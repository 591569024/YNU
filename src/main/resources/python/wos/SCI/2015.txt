This route contains two steps, photo-synthesis of silver nanoclusters (NCs) with papain under UV irradiation, and catalytic growth of silver nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of ascorbic acid. The produced silver NCs at the first step is excellent catalyzer that could quickly catalyze the growth of silver NPs by Ag+ and ascorbic acid in 1 min at room temperature. And thus, in the second step, the color of the mixture changed from colorless to yellow and a strong absorption band near 420 nm could be found in their absorption spectra owing to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of produced silver NPs. We found that the absorbance changes at 420 nm have a good relationship with ascorbic acid concentration, and established a spectrophotometric method for the sensing of ascorbic acid in the range from 0.25 to 50.0 mu M, with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 79.2 nM. We also established a colorimetric assay of ascorbic acid by analyzing the yellow value (Y%) of the silver NPs photographs using cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY) color mode. The lowest detection concentration of ascorbic acid for calorimetric assay by the photographs could be estimated to similar to 1 mu M. Moreover, the method for ascorbic acid detection also has high selectivity. Potential interferes, such as glucose, dopamine, uric acid and cysteine will not affect the detection of ascorbic acid.

J	Huang, BL; Li, YD				Huang, Bo-Lin; Li, Yun-De			Kaon-nucleon scattering to one-loop order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTIAL-WAVE ANALYSIS; PARTICLE EFFECTIVE THEORIES; PI-N-SCATTERING; K-P; INTEGRALS; DYNAMICS; LENGTHS; ENERGY; KBARN	We calculate the T matrices of kaon-nucleon (KN) and antikaon-nucleon ((K) over barN) scattering to one-loop order in SU(3) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB chi PT). The low-energy constants (LECs) and their combinations are then determined by fitting the phase shifts of KN scattering and the corresponding data. This leads to a good description of the phase shifts below 200 MeV kaon laboratory momentum. We obtain the LEC uncertainties through statistical regression analysis and successfully reduce one parameter. We also determine the LECs through the use of scattering lengths in order to check the consistency of the HB chi PT framework for different observables and obtain a consistent result. By using these LECs, we predict the (K) over barN elastic scattering phase shifts and obtain reasonable results. The scattering lengths are also predicted, which turn out to be in good agreement with the empirical values except for the isospin-0 (K) over barN scattering length that is strongly affected by the Lambda(1405) resonance. As most calculations in the chiral perturbation theory, the convergence issue is discussed in detail. Our calculations provide a possibility to investigate the baryon-baryon interaction in HB chi PT.

J	Zhou, LH; Lu, KV; Yang, PZ; Wang, LZ; Kong, B				Zhou, Lihua; Lu, Kevin; Yang, Peizhong; Wang, Lizheng; Kong, Bing			An approach for overlapping and hierarchical community detection in social networks based on coalition formation game theory	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social network; Community detection; Coalition formation game theory	INFORMATION-FLOW	With greater availability of data and increasing interaction activities taking place on social media, detecting overlapping and hierarchical communities has become an important issue and one that is essential to social media analysis. In this paper, we propose a coalition formation game theory-based approach to identify overlapping and hierarchical communities. We model community detection as a coalition formation game in which individuals in a social network are modelled as rational players aiming to improve the group's utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions, and those coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation is beneficial to the utilities of the merged coalitions, thus overlapping and hierarchical communities can be revealed simultaneously. The utility function of each coalition is defined as the combination of a gain function and a cost function. The gain function measures the degree of interactions amongst the players inside a coalition, while the cost function instead represents the degree of the interactions between the players of the coalition and the rest of the network. As game theory provides a formal analytical framework with a set of mathematical tools to study the complex interactions among rational players, applying game theory for detecting communities helps to identify communities more rationally. Some desirable properties of the utility function, such as the non-resolution limit and the non-scaling behavior, have been examined theoretically. To solve the issue of pre-setting the number and size for communities and to improve the efficiency of the detection process, we have developed a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on synthetic and real networks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which can be applied for real world applications.

Unlocking the early fossil record of the arthropod central nervous system	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Cambrian; brains; Chengjiang; Burgess Shale; Arthropoda	BURGESS SHALE; OPTIC LOBES; PRESERVATION; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; DECAY; ONYCHOPHORA; CRUSTACEAN; PHYLOGENY; VIEW	Extant panarthropods (euarthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades) are hall-marked by stunning morphological and taxonomic diversity, but their central nervous systems (CNS) are relatively conserved. The timing of divergences of the ground pattern CNS organization of the major panarthropod clades has been poorly constrained because of a scarcity of data from their early fossil record. Although the CNS has been documented in three-dimensional detail in insects from Cenozoic ambers, it is widely assumed that these tissues are too prone to decay to withstand other styles of fossilization or geologically older preservation. However, Cambrian Burgess Shale-type compressions have emerged as sources of fossilized brains and nerve cords. CNS in these Cambrian fossils are preserved as carbon films or as iron oxides/hydroxides after pyrite in association with carbon. Experiments with carcasses compacted in fine-grained sediment depict preservation of neural tissue for a more prolonged temporal window than anticipated by decay experiments in other media. CNS and compound eye characters in exceptionally preserved Cambrian fossils predict divergences of the mandibulate and chelicerate ground patterns by Cambrian Stage 3 (ca 518 Ma), a dating that is compatible with molecular estimates for these splits.

J	Yang, Y; Liu, XC				Yang, Yun; Liu, Xingchen			A robust semi-supervised learning approach via mixture of label information	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Clustering; Classification		Due to the fact that limited amounts of labeled data are normally available in real-world, semi supervised learning has become a popular option, where we expect to use unlabeled data information to improve the learning performance. However, how to use such unlabeled information to make the predicted labels more reliable remains to be a key for any successful learning. In this paper, we propose a semi supervised learning framework via combination of semi-supervised clustering and semi-supervised classification. In our approach, the predicted labels are selected by both the constrained k-means and safe semi-supervised SVM (S4VMs) to improve the reliability of the predicted labels. Extensive evaluations on collection of benchmarks and real-world action recognition datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, an analytical model for the surface plasmon modes supported by this graphene geometry is presented and verified by finite element method simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a large tunability of the modes behavior by varying the Fermi level of the graphene, the coupling distance between the two sheets and the radius of the cylinder. Finally, a molecular sensing scheme based on the CGPW is proposed. Broadband spectroscopy of ethanol and toluene thin layers is realized by recording the changes in spectral intensity of the propagating mode. Due to the broadband localization capability of graphene plasmon mode which leads to a strong light-matter interaction in the midinfrared and terahertz regime, the proposed sensing scheme may provide an effective way for detecting nanometric-size molecules.

Properties of the obtained complexes, as well as the interactions between each component, were systematically investigated in both solution and solid states by means of ESI-MS, NMR, FTIR, XRD, DSC, SEM etc. All characterization information demonstrated that FIT/CDs inclusion complexes were formed, and exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from FIT. A complex with 1: 1 stoichiometry of FIT and CDs was confirmed with Job's method. Meanwhile, as supported by molecular modeling calculations, we suggested that phenyl group (C ring) of FIT molecule was included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of FIT/CDs was successfully improved from 2.8 mg/mL (in ethanol aqueous solution) to 4.5 mg/mL (FIT/beta-CD complex) and 7.8 mg/mL (FIT/gamma-CD complex), and higher thermal stability results were shown by thermal analysis for those complexes. Notably, the inclusion complexes displayed almost two times higher cytotoxicity compared to free FIT against Hela and MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that FIT/CDs complexes could be potentially useful in food industry and healthcare area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Upon the presence of tadalafil to the performed CX6-Gra-RhB complex, the RhB molecules are displaced by tadalafil, leading to a "switch-on" fluorescence signal. The observed fluorescence signal can be used for quantitative detection of tadalafil ranging from 1.00 to 50.00 mu M with a detection limit of 0.32 mu M (S/N = 3). The inclusion complex of tadalafil and CX6 was studied by molecular docking and the results indicated that a 1:1 host-guest stoichiometry had the lowest Delta G value of -7.18 kcal/mol. The docking studies demonstrated that the main forces including pi-pi interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions should be responsible for the formation of this inclusion compound. The mechanism of the competitive host-guest interaction was clarified. The binding constant (K) of the tadalafil/CX6 complex was more than 5 times greater than that of RhB/CX6.

The species is native to southwest China and southeast Asia, especially the Himalayan region, showing good adaptability, and tolerance to drought. To understand the water stress coping mechanisms of R. delavayi, we analyzed the plant's photosynthetic performance during water stress and recovery. In particular, we looked at the regulation of stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)), and maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax). After 4 days of water stress treatment, the net CO2 assimilation rate (AN) declined slightly while g(s) and g(m) were not affected and stomatal limitation (S-L) was therefore negligible. At this stage mesophyll conductance limitation (MCL) and biochemical limitation (B-L) constituted the main limitation factors. After 8 days of water stress treatment, A(N), g(s), and gm had decreased notably. At this stage S-L increased markedly and MCL even more so, while B-L remained relatively constant. After re-watering, the recovery of A(N), g(s), and g(m) was rapid, although remaining below the levels of the control plants, while V-cmax fully regained control levels after 3 days of re-watering. MCL remained the main limitation factor irrespective of the degree of photosynthetic recovery. In conclusion, in our experiment MCL was the main photosynthetic limitation factor of R. delavayi under water stress and during the recovery phase, with the regulation of g(m) probably being the result of interactions between the environment and leaf anatomical features.

Combing previous studies, the spore morphology of nearly all documented Selaginella species from China were reviewed. Based on the morphological characteristics in megaspores and/or microspores, we divided the spores of Chinese species into 15 types and three types are further divided into various subtypes. Each type and subtype are described in detail and a key to the types and subtypes of spores is given. For the first time, the systematic significance of microspores of Selaginella are discussed, and the results indicate that microspores of Selaginella are significant in the systematics of Selaginella. Some important morphological characteristics in spores (e.g., color, micro-sculpture, size, etc.), often been neglected in previous studies, are introduced. Some spore-morphological synapomorphies of the clades and subclades, identified by recent molecular work (Zhou et al. 2015a), are well established. Using the spore morphology, the delimitation of some taxonomically difficult species in Selaginella is assessed.

Both scenarios, however, seem problematic to understand cooperative behavior, because they can raise the second-order free-rider problem and many organisms are not able to discriminate less cooperating individuals. Even though they have been proved to increase cooperation, there has been a debate about which one being more effective. To address this issue, we resort to the N-player evolutionary snowdrift game (NESG), where a collective punishment/reward mechanism is added by allowing some players to display punishment/reward towards all remaining players. By means of numerous simulations and analyses, we find that collective punishment is more effective in promoting cooperation for a relatively high initial frequency of cooperation or for a relatively small group. When the intensity of punishment exceeds a certain threshold, a stable state of full cooperation emerges for both small and large groups. In contrast, such state does not appear for large groups playing a NESG with reward mechanism. In the case of mutualistic interactions, finally, our results show the new payoff with collective punishment/reward can lead to the coexistence of cooperators and defectors when discrimination between these two is not possible.

Thus, it is desirable to have an arsenal of such compounds that inhibit HIV-1 infection by various mechanisms. Until now, only a few small-molecule compounds that inhibit nuclear entry of viral DNA have been documented. Results: We identified a novel, small-molecule compound, SJP-L-5, that inhibits HIV-1 infection. SJP-L-5 is a nitrogen-containing, biphenyl compound whose synthesis was based on the dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan gomisin M2, an anti-HIV bioactive compound isolated from Schisandra micrantha A. C. Smith. SJP-L-5 displayed relatively low cytotoxicity (50 % cytoxicity concentrations were greater than 200 mu g/ml) and high antiviral activity against a variety of HIV strains (50 % effective concentrations (EC50)) of HIV-1 laboratory-adapted strains ranged from 0.16-0.97 mu g/ml; EC(50)s of primary isolates ranged from 1.96-5.33 mu g/ml). Analyses of the viral DNA synthesis indicated that SJP-L-5 specifically blocks the entry of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex (PIC) into the nucleus. Further results implicated that SJP-L-5 inhibits the disassembly of HIV-1 particulate capsid in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Conclusions: SJP-L-5 is a novel small-molecule compound that inhibits HIV-1 nuclear entry by blocking the disassembly of the viral core.

However, the relationship between high and low temperature adaptations remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we collected the available predicted whole proteome sequences of species with different optimal growth temperatures, and analyzed amino acid variations and substitutional asymmetry in pairs of homologous proteins from related species. We found that changes in amino acid composition associated with low temperature adaptation did not exhibit a coherent opposite trend when compared with changes in amino acid composition associated with high temperature adaptation. This result indicates that during their evolutionary histories the proteome-scale evolutionary patterns associated with prokaryotes exposed to low temperature environments were distinct from the proteome-scale evolutionary patterns associated with prokaryotes exposed to high temperature environments in terms of changes in amino acid composition of the proteins.

At high energies, the value of saturation momentum becomes larger than the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) confinement scale Lambda(QCD), which implies that alpha(s) (Q(s)) << 1. Using the relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the production rate for the light vector mesons produced by gluon -gluon fusion in the k(T)-factorization approach. The numerical results indicate that the light vector mesons from the color glass condensate become prominent in p-p, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.

There is limited recreation ecology research on the impact of trails in China, especially on Mount Jade Dragon, where it is characterized as a global biodiversity hotspot with high scenic value. Impacts of trails on vegetation, soil and their interaction were assessed for the subalpine meadow area of Mount Jade Dragon. The aims of this research were: (i) to assess trail effects on vegetation, soil and their interaction, and (ii) to evaluate the effects of the trail type and usage level on trail impacts. Vegetation and soil properties were measured at control and trailside sites along formal and informal trails of different usage levels. A three-way analysis of variance was performed to determine the effects of site location, trail type and usage level. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to visualize species composition along trails and to ordinate species with respect to the soil variables. A multiple linear regression model was used to examine relationships between soil variables and vegetation cover. The results showed that trails led to vegetation cover, height and species richness reduction as well as soil organic matter and moisture content loss. Trails also affected soil-vegetation relationships. Soil organic matter and soil moisture content played an important role in determining vegetation along trails at low-usage sites. The soil-vegetation relationships were weakened at high-usage sites. Compared with informal trails, formal trails had a protective effect on vegetation cover, especially at high-usage sites. These results suggest that park managers should limit the spread of informal trails at high-usage sites, upgrade existing informal trails, and rehabilitate damaged areas. Further, greater recognition should be given to research on soil protection and soil-vegetation relationships.

Klebsiella pneumoniae causes serious infections and healthcare burdens in humans. We have previously reported that the deficiency of autophagy-related gene (Atg) 7 in macrophages (murine alveolar macrophage cell line [MH-S]) induced irregular host immunity against K. pneumoniae and worsened pathologic effects in the lung. In the current study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Atg7 influenced K. pneumoniae-induced inflammatory responses. Methods. Expression levels of Atg7, ubiquitin (Ub), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a and phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha (p-I kappa B alpha) were determined with immunoblotting. Ubiquitylation of p-I kappa B alpha was determined with immunoprecipitation. Results. We noted an interaction between Atg7 and p-I kappa B alpha, which was decreased in MH-S after K. pneumoniae infection, whereas the interaction between Ub and p-I.Ba was increased. Knock-down of Atg7 with small interfering RNA increased p-I.Ba ubiquitylation, promoted nuclear factor kappa B translocation into the nucleus, and increased the production of TNF-alpha. Moreover, knock-down of Ub with lentivirus-short hairpin RNA Ub particles decreased binding of p-I kappa B alpha to Ub and inhibited TNF-a expression in the primary alveolar macrophages and lung tissue of atg7-knockout mice on K. pneumoniae infection. Conclusions. Loss of Atg7 switched binding of p-I.Ba from Atg7 to Ub, resulting in increased ubiquitylation of p-I.Ba and intensified inflammatory responses against K. pneumoniae. Our findings not only reveal a regulatory role of Atg7 in ubiquitylation of p-I.Ba but also indicate potential therapeutic targets for K. pneumoniae control.

J	Yan, DH; Zhang, L; Zhang, SN				Yan, Dahai; Zhang, Li; Zhang, Shuang-Nan			Parameter constraints in a near-equipartition model with multifrequency NuSTAR, Swift, and Fermi-LAT data from 3C 279	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; galaxies: jets; gamma-rays: galaxies	SPECTRUM RADIO QUASARS; RAY BRIGHT BLAZARS; ENERGY GAMMA-RADIATION; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LOG-PARABOLIC SPECTRA; BL LACERTAE OBJECTS; MRK 421; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS; STOCHASTIC ACCELERATION	Precise spectra of 3C 279 in the 0.5-70 keV range, obtained during two epochs of Swift and NuSTAR observations, are analysed using a near-equipartition model. We apply a one-zone leptonic model with a three-parameter log-parabola electron energy distribution to fit the Swift and NuSTAR X-ray data, as well as simultaneous optical and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data. The Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is used to search the high-dimensional parameter space and evaluate the uncertainties on model parameters. We show that the two spectra can be successfully fitted in near-equipartition conditions, defined by the ratio of the energy density of relativistic electrons to magnetic field zeta e being close to unity. In both spectra, the observed X-rays are dominated by synchrotron self-Compton photons, and the observed gamma-rays are dominated by Compton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty torus. Model parameters are well constrained. From the low state to the high state, both the curvature of the log-parabola width parameter and the synchrotron peak frequency significantly increase. The derived magnetic fields in the two states are nearly identical (similar to 1G), but the Doppler factor in the high state is larger than that in the low state (similar to 28 versus similar to 18). We derive that the gamma-ray emission site takes place outside the broad-line region, at similar to 0.1 pc from the black hole, but within the dusty torus. Implications for 3C 279 as a source of high-energy cosmic rays are discussed.

The MO conductivity was calculated using the Kubo formula. Results show that in contrast to parabolically confined quantum wires realized from low-dimensional semiconductor systems, the features of MO absorption and the retard effect of the MO response by cylindrical metallic nanowires depend sensitively on the polarization of the radiation field due to corresponding selection rules. The frequencies of resonant absorption induced by inter-subband MO transition channels are within the terahertz (THz) bandwidth and can be tuned effectively by adjusting the radius of the nanowire and/or varying the strength of the magnetic field. This study is pertinent to the potential application of metallic nanowires as frequency-tunable THz optoelectronic devices.

Cylindrical metallic nanowire (NW) structures realized from the state-of-the-art nanotechnology, were used to demonstrate Ni NW embedded in Al2O3 template. The phonon modes were examined by solving the wave equations with corresponding boundary conditions. We find that the quantized phonon energy and the energy spacing between different phonon states increase with decreasing of NW radius. The allowed phonon modes lie below the straight line of q(z)V(Al2O3) in the dispersion relation, and such a feature does not vary significantly with altering of NW radius. This study will be pertinent to the applications of metallic NW systems as high-frequency ultrasonic devices.

The structures were proposed on the basis of metallic NWAs realized from the state-of-the-art nanotechnology. The band gaps with GHz frequency can be achieved. We find that, in AT direction, Ni arrays are more easily to obtain the wider z mode band gaps. In Gamma M direction, Cu arrays are more easily to motivate xy mode band gaps and larger band gaps at high frequency area. In some filling fraction, the band gap frequencies with z mode and xy mode can be obtained. Structurally, the two dimensional square lattice NWAs are more advantageous to produce hypersonic band gaps.

Unlike the inheritance of nuclear genes, that of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not follow Mendelian Laws. In the great majority of sexual plants and animals, mtDNA is uniparentally inherited from the maternal parent. However, there is a diversity of mtDNA inheritance patterns in basidiomycete fungi. In this commemorative review of mtDNA inheritance in basidiomycetes, we first summarize Dr. Lorna Casselton's pioneering contributions to the subject using Coprinopsis cinerea as a model organism. Using her findings as a benchmark, we then describe other mtDNA inheritance patterns found in basidiomycete fungi, both in laboratory crosses and in natural populations. We review recent research on the genes, molecular mechanisms, and environmental factors that impact mtDNA inheritance in basidiomycete fungi. The patterns and mechanisms of mitochondrial inheritance are compared between unicellular and filamentous basidiomycetes, and among basidiomycetes, ascomycetes and representatives from other groups of eukaryotes. Our analyses suggest that basidiomycetes can be excellent models for understanding the molecular, cellular, and evolutionary mechanisms governing mtDNA inheritance in eukaryotes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the polymorphisms localized in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, a main component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in inducing the susceptibility to essential hypertension (EH) among isolated populations (Yi and Hani minorities) with low prevalence rate from the remote region of Yunnan in China. Methods: A case-control association study was performed, and all subjects were genotyped for the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms localized in the AGT region by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: Three polymorphisms, i.e. rs5046, rs5049, and rs2478544, were significantly associated with EH among the Hani minority. The associations, found in the Yi minority, did not reach a conclusive level of statistical significance. The polymorphisms of rs2478544 and rs5046 caused the transformations of exonic splicing enhancer sites and transcription factor binding sites, respectively, in the bioinformatic analyses. The haplotype-rs5046T, rs5049A, rs11568020G, rs3789679C, rs2478544C was susceptible for EH among the Hani minority. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the AGT polymorphisms have played a vital role in determining an individual's susceptibility to EH among the isolated population, which would be helpful for EH management in the remote mountainous region of Yunnan in China.

Several polymorphisms within the PRNP are known to be associated with influencing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) susceptibility in cattle, namely two insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms (a 23-bp indel in the putative promoter and a 12-bp indel in intron 1), the number of octapeptide repeats (octarepeats) present in coding sequence (CDS) and amino acid polymorphisms. The domestic buffaloes, Bubalus bubalis, are a ruminant involved in various aspects of agriculture. It is of interest to ask whether the PRNP polymorphisms differ between cattle and buffalo. In this study, we analyzed the previously reported polymorphisms associated with BSE susceptibility in Chinese buffalo breeds, and compared these polymorphisms in cattle with BSE, healthy cattle and buffalo by pooling data from the literature. Our analysis revealed three significant findings in buffalo: 1) extraordinarily low deletion allele frequencies of the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms; 2) significantly low allelic frequencies of six octarepeats in CDS and 3) the presence of S4R, A16V, P54S, G108S, V123M, S154N and F257L substitutions in buffalo CDSs. Sequence alignments comparing the buffalo coding sequence to other species were analyzed using the McDonald-Kreitman test to reveal five groups (Bison bonasus, Bos indicus, Bos gaurus, Boselaphus tragocamelus, Syncerus caffer caffer) with significantly divergent non-synonymous substitutions from buffalo, suggesting potential divergence of buffalo PRNP and others. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of PRNP polymorphisms associated with BSE susceptibility in Chinese buffalo. Our findings have provided evidence that buffaloes have a unique genetic background in the PRNP gene in comparison with cattle. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The existing methods for ABTS center dot+ radical-scavenging activity assays are diverse in pre-diluting solvents and reaction time, which lead to errors in the TAC estimations. To develop an effective and universal method for estimating the ABTS center dot+ capacity accurately and reasonably, five pre-dilution solvents [methanol, ethanol, phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 200 mM, pH = 7.4), PBS buffer (Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4-NaC1, 200 mM, pH = 7.4), and distilled water] and different reaction times were investigated in ABTS center dot+ assays of five typical antioxidants. The results showed that the solvent effects were very significant. When using different pre-diluting solvents, different detection wavelengths should be selected. ABTS center dot+ assay could be measured within 2-10 min to obtain a rough result, which was mostly 6 min in the literature. However, full and accurate evaluation of antioxidant reactivity rather than capacity requires recording ABTS center dot+ loss continuously during the whole reaction period. The present study makes a recommendation for estimating the ABTS-F capacity accurately and reasonably.

The dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonia in thermal medium are also discussed for CG, FG and HTL cases. It is shown that the thermal widths, derived from the HTL approximation and used in many research studies, cause some errors in the practical calculations at the temperature range accessible in the present experiment, and the problem of gauge dependence cannot be avoided when the complete self energy is used in the derivation of potential.

The PMC shielding is artificially built by a metal lid of pins, based on the gap waveguide (GW) technology. As a foundation, the effects of via hole in a unit cell are studied first considering its diameter, substrate thickness, pin size, pin height, as well as relative position between the via hole and the pin. The via adjacent space and pin rows are also considered for a general grounded coplanar waveguide along with ground vias. The effectiveness of package for such a transmission line containing metalized via holes is then verified experimentally. It is shown that the measured performance agrees well with the simulation. This paper presents a guideline for the GW-based PMC packaging technology.

It is determined that the hailstorms were found to present dominant negative CG lightning flashes at any given stage. One specific hailstorm occurring on July 16, 2006, is analyzed in detail by using the data from a CG lightning location network and Doppler radar. This severe hailstorm, which exhibited strong vertical development with cloud tops reaching 15.9 km, produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifespan of 3 h and 12 min. The total CG lightning within the hailstorm showed high levels of activity with flash rates of up to 79 fl/5 min. The analysis of the storm cell's lifecycle shows similar trends between the CG lightning flash rates and radar-derived parameters. Cloud-to-ground flashes tended to initiate within the cloud region with reflectivity of more than 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. A distinct increase in CG flash rate is shown during the rapid development stages of hailstorms. The CG lightning jump pattern appears to be an effective tool for short-term forecasting of possible occurrences of severe weather. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ThCel5A was most similar (77% identity) to a GH5 endoglucanase from Thermobifida fusca YX, followed by cellulases from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111, Nocardiopsis alba ATCC BAA-2165, and Kribbella flavida DSM 17836. The deduced amino acid sequence of ThCel5A, which consisted of 462 amino acid residues, encompassed a family 2 cellulose-binding module and a GH5 catalytic domain. Notably, ThCel5A hydrolysed soluble as well as insoluble cellulose substrates. The enzymatic hydrolysis assay showed that the activity of recombinant ThCel5A was optimized at pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C. Moreover, it retained hydrolytic activity in the presence of various metal ions and >90% activity within the range of pH 8.0-9.0 after 30 min at 50 degrees C. These results suggested that this enzyme has considerable potential in industrial applications. (c) 2015, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

Novel hydrophobic CaCO3 was then prepared by a urethane formation reaction between methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and the OH groups both in the PVC-OH chains and on the surface of pristine CaCO3 particles. The effect of the PVC-OH content on the grafting ratio of treated CaCO3 particles was extensively investigated. Combining the result of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with that of water contact angle, it can be concluded that the hydrophobicity of CaCO3 had been efficiently improved by the PVC-OH segments grafted on the surface of CaCO3 particles.

However, little is known concerning the level of contamination, spatial distribution and environmental controls of the heavy metals in the soils of the DHV. Heavy metal concentrations in agricultural soils in a typical DHV catchment were investigated. Soil samples from both the topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) were collected at sixty-two sites, and the soil physical and chemical properties of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter contents; soil pH; bulk density; and the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb were determined. Topographic factors of slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, and topographic wetness index at each site were calculated using DEM. Kriging and canonical correspondence analyses were used to assess the spatial distribution of and environmental controls on heavy metals. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb in the DHV were higher than most of the reported values for agricultural soils worldwide and that the DHV may constitute a potential source of heavy metal pollution in the Red River. Considering each heavy metal individually, the vertical distribution in the topsoil and subsoil was similar at all of the sampling sites. High concentrations of Cr, Ni, Zn and Pb were observed at low elevations and low slope areas, and the spatial distribution pattern of Cu was contrary to that of Cr, Ni, Zn and Pb. The concentrations of heavy metals in the topsoil were controlled by both soil and topographical factors, while in the subsoil, they were primarily controlled by soil-related factors. It is concluded that high background concentrations, uncontrolled use of chemical fertilizers, and mining are the sources responsible for heavy metal contamination in the DHV region.

Species turnover (beta-diversity) in ectomycorrhizal fungi linked to NH4+ uptake capacity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						ammonium; community assembly; fungal niche; nitrogen; species diversity	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENTS; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; RHIZOPOGON ROSEOLUS; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; EXPLORATION TYPES; ORGANIC NITROGEN; NUTRIENT REGIMES; GLOBAL PATTERNS	Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal communities may be shaped by both deterministic and stochastic processes, potentially influencing ecosystem development and function. We evaluated community assembly processes for EcM fungi of Pseudotsuga menziesii among 12 sites up to 400 km apart in southwest British Columbia (Canada) by investigating species turnover (beta-diversity) in relation to soil nitrogen (N) availability and physical distance. We then examined functional traits for an N-related niche by quantifying net fluxes of NH4+, NO3 and protons on excised root tips from three contrasting sites using a microelectrode ion flux measurement system. EcM fungal communities were well aligned with soil N availability and pH, with no effect of site proximity (distance-decay curve) on species assemblages. Species turnover was significant (beta(1/2) = 1.48) along soil N gradients, with many more Tomentella species on high N than low N soils, in contrast to Cortinarius species. Ammonium uptake was greatest in the spring on the medium and rich sites and averaged over 190 nmol/m(2)/s for Tomentella species. The lowest uptake rates of NH4+ were by nonmycorrhizal roots of axenically grown seedlings (10 nmol/m(2)/s), followed by Cortinarius species (60 nmol/m(2)/s). EcM roots from all sites displayed only marginal uptake of nitrate (8.3 nmol/m(2)/s). These results suggest NH4+ uptake capacity is an important functional trait influencing the assembly of EcM fungal communities. The diversity of EcM fungal species across the region arguably provides critical belowground adaptations to organic and inorganic N supply that are integral to temperate rainforest ecology.

However, this species lacks efficient vectors for genetic manipulation. In this study, the circular plasmid pCM32 was newly isolated from Saccharopolyspora endophytica YIM 61095. The complete nucleotide sequence of pCM32 consists of 14,611 bp and is predicted to encode 17 open reading frames (ORFs). Interestingly, a putative int gene in pCM32 was predicted by homologous alignment to encode an integrase belonging to the tyrosine family of integrases/recombinases. Plasmid pCM238 containing this int locus derived from pCM32 could be transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli into Sa. spinosa at a high frequency. Integration of pCM238 in the host chromosome was demonstrated as site-specific recombination (at the tRNA (Ser) gene) via a 56-bp core sequence within the attP/attB sites. Plasmid pCM265, a shuttle vector containing the int and attP sequences of pCM32, was constructed to introduce foreign genes into Sa. spinosa. The production of spinosad approximately doubled in Sa. spinosa NRRL18395 after introducing pCM265-derived plasmids carrying the genes for phosphofructokinase (PFK) or anthranilate synthase. These results indicate that plasmid pCM32 is an actinomycete integrative and conjugative element (AICE) and that its derived integrative vectors are useful for efficiently introducing foreign DNA into Sa. spinosa.

As the basis of realistic applications centered on probabilistic inferences, learning a BN from data is a critical subject of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data paradigms. Currently, it is necessary to extend the classical methods for learning BNs with respect to data-intensive computing or in cloud environments. In this paper, we propose a parallel and incremental approach for data-intensive learning of BNs from massive, distributed, and dynamically changing data by extending the classical scoring and search algorithm and using MapReduce. First, we adopt the minimum description length as the scoring metric and give the two-pass MapReduce-based algorithms for computing the required marginal probabilities and scoring the candidate graphical model from sample data. Then, we give the corresponding strategy for extending the classical hill-climbing algorithm to obtain the optimal structure, as well as that for storing a BN by <key, value> pairs. Further, in view of the dynamic characteristics of the changing data, we give the concept of influence degree to measure the coincidence of the current BN with new data, and then propose the corresponding two-pass MapReduce-based algorithms for BNs incremental learning. Experimental results show the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our methods.

It tolerates increased environmental concentrations of sodium, chloride and potassium partly by raising ion and urea levels in its blood plasma. The molecular mechanism of the adaptation remains rarely documented. Herein, we analyze transcriptomes of the crab-eating frog and its closely related saline-intolerant species, F. limnocharis, to explore the molecular basis of adaptations to such extreme environmental conditions. Analyses reveal the potential genetic mechanism underlying the adaptation to salinity for the crab-eating frog. Genes in categories associated with ion transport appear to have evolved rapidly in F. cancrivora. Both positively selected and differentially expressed genes exhibit enrichment in the GO category regulation of renal sodium excretion. In this category, the positively selected sites of ANPEP and AVPR2 encode CD13 and V2 receptors, respectively; they fall precisely on conserved domains. More differentially expressed rapidly evolved genes occur in the kidney of F. cancrivora than in F. limnocharis. Four genes involved in the regulation of body fluid levels show signs of positive selection and increased expression. Significant up-regulation occurs in several genes of F. cancrivora associated with renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption pathways, which relate to osmotic regulation.

In this paper, we focus on the representation and processing of lineages over uncertain data, where we adopt Bayesian network (BN), one of the popular and important probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), as the framework of uncertainty representation and inferences. Starting from the lineage expressed as Boolean formulae for SPJ (Selection-Projection-Join) queries over uncertain data, we propose a method to transform the lineage expression into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) equivalently. Specifically, we discuss the corresponding probabilistic semantics and properties to guarantee that the graphical model can support effective probabilistic inferences in lineage processing theoretically. Then, we propose the function-based method to compute the conditional probability table (CPT) for each node in the DAG. The BN for representing lineage expressions over uncertain data, called lineage BN and abbreviated as LBN, can be constructed while generally suitable for both safe and unsafe query plans. Therefore, we give the variable-elimination-based algorithm for LBN's exact inferences to obtain the probabilities of query results, called LBN-based query processing. Then, we focus on obtaining the probabilities of inputs or intermediate tuples conditioned on query results, called LBN-based inference query processing, and give the Gibbs-sampling-based algorithm for LBN's approximate inferences. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The major isoprenoid quinones were MK-6(H-2) and MK-7(H-2). The polar lipids of strain YIM 13062(T) consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), one unidentified phospholipid (PL), one unidentified aminophospholipid (APL), two unidentified aminolipids (AL) and four unidentified lipids (L). Major fatty acids of the novel isolate were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-14:0 and C-18:1 2OH. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain YIM 13062(T) was 68.0 mol%. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain YIM 13062(T) and K. polaris NBRC 103063(T), K. rosea NBRC 3768(T), K. carniphila JCM 14118(T) were 53.2, 48.8 and 42.6 %, respectively. On the basis of genotypic and phenotypic data, it is apparent that strain YIM 13062(T) represents a novel species of the genus Kocuria, for which the name Kocuria subflava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 13062(T) (=CGMCC 4.7252(T)=KCTC 39547(T)).

Strain VSW210(T) was found to grow optimally at 30 A degrees C, at pH 7 and in the presence of 2-6 % (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain VSW210(T) clusters with the type strain Citreicella marina CK-I3-6(T) (sequence similarity value of 99.6 %), but DNA-DNA hybridization showed DNA-DNA relatedness between the strain VSW210(T) and C. marina CK-I3-6(T) to be 55.8 +/- A 3.2 %. The DNA G+C content of strain VSW210(T) was determined to be 67.4 mol%. The cellular fatty acid profiles of strain VSW210(T) was found to contain C-18:1 omega 7c (80.1 %) and C-16:0 (9.2 %). The major polar lipids in strain VSW210(T) were identified as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified phospholipid. Strain VSW210(T) was found to be able to oxidize soluble Mn(II) to insoluble MnO2, which was confirmed with LBB staining. Differential phenotypic properties and genetic uniqueness revealed that this strain VSW210(T) is distinguishable from other species of the genus Citreicella. On the basis of the data presented, strain VSW210(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Citreicella, for which the name Citreicella manganoxidans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is VSW210(T) (=KCTC 32497(T) = MCC 2286(T)).

NOV.; CHINA; HYBRIDIZATION; SEQUENCES; MEMBER; TREES; WELLS; SOIL	Two novel actinobacteria, designated strains YIM 101617(T) and YIM 101632(T), were isolated from Lama pacos (alpaca) and Viverra zibetha (civet) faeces in Yunnan Wild Animal Park in Yunnan province, southwestern China. Both strains should be placed in genus Enteractinococcus based on phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain YIM 101617(T) exhibits high similarity to Enteractinococcus fodinae DSM 22966(T) (97.70 %) and Enteractinococcus coprophilus YIM 100590(T) (97.45 %), whilst YIM 101632(T) exhibits high similarity to Enteractinococcus coprophilus YIM 100590(T) (97.25 %), and the similarity between YIM 101617(T) and YIM 101632(T) is 95.90 %. However, DNA-DNA hybridization values of the two strains with the type strains in the genus Enteractinococcus were low (< 70 %). Most morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the two strains were found to be similar to those of species in the genus Enteractinococcus but also some differences were observed. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 101617(T) and YIM 101632(T) were determined to be 55.9 and 56.4 mol%, respectively. Based on these data, the two strains are concluded to represent two different novel species in the genus Enteractinococcus. The names Enteractinococcus lamae sp. nov.

With the introduction of the compressive sensing theory, researchers are provided with a new and effective way of real-time object tracking. In this study, an enhanced fast compressive tracking based on an adaptive measurement matrix is presented, which the authors have named adaptive fast compressive tracking' (AFCT). The sparsity of the matrix and the number of columns are adaptively determined according to the dimension of the Haar-like feature. This measurement matrix is fixed once it has been calculated when selecting a tracked rectangle region in the first frame. Unlike most of the existing compressive trackers, the proposed method adopts a different adaptive measurement matrix for a different targeting object. Compared with the fast compressive tracking (FCT), each measurement element contains more information for the original signal. As a result, stable object tracking is achieved by using fewer measurement elements. The proposed AFCT method can run in real time and outperforms FCT on many challenging video sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

At present, there are few published studies available on environmentally friendly management of this pest, compared with those on the use of chemical pesticides. The few studies that are available have suggested that the phototactic response of this beetle could be exploited in its management. We studied the phototactic behavior of H. vigintioctomaculata in response to 17 wavelengths of monochromatic lights and 10 illumination intensities of three of these wavelengths. The beetles showed a positively phototactic response to most wavelengths from 340 to 689 nm, except for the blue wavelength (492 nm). In addition, the beetles exhibited varying levels of sensitivity to illumination intensities from 10 to 190 lux under ultraviolet (UV) (340 nm), red (649 nm), green (510 nm), and white light. The general overall pattern of phototactic response rate, from short to long wavelengths, was a U-shaped curve. Thus, the beetles were most sensitive to UV light and red light. The response of the beetles to illumination intensity was correlated with light wavelength; therefore, the phototactic response rate (PRR) to UV light was always higher compared with the PRRs to other light. Our results highlight the positive phototactic behavior of H. vigintioctomaculata to different light wavelengths and illumination intensities. Such behavior could be exploited for noninvasive management using colored lights to control this important agricultural pest.

Crystallographic analysis indicates that all the complexes contain homochiral left- and/or right-handed helical chains, which are constructed by PIA fragments and Cd(II) ions. Meanwhile, in these complexes nitrogen heterocycle auxiliary ligands play an important role in structural diversity. Some physical characteristics, such as thermal stabilities, solid-state circular dichroism, and photoluminescent properties, are also investigated. Our results highlight an effective method to apply proline ligands to construct interesting HHMOFs.

The BuOH fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity with the highest phenolic content. A phytochemical investigation of this fraction led to the isolation of three tannins, 2,3-hexahydroxydiphenoylglucose (1), pedunculagin (2) and 2,3,4,6-tetragalloylglucose (3). Pedunculagin showed high content and powerful activity, which implied that this compound plays an important role in the antioxidant activity of the walnut pellicle.

It was found that the obtained products exhibit 3D hierarchical porous structure regardless the Pt-loaded amounts due to the release of gases and the loosely packed NiO particles. Compared with the pristine NiO, the presence of Pt nanoparticles somehow affected the growth behavior of NiO around and embedded on these relatively big NiO nanoparticles in different size. The Ptfunctionalized NiO based gas sensor showed lower operating temperature and substantially enhanced responses to formaldehyde, especially 1% Pt-loaded NiO. The 1% Pt-loaded NiO based gas sensor displayed a response value of 9.90 to 2000 ppm formaldehyde at 200 degrees C, whereas the pristine NiO based gas sensor only showed a response of 3.15 under the same conditions. The plausible explanation for the Pt-functionalized NiO based gas sensors to enhance the gas sensing performance is attributed to the role of Pt on the catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde and the increase of oxygen species quantity.

Ten ships were used for spraying 6-8 t of FeCl3 in the lake every day since October 2009. After spraying, the average concentration of arsenic in Yangzonghai Lake, which has an area of 31 km(2), an average depth of 20 m, and a water storage capacity of 604 million m(3), started to decrease from 0.117 mg L-1. On 20 September 2010, the lowest arsenic level of 0.021 mg L-1 was attained, with an arsenic removal rate as high as 82.0%. However, the source of pollution was not eliminated, and local rainfall mainly occurred in September; hence, arsenic concentration from October to December increased to 0.078 mg L-1. At the beginning of 2011, the As concentration decreased and remained at 0.025-0.028 mg L-1 from May to September. During the 2 years of FeCl3 treatment, the water quality improved from V Class to II-III Class of the Chinese standards, which remained consistent for 12 months. The total cost for this in situ water treatment was 29 million RMB, which was less than a hundredth of the expected expenditure of 4-7 billion RMB. The treatment method achieved goals such as high arsenic removal rate, easy operation, low cost, and ecological security. In this study, the changing patterns of the concentration of arsenic in Yangzonghai Lake from June 2008 to December 2014 were analyzed, and the following problems were discussed: the stability of iron-arsenic precipitates in the lake, the concentrations of ferric and chloride ions in the lake, the pH of the lake during treatment, the stability of iron-arsenic precipitates in the lakebed sediments, and the variation of phytoplankton species in the lake.

The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that, the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed on RGO sheets, and there was a C-Ti bond in FTG. Moreover, the F- was adsorbed on the surface of TiO2, and generated the stable F-Ti bonds. The adsorption ability and photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites was evaluated by degradation of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethynyl-estradiol (EE2) under UV light illumination. The removal ratio was strongly affected by the mass ratio of RGO in FTG, and the optimal mass ratio of RGO for both E2 and EE2 was 4.0 wt% (FTG-4). Further more, the presence of F- enhanced the photocatalytic activity effectively. Under the optimal degradation conditions, the total removal ratios of E2 over FTG-4, TiO2/4 wt% RGO (denoted as TG, without adding hydrofluoric acid) and P25 (Commercial TiO2) were 99.8%, 833% and 74.4%, respectively. And the total removal ratios of EE2 over the same catalysts were 99.7%, 82.6% and 75.6%, respectively. The results indicated that FTG exhibited much higher efficient removal ability for estrogens compared to TG and P25. The introduction of GO in the TiO2 can enhance the adsorption ability for estrogens, meanwhile, GO and the F- can both improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for degradation of estrogens greatly. Further more, the prepared catalyst was found to be reusable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The building sector shares one fourth of total energy consumption in the country and plays an important role in reducing the energy consumption and the consequential green house gas (GHG) emissions. Some policies have been issued for promoting the low carbon sustainable development in China's buildings. However, existing barriers especially the investment barriers substantially prevent the low carbon technologies and service from being employed effectively. The carbon trading scheme of cap-and-trade is now widely accepted as one cost-effective way to deal with the climate change issue in the world, and it can be utilized for overcoming the barriers to carbon reduction activities in China's building sector. A new Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) energy performance based method is designed for reducing transaction costs in implementing CDM projects in China's buildings before 2020. And then a "step by step" approach is formed to establish the domestic and international carbon trading mechanism to effectively reduce GHG missions in China's building sector after 2020.

The calculation results show that: SO2 absorption coefficient Delta gamma AD is 1.843, and influence factor C related to Delta gamma(AD) has obvious seasonal variation that reaches a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer; moreover, the presence of SO2 leads to higher amount of Dobson ozone than the actual values. After the correction by using the factor C, the relative difference between Dobson and Brewer data sets shows a decrease by 1 similar to 3%. On the other hand, the effect of SO2 on Dobson total ozone is reduced due to the decrease of total SO2, but it should still be taken into account during a high-pollution period.

In this study, we investigated the root microbiome of tomato in association with infection by root knot nematodes. Our objectives were to observe the effects and response of the bacterial endophytes before nematode attacks and to reveal the functional attributes of microbes in plant health and nematode pathogenesis. Community analysis of root-associated microbiomes in healthy and nematode-infected tomatoes indicated that nematode infections were associated with variation and differentiation of the endophyte and rhizosphere bacterial populations in plant roots. The community of the resident endophytes in tomato root was significantly affected by nemato-pathogenesis. Remarkably, some bacterial groups in the nematode feeding structure, the root gall, were specifically enriched, suggesting an association with nematode pathogenesis. Function-based metagenomic analysis indicated that the enriched bacterial populations in root gall harbored abundant genes related to degradation of plant polysaccharides, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and biological nitrogen fixation. Our data indicated that some of the previously assumed beneficial endophytes or bacterial associates with nematode might be involved in nematode infections of the tomato roots.

Confronting limited oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations, and complete darkness, they epitomize a successful physiological adaptation. Here, we employ transcriptome sequencing to explore the genetic underpinnings of their adaptations to this unique habitat. Compared to Rattus norvegicus, genes belonging to GO categories related to energy metabolism (e.g. mitochondrion and fatty acid beta-oxidation) underwent accelerated evolution in the plateau zokor. Furthermore, the numbers of positively selected genes were significantly enriched in the gene categories involved in ATPase activity, blood vessel development and respiratory gaseous exchange, functional categories that are relevant to adaptation to high altitudes. Among the 787 genes with evidence of parallel evolution, and thus identified as candidate genes, several GO categories (e.g. response to hypoxia, oxygen homeostasis and erythrocyte homeostasis) are significantly enriched, are two genes, EPAS1 and AJUBA, involved in the response to hypoxia, where the parallel evolved sites are at positions that are highly conserved in sequence alignments from multiple species. Thus, accelerated evolution of GO categories, positive selection and parallel evolution at the molecular level provide evidences to parse the genetic adaptations of the plateau zokor for living in high-elevation burrows.

An instance of the problem is given by m identical parallel machines and a set of n independent jobs, with each job having a processing time and a penalty. A job may be accepted to be processed or be rejected at its penalty. The objective of the problem is to partition the set of jobs into two subsets, the subset of accepted and the subset of rejected jobs, and to schedule the set of accepted jobs such that the makespan is minimized under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time for the problem. We also present a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O (nm(O(1/epsilon 2)) + mn(2)) for the problem. Moreover, for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant m, our results lead to a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the problem. Our result is fairly good in the sense that in a reasonable size of jobs, our FPTAS improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2)/epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the molecular mechanism of RA-mediated differentiation in hepatic cancer stem cells (hCSCs) is not well understood. In this study, we found that mRNA expressions of RA-biosynthesis-related dehydrogenases were highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) differentiated hCSCs through inhibiting the function of beta-catenin in vitro. ATRA also inhibited the function of PI3K-AKT and enhanced GSK-3 beta-dependent degradation of phosphorylated beta-catenin. Furthermore, ATRA and beta-catenin silencing both increased hCSC sensitivity to docetaxel treatment. Our results suggest that targeting beta-catenin will provide extra benefits for ATRA-mediated treatment of hepatic cancer patients.

Considering the ultra-relativistic hadrons as a beam of freely moving elementary constituents, the inclusive photoproduction cross sections for charm quark, bottom quark, J/psi, and Upsilon (1S) are calculated by using the incoherent photon spectrum from the individual quarks in the nucleus. Comparing with the predictions of the coherent photon channel in the literatures, it is shown that the ultrain-coherent photon channel provides non-negligible contributions to the heavy quarks and heavy quarkonia photoproduction in ultra-peripheral collisions.

Preservational Pathways of Corresponding Brains of a Cambrian Euarthropod	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							BURGESS SHALE; ORGANIC PRESERVATION; OPTIC LOBES; CRUSTACEAN; VIEW; PYRITIZATION; EVOLUTION; ORIGINS; SYSTEM	The record of arthropod body fossils is traceable back to the "Cambrian explosion," marked by the appearance of most major animal phyla. Exceptional preservation provides crucial evidence for panarthropod early radiation. However, due to limited representation in the fossil record of internal anatomy, particularly the CNS, studies usually rely on exoskeletal and appendicular morphology. Recent studies [1-3] show that despite extreme morphological disparities, euarthropod CNS evolution appears to have been remarkably conservative. This conclusion is supported by descriptions from Cambrian panarthropods of neural structures that contribute to understanding early evolution of nervous systems and resolving controversies about segmental homologies [4-12]. However, the rarity of fossilized CNSs, even when exoskeletons and appendages show high levels of integrity, brought into question data reproducibility because all but one of the aforementioned studies were based on single specimens [13]. Foremost among objections is the lack of taphonomic explanation for exceptional preservation of a tissue that some see as too prone to decay to be fossilized. Here we describe newly discovered specimens of the Chengjiang euarthropod Fuxianhuia protensa with fossilized brains revealing matching profiles, allowing rigorous testing of the reproducibility of cerebral structures. Their geochemical analyses provide crucial insights of taphonomic pathways for brain preservation, ranging from uniform carbon compressions to complete pyritization, revealing that neural tissue was initially preserved as carbonaceous film and subsequently pyritized. This mode of preservation is consistent with the taphonomic pathways of gross anatomy, indicating that no special mode is required for fossilization of labile neural tissue.

The results show that there are several product channels. First, the ion H3O+, which has been observed in the interstellar medium, can be generated by direct abstraction of H from HOCO+. Second, the HOCO+ cation can combine with a water molecule to generate the new molecule, HOC(OH)(2)(+) for which stable structures have been found. Third, a transition state can exist where the reaction proceeds through HOC(O)OH2+ T radicals to produce the products HCOOH+ + OH. We have also calculated structural parameters, energies, and vibrational frequencies of both the HOC(O)OH2+ adduct and the products which are presented to help in their future identification. Using the calculated spectrums of the ground states and excited states we have proposed possible structures which correspond to observed spectral lines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Excluding fire from fire-dependent ecosystems can substantially alter these ecosystems. This study mainly investigates the how the zonal vegetation evergreen broad-leaved forests as well as widely distributed vegetation Pinus yunnanensis forest and shrubland in the Central Yunnan Plateau adapt to fire, and addresses the role of fire in the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem to determine whether this ecosystem is fire-dependent. Re-sprouting trees and shrubs composed about 90.6% of the dominant taxa. In re-sprouting species, 41 species (77.4% of all re-sprouting species) were observed re-sprout from underground basal burls after a fire. After a fire, 100% of all trees and tall shrubs, 93.6% of all shrubs and 73.9% of all herbs recovered. Two serotinous tree taxa were found, including two varieties of P. yunnanensis (var. pygmaea and var. yunnanensis) which is a dominant and the most common tree species in this region. All these were identified here as weakly serotinous species. The degree of serotiny was 50.4% for P. yunnanensis var. yunnanensis and 74.7% for var. pygmaea. Heat shock resulted in higher seed germination rates for both varieties of P. yunnanensis. Dominant and common taxa in these two typical forest types had typical traits of species known to be adapted to fire; forest fire did not significantly reduce number of species. Based on the above results, the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem is a fire-dependent system. Wildfire plays an important role in the community assembly for the semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests, P. yunnanensis forest and shrub communities. Wildfire should not be viewed as a totally catastrophic event in forests of the Central Yunnan Plateau. In theory this region appropriates to carry out prescribed burning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, CP; Wang, J; Guo, H; Ding, SJ				Li, Cuiping; Wang, Jie; Guo, Hong; Ding, Shujiang			Low temperature synthesis of polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes with enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Polyaniline; Crystalline TiO2; Halloysite; Low-temperature synthesis; Visible-light photocatalysis	TIO2; HALLOYSITE; DEGRADATION; NANOCOMPOSITES; EFFICIENT; ANATASE; PHOTODEGRADATION; POLYMERIZATION; NANOPARTICLES; NANOSHEETS	A series of one-dimensional polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes with different mass ratio of polyaniline to TiO2 are facilely prepared by employing the low-temperature synthesis of crystalline TiO2 on halloysite nanotubes. The halloysite nanotubes can adsorb TiO2/polyaniline precursors and induce TiO2 nanocrystals/polyaniline to grow on the support in situ simultaneously. By simply adjusting the acidity of reaction system, PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA composite nanotubes composed of anatase, a mixed phase TiO2 and different PANI redox state are obtained. The XRD and UV-vis results show that the surface polyaniline sensitization has no effect on the crystalline structure of halloysite and TiO2 and the light response of TiO2 is extended to visible-light regions. Photocatalysis test results reveal the photocatalytic activity will be affected by the pH value and the volume ratio of ANI to TTIP. The highest photocatalytic activity is achieved with the composite photocatalysts prepared at pH 0.5 and 1% volume ratio of ANI and TTIP owing to the sensitizing effect of polyaniline and the charge transfer from the photoexcited PANI sensitizer to TiO2. Moreover, the PANI-TiO2-HA composite nanotubes synthesized by one-step at pH 0.5 with I% volume ratio of ANI to TTIP exhibit higher visible light photocatalytic activity than those synthesized by the two-step. Heterogeneous PANI-TiO2-HA composite nanotubes prepared at pH 0.5 exhibit a higher degradation activity than that prepared at pH 1.5. The redoped experiment proves that the PANI redox state plays the main contribution to the enhanced visible light catalytic degradation efficiency of PANI-TiO2-HA prepared at pH 0.5. Furthermore, the heterogeneous PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA nanotubes have good photocatalytic stability and can be reused four times with only gradual loss of activity under visible light irradiation.

However, there is no complete plastid genome of Tilia sequenced to date, and the taxonomy of Tilia is difficult owing to frequent hybridization and polyploidization. A well-supported interspecific relationships of this genus is not available due to limited informative sites from the commonly used molecular markers. We report here the complete plastid genome sequences of four Tilia species determined by the Illumina technology. The Tilia plastid genome is 162,653 bp to 162,796 bp in length, encoding 113 unique genes and a total number of 130 genes. The gene order and organization of the Tilia plastid genome exhibits the general structure of angiosperms and is very similar to other published plastid genomes of Malvaceae. As other long-lived tree genera, the sequence divergence among the four Tilia plastid genomes is very low. And we analyzed the nucleotide substitution patterns and the evolution of insertions and deletions in the Tilia plastid genomes. Finally, we build a phylogeny of the four sampled Tilia species with high supports using plastid phylogenomics, suggesting that it is an efficient way to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of this genus.

Individuals growing in different habitats exhibit extensive phenotypic variation but little genetic differentiation. Little is known about the molecular basis underlying environment-induced phenotypic changes. Variation in transcript abundance in A. philoxeroides was characterized throughout the time-courses of pond and upland treatments using RNA-Sequencing. Seven thousand eight hundred and five genes demonstrated variable expression in response to different treatments, forming 11 transcriptionally coordinated gene groups. Functional enrichment analysis of plastically expressed genes revealed pathway changes in hormone-mediated signaling, osmotic adjustment, cell wall remodeling, and programmed cell death, providing a mechanistic understanding of the biological processes underlying the phenotypic changes in A. philoxeroides. Both transcriptional modulation of environmentally sensitive loci and environmentally dependent control of regulatory loci influenced the plastic responses to the environment. Phenotypic responses and gene expression patterns to contrasting hydrological conditions were compared between A. philoxeroides and its alien congener Alternanthera pungens. The terricolous A. pun gens displayed limited phenotypic plasticity to different treatments. It was postulated based on gene expression comparison that the interspecific variation in plasticity between A, philoxeroides and A. pungens was not due to environmentally-mediated changes in hormone levels but to variations in the type and relative abundance of different signal transducers and receptors expressed in the target tissue.

Secondary growth mechanism of SiGe islands deposited on a mixed-phase microcrystalline Si by ion beam co-sputtering	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						secondary-grown SiGe islands; mixed-phase structure; preferential growth; Si-Ge intermixing behaviour	GE QUANTUM DOTS; GE/SI(001) ISLANDS; AMORPHOUS-SILICON; EVOLUTION; RAMAN; STRAIN; SPECTROSCOPY; SCATTERING; ENERGY	We discuss the SiGe island co-sputtering deposition on a microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si) buffer layer and the secondary island growth based on this pre-SiGe island layer. The growth phenomenon of SiGe islands on crystalline silicon (c-Si) is also investigated for comparison. The pre-SiGe layer grown on mu c-Si exhibits a mixed-phase structure, including SiGe islands and amorphous SiGe (a-SiGe) alloy, while the layer deposited on c-Si shows a single-phase island structure. The preferential growth and Ostwald ripening growth are shown to be the secondary growth mechanism of SiGe islands on mu c-Si and c-Si, respectively. This difference may result from the effect of amorphous phase Si (AP-Si) in mu c-Si on the island growth. In addition, the SiGe intermixing behavior of the secondary-grown islands on mu c-Si is interpreted by constructing the model of lateral atomic migration, while this behavior on c-Si is ascribed to traditional uphill atomic diffusion. It is found that the aspect ratios of the preferential-grown super islands are higher than those of the Ostwald-ripening ones. The lower lateral growth rate of super islands due to the lower surface energy of AP-Si on the mu c-Si buffer layer for the non-wetting of Ge at 700 degrees C and the stronger Si-Ge intermixing effect at 730 degrees C may be responsible for this aspect ratio difference.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration; LHAASO Collaboration	Knee of the cosmic hydrogen and helium spectrum below 1 PeV measured by ARGO-YBJ and a Cherenkov telescope of LHAASO	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ENERGY-SPECTRUM; ELEMENTAL GROUPS; RAY PHYSICS; RANGE; TIBET; DETECTOR; MODELS; WIND; TEV	The measurement of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, in particular for individual species of nuclei, is an important tool to investigate cosmic ray production and propagation mechanisms. The determination of the "knees" in the spectra of different species remains one of the main challenges in cosmic ray physics. In fact, experimental results are still conflicting. In this paper we report a measurement of the mixed proton and helium energy spectrum, obtained with the combined data of the ARGO-YBJ experiment and a wide field of view Cherenkov telescope, a prototype of the future LHAASO experiment. By means of a multiparameter technique, we have selected a high-purity proton plus helium sample. The reconstructed energy resolution is found to be about 25% throughout the investigated energy range from 100 TeV to 3 PeV, with a systematic uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of 9.7%. The found energy spectrum can be fitted with a broken power-law function, with a break at the energy E-k = 700 +/- 230(stat) +/- 70(sys) TeV, where the spectral index changes from -2.56 +/- 0.05 to -3.24 +/- 0.36. The statistical significance of the observed spectral break is 4.2 standard deviations.	[Bi, X. J.; Cao, Z.; Chen, S. Z.; Feng, Zhaoyang; Guo, Q. B.; Guo, Y. Q.; He, H.

Here we reveal a role for annexin A2 (AnxA2) in host defense against infection as anxa2(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis with enhanced inflammatory responses. Computing analysis and biochemical experiments identified that constitutive AnxA2 expression facilitated TLR4 internalization and its subsequent translocation into early endosomal membranes. It activated the TRAM-dependent endosomal signaling, leading to the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, AnxA2 deficiency prolonged TLR4-mediated signaling from the plasma membrane, which was attributable to pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta). Thus, AnxA2 directly exerted negative regulation of inflammatory responses through TLR4-initiated TRAM-TRIF pathway occurring on endosomes. This study reveals AnxA2 as a critical regulator in infection-initiated inflammation, which protects the host from excessive inflammatory damage.

However, the normality assumption may be violated in some applications. To this end, this article assumes that the random effect follows a skew-normal distribution and the within-individual error is distributed as a reproductive dispersion model. An expectation conditional maximization (ECME) algorithm together with the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm within the Gibbs sampler is presented to simultaneously obtain estimates of parameters and random effects. Several diagnostic measures are developed to identify the potentially influential cases and assess the effect of minor perturbation to model assumptions via the case-deletion method and local influence analysis. To reduce the computational burden, we derive the first-order approximations to case-deletion diagnostics. Several simulation studies and a real data example are presented to illustrate the newly developed methodologies.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM 77969(T) belongs to the genus Hymenobacter, and was closely related to Hymenobacter tibetensis XTM003(T) (96.58 %), Hymenobacter gelipurpurascens Txg1(T) (96.02 %) and Hymenobacter xinjiangensis X2-1g(T) (95.80 %). Growth of strain YIM 77969(T) occurred at 5-35 degrees C, at pH 5.0-9.0 and in the presence of 0-1 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15 (:) (0), C-16 (:) (1)omega 5c and summed feature 3 (C-16 (: 1)omega 7c and/or C-16 : 1 omega 6c). The polar lipid profiles consisted of the major compound phosphatidylethanolamine, two unknown aminolipids, three unknown aminophospholipids, one glycolipid and one unknown polar lipid. Pigment analysis showed that the pigment belonged to the plectaniaxanthin series of carotenoid pigments. The genomic DNA G+C content was 55.2 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain YIM 77969(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Hymenobacter, for which the name Hymenobacter mucosus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 77969(T) (=KCTC 32567(T)=DSM 28041(T)).

Poiqu watershed in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China, also known as the Bhote Koshi and Sun Koshi downstream in Nepal, has been identified as highly prone to GLOFs. This study explored the distribution of and changes in glacial lakes, past GLOFs and the resulting losses, risk from potential future GLOFs, and risk reduction initiatives within the watershed. A relationship was established between lake area and volume of lake water based on data from 33 lakes surveyed within the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, and the maximum possible discharge was estimated using this and other previously developed empirical equations. We recommend different strategies to reduce GLOF risk and highlight the need for a glacial lake monitoring and early-warning system. We also recommend strong regional cooperation, especially on issues related to transboundary rivers.

J	Zhao, Y; Wang, YL				Zhao, Yue; Wang, Yalin			Intrinsic parameter determination of a paracatadioptric camera by the intersection of two sphere projections	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							CATADIOPTRIC LINE IMAGES; GEOMETRIC-PROPERTIES; CALIBRATION METHOD	In this paper, a linear calibration method is proposed for a paracatadioptric camera using the images of two spheres. Two spheres are selected in space, and the two groups of their projection circles on the unit viewing sphere are made to intersect at four points. The quadrilateral consisting of four points is a rectangle, so a group of orthogonal directions can be determined in space to obtain a group of orthogonal vanishing points in the paracatadioptric image plane. Because of the relationship between orthogonal vanishing points and intrinsic camera parameters, the intrinsic parameters of a paracatadioptric camera can be linearly solved by at least five views satisfying the above conditions. First, one estimates the sphere images and their antipodal sphere images. Second, by solving the intersection of the images of two spheres and the intersection of the images of their antipodal spheres, a group of orthogonal vanishing points can be obtained in the image plane. Finally, by taking the relationship between the orthogonal vanishing points and the intrinsic camera parameters as constraint conditions, the intrinsic parameters of the paracatadioptric camera can be obtained. Simulation results and real image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithms.

Using delay Langevin and Fokker-Planck approaches, the theoretical analysis of the model is presented. It is found that the mean first-passage time (MFPT) as a function of the time delay exhibits a maximum, which is identified as the characteristic of the delay-enhanced stability of the system. This is different to the case of noise-enhanced stability. The non-Gaussian noise-enhanced stability of the system is also analyzed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the noise intensity exhibits a maximum. This maximum implies the identifying characteristic of stochastic resonance (SR), and the time delay and non-Gaussian noise can enhance the SR phenomenon.

J	Wang, S; Xu, XY; Hu, JF				Wang Su; Xu Xiao-Ya; Hu Jia-Fu			Review on the study of crustal structure and geodynamic models for the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Sichuan and Yunnan region; Geodynamic model; Crustal structure; Lower crustal flow	UPPER-MANTLE STRUCTURE; RECEIVER FUNCTION-ANALYSIS; SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; VELOCITY STRUCTURE; EASTERN MARGIN; DISCONTINUITY STRUCTURE; ACTIVE DEFORMATION; CENOZOIC TECTONICS; STRUCTURE BENEATH; WAVE DISPERSION	The convergence between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plates has resulted in the shortening of crust at least 1500 km and thickening of crust to twice of the normal (about 70 km) beneath the collision zone over the last 45 Ma. To model the mechanism of the surface deformation, several models, including lateral extrusion of rigid blocks along large strike-slip faults and lower crust flow have been proposed. The crustal-flow model, in which the middle/lower crust in central Tibet is partially molten and flows from central Tibet through Sichuan into Yunnan, is gradually accepted by seismologists. Therefore, the study of the deformational characteristics in crust and mantle and the geodynamic model beneath Sichuan and Yunnan (southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau) remains one of focused issues in the earth sciences of the world for many years. Although the fine crustal structures have been obtained in the region during the past several decades, the mechanisms for plateau deformation and expansion are still enigmatic due to the resolution limitations of methods and/or data. The aim of this paper is to select the previous results, analyze their discrepancies and conclude the reliable evidence for the lower crustal-flow model. The lower crustal flow model on the evolution of the Tibetan plateau yields surface velocity and deformation field consistent with observations of GPS, thus being very popular in the earth science community. A scientific problem in deep geophysics is searching for evidence on the existence of the lower crustal flow. In this paper, GPS observations, focal mechanism solutions, and Pms phase splitting in Sichuan and Yunnan are combined to explore the reasonability of crustal deformation models. On the other hand, based on the analysis of tomography, receiver function inversion, and magnetotelluric profiles, this paper discusses whether there exits the deep evidence on lower crustal flow beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as the distribution scale of lower crustal flow if it is really present. The geodynamic implications are also investigated in relation to surface geological features, GPS velocities, Pms phase splitting, and focal mechanism. We observe a conspicuous sharper clockwise rotation around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, and suggest that the deformation between the upper and lower crust within Sichuan and Yunnan is coupled. Resistivity imaging by magnetotelluric measurements have mapped two zones of high electrical conductivity at depth 20 similar to 40 km beneath southeast Tibet, only along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault and Jiali-Nujiang fault, respectively. However, the crustal velocity structure obtained by inversion of receiver functions and surface waves shows that intra-crust low-velocity zone (IC-LVZ) is locally distributed in western Sichuan, and not found in the Sichuan basin. Additionally, by analysis of the polarity of the converted phases at intra-crust interfaces, we suggest that a wide-spread IC-LVZ is present in Yunnan. According to the distribution features of the negative polarity at intra-crust interface and crustal structure from joint inversion of receiver functions of surface waves, it is concluded that an IC-LVZ from eastern Tibet on a large scale may exist beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, and has reached the southern Yunnan, but has a complex geometric shape. In Yunnan, this zone appears to be constrained in a certain area by the Xiaojiang and Jinshajiang-Red River faults. This conclusion is not quite consistent with previous suggestion that the lower-crustal flow reaches only the Lijiang-Jinhe fault, and that the lower crustal flow is only bounded within two arc-like channels.

We grew E. pisciphila in the liquid media with increasing Cd concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg L-1). Increased Cd in the media caused a proportional increase in the Cd uptake by E. pisciphila. Subcellular distribution indicated that 81 to 97 % of Cd was associated with the cell walls. The largest amount and proportion (45-86 %) of Cd was extracted with 2 % acetic acid, and a concentration-dependent extraction was observed, both of which suggest that Cd-phosphate complexes were the major chemical form in E. pisciphila. A large distribution of phosphate and Cd on the mycelia surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The precipitates associated with the mycelia were observed to contain Cd by transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) identified that hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, and phosphate groups were responsible for binding Cd. We conclude that Cd associated with cell walls and integrated with phosphate might be responsible for the tolerance of E. pisciphila to Cd.

It is found that the Drude part dominates the optical conductivity in the low-frequency region, whereas the plasmon effect can give rise to a relatively weak but observable the optical conductivity in the high-frequency region. Both the Drude and plasmon-induced parts of optical conductivity can be observed in the terahertz (THz) bandwidth. Drude part decreases monotonously with increasing of the photon frequency, the plasmon-induced part exhibits a peak at about omega similar to 1 THz due to resonant plasmon-photon interaction in graphene. Moreover; we examined the dependence of plasmon-induced optical conductivity on the driving electric field and electron density and find that it depends sensitively on these parameters. It is indicated that the optical conductivity resulted from Drude and plasmon-induced parts in graphene can be tuned efficiently not only by electric gating but also by source-drain voltage.

It is found that there are two peaks in the phosphorescent spectra in visible region from 2.2 similar to 77 K. They are located at 547.70 nm and 515.70 nm wavelength. This is due to radiative electronic transition from two substates in (MLCT)-M-3 structure to the ground state of Ir(ppy)(3). Changing temperature can vary electron distribution and life-time on different substates in the (MLCT)-M-3 structure of Ir(ppy)(3). Thus, we can observe a strong dependence of the phosphorescent spectrum on temperature. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of phosphorescent emission from Ir(ppy)(3) increases with magnetic field at 2.2 K. The presence of the high magnetic field can alter the electronic states and, thus, modulate the electron distribution and transition possibility for substates in (MLCT)-M-3. As a result, the phosphorescence emission from Ir(ppy)(3) can be enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field.

The sample in this study consists of 49 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 22 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). The fractional variability amplitudes of each source have been calculated in both optical R band and infrared J band. Overall, the variability amplitudes of FSRQs are larger than those of BL Lacs. The results also suggest that the variability amplitude of most FSRQs is larger at a lower energy band (J band) than at a higher one (R band), but the variability amplitude of BL Lacs is larger at the higher energy band. Both types of blazars display color variation along with variability in brightness. However, they show different variation behaviors in general. In the whole data set, 35 FSRQs exhibit redder-when-brighter trends, and 11 FSRQs exhibit opposite trends; 11 BL Lacs follow bluer-when-brighter trends, and seven BL Lacs follow opposite trends. A detailed examination indicates that there are 10 blazars showing redder-when-brighter trends in their low state, and bluer-when-brighter or stable-when-brighter trends in their high state. Some more complicated color behaviors have also been detected in several blazars. The non-thermal jet emission and the thermal emission from the accretion disk are employed to explain the observed color behaviors.

The roasted material is leached with tap water for the recovery of zinc and indium. The influence of roasting temperature, particle size, and the ratio of acid to ZSOD mass on the rate of roasting reactions were investigated. The results show that the extraction rate of zinc and indium increases with increasing the roasting temperature and the ratio of acid to ZSOD mass, while decreases with increase in the particle size. The samples were characterized using XRD and SEM. Under the conditions employed in the present work a maximum recovery of 94% and 90% of zinc and indium could be achieved. Shrinking core model was used to describe the kinetic parameters and to identify the rate controlling step. Both zinc and indium extraction were controlled by the internal diffusion in the solid product layer, with the apparent activation energy of the roasting reaction were 15.94 kJ/mol and 12.68 kJ/mol respectively. The reaction order with respect to concentrated sulphuric acid was 1.75 and 1.59 for zinc and indium, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the condition of conference, the equivalent photon-approximation formulation isused, and the limitations of the variables in the calculations are obtained. Three kinds of the equivalent photon spectrums are considered: the plane wave form, the approximate plane wave forms of Dress et al., and the semi-classical form. For comparison, the gluon-gluon fusion and intrinsic heavy flavors contributions are presented. The numerical results show that, the plane wave photon spectrum with correct limitations of the variables provides more reasonable results for the exclusive p + p -> p + p + H and and Pb + Pb -> Pb + Pb + H processes, and the electromagnetic process provides meaningful contributions for the exclusive Higgs production in ultra-peripheral collisions.

An optical fiber is chosen to serve as the ring resonator and surrounded by rhodamine 6G dye solution of lower refractive index as the fluidic gain medium. When the ring resonator is pumped by a linearly s-polarized laser, the emitted whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is of parallel polarization (TM mode), while p-polarized laser excitation generates a vertically polarized lasing emission (TE mode), both TM and TE mode lasing emission coexist simultaneously if the ring resonator is pumped by the s- and p-mixed polarized light. Further investigation reveals that the lasing intensity of the TM mode is approximately twice that of the TE mode for the same pump energy density, meaning an obvious difference of coupling efficiency on the polarization state of pump light; the experimental results of coupling efficiency are well explained by an induced dipole model.

Secondly, we solve the Riemann problem of the Euler equations of isentropic gas dynamics with a double parameter flux approximation including pressure. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that, as the two-parameter flux perturbation vanishes, any Riemann solution containing two shock waves tends to a delta-shock solution to the zero-pressure flow; any Riemann solution containing two rarefaction waves tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the zero-pressure flow and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Finally, numerical results are given to present the formation processes of delta shock waves and vacuum states.

J	Du, GH; Liu, FH; Rowland, G				Du, Guang-Hui; Liu, Fei-Hu; Rowland, Gordon			Fiber cell development and fiber yield of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) affected by the seasonal temperature pattern	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Flax; bast fiber; temperature pattern; cell morphological structure; fiber yield	GROWTH; GERMINATION; ENVIRONMENT	Three fiber flax cultivars 'Ariane', 'Argos' and 'Viking' were cultured in growth chambers under three seasonal temperature patterns (STPs) [parabolic (P), anti-parabolic (AP) and quasi-horizontal (QH) configurations]. The effect of STP was studied on fiber cell development and on fiber yield. The results indicated that, compared with the quasi-horizontal seasonal temperature pattern (QH-STP), the size of fiber cell cavity (SFCC) and fiber content (FC) decreased under parabolic seasonal temperature pattern (P-STP). However, the size of fiber cell (SFC) and SFCC decreased, but the number of fiber cells per bundle (NFCB) increased under anti-parabolic seasonal temperature pattern (AP-STP). Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between fiber weight (FW) and width of fiber bundle (WFB), also between FC and NFCB. Considering the response of fiber flax cultivars to the different STPs, 'Ariane' had smaller SFC and SFCC, thinner thickness of fiber cell wall (TFCW) under AP-STP, and smaller SFCC and thicker TFCW under P-STP than under QH-STP, while 'Argos' had smaller SFC and SFCC, and higher NFCB under AP-STP, and smaller SFC under P-STP than under QH-STP. However, STPs had little effect on the fiber cell development of 'Viking'. All three cultivars had high FC under AP-STP than under P-STP. These observations indicate that the fiber cell development and fiber yield of flax were related to the STP and suggest that AP-STP are the most favorable temperature conditions for fiber flax growth.

First, the delay-dependent stability condition for the systems is established through computing the more general Lyapunov functional. The Lyapunov functional is constructed by making full use of the property and the information of the systems, and the condition has advantages over the existing ones in the skillful combination of the delay decomposition and the reciprocal convex approach. Second, considered to be more flexible for the controller design with the introduced positive scalar, a new controller method is presented. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the results in this paper.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed a clear affiliation of strain YIM 101302(T) to the genus Sphingobacterium. The newly isolated bacterium was found to be closely related to Sphingobacterium composti T5-12(T) (97.1 % 16S rRNA sequence identity) and Sphingobacterium alimentarium WCC 4521(T) (95.6 % 16S rRNA sequence identity) forming a distinct clade with these two species. Polar lipids of strain YIM 101302(T) were identified as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unidentified aminophospholipid, and three unidentified polar lipids; the predominant menaquinone as MK-7 and the major fatty as iso-C-15:0. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 38.9 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain YIM 101302(T) and S. composti T5-12(T), was 53.6 +/- A 5.8 %. These results indicates that strain YIM 101302(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium rhinocerotis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 101302(T) (=CCTCC AB 2013218(T) = KCTC 42533(T)).

The depths of these discontinuities are an important parameter to investigate tectonic evolution in the lithosphere. Receiver functions technique with teleseismic events is very suitable for studying the crust and upper mantle structure beneath stations, thus becoming one of the standard tools for such study. The principle of receiver functions is to separate the converted Ps or Sp phases generated at the discontinuities beneath stations in the case that the direct P or S is a delta function. In this paper, the methods of receiver function analysis are collected from literatures. We introduce the coordinate transform technique for the separation of Ps or Sp waves, the deconvolution algorithm to extract P and S receiver functions, the waveform fitting method to invert for S-wave velocity structure, the stacking technique to improve signals, and the migration from time series to depth domain. With some illustrative examples, the care that should be taken in study of the crustal and upper mantle structure using receiver functions are summarized. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The precise effects of EYA2 remain elusive in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we examined EYA2 expression in NSCLC cell lines and a normal pulmonary epithelial cell line. We found that EYA2 was aberrantly upregulated in the lung adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, we studied the methylation status of the eya2 gene in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, a normal pulmonary epithelial cell line and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Furthermore, the eya2 gene was knocked down in lung adenocarcinoma cells via RNA interference to investigate the regulatory role of EYA2; specifically, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, migration and invasive capacities were assessed in tje EYA2-knockdown cancer cells. The results showed that the aberrant hypomethylation and overexpression of the eya2 gene were associated with lung adenocarcinoma oncogenesis. In addition, inhibition of EYA2 expression suppressed tumour cell growth by altering the proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, migration and invasive capacities of the cells. These findings demonstrated that EYA2 functions as a stimulant in lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of novel diagnostic targets and therapy strategies for lung adenocarcinoma.

In this paper, we reported that expression of the apple (Malus domestica B.) vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit A (MdVHA-A) was induced by salt stress in apple in vitro shoot cultures. Additionally, MdVHA-A overexpression enhanced the resistance to salinity in the transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants. Compared to control tobacco plants, the transgenic plants exhibited the higher Na+, K+, and proline content but lower MDA content in leaves and roots. Therefore, these results indicate that expression of MdVHA-A can enhance plant tolerance to salt stress by modulating internal stores of ions and solutes.	[Dong, Q. L.; Liu, D. D.; Wang, Q.

In silicene, the Si atoms are in a mixed sp(2)/sp(3) configuration; it is therefore natural to imagine a silicane structure analogous to graphane. However, a monatomic silicene sheet grown on substrates generally reconstructs into different phases, and only partially hydrogenated silicene with reconstructions had been reported before. In this work, we produce half-silicane, where one Si sublattice is fully H-saturated and the other sublattice is intact, forming a perfect 1 x 1 structure. By hydrogenating various silicene phases on a Ag(111) substrate, we found that only the (2 root 3x2 root 3)R30 degrees phase can produce half-silicane. Interestingly, this phase was previously considered to be a highly defective or incomplete silicene structure.

Porous Co3O4 material was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause. Co3O4 with the meso- and macroporous structure consisting of nanoparticles has a coral-like shape with a size of tens of micrometers and exhibits the hierarchically porous morphology, in which the walls of the macropores contain smaller mesopores. The gas-sensing characteristics of the porous Co3O4 for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated. The gas response to 1000 ppm n-butanol reaches a maximum of 27.7 at an operating temperature of 120 degrees C, and about five tithes of the Co3O4 particles. The porous Co3O4 also exhibits certain selectivity and response/recovery time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

Nowadays, a group of imidazopyridines as B-Raf kinase inhibitors have been reported. In order to investigate the interaction between this group of inhibitors and B-Raf kinase, molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and binding free energy (G(bind)) calculation were performed in this work. Molecular docking was carried out to identify the key residues in the binding site, and MD simulations were performed to determine the detail binding mode. The results obtained from MD simulation reveal that the binding site is stable during the MD simulations, and some hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in MD simulations are different from H-bonds in the docking mode. Based on the obtained MD trajectories, G(bind) was computed by using Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA), and the obtained energies are consistent with the activities. An energetic analysis reveals that both electrostatic and van der Waals contributions are important to G(bind), and the unfavorable polar solvation contribution results in the instability of the inhibitor with the lowest activity. These results are expected to understand the binding between B-Raf and imidazopyridines and provide some useful information to design potential B-Raf inhibitors.

It is likely that the type material is a latest stage meraspis, and the species had nine thoracic segments in the holaspid phase rather than the eight suggested previously. The earliest holaspis is relatively small in size (about 3.00 mm in total length), and the succeeding instars show little size-related shape change. Striking changes take place in the morphology of the glabella during early ontogeny including forward extension of the axial furrows until they reach the anterior cephalic margin in meraspid degree 0iii, and narrowing of the glabellar mid-region. This is the first noneodiscid trilobite to show three developmental stages within meraspid degree 0. Documentation of ontogenetic changes demonstrates that both Duodingia hubeiensis and D. taihuensis are junior synonyms of D. duodingensis because they bear characters of particular ontogenetic stages of their senior synonym. The per-moult growth increment in D. duodingensis was apparently small in this small trilobite. The development of trunk segmentation during the meraspid phase is apparently more complex than in many other trilobites and could include multiple moults within individual meraspid degrees, intraspecific polymorphism in the pattern of segment release, or phenotypic variation among the population in the degree of segment expression. Fluctuations between accumulative moults, in which segments are added to the meraspid pygidium, and depletive moults, in which segments are released into the thorax, if confirmed, would suggest tight coordination between these different aspects of trunk segment development.

These Fe3O4 nanoparticles were the nucleated centers for the ZnO nanorods growth so that these nanorods ended with aggregated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The growth processes and mechanism are explained as those insoluble zinc hydroxides prefer to nucleate on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (heterogeneous nucleation) rather than nucleated as isolated ZnO nanostructures (homogeneous nucleation). These nanocomposites have strong photocatalytic ability to reduce RhB and moderate magnetization, which make them being good recyclable photocatalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first stage is formed by an adiabatically tapering a circular fiber to excite the desirable LP0m mode. The second stage is formed by inserting an inner core (tapered from both sides) with a refractive index smaller than the original core. This second stage is used to obtain low insertion loss and high extinction ratio of the desired LP0m mode. Three converters between LP01 and LP0m, m = 2, 3, and 4, are designed for C-band, and simulation results show that less than 0.24, 0.54 and 0.7 dB insertion loss and higher than 15, 16, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio over the entire band were obtained for the three converters, respectively.

However, when feature representation schemes are adopted, the dimensionality of concatenated scene features extracted from the RGB and depth image pair is very high and faces the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we present a new subspace selection scheme called local structure preserving discriminative projections (LSPDP). LSPDP simultaneously considers two issues: (1) achieving a balance between the local patch structure and global within-class structure and (2) maximizing between-class distances. Extensive experimentation on the NYU Depth V1 dataset with feature sets computed using three popular schemes (locality-constrained linear coding (LLC), spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding (Sc-SPM), and efficient match kernels (EMKs)) demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the new method for RGB-D sensor-based scene classification.

However, current methods with traditional classifiers are usually based on one-to-one view matching and fail to capture the structure information of multiple views. Some multi-view based methods take different views into consideration, but they still treat views separately. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D object recognizing method based on multi-view data fusion, called Multi-view Ensemble Manifold Regularization (MEMR). In this method, we model image features with a regularization term for SVM. To train this modified SVM, multi-view learning is achieved with alternating optimization.

J	Liu, WF; Li, Y; Tao, DP; Wang, YJ				Liu, Weifeng; Li, Yang; Tao, Dapeng; Wang, Yanjiang			A general framework for co-training and its applications	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Co-training; Multi-view; Human action recognition; Social activity recognition	UNLABELED DATA; IMAGE; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; SUBSPACE; FEATURES; MANIFOLD; MACHINE; IMPROVE	Co-training is one of the major semi-supervised learning paradigms in which two classifiers are alternately trained on two distinct views and they teach each other by adding the predictions of unlabeled data to the training set of the other view. Co-training can achieve promising performance, especially when there is only a small number of labeled data. Hence, co-training has received considerable attention, and many variant co-training algorithms have been developed. It is essential and informative to provide a systematic framework for a better understanding of the common properties and differences in these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for co-training according to the diverse learners constructed in co-training. Specifically, we provide three types of co-training implementations, including co-training on multiple views, co-training on multiple classifiers, and co-training on multiple manifolds. Finally, comprehensive experiments of different methods are conducted on the UCF-iPhone dataset for human action recognition and the USAA dataset for social activity recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The characteristic results of the morphology and structure show that the synthesized nanoarray can be well indexed to tetragonal phase SnO2 nanorods with a diameter of 20 nm and length of several hundred nanometers. The twin-layered SnO2 nanorods array was tightly combined together by two layers of nanrods array with an apparent interface in the center. The results of the gas-sensing characteristics for various volatile organic compounds show that the sensor based on layered SnO2 nanoarray exhibits the highest gas sensitivity, very fast response and recovery to isopropanol at the operating temperature of 250 degrees C, and good gas-sensing performances to ethanol and acetone have also been found at the operating temperature of 278 and 300 degrees C, respectively. The enhanced response is attributed to the numbers of the gas transport channels increasement leading to more effective surface areas and the additional modulation of the sensor resistance due to the potential barrier at nanorod/nanorod junctions of twin-layered SnO2 well-oriented nanorods array.

Highly effective TP elimination sustained for about 10d, with remarkable declines followed to relatively stable efficiencies for both types of wastewater. Significant difference of TP removal performance for the two types of wastewater was observed. In period 1, under high LR, the IVCWs performed better when treating domestic wastewater (DW), achieving average removal efficiency and rate of 51.6% and 0.389gm(-2)d(-1), respectively, compared to those of 30.1% and 0.233gm(-2)d(-1) for SW. However, in the operational period 2 fed with a low LR, better TP removal performance was achieved for SW, with reduction efficiency and rate of 41.5% and 0.057gm(-2)d(-1) on average, while the corresponding value for the treatment of DW was just 12.5% and 0.023gm(-2)d(-1). Significant correlations between TP removal efficiency and plant growth detected during this period and better developed vegetation in systems fed with SW might suggest the considerable role of plant growth, which could be influenced by inlet properties, on P retention and lifespan extending of constructed wetland. Gravel-based IVCW could be employed to remove low load of phosphorus and wastewater properties, and plant growth cycle should be taken intoconsideration in future IVCW design and application.

The as-prepared materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The results showed that pure anatase TiO2 particles were anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide. And the HF added during the preparation process can not only prevent phase transformation from anatase to rutile, but also the F- ion adsorbed on the surface of TiO2-RGO surface can enhance photocatalytic activity of F-TiO2-RGO. The photocatalytic activities of F-TiO2-RGO nanocomposites were evaluated by decomposing bisphenol A under UV light illumination. Under optimal degradation condition, the degradation rate constant of BPA over F-TiO2-10RGO (0.01501 mm(-1)) was 3.41 times than that over P25 (0.00440 mm(-1)). The result indicated that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of F-TiO2-10RGO was ascribed to the adsorbed F ion and RGO in F-TiO2-RGO composite, which can reduce the recombination rate of the photo-generated electrons and holes synergistically.

The effects of Cu addition on the crystal structure, surface morphology and magnetic property of Mn3Ni(Cu)N thin films were investigated. As a result, the preferred orientation is independent to Cu-doping in the Mn3Ni(Cu)N phase, while the addition of Cu induces the lattice expansion for the films, indicating the possibility of controlling the crystal orientation and the substitution of Cu for Ni. Correspondingly, the surface morphologies significantly vary with the Cu-doping. In particular, it is found that increase in Cu content changes the ground state from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic (FI) phase and the magnetic transition temperature gradually decreases within the testing temperature ranges, which is mainly attributed to the competition between FI and AFM interactions with increasing Cu-doping content. The present discovery highlights the potential application of magnetic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we re-analyzed a published methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) dataset to characterize the DNA methylation pattern of pig lincRNA genes in adipose and muscle tissues. Our study showed that the methylation level of lincRNA genes was higher than that of mRNA genes, with similar trends observed in comparisons of the promoter, exon or intron regions. Different methylation pattern were observed across the transcription start sites (TSS) of lincRNA and protein-coding genes. Furthermore, an overlap was observed between many lincRNA genes and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified among different breeds of pigs, which show different fat contents, sexes and anatomic locations of tissues. We identify a lincRNA gene, linc-sscg3623, that displayed differential methylation levels in backfat between Min and Large White pigs at 60 and 120 days of age. We found that a demethylation process occurred between days 150 and 180 in the Min and Large White pigs, which was followed by remethylation between days 180 and 210. These results contribute to our understanding of the domestication of domestic animals and identify lincRNA genes involved in adipogenesis and muscle development.

S. furcifera overwinters in low-altitude basins and valleys in southern Yunnan and migrates northward in spring and summer of the following year, causing serious damage during migration. The overwintering distribution, areas, and spatial pattern of S. furcifera are relevant to the migration and outbreak of this pest. Based on a 4-yr field survey (2010-2013), this study projected areas suitable for S. furcifera to overwinter using a species distribution model, and analyzed the key influencing climatic factors using principal component analysis (PCA) and ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA). Our field survey showed that the northern latitudinal-and upper elevation limits of overwintering S. furcifera was 25.4 degrees N and 1,608 m in western Yunnan and 24.2 degrees N and 1,563 m in eastern Yunnan. The species distribution model produced a fragmented distribution pattern, with most of which in western Yunnan and only a few in eastern Yunnan. The PCA and ENFA analyses showed that the mean temperature of the driest quarter and the precipitation of the coldest quarter significantly influenced the distribution of S. furcifera in winter. The results suggested that the complex topography, spatial differences in winter temperatures, and host availability altogether determined the distribution of overwintering S. furcifera. Compared with previous surveys, the northern latitudinal- and upper elevation limits of overwintering S. furcifera were higher, while the population became rarer in some suitable areas due to change of farmland utilization in winter and possibly climate change.

A combination of genetic manipulation and chemical analyses was applied to characterize the function of one polyketide synthase (PKS) gene AOL_s00215g283 in A. oligospora, which was putatively involved in the production of 6-methylsalicylic acid. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the disruption of the PM gene not only led to the total loss of the arthrosporol A but also resulted in significant reduction in the production of secondary metabolites in the cultural broth of the mutant Delta AOL_s0021Sg283 strain. Interestingly, the mutant strain displayed significant increases in the trap formation and the nematicidal activity by 10 and 2 times, respectively, higher than the wild-type strain. These findings revealed a pathogenicity-related biosynthetic gene of this agriculturally important biological agent and have implications for establishment of efficient fungal biocontrol agents.

The intrinsic hollow nanostructure can shorten the lengths for both ionic and electronic transport, enlarge the electrode surface areas, and improving accommodation of the anode volume change during Li insertion/extraction cycling. The hybrid multi-elements in this material allow the volume change to take place in a stepwise manner during electrochemical cycling. In particular, the coating of TiO2 onto SnO2 can enhance the electronic conductivity of hollow SnO2 electrode. As a result, the as-prepared SnO2@TiO2 nanocapsule electrode exhibits a stably reversible capacity of 770 mA hg(-1) at 1C, and the capacity retention can keep over 96.1% after 200 cycles even at high current rates. This approach may shed light on a new avenue for the fast synthesis of hierarchical hollow nanocapsule functional materials for energy storage, catalyst and other new applications.

Low-dimensional representations of visual features are computed via spectral embedding, regularized by the pairwise relationship of poses for simultaneously preserving the locality in the feature space and taking account of similarities in the pose space. To deal with the "out-of-sample" problem, we obtain a global linear projection from the embedding whereby the Euclidean distances between transformed feature vectors can faithfully reflect the corresponding pose distances. To retrieve the most similar candidate from the exemplar database, weighted sum of Euclidean distances of features is employed to achieve better accuracy instead of simply summing up the squared distances of all feature types. The experimental results on HumanEva dataset validate the efficacy of our proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies demonstrated that AnxA2 also functions in immunity against infection, but the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Using a mouse infection model, we reveal a crucial role for AnxA2 in host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as anxa2(-/-) mice manifested severe lung injury, systemic dissemination, and increased mortality compared with wild-type littermates. In addition, anxa2(-/-) mice exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and IFN-gamma), decreased bacterial clearance by macrophages, and increased superoxide release in the lung. We further identified an unexpected molecular interaction between AnxA2 and Fam13A, which activated Rho GTPase. P. aeruginosa infection induced autophagosome formation by inhibiting Akt1 and mTOR. Our results indicate that AnxA2 regulates autophagy, thereby contributing to host immunity against bacteria through the Akt1-mTOR-ULK1/2 signaling pathway.

Unlike previous work on global modeling, the local-variation based neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) provides stable and reliable description of the data characteristics. Taking such latent variables obtained by NPE as the input feature for data regression, NPRE is employed to construct soft sensor model and applied to industrial case to estimate some product qualities or key variables that are difficult to measure online. Besides, considering the nonlinear relation between the process data, the kernel extension of NPRE is also proposed. Two case studies on a fermentation process and a debutanizer column are provided to demonstrate the efficiencies of the proposed method in variable prediction. Based on the root mean square errors (RMSE) and correlation coefficient criterions, comparisons are also made with the global-based soft sensors. The results illustrate that the proposed NPRE can achieve significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy and data correlation for the nonlinear processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A modified Heston model and recycled noises are employed to describe the dynamics of stock price and capital flow in the ensemble, respectively. The mean escape times of two submarkets with a cubic nonlinearity are calculated by using numerical simulation. The results evidence that (i) there is a worst delay time or rate of capital inflow concerning the minimal stability of stock price and an optimal delay time or rate of capital outflow concerning the maximal stability of stock price when lambda <= 0 (lambda denotes strength of correlation between two Wiener processes of the stock price and the volatility); (ii) when lambda > 0, the stability of stock price is maximally enhanced by an optimal delay time or rate of capital inflow and reduced by a worst rate of capital outflow, but monotonously strengthened by delay time of capital outflow.

Based on the nonlinear diffusion shock acceleration model, we explore the emission from these two TeV sources, the particle diffusion is assumed to be different inside and outside the absorbing boundary of the particles accelerated in the SNR shock. The results indicate that (1) the GeV-TeV emission from the region of the HESS J1640-465 is produced as a result of the particle acceleration inside the SNR G338.3-0.0 and (2) the runaway cosmic-ray particles outside the SNR are interacting with the nearby dense molecular cloud (MC) at the region of the HESS J1641-463, corresponding pi(0) decay gamma-ray in proton-proton collision contribute to the TeV emission from the HESS J1641-463. Also, we investigate the possible X-ray emission in MC from the synchrotron procedure by secondary e(+/-) produced through escaped protons interaction with the MC.

J	Yang, JJ; Li, JJ; Deng, W; Cheng, C; Huang, M				Yang Jing-Jing; Li Jun-Jie; Deng Wei; Cheng Cheng; Huang Ming			Transmission mode of a single layer graphene and its performance in the detection of the vibration spectrum of gas molecular	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						graphene; transmission mode; vibration spectrum of moleculae; eigenmode analysis	SURFACE-PLASMON RESONANCE; SENSOR; BIOSENSORS	Since its successful preparation in 2004, graphene has attracted a great deal of attention, and the sensing application is an important research field. But nearly all the researches about graphene sensors focus on low frequency band, of which the mechanism is mainly dependent on the detection of charge carrier concentration and conductivity variation induced by the absorption of molecules. However, due to the fact that most of the molecules absorbed on the surface of graphene will induce the change of conductivity, this method is incapable of distinguishing different molecules. Transmission mode of a single molecular layer is studied based on Kubo formula and combined with a numerical method. The relation between transmission properties and effective mode index is analyzed, and the broadband localization capability of the waveguide mode is demonstrated. Meanwhile, the variation of the transmission intensity which is due to the interaction between the first order waveguide mode and the gas is adopted to retrieve the vibration spectrum of molecules. Taking the sensing of SO2, CO and C7H8 as examples, the effectiveness of this method is verified based on eigenmode analysis. Results show that the transmission spectrum is consistent with the variation spectrum of gas molecules; besides, in the transmission direction, the larger the interaction range, the greater the attenuation of mode transmission intensity will be. This study has provided a theoretical foundation for the realization of the detection and identification of gas moleculan fingerprints.

The obtained results revealed that the solid solution hardening and work hardening effects are both quite significant. The quenching hardness (114 HV), processing hardness (202 HV with 90% rolling), and annealing hardness (130 HV after 1 h at 800 degrees C) of the Pt-0.5Ti microalloy are 1.7, 2.0, and 2.6 times greater, respectively, than that of pure Pt. The work hardening curves of the aged microalloys were also unique in that a deformation of 20-70% produced no discernible work hardening of the microalloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chi, SM; Xie, W; Zhang, JW; Xu, SC				Chi, Shaoming; Xie, Wei; Zhang, Jiwei; Xu, Sichuan			Theoretical insight into the structural mechanism for the binding of vinblastine with tubulin	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS			English	Review						tubulin; vincristine; DFT; chemotherapy; vinblastine; molecular simulation and docking; cancer	PROTON-TRANSFER MECHANISM; PARTICLE MESH EWALD; ALPHA-BETA-TUBULIN; VINCA ALKALOIDS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; QUANTUM-MECHANICS; SCORING FUNCTION; LIGAND-BINDING; MICROTUBULE INHIBITOR; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION	Vinblastine (VLB) is one of vinca alkaloids with high cytotoxicity toward cancer cells approved for clinical use. However, because of drug resistance, toxicity, and other side effects caused from the use of VLB, new vinca alkaloids with higher cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and other good qualities need to develop. One strategy is to further study and better understand the essence why VLB possesses the high cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. In present work, by using molecular simulation, molecular docking, density functional calculation, and the crystal structure of alpha,beta-tubulin complex, we find two modes labeled in catharanthine moiety (CM) and vindoline moiety (VM) modes of VLB bound with the interface of alpha,beta-tubulin to probe the essence why VLB has the high cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. In the CM mode, nine key residues B-Ser178, B-Asp179, B-Glu183, B-Tyr210, B-Asp226, C-Lys326, C-Asp327, C-Lys336, and C-Lys352 from the alpha,beta-tubulin complex are determined as the active sites for the interaction of VLB with alpha,beta-tubulin. Some of them such as B-Ser178, B-Glu183, B-Tyr210, B-Asp226, C-Lys326, C-Asp327, and C-Lys336 are newly identified as the active sites in present work. The affinity between VLB and the active pocket within the interface of alpha,beta-tubulin is -60.8kJmol(-1) in the CM mode. In the VM mode, that is a new mode established in present paper, nine similar key residues B-Lys176, B-Ser178, B-Asp179, B-Glu183, B-Tyr210, B-Asp226, C-Lys326, C-Asp327, and C-Lys336 from the alpha,beta-tubulin complex are found as the active sites for the interaction with VLB. The difference is from one key residue C-Lys352 in the CM mode changed to the key residue B-Lys176 in the VM mode. The affinity between VLB and the active pocket within the interface of alpha,beta-tubulin is -96.3kJmol(-1) in the VM mode. Based on the results obtained in present work, and because VLB looks like two faces, composed of CM and VM both to have similar polar active groups, to interact with the active sites, we suggest double-faces sticking mechanism for the binding of VLB to the interface of alpha,beta-tubulin. The double-faces sticking mechanism can be used to qualitatively explain high cytotoxicity toward cancer cells of vinca alkaloids including vinblastine, vincristine, vindestine, and vinorelbine approved for clinical use and vinflunine still in a phase III clinical trial. Furthermore, this mechanism will be applied to develop novel vinca alkaloids with much higher cytotoxicity toward cancer cells.

We studied a water extract of dry mycelium of Penicillium chrysogenum (DMP)-induced defense responses and determined whether this extract protects tobacco from Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Transcripts of four genes - PAL, 4CL, C4H and LPO that are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the contents of phenolic compounds, scopoletin and lignin, were rapidly induced in DMP-treated BY-2 cell suspensions that were derived from Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow-2, indicating a DMP-induced resistance in BY-2 cells. Transcripts of the salicylic acid (SA)dependent gene PR-1a were rapidly induced after DMP treatment, indicating the activation of SA-dependent signaling pathway. The expression of the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene PDF1.2 suggests that DMP might induce distinct signaling pathways simultaneously. A 30B vector carrying the green fluorescent protein gene (30B: GFP) was used to monitor the replication of the virus vector in BY-2 cells and tobacco plants. The spread of the virus vector was impaired both in DMP-pretreated BY-2 cells and tobacco plants, indicating that DMP helped protect tobacco against TMV. Our data suggest that the DMP activates defense responses in tobacco BY-2 cell suspensions, including the accumulation of secondary metabolites and the expression of defense responses genes, and protects tobacco from TMV.

The two Gram-stain-positive, aerobic strains produced branched substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae, and no diffusible pigment was produced in the media tested. At maturity, spore chains were formed on aerial hyphae and all mycelium fragmented with age. Whole-cell hydrolysates of both strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and no diagnostic sugars. Their predominant menaquinones (>10 %) were MK-9(H-4), MK-9(H-6) and MK-10(H-6) for strain 10A08A(T) and MK-9(H-4), MK-9(H-6), MK-10(H-6) and MK-10(H-6) for strain 10A08B(T). The polar lipids detected from the two strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and unknown phosphoglycolipids and phospholipids. The major fatty acids (>10 %) of both strains were iso-C-(16) (: 0) and summed feature 4 (iso-C-17 : 1 I and/or anteiso-C-17 : (1) B). The genomic DNA G + C contents of strains 10A08A(T) and 10A08B(T) were 70.9 and 71.6 mol%, respectively. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, the two strains were shown to be most closely related to species of the genus Nocardiopsis. DNA DNA hybridization relatedness values of <70 % between these two isolates and their closest neighbour, Nocardiopsis terrae YIM 90022(T), and between the two strains supported the conclusion that they represent two novel species. Based on phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the two isolates belong to the genus Nocardiopsis, and the names Nocardiopsis oceani sp. nov. (type strain 10A08A(T)=DSM 45931(T)=BCRC 16951(T)) and Nocardiopsis nanhaiensis sp. nov. (type strain 10A08B(T)=CGMCC 47227(T)=BCRC 16952(T)) are proposed.

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; DEFINITION; COCCUS; MEMBER; WELLS; SOIL	A novel Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, motile, non-spore-forming coccus-shaped actinomycete, designated strain YIM 121300(T), was isolated from alkaline sediment in Yuanjiang, Yunnan province, south-west China. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain YIM 121300(T) was affiliated to the genus Kineococcus, and was closely related to Kineococcus aurantiacus IFO 15268(T) (97.3 % similarity). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to other species of the genus Kineococcus was <97 %. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The whole-cell sugars contained arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose and ribose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-2). Mycolic acids were not detected. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unknown phospholipid. The predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C-15 : 0 and anteiso-C-15 : (1) A. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 75.1 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness (55 +/- 4 % to K. aurantiacus IFO 15268(T)) and differential phenotypic data demonstrated that strain YIM 121300(T) was distinguished from all related species of the genus Kineococcus. On the basis of data from the present polyphasic study, the organism should be assigned to a novel species of the genus Kineococcus, for which the name Kineococcus gypseus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 121300(T) (=CCTCC AA 2013232(T)=DSM 27627(T)).

Methods: A total of 973 (427 buffaloes, 154 sheep and 392 goats) serum samples were collected from seven administrative regions of Yunnan Province, and examined for T. gondii antibodies by indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test. Some risk factors related to species, age, gender and geographical origin were determined using a multinomial logistic regression. Results: The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii in ruminant species was estimated at 11.9%. The final logistic regression model demonstrated that host species and geographical origin were the main risk factors associated with T. gondii infection (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Taken together, the results of the present study revealed a high exposure to T. gondii in ruminant species in Yunnan Province, which has an important implication for public health.

The classic method of synthesizing chiral propargylamines involves the asymmetric alkynylation of imines. Here, we report a significant advance in the catalytic asymmetric Mannich-type synthesis of propargylamines through catalytic asymmetric addition of carbon nucleophiles to C-alkynyl imines, culminating in a highly syn-selective catalytic asymmetric Mannich reaction of C-alkynyl imines that provide syn-configured propargylamines with two adjacent stereogenic centres and a transition metal-free organocatalytic asymmetric approach to beta-alkynyl-beta-amino acids with high efficiency and practicality, via a chiral Bronsted base-catalysed asymmetric Mannich-type reaction of in situ generated challenging N-Boc C-alkynyl imines from previously unreported C-alkynyl N-Boc-N,O-acetals, with alpha-substituted beta-keto esters and less-acidic malonate (thio)esters as nucleophiles, respectively. A catalytic activation strategy is also disclosed, which may have broad implications for use in catalysis and synthesis.

(Pinaceae), is described on the basis of lignified fossil wood from the late Miocene of the Xianfeng Basin, central Yunnan, southwestern China. Detailed observation of the fossil wood specimens show the following characteristics: distinct growth rings, absence of resin canals, uniseriate bordered pits in the radial wall of tracheids, ray tracheids and piceoid and cupressoid cross-field pits. These features indicate similarities to the wood of extant Tsuga canadensis, T. chinensis, and T. dumosa. According to the fossil record, Tsuga was present in Xundian County during the Miocene. Today Tsuga is drought intolerant, preferring wet conditions with no extant species growing naturally in Xundian County. The presence of Tsuga in the Miocene of Xundian County indicates a humid climate consistent with previous palaeoclimatic reconstructions showing a wetter and probably shorter dry season in the Miocene, relative to the present day. Therefore, the change in the local climate such as increasing aridity through the Miocene might explain the local extinction of Tsuga from central Yunnan.

We name these electromagnetic modes coupled graphene plasmon polaritons (CGPPs). It is found that the properties of the CGPPs can be tuned by the geometry of the heterostructure, the material used to fill the holes, and the electron density in graphene. Most interestingly, we show that it is possible to achieve CGPPs with about 10 times enhancement of wave localization or about 300 times enhancement of propagation length, compared to usual GPs through varying device parameters. These features can be applied to tunable terahertz and infrared plasmonic devices.

Effectiveness of China's National Forest Protection Program and nature reserves	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						avoided deforestation; biodiversity conservation; covariate matching; governance; MOD13Q1; national parks; protected areas	LAND-COVER; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; AREAS; DEFORESTATION; 21ST-CENTURY; DEGRADATION; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY	There is profound interest in knowing the degree to which China's institutions are capable of protecting its natural forests and biodiversity in the face of economic and political change. China's 2 most important forest-protection policies are its National Forest Protection Program (NFPP) and its national-level nature reserves (NNRs). The NFPP was implemented in 2000 in response to deforestation-caused flooding. We undertook the first national, quantitative assessment of the NFPP and NNRs to examine whether the NFPP achieved its deforestation-reduction target and whether the NNRs deter deforestation altogether. We used MODIS data to estimate forest cover and loss across mainland China (2000-2010). We also assembled the first-ever polygon dataset for China's forested NNRs (n = 237, 74,030 km(2) in 2000) and used both conventional and covariate-matching approaches to compare deforestation rates inside and outside NNRs (2000-2010). In 2000, 1.765 million km(2) or 18.7% of mainland China was forested (12.3% with canopy cover of >= 70%)) or woodland (6.4% with canopy cover <70% and tree plus shrub cover >= 40%). By 2010, 480,203 km(2) of forest and woodland had been lost, an annual deforestation rate of 2.7%. Forest-only loss was 127,473 km(2) (1.05% annually). In the NFPP provinces, the forest-only loss rate was 0.62%, which was 3.3 times lower than in the non-NFPP provinces. Moreover, the Landsat data suggest that these loss rates are overestimates due to large MODIS pixel size. Thus, China appears to have achieved, and even exceeded, its target of reducing deforestation to 1.1% annually in the NFPP provinces. About two-thirds of China's NNRs were effective in protecting forest cover (prevented loss 4073 km(2) unmatched approach; 3148 km(2) matched approach), and within-NNR deforestation rates were higher in provinces with higher overall deforestation. Our results indicate that China's existing institutions can protect domestic forest cover.

Heterogeneity of clonal patterns among patches of kudzu, Pueraria montana var. lobata, an invasive plant	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						Clonal diversity; clonal structure; colonization; dispersal; founder effects; invasion ecology; kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata); vines	DECODON-VERTICILLATUS LYTHRACEAE; SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; UNITED-STATES; POPULATION; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; SYSTEMS; SPREAD	Background and Aims Viny species are among the most serious invasive plants, and better knowledge of how vines grow to dominate landscapes is needed. Patches may contain a single genotype (i.e. genet), a competitively dominant genet or many independent but interacting genets, yet the clonal structure of vining species is often not apparent. Molecular markers can discriminate among the genetic identities of entwined vines to reveal the number and spatial distribution of genets. This study investigated how genets are spatially distributed within and among discrete patches of the invasive vine kudzu, Pueraria montana var. lobata, in the United States. It was expected that ramets of genets would be spatially clustered within patches, and that an increase in the number of genets within a patch would be associated with a decrease in the average size of each genet. Methods Six discrete kudzu patches were sampled across 2 years, and 1257 samples were genotyped at 21 polymorphic allozyme loci. Variation in genotypic and genetic diversity among patches was quantified and patterns of genet interdigitation were analysed. Key Results Substantial genotypic and genetic variation occurred within and among patches. As few as ten overlapping genets spanned up to 68 m(2) in one patch, while >90 % of samples were genetically unique in another patch. Genotypic diversity within patches increased as mean clone size decreased, although spatially widespread genets did not preclude interdigitation. Eight genets were shared across >= 2 patches, suggesting that vegetative dispersal can occur among patches. Conclusions Genetically unique kudzu vines are highly interdigitated. Multiple vegetative propagules have become established in spatially discrete patches, probably through the movement of highway construction or maintenance machinery. The results suggest that common methods for controlling invasive vines (e.g. mowing) may inadvertently increase genotypic diversity. Thus, understanding vine architecture and growth has practical implications.	[Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hamrick, J.

Results indicate that both the light rain amount and the number of light rain days decline distinctly, with trends of -4.89 mm (10 year)(-1) and -2.48 days (10 year)(-1), respectively. The first two principal components of EOF analysis on light rain days not only show a long-term decrease, but also depict regional differences; specifically, light rain days decline more distinctly in northeastern and southern regions of eastern China. Spatial and temporal features, as well as the periods derived from the EOF analysis of temperature, precipitable water content, and relative humidity in the lower troposphere, coincide with those of light rain days. Composite analysis also suggests that there are fewer light rain days in years with lower relative humidity and precipitable water content in the lower troposphere, while there are fewer light rain days in years with higher tropospheric temperatures. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and the relative humidity equations, relative humidity over eastern China during the period studied decreases by 5.5 % due to lower-tropospheric warming, and decreases by 0.16 % because of the decrease in specific humidity in the same period. Both warming and water vapor content are the reasons for light rain reduction, and warming is deemed the primary cause.

The influences of several variables on phenol extraction were investigated, including equilibrium time, pH value, temperature, and salts in the aqueous phase. It was found the BSO dissolved in kerosene was an effective extractant for the recovery of phenol from an aqueous solution at pH=2. The transfer mechanism of phenol into the organic phase was proved to be the solvation reaction by BSO through hydrogen bonds as a phenol: BSO 1:1 complex. The temperature variation tests showed that the extraction process is exothermic, and phenol extraction efficiency decreased with increased reaction temperature. Phenol could be efficiently stripped from the loaded organic phase with a sodium hydroxide solution. The results obtained establish that the BSO/kerosene system has potential for practical applications in the recovery of phenol from aqueous solutions.

Five different soils, including black soil (BLA), cinnamon soil (CIN), cultivated loessial soil (CUL), castanozems, and brown soil (BRO), were collected to test the sorption-desorption properties of oxytetracycline (OTC). Molecular properties of TC, chlortetracycline (CTC), and OTC were acquired by quantum chemistry calculations to explain the sorption-desorption differences on CUL. Among the five soils, BLA exhibits strongest adsorption of OTC and the adsorption follows the order of BLA>CIN approximate to BRO>CUL approximate to CAS, and the hysteresis index (HI) has an opposite trend at low contamination levels. Among the TCs investigated, sorption follows the order of CTC>TC>OTC on CUL, which is determined by both molecular polarity and steric hindrance. The order of HI is OTC>TC>CTC on CUL. It was found that CUL is most sensitive to TCs' contamination among the five soils and OTC is most labile to induce environment hazards considering its lower K-d than CTC and TC. This work will help researchers in identifying the most sensitive soil to TCs' contamination, the most dangerous compound among TCs, and the origin of sorption difference, and thus to ameliorate or avoid potential environment hazards of TCs.

However, counterfeits and mimics of DCXC are frequently found in markets. In the present study, we examined the potential of quadrupole titne-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) coupled with ultrafast liquid chromatography (UFLC) for use in the authentication of DCXC. Metabolite fingerprinting was obtained and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. Discrimination of genuine DCXC, its counterfeits, cultured mycelia, and mimics was carried out by principal component analysis-discriminant analysis (PCA-DA). Furthermore, 18 characteristic markers efficiently distinguishing DCXC and its adulterants were selected by creation of profile plots displaying the abundances of markers. Determination of molecular formulae and tentative identification of marker compounds were conducted using elemental formula calculation and online database searches based on accurate MS mass and MS/MS fragmentation information. These results suggested that UFLC-QTOF-based metabolomics has great potential for the rapid detection of DCXC adulteration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By dropping the differentiability assumption, we substitute gradients with subgradients obtained from KKT conditions, and use the outer approximation method to reformulate convex MINLP as one equivalent MILP master program. By solving a finite sequence of subproblems and relaxed MILP problems, we establish an outer approximation algorithm to find the optimal solution of this convex MINLP. The convergence of this algorithm is also presented. The work of this paper generalizes and extends the outer approximation method in the sense of dealing with convex MINLPs from differentiable case to non-differentiable one.

The structure and morphology of the as-prepared nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM. It was indicated that NiO nanoparticles with size of 10-30 nm were tightly decorated on the MWCNTs. A chemoresistive gas sensor using NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite as sensitive material was fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. The gas-sensing properties of NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite were evaluated for volatile organic compound vapors (VOCs). The electrical resistance is found to be dramatically decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to a sensor based on NiO nanoparticles free MWCNTs. The highest response values of the nanocomposite were obtained at operating temperature of 180 A degrees C. NiO/MWCNTs sensor shows much better performance compared to the NiO sensor and the VOCs responses are found to be several times higher than that of a NiO nanoparticles sensor.

In this article, Ca2+ and CaM activated the activity of cysteine desulfhydrase (L-DES), followed by inducing endogenous H2S accumulation in tobacco suspension cultured cells, while treatment with Ca2+ chelator ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethylether)-N, N,N' ,N'-tetraacetic acid and CaM antagonists chlorpromazine lowered L-DES activity and H2S accumulation. Interestingly, Ca2+ - and CaM-activated L-DES activity and endogenous H2S accumulation were eliminated by H2S synthesis inhibitors DL-propargylglycine (PAG), aminooxy acetic acid (AOA), potassium pyruvate (PP) and hydroxylamine (HA), and the H2S scavenger hypotaurine (HT), indicating that Ca2+ and CaM regulated endogenous H2S generation via activating L-DES activity in tobacco cells. Furthermore, H2S donor NaHS, Ca2+ and CaM treatment alone significantly improved the thermotolerance of tobacco cells, and heat tolerance induced by Ca2+ and CaM was enhanced by exogenous NaHS, while weakened by PAG, AOA, PP, HA or HT. All above-mentioned results suggest that endogenous H2S generated by L-DES was involved, at least partly, in the thermotolerance induced by Ca2+ and CaM in tobacco suspension cell cultures.

In total, 241 sequences were assigned to 22 distinct haplotypes. Haplotype diversity in Nigeria was 0.693 +/- 0.022. The network grouped most matrilines into two main haplogroups: A and B. There was an absence of a geographic signal, and two haplotypes dominated across all locations with the exception of the Kebbi population in the northwest of the country; AMOVA also confirmed this observation (FST = 0.035). The low genetic diversity may be a result of recent domestication, whereas the lack of maternal genetic structure likely suggests the extensive genetic intermixing within the country. Additionally, the differentiation of the Kebbi population may be due to a certain demographic history and/or artificial selection that shaped its haplotype profile. The current data do not permit us to make further conclusions; therefore, more research evidence from genetics and archaeology is still required.

MSAP-based analysis of DNA methylation diversity in tobacco exposed to different environments and at different development phases	BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Development phase; DNA methylation; Environmental impacts; Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP); Tobacco	SENSITIVE AMPLIFICATION POLYMORPHISM; CYTOSINE METHYLATION; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; PATTERNS; STRESS; GENOME; PLANTS; INHERITANCE; PHENOTYPES; DROUGHT	The DNA methylation phenomenon, which plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, exists in most eukaryotes. In this study, we employed methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technology to investigate the extent and patterns of methylation in tobacco planted in five different areas of Dali County, Yunnan Province. All of the samples were collected during the vegetative and reproductive growth phases. The data obtained from the MSAP analysis showed that full-methylation and non-methylation modifications were predominant and that the hemi-methylation modification ratio was markedly lower. The PCA and UPGMA analysis results indicated that the samples collected from different areas during the vegetative and reproductive growth phases exhibit certain differences: development had a more significant impact on the methylation diversity than environmental factors, although the samples collected at the same growth stages showed that the geographical environment may also affect the methylation status. The sequencing and BLASTn analyses indicated that most of the bands that showed significant polymorphisms are highly homologous to some methylation-sensitive-related sequences discovered in tobacco or other plant species and that many of these sequences are closely related to growth regulation or environmental factors.

The chemical structure, chemical compatibility, element composition, crystalline structure, thermal properties and thermal stability of LA/diatomite composite were extensively investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis. FTIR and XRD results indicate that there are only physical interactions between LA and diatomite in LA/diatomite composite. The decrease of XRD intensity of composite PCM confirms the reduction of the crystalline size of LA in LA/diatomite composite. The melting and freezing temperatures of composite PCM are 40.9 degrees C and 38.7 degrees C respectively. The latent heat of composite PCM is 57.2 J/g. LA/diatomite composite does not decompose when the surrounding temperature is lower than 157 degrees C, indicating that the composite PCM has a good thermal stability.

J	Fan, H; He, DM				Fan, Hui; He, Daming			Temperature and Precipitation Variability and Its Effects on Streamflow in the Upstream Regions of the Lancang-Mekong and Nu-Salween Rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Asia; Rivers; Streamflow; Surface observations; Interannual variability; Trends	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; WATER AVAILABILITY; FIELD SIGNIFICANCE; DISCHARGE; RUNOFF; TRENDS; IMPACT; SENSITIVITY; HYDROLOGY	Hydrological regimes of alpine rivers are highly sensitive to climate variability/change. Temperature and precipitation variability and its effects on streamflow in the upstream regions of the Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) and Nu-Salween River (NSR) are examined in this study based on long-term observational data from 16 meteorological stations and 2 hydrological stations between the 1950s and 2010. This study employs the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test, together with the trend-free prewhitening (TFPW) approach to test trends and the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method to detect abrupt changes in the hydrometeorological time series. The relations between air temperature, precipitation, and streamflow trends are assessed using random forest regression. The results show significant climate warming and related prevalent positive precipitation trends both at the annual and seasonal scale. A substantial precipitation increase paralleling climate warming, especially in spring, was also observed. However, no consistent abrupt change in meteorological time series was found. The increasing trends of streamflow with climate warming are seen both for the outlets of the LMR and NSR upstream regions, with the abrupt changes occurring in the mid-1960s and the late 1990s, respectively. The relation of streamflow to annual and wet season precipitation is pronounced, especially for the upstream region of the LMR with a percent variance explained of more than 65%. However, the relatively minor linkage of streamflow to air temperature and dry season precipitation may be confounded by the climate warming-driven changes in snowpack, permafrost, glacier, and evapotranspiration. These results could provide further a reference for the regional water resources management under climate change scenarios.

The benz[a]anthracene scaffold is biosynthesized by type II polyketide synthases that catalyze the decarboxylative condensation of a short acyl-CoA starter and nine extender units. Angucyclines and angucyclinones, the largest group of polycyclic aromatic polyketides, achieve structural diversity via subsequent oxidation, ring cleavage, amino acid incorporation, and glycosylation. We here report the discovery of 14 angucyclinones and two angucyclines (1-16) from Streptomyces sp. CB01913, identifying 12 new compounds featuring various oxidations on rings A and C (1, 2, and 4), different sugar moieties attached to rings A and B (3 and 6), and C-ring cleavage (5 and 10-14) and expansion (8). These new structural features, highlighted by C-ring cleavage and expansion, enrich the structural diversity of angucyclines and angucyclinones. All compounds were tested for cytotoxicity and antibacterial activities, with 1, 5, 15, and 16 showing moderate activities against selected cancer cell lines or bacterial strains.

J	Hui, PH; Tang, JP; Wang, SY; Wu, J				Hui, Pinhong; Tang, Jianping; Wang, Shuyu; Wu, Jian			Sensitivity of simulated extreme precipitation and temperature to convective parameterization using RegCM3 in China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; SUMMER MONSOON PRECIPITATION; EAST-ASIA; TRENDS; SCHEME; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL; INDEXES; EUROPE; AUSTRALIA	In this study, the regional climate model of RegCM3 is applied to investigate the sensitivity of regional climate over China using four cumulus parameterizations, the modified Anthes-Kuo (AK), the Grell with Arakawa-Schubert closure, the Grell with Fritsch-Chappell closure, and the MIT-Emanuel (EM). The model was integrated over the period of 1982 to 2001 using the NCEP Reanalysis data NNRP2 as boundary conditions. RegCM3 coupled with various cumulus parameterizations is evaluated firstly as for its ability to represent regional climatology and climate extreme indices, and the results show that simulated regional climate in China is sensitive to the option of cumulus parameterizations. All the cumulus schemes produce a northward expansion of heavy rain area and an underestimation of surface air temperature. For precipitation, the AK scheme simulates relatively better magnitude, while the EM scheme has more reliable performance on the spatial distribution. RegCM3 can represent the spatial distributions of extreme indices for both precipitation and temperature, as well as their decadal trends irrelevant to the cumulus parameterizations. However, the model underestimates the consecutive dry days and overestimates the three extreme wet indices, with the EM scheme giving the worst result. Slight underestimations of extreme temperature indices are detected in all cumulus parameterization scheme runs. The shapes of probability distribution functions for extreme indices are correctly produced, though the probabilities of extreme dry and warm events are underestimated.

The isolate grew at 20-35 A degrees C, pH 5-12 and with 1-30 % NaCl. The substrate mycelium is white or yellow, well developed, branched and fragments into squarish, rod-like elements. The isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as cell-wall diamino acid, and arabinose and galactose as whole-cell sugars. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and one unidentified phospholipid. Major fatty acids were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-16:1 H, C-17:1 omega 6c. The DNA G + C content was 67.7 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AFM 10111(T) belongs to the genus Amycolatopsis, and formed a distinct clade with Amycolatopsis marina CGMCC 4.3568(T) and Amycolatopsis palatopharyngis CGMCC 4.1729(T), with the sequence similarity 98.4 and 98.6 %. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between the strain AFM 10111(T) and A. marina CGMCC 4.3568(T) and A. palatopharyngis CGMCC 4.1729(T) were 46.9 +/- A 3.08 and 49.4 +/- A 1.25 %. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data indicate that strain AFM 10111(T) represents a novel species of the genus Amycolatopsis, for which the name Amycolatopsis flava sp. nov. is proposed.

NOV; GEN. NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; YUNNAN; WELLS	A novel actinobacterial strain, designated CFH S0499(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from Catba island in Halong Bay, Vietnam. The cells were observed to be Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-motile, curved rods. The strain was found to grow optimally at 28 A degrees C and pH 7.0. Growth was found to occur at 0-7 % NaCl. Chemotaxonomically, the peptidoglycan type was determined to be of the A3 alpha type, with glutamic acid, glycine, alanine and lysine as the major cell wall amino acids. The whole cell sugars were found to contain mannose, galactose, glucose, ribose and rhamnose. The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, glycolipids and two unidentified phospholipids. The major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0 and the predominant respiratory quinone as MK-9 (H-2), with a minor amount of MK-10 (H-4) and MK-8 (H-2). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 71.8 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain CFH S0499(T) should be assigned to the genus Sinomonas and is closely related to members of the species Sinomonas atrocyanea DSM 20127(T) (98.3 %), Sinomonas soli CW 59(T) (98.28 %), Sinomonas flava CW 108(T) (98.26 %), Sinomonas mesophila MPLK 26(T) (97.5 %) and Sinomonas notoginsengisoli SYP-B 575(T) (95.8 %). DNA-DNA hybridizations showed low values (49.1-54.5 %) between strain CFH S0499(T) and its four closest neighbours. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain CFH S0499(T) is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Sinomonas, for which the name Sinomonas halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed, with CFH S0499(T) as the type strain (=CCTCC AB2014300(T) = KCTC 39116(T)).

The novel isolates were observed to be Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and yellow-pigmented bacteria. The strains were found to be able to grow at 37-65 A degrees C, pH 6.0-9.0 and with a NaCl tolerance up to 1.0 % (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed these two isolates in the genus Meiothermus. They were found to be closely related to Meiothermus timidus DSM 17022(T) (98.6 % similarity), and formed a cluster with this species. The predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-8 and the major fatty acids (> 10 %) as anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-16:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 71031(T) and YIM 71039 were determined to be 64.0 and 65.4 mol%, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridizations showed low values between strains YIM 71031(T) and YIM 71039 and their closely related neighbour M. timidus DSM 17022(T).

Here, we used laboratory simulation experiments to examine the absorption/desorption behavior of As when it is affected by microbial activity. Sediment from Yangzonghai Lake, which is known to be contaminated by As, was used in this experiment, and pollution abatement was performed using ferric salt flocculants (FeCl3). In the presence of sulfides, the reductive dissolution of iron (hydr) oxides affects the behavior of As in sediment in two ways. First, the reductive dissolution of iron (hydr) oxide accelerates the desorption of As, thus releasing As(III) from the sediment, increasing the environmental risk of As. Secondly, reductive dissolution causes the system's redox conditions to continually change. When the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the system exceeds 80 mV, As is precipitated rather than desorpting. As is co-precipitated with sulfur released previously via microbially induced reductive dissolution, where sulfur precipitation is more important than reductive dissolution of iron (hydr) oxide in controlling the adsorption/desorption of As.

The results show that the LAB depth increases from 80100 km beneath southern Yunnan to 140-180 km beneath Sichuan. Most of the 410 km discontinuity is flat and at 410 km depth, with a slight depression of 10-20 km beneath the Longmenshan (LMS) Fault, the central Sichuan-Yunnan (SY) diamond-shaped block, and southeastern Yunnan. For the 660 km discontinuity, the greatest depth occurs beneath the LMS and southern Yunnan, reaching 670-680 km. The deepening of 660 km discontinuity is attributed to compositional heterogeneity within the MTZ or dynamic pressure on the discontinuity. Additionally, the Velocity of movement in the crust and upper mantle beneath SY is different In Yunnan, crustal movement is southeastward, whereas across the Red-River fault, part of the crustal motion is redirected southwest by the westward rollback of the mantle beneath Myanmar. The interaction between the asthenosphere moving northeastward from Myanmar and southeastward from Tibet near latitude 26 degrees N causes the crust and lithospheric mantle beneath southern Yunnan to have different movement directions.

But the molecular mechanism of erect panicle remains elusive. Oryza glumaepatula, with the erect panicle phenotype, is an excellent gene pool to improve Asian cultivated rice O. sativa. In this study, a backcross introgression line was derived with Dianjingyou 1, a japonica cultivar, as the recurrent parent and an accession of O. glumaepatula as the donor parent. Using BC5F2 population, a novel gene responsible for erect panicle, EP4, was mapped within a 1.5 cM region flanked by SSR markers RM253 and RM19623 on the short arm of chromosome 6, at genetic distances of 0.4 and 1.1 cM, respectively. These results are useful for marker-assisted selection of erect panicles and for further cloning of the EP4 gene, which will contribute to the dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying erect panicles in rice.

Also, the efficiency of the (Yb, N)-TiO2 as a photocatalyst for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) using visible light irradiation has been evaluated. The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS, UV-vis-DRS and PL The results show that the (Yb, N)-TiO2 photocatalyst has the anatase TiO2 crystalline phase. The TEM micrograph demonstrated that the average particle size of the sample was about 12 nm. The band-gap energy absorption edge shifted to longer wavelength as compared to commercial TiO2-P25, N-TiO2 and the Yb-TiO2 prepared by our group. Results of degradation revealed that the (Yb, N)-TiO2 has shown much more higher photocatalytic activity than that of the TiO2-P25, the N-TiO2 and the Yb-TiO2 under the visible light.

Yang et al. raised an incorrect conclusion that after treatment with FeCl3 using the flocculation method, the sediments in the Yangzonghai Lake released As in the summer. The fundamental flaws of the paper which led to the incorrect conclusion were unreasonable sampling method for determining As concentration at various water depth and the wrong lake water volume of 6.04 x 10(8) m(3) (actually 4.8 x 10(8) m(3)) for calculating inventory of As in Yangzhonghai in August 2012. Then the authors attribute the As release in summer to the high concentration of HCO3- without any support of experimental data. Meanwhile, the authors designed a microbiological experiment to illustrate that increasing capacity of anaerobic microorganism could lead to As releasing from sediments. In our view point, this microbiological experiment was nonsense for evaluating the stability of As in sediments of Yangzonghai lake since the experimental conditions were greatly different from the natural conditions. Therefore, we conclude that the conclusions put forward by YANG are incorrect (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To doubts and questions raised by Chen et al., we give further explanations and provide more relevant evidences. The water temperature stratification existed in Lake Yangzonghai in summer, and affected by which arsenic concentration with water depth was uneven and peaked in the bottom layer in summer. In the case of adding carbon source (glucose) and maintaining anerobic state, enhanced microbial activity promoted the release of arsenic from sediment to water which was observed in the laboratory experiments. Errors might exist in sampling, determination and calculation, but they would not change the main conclusions of the article. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The development of UV photodetectors has been impeded because of lacking stable p-type wide-gap semiconductor which is crucial for high-performance, low-cost, large-array UV photovoltaic detector. In this paper, we report a novel UV photovoltaic detector fabricated using 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) as a sole photoactive material. The highest detectivity (D*) reaches 9.02 x 10(11) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 at -1 V bias voltage at room temperature under 365 nm illumination for the un-optimized BCP based detector (without using pre-amplifier), which is the highest value for the sole UV organic photoactive material based photovoltaic detector. The optical, electrical, and photovoltaic properties, including the UV absorption, photoluminescence (PL) emission, PL excitation, I-V, C-V, and photoresponse, have been systematically investigated to disclose the internal mechanism. The present study paves the way for developing high-performance, low-cost UV focal plane array detectors. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Front-end electronics and data acquisition system for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						IACT; FEE; FPGA; ASIC; WFCTA		In this paper, a front-end electronics based on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is presented for the future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). To achieve this purpose, a 16-channel ASIC chip, PARISROC 2 (Photomultiplier ARray Integrated in SiGe ReaclOut Chip) is used in the analog signal processing and digitization. The digitized results are sent to the server by a user-defined User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) hardcore engine through Ethernet that is managed by a FPGA. A prototype electronics fulfilling the requirements of the Wide Field of View Cherenkov Telescope Array (WFCTA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project has been designed, fabricated and tested to prove the concept of the design. A detailed description of the development with the results of the test measurements are presented. By using a new input structure and a new configuration of the ASIC, the dynamic range of the circuit is extended. A highly precise time calibrating algorithm is also proposed, verified and optimized for the mass production. The test results suggest that the proposed electronics design fulfills the general specification of the future IACTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chen, Y.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, CV, and galvanostatical method. The results show that the unique hollow structures can shorten the distance Li-ion diffusion, and the hollow structure offers a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. The as-obtained hollow core-shell MoO3-SnO2 hybrid electrodes can retain a discharge capacity of 865 mAh/g at current density of 50 mA/g after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Even at the current density of 1000 mA/g, the MoO3-SnO2 hybrid electrodes can still deliver a high reversible discharge capacity of 545 mAh/g. Therefore, the hollow MoO3-SnO2 hybrid electrode exhibits stable cyclability and good rate capability. This method is simple, low cost and mass-productive, and may also be used to prepare other advanced functional materials.

We discuss some properties of this new concept and illustrate several examples. Specially, we establish a basic decomposition theorem of time scales which provides bridges between periodic time scales and an arbitrary time scale with a bounded graininess function mu. Based on this result, we introduce local-almost periodic and local-almost automorphic functions on changing-periodic time scales and study some related properties. The concept of changing-periodic time scales introduced in this paper will help in understanding and removing the serious deficiency which arises in the study of classical functions on time scales.

It is found that a mixture of glycine and ethylene glycol (EG) (1:1) is much more favorable than individual fuel for the fabrication of CuO. All as-synthesized products are surfactant indispensable monoclinic CuO phase. The CuO synthesized without any surfactant is foam network, however, it evolves into basic flake-like morphology with different pores and assembling microstructures in the presence of surfactant. We believe that the different distributions of anions and cations originated from the effect of surfactant lead to the variations of CuO morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The microstructure and magnetic properties of the samples at low temperature were investigated. Both structural and magnetic properties of the films were shown to be influenced by the substrate. Specifically, the film deposited on the GaAs exhibited a strong preferred orientation along the (1 0 0) plane, while the film deposited on Si exhibited higher saturation magnetization (Ms) and lower coercivity (Hc). The results suggest that the coercivity is probably related to the intrinsic stress and that Ms increases whereas Hc decreases with decreasing lattice mismatch. The Mr/Ms ratio decreased with decreasing temperature due to the effect of the thermal disturbance on the magnetization.

Qi (2005) [18] and C.Q. Li, Y.T. Li, X. Kong (2014) [12]. In addition, we study the eigenvalues lying on the boundary of the eigenvalue inclusion set provided by Qi (2005) for weakly irreducible tensors. As applications, we give new bounds for the spectral radius of nonnegative tensors, some sufficient conditions for a tensor to be a strong M-tensor and some inequalities to identify the positive definiteness for an even-order real supersymmetric tensor.

Myricetin and rutin are considered two of the most bioactive flavonoids, which have been proved to exhibit various physiological functions. This work reports a simple and facile approach for the synthesis of beta-cyclodextrin-gold@3, 4, 9, 10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid functionalized single-walled carbon nanohorns (beta-CD-Au@PTCA-SWCNHs) nanohybrids. The simultaneous electrochemical determination of myricetin and rutin using a beta-CD-Au@PTCA-SWCNHs-modified glassy carbon electrode was established. The results show that the beta-CD-Au@PTCA-SWCNHs-modified electrode displayed electrochemical signal superior to those of Au@PTCA-SWCNHs and SWCNHs towards myricetin and rutin. The proposed modified electrode has a linear response range of 0.01-10.00 mu M both for myricetin and rutin with relatively low detection limits of 0.0038 mu M for myricetin and 0.0044 mu M (S/N = 3) for rutin, respectively. The excellent performance of the sensing platform is considered to be the synergic effects of the SWCNHs (e.g. their good electrochemical properties and large surface area) and beta-CD (e.g. a hydrophilic external surface, a high supramolecular recognition, and a good enrichment capability).

Our result shows that there is a novel avenue in which dark matter is produced thermally and has a weak freezing-out process; this is in addition to two previously known cases, the case with thermal production and strong freezing out case and the case with nonthermal production and weak freezing out, in which the relic abundance of dark matter is inverse and proportional to its cross section, respectively. We calculated the relic abundance of dark matter for this new case and find that it is independent of its cross section. We also present the cosmological constraints on the cross section and mass relation of dark matter for this new case by utilizing the observational data of the matter-energy density fraction.

Due to its large distance (11.1(-0.7)(+0.9) kpc), the kinematics inside and between the dense molecular clumps in W49N are far from well-understood. The Submillimeter Array observations resolved the continuum emission into two clumps. The molecular line observation of SO2 (28(4,24)-28(3,25)) suggests that the two clumps have a velocity difference of similar to 7 km s(-1). The eastern clump is very close to two radio sources "G1" and "G2," and the western clump coincides with a radio source "B." The HCN (3-2) line reveals an extremely energetic outflow, which is among the most energetic molecular outflows in the Milky Way. This is the first report of high-velocity molecular outflow detection in W49N. The outflow jet might be in precession, which could account for the distribution, velocity, and rotation of water maser spots. Three absorption systems are identified in HCO+ (3-2) spectra. The absorption features are blueshifted with respect to the emission of SO2 (28(4,24)-28(3,25)) lines, indicating that a cold layer is expanding in front of the warm gas. Further analysis indicates that the expansion is decelerated from the geometric expansion centers.

Complete condition for nonzero quantum correlation in continuous variable systems	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						quantum correlation; continuous variables; quantum circuits	DISCORD	Quantum correlation provides a promising measure beyond entanglement. Here, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero quantum correlation in continuous variable systems, which is simple and easy to perform in terms of a marker Q(r). In order to get this condition, we introduce continuous-variable local orthogonal bases of the operator space, which are generalized from the orthogonal basis sets in local operator space for discrete variables. Based on this, we obtain the marker Q(r) for all bipartite continuous variable states, and provide several examples including two-mode Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Our result may provide a candidate for quantum correlation measures, and can be measured by designed quantum circuits.

The unique hollow nanocage structures shorten the length of Li-ion diffusion. The hollow structure offers a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Besides, the hybrid elements allow the volume change to take place in a stepwise manner during electrochemical cycle. And thus, the hierarchical hollow NiFe2O4 nanocage electrode exhibits extraordinary electrochemical performance. The stable cyclic performance is obtained for all rates from 1 C to 10 C. Even when the current reaches 10 C, the capacity can also arrive at 652 mAhg(-1). Subsequently, a specific capacity of ca. 975 mAhg(-1) is recovered when the current rate reduces back to 1 C after 200 cycles. This strategy that derived from NMOFs may shed light on a new route for large-scale synthesis of hollow porous hybrid nanocages for energy storage, environmental remediation and other novel applications.

J	Sun, LC; Meng, WD; Pu, XY				Sun, Licun; Meng, Weidong; Pu, Xiaoyun			New method to measure liquid diffusivity by analyzing an instantaneous diffusion image	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS; BINARY	A novel optical method was applied to measure the binary liquid diffusion coefficient (D) quickly. Equipped with an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens (ALCL), the spatially resolving ability of the ALCL in measuring refractive index of liquid was utilized to obtain the gradient distribution of the liquid concentration along diffusive direction. Based on Fick's second law, the D value was then calculated by analyzing diffusion images. It was worth mentioning that only one instantaneous diffusive image was required to measure D value by the method, reducing the measurement time greatly from several hours in traditional methods to a few seconds. The diffusion coefficients of ethylene glycol diffusing in pure water, at temperatures from 288.15 to 308.15 K, were measured by analyzing instantaneous diffusion images, the results were consistent well with the values measured by using holographic interferometry and Taylor dispersion methods. The method is characterized by faster measurement, direct observation of diffusive process, and easy operation, which provides a new method in measuring diffusion coefficient of liquids rapidly.

Its solutions are Bessel functions, and may form the double helical structure of DNA in three dimensional spaces. From this model we may predict the discrete bound energy spectrum of DNA. Moreover, we discuss some solutions of quantum mechanics and their meaning. Further, we research the entangled state of neurobiology by the extensive quantum method and the nonlinear theory. New experiments shown that the quantum entangled state should be a new fifth interaction, for its verification neuroscience will possibly take a very important role.

In addition, the morphologies of materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the presence of fluorine ion posed a serious threat for Ti-6Al-4V alloy in artificial saliva. Obvious increase in OCP was observed in solutions with fluorine ion compared with that without fluorine ion. The presence of fluorine ion was also associated with decreases in R-ct and increase in i(corr) values, indicating the corrosion rate was clearly accelerated in the presence of fluorine ion. And it is clear that the corrosion increased with increasing the concentration of fluorine ion. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that pitting occurred on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy after immersion in artificial saliva containing fluorine ion. The Ti-F complex was suggested as the viable pitting corrosion mechanism.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NEAU-Jh2-17(T) showed highest similarity to those of Streptomonospora nanhaiensis 12A09(T) (99.26 %), Nocardiopsis rosea YIM 90094(T) (97.31 d/o), Streptomonospora halophila YIM 91355(T) (97.24 %) and Streptomonospora arabica S186(T) (97.02 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that strain NEAU-Jh2-17(T) fell within a cluster consisting of the type strains of species of the genus Streptomonospora and formed a stable clade with S. nanhaiensis 12A09(T) in trees generated with two algorithms. Key morphological and chemotaxonomic properties also confirmed the affiliation of strain NEAU-Jh2-17(T) to the genus Streptomonospora. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, ribose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM), two unknown phospholipids (PLs) and two unknown glycolipids (GLs). The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H-2), MK-10(H-8), MK-10(H-6) and MK-10(H-4). Major fatty acids were C-18 : 0 10-methyl, anteiso-C-17 : 0, C-16 :0 10-methyl, iso-C-15 :0, C-17 : 0 10-methyl and C-18 : 0. The DNA G +C content was 71.82 mol%. However, a combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and some phenotypic characteristics demonstrated that strain NEAU-Jh2-17(T) could be distinguished from its closely related relatives. Therefore, strain NEAU-Jh2-17(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomonospora, for which the name Streptomonospora halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-Jh2-17(T) (=CGMCC 4.7218(T)=JCM 30347(T)).

Based on their 16S rRNA sequences, these strains were identified as Pseudochrobactrum saccharolyticum, Wautersiella falsenii, Proteus hauseri, Arthrobacter nicotianae, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. The bacterial VOCs were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and subsequently identified by GC/MS analysis. The VOCs covered a wide range of aldehydes, ketones, alkyls, alcohols, alkenes, esters, alkynes, acids, ethers, as well as heterocyclic and phenolic compounds. Among the 53 VOCs identified, 19 candidates, produced by different bacteria, were selected to test their nematicidal activity (NA) against Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. The seven compounds with the highest NAs were acetophenone, S-methyl thiobutyrate, dimethyl disulfide, ethyl 3,3-dimethylacrylate, nonan-2-one, 1-methoxy-4-methylbenzene, and butyl isovalerate. Among them, S-methyl thiobutyrate showed a stronger NA than the commercial insecticide dimethyl disulfide. It was reported for the first time here that the five bacterial strains as well as S-methyl thiobutyrate, ethyl 3,3-dimethylacrylate, 1-methoxy-4-methylbenzene, and butyl isovalerate possess NA. These strains and compounds might provide new insights in the search for novel nematicides.

J	Zhou, LH; Lu, K				Zhou, Lihua; Lu, Kevin			Detecting Communities with Different Sizes for Social Network Analysis	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						social network; community detection; modularity; modularity optimization	COMPLEX NETWORKS; MODEL	Online community detection is essential for social network analysis. Modularity is a quality function used to measure the strength of the community structure discovered with social networks. Existing methods detect community structures through modularity analysis. However, the existing modularities are unable to identify community structures correctly when communities are very different in size, in particular, when the size of some communities is very small compared with others. To address this problem, we propose the concept of a coupling coefficient between two communities and define a new modularity, MC modularity, to evaluate the quality of the discovered community structures. This method can provide adequate measures for the quality of community structures. In addition, we develop the DC_MC algorithm to detect community structures based on the concept of MC modularity. An algorithm for shifting a group of nodes, instead of one node at a time, amongst communities also is designed to achieve optimal results. The effectiveness and efficacy of the approach we proposed have been demonstrated through a set of experiments involving real data benchmarks and synthetic data sets that are purpose-built for evaluating different types of networks.

Polymorphisms of angiotensin II receptor type 1 are associated with essential hypertension, but the results are inconsistent and conflicting. The aim of the present study is to assess the association between angiotensin II receptor type 1 polymorphisms and essential hypertension risk in Chinese Hani and Yi minorities. Methods: This study recruited 692 unrelated Chinese Hani subjects (case vs. control = 346:346) and 615 unrelated Chinese Yi subjects (case vs. control = 303:312). Twelve selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results: Statistical analysis indicated that the GC+CC genotype of rs387967 was significantly associated with the decreased susceptibility to essential hypertension compared with GG in a Yi population (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals 0.41-0.83, P = 0.003). Allele C was a protective allele for essential hypertension (odds ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence intervals 0.61-0.99, P = 0.040). This association was confirmed respectively by comparing systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure between different genotypes and between different alleles, which indicated that the genotype (GC+CC) had a tendency of lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure than GG (P-SBP = 3.716 x 10(-4), P-DBP = 1.187 x 10(-3)); Carriers with C had lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P-SBP = 7.301 x 10(-3), P-DBP = 9.142 x 10(-4)). Another single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2638360) was analysed in a Hani minority, then replicated in a Yi minority. The C allele showed a consistent risk trend for essential hypertension in two independent populations (Hani: odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence intervals 1.01-2.99, P = 0.046; Yi: odds ratio = 1.27, 95% confidence intervals 0.82-1.96, P = 0.277). Meta-analysis revealed that the C allele could significantly increase the risk of essential hypertension (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence intervals 1.02-2.02, P = 0.037). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that rs387967 is associated with the susceptibility to essential hypertension in a Yi population and the tendency was replicated in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure detection. Meta-analysis revealed that C allele of rs2638360 could significantly increase the risk of essential hypertension. The two single nucleotide polymorphisms maybe play a role in the pathology of essential hypertension.

The goal is to investigate into the influence of the Southern Hemispheric (SH) SST on the summer precipitation in Yunnan from January to May so as to identify the key time and marine regions. Physical mechanisms are obtained by analyzing the influence of sea level wind and the key marine regions on the precipitation during Yunnan's rain season. Results show that there is indeed significant relationship between the SST in SH and summer precipitation in Yunnan. The key areas for influencing the summer precipitation are mainly distributed in a region called "West Wind Drift" in the SH, including the Southeast Indian, southern Australia, west coast of eastern Pacific off Chile, Peru and the southwest Atlantic Magellan. Besides, the most significant marine region is the west coast of Chile and Peru (cold-current areas of the eastern Pacific). Diagnostic analysis results also showed that monsoons in the Bay of Bengal, a cross-equatorial flow in the Indian Ocean near the equator and southwest monsoon in India weaken during the warm phase of the Peruvian cold current in the eastern Pacific. Otherwise, they strengthen.

Leaf N and P of 126 plant species in 70 vegetation plots in GPES were investigated in central Yunnan, southwestern China, and leaf P fractions (i.e., inorganic vs. organic P) of the dominant species were examined. Our objectives were to improve the understanding of the role of soil N and P variability in controlling leaf N and P stoichiometry of plant communities in GPES. We found that plants in GPES had higher mean leaf P (4.07 mg/g) and lower N:P ratios (4.94) than average plant values that have been recorded in other parts of the world so far. Some fast-growing plants had extremely high leaf P (> 10 mg/g). Community leaf N and P contents increased as soil N availability increased, but soil N variability was unrelated to community leaf N:P. Instead, community leaf P and N:P ratios were primarily determined by soil P; as soil P availability increased, leaf P increased and leaf N:P significantly decreased. Greater accumulation of inorganic P relative to organic P in leaf was the direct driving factor for community leaf P and N:P ratio patterns in GPES. Although soil P availability was the main controlling factor of leaf N:P patterns, community composition could be manipulated to restore the balance of N and P stoichiometry based on the different responses across species and plant types.

J	Hu, W; Fan, ZH; Dai, BZ				Hu, Wen; Fan, Zhong-Hui; Dai, Ben-Zhong			The nature of the gamma-ray flare associated with blazar 3C 454.3	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; methods: numerical; galaxies: active; quasars: individual (3C 454.3)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SPACE-TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS; DOPPLER FACTORS; RELATIVISTIC JETS; RADIATION-FIELDS; COMPTON ANALYSIS; EMISSION-REGION; LORENTZ FACTORS; VIEWING ANGLES; XMM-NEWTON	We have studied the simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the 2009 December flare and those of the quiescent state of blazar 3C 454.3 by constructing a multi-component model. We find that all six SEDs can be explained by a one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) plus external Compton emission from an accretion disk (ECD) and that from a broad-line region (ECC). X-ray emission is dominated by the SSC mechanism, and the gamma-ray spectrum is well represented by a combination of ECD and ECC processes. Our results indicate that the energy density of the magnetic field and electrons decrease with distance from the central engine, and the Doppler factor increases with the blob moving outward in the development of the 2009 December flare. The increase in the observed flux density is possibly due to the increase in the Doppler factor of the blob. The relation between the Doppler factor delta(b) and the distance from the central black hole suggests the magnetically driven jets span a sub-pc scale, and the relation between the magnetic field B' and the dimension of the emission region R-b' is in good agreement with what is required by conservation of magnetic flux. The weak "harder-when-brighter" behavior of the gamma-ray spectrum could be a result of the increase in Doppler factor during the outward motion of the blob. The parameters during the quiescent state obviously deviate from those during the flare state. We propose that the flare was likely caused by the ejection of a new blob. The gamma-ray emissions in different states are associated with the evolution of the blob.

In this study, an antialgal compound was isolated from the cultured broth of S. jiujiangensis JXJ 0074(T) by using bioassay methods. Based on spectroscopic data, the active compound was identified as 2'-deoxyadenosine, which exhibited a greater antialgal activity against cyanobacteria than its analogues such as adenosine, guanosine, and 2'-deoxyguanosine. The antialgal activity of 2'-deoxyadenosine increased with the content and time. 2'-Deoxyadenosine severely damaged the vegetative cells of cyanobacteria, causing crumpling, collapse, expanding, perforation, breakage of filamentous cyanobacteria, and decrease of the chlorophyll. However, 2'-deoxyadenosine seemed to have less impact on the morphology of heterocysts of filamentous cyanobacteria. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the treated cells of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 initially increased with 31.14 +/- 2.00 % higher than that of the control after 36 h and then decreased quickly. On the same time, there were rapid increases in superoxide anion radical (O-2 (-)) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents with 315.53 +/- 12.81 and 84.72 +/- 6.15 % higher than these of the controls at 60 h, respectively. The intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR) content in the treated cells of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 increased by 36.34 +/- 7.35 % 1 day later, followed by a rapid decrease with a rate of 90.50 +/- 1.08 % 8 days later, while the extracellular MC-LR content showed no significant difference with the control. Five days after adding 15 mu g/ml of 2'-deoxyadenosine to the culture of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, there was no 2'-deoxyadenosine detected by HPLC, suggesting that 2'-deoxyadenosine completely degraded. This study provides a new clue to screen natural-based antialgal compounds from nucleoside analogues.

Hemichannels and gap junctions are involved in these cellular actions. Innexins (Inxs: analogous to the vertebrate connexins) form hemichannels and gap junctions, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their biology is still unclear. In this article, we reported a steady-state level of Inxs (SpliInxs) in hemocytes of Spodoptera litura, which formed nonfunctional hemichannels on the cell surface to maintain normal metabolism. We also reported that two innnexins (SpliInx2 and SpliInx3) were expressed significantly higher in hemocytes compared to other tissues, suggesting that they play important roles in hemocytes. Amino acid analysis found that two cysteine residues in two extracellular loops provided the capability for SpliInx2 and SpliInx3 hemichannels to dock into gap junctions. Western blotting demonstrated that both extracellular and intracellular loops of SpliInx3 and the extracellular loops of SpliInx2 might undergo posttranslational modification during the formation of a steady-state hemichannel. During hemichannel formation, SpliInx2 presented as one isoform, while SpliInx3 presented as three isoforms. These results provide fundamental knowledge for further study of how steady-state levels of SpliInxs are dynamically adjusted to perform cellular immune responses under immune challenge.

DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; GENUS SPHINGOMONAS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CONTAMINATED SOIL; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES	A novel Gram-staining-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped and aerobic bacterial strain, designated EGI 60015(T), was isolated from healthy roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis F. collected from Yili County, Xinjiang Province, Northwest China. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain EGI 60015(T) was found to show 97.6 % sequence similarity with Novosphingobium pentaromativorans US6-1(T). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain formed a clade with N. pentaromativorans US6-1(T) in the neighbor-joining tree. Q-10 was identified as the respiratory quinone of strain EGI 60015(T). The major fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c; 55.04 %), summed feature 4 (C-17:1 anteiso B and/or iso I; 18.34 %) and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c; 8.53 %). The polar lipids detected were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and sphingoglycolipids. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 60015(T) was determined to be 66.6 mol%. The genomic DNA relatedness value between EGI 60015(T) and N. pentaromativorans US6-1(T) (54 %) was below the 70 % limit for species identification. Based on the result of the molecular studies supported by its morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and other differentiating phenotypic characteristics, strain EGI 60015(T) was considered to represent a novel species within the genus Novosphingobium, for which the name Novosphingobium endophyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 60015(T) (=CGMCC 1.15095(T) = KCTC 42486(T) = DSM 29948(T)).

Oxygen can play a significant role in biotrickling towers. Other important factors had already been optimized prior to the study, including inlet concentration, gas flow rate, and temperature. SO2 and NOx were prepared by a chemical method. A gas flow meter was used to regulate nitrogen (N-2) that had been stored in steel cylinders. In this way, the O-2 content was adjusted in the biotrickling towers by controlling the N-2 flow rate. Five gradients of O-2 content were selected for investigation, namely 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20%. Results indicated that the SO2 removal efficiency from mixed gas (SO2 and NOx) can reach 100%, from all of the five O-2 gradients, in biotrickling towers. In a tandem twin-towers desulfurization and denitrification process system, the NOx removal efficiency and the inlet concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gradually increased as the O-2 content increased. Specifically, the average removal efficiency of NOx increased from 49.28 to 80.85% as the O-2 content changed from 4 to 20%. The oxygen levels influenced the removal of NOx but the SO2 removal efficiency in mixed gas was always stable.

Most of the existing methods employ feature classifiers and thereby contain a data training process. Moreover, some methods cannot detect urban areas in complex scenes accurately. This letter proposes an automatic urban area detection method that uses multiple features that have different resolutions. First, a down-sampled low-resolution image is used to segment the candidate area. After the corner points of the urban area are extracted, a weighted Gaussian voting matrix technique is employed to integrate the corner points into the candidate area. Then, the edge features and homogeneous region are extracted by using the original high-resolution image. Using these results as the input, the processes of guided filtering and contrast enhancement can finally detect accurately the urban areas. This method combines multiple features, such as corner, edge, and regional characteristics, to detect the urban areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better detection accuracy for urban areas than the existing algorithms.

However, investigations into this phenomenon differ greatly between plants and animals. Recent research on polyploid plants illustrates the immediate changes that follow WGDs and the mechanisms behind in both genetic and epigenetic consequences. Unfortunately, equivalent questions remain to be explored in animals. Enlightened by botanical research, the study of polyploidization in vertebrates involves the identification of model animals and the establishment of strategies. Here we review and compare the research on plants and vertebrates while considering intrageneric or intraspecific variation in genome size. Suitable research methods on recently established polyploidy systems could provide important clues for understanding what happens after WGDs in vertebrates. The approach yields insights into survival and the rarity of polyploidization in vertebrates. The species of Carassius and the allopolyploid system of goldfish x common carp hybridization appear to be suitable models for unraveling the evolution and adaptation of polyploid vertebrates.

Both strains were Gram-staining negative, aerobic, non-motile, elongated rod shaped and yellow coloured. They grew optimally at 28 A degrees C and pH 7.0. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the two strains shared 99.8 % sequence similarity to each other, but lower than 97.6 % to the other known species of the genus Flavobacterium. The predominant respiratory quinone for the two strains was MK-6, and the major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and summed Feature 3 (comprising 16:1 omega 7c and/or 16:1 omega 6c). The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified polar lipids and three unidentified amino-phospholipids. The DNA G+C contents of strains SYP-B540(T) and SYP-B556 were 33.3 and 32.7 mol%, respectively. In addition, the DNA-DNA hybridization values of strains SYP-B540(T) and SYP-B556 to their closest phylogenetic neighbors were significantly lower than 70 %. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomy studies, strains SYP-B540(T) and SYP-B556 represent a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium notoginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SYP-B540(T) (=KCTC 32505(T) = NBRC 110012(T) = BCRC 80724(T)).

The major cellar fatty acids identified were iso-C-14:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 8c and C-17:0. MK-9 (H-4) was the predominant menaquinone. The genomic DNA G+C contents were 73.4 and 74.2 mol%, respectively. These chemotaxonomic data, together with their morphological properties, were consistent with the assignment of the two strains to the genus Umezawaea. They showed highest similarities to Umezawaea tangerina JCM 10302(T) on phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences and were found to form a coherent cluster. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values of YIM 2047X(T) and YIM 2047D with U. tangerina JCM 10302(T) were 46.5 +/- 3.1 and 57.5 +/- 1.6 %, respectively; while the reassociation value between themselves was 80.4 +/- 2.3 %. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the two new isolates to be differentiated phenotypically from the recognized strain U. tangerina JCM 10302(T). On the basis of results from this polyphasic study, the strains were characterized as a novel species of the genus Umezawaea, for which the name Umezawaea endophytica sp. nov. is proposed.

In this study, we investigated allelopathic interactions between cyanobacteria and Ottelia acuminata, an endangered submerged macrophyte species in China. We tested effects of Microcystis aeruginosa on germination and seedling growth of two varieties of O. acuminata (O. acuminata var. crispa, OAC; and O. acuminata var. songmingensis, OAS) and vice versa effects of culture water of young seedlings and mature macrophytes on the growth of M. aeruginosa. We found that: (1) The culture water of mature O. acuminata (both OAC and OAS) allelopathically promoted M. aeruginosa growth, while seedlings had no effect. (2) M. aeruginosa exudates and extracts significantly promoted or inhibited seed germination of O. acuminata; (3) both exudates and extracts significantly decreased the seedling vitality of OAC and OAS. (4) M. aeruginosa exudates and extracts inhibited seedlings growth of O. acuminata, especially growth of roots and the second true leaf. (5) Allelopathic effects of M. aeruginosa exudates were stronger than those of extracts, and OAC showed stronger resistance to cyanobacteria than OAS. Our results indicate that cyanobacteria can allelopathically inhibit O. acuminata mainly by their exudates, while mature O. acuminata stimulate cyanobacteria growth. Such negative effects of cyanobacteria may contribute to the disappearance of O. acuminata and also slow down their recovery in eutrophic lakes.

The pycnoxylic wood consists of thick-walled tracheids and thin-walled rays. It is characterised by uniseriate, contiguous, compressed bordered pits on the radial walls of tracheids, and one large simple pit in each cross-field. Growth rings exhibit narrow late-wood. The mean sensitivity of analysis of 25 growth rings is 0.2, suggesting that a climate with abundant rainfall and weak seasonality could have prevailed in Yunnan, at least locally, during the Middle Jurassic. The outer portion of the wood is largely decayed, and shows poorly preserved cells lacking details. Decayed tracheids displaying various features, including removal of middle lamellae, separations of secondary walls, presence of thickened corners and appositions, are recognised as cell reactions to fungal activity. Irregularly distributed micro-cavities are formed by complete decomposition of tracheids and rays in the wood. Abundant fungal remains occurring in the wood generally consist of multiple branched hyphae. These fungal hyphae are either confined to individual cell lumens or extend through adjacent cells. Although the probable reproductive structure and typical clamp connection are very rarely observed with few septate hyphae, the affinities of these fungal hyphae are somewhat obscure. Nevertheless, our study sheds light on the palaeoecology of Middle Jurassic terrestrial ecosystems of Southwest China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The replications in other ethnic populations such as East Asians have also been conducted, but the results were inconsistent, either likely due to the limited sample size of single study or genetic heterogeneity between continental populations on this locus. Methods: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available samples from existing studies of East Asian populations, including a total of 9,432 cases and 10,661 controls, to further confirm whether CACNA1C rs1006737 is an authentic risk SNP for schizophrenia in East Asian populations. Results: Our results revealed a significant association between rs1006737 and schizophrenia (allelic model, P = 4.39 x 10(-6), pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.20), and the results were much strengthened when the European and East Asian samples were combined together (P = 2.40 x 10(-17), pooled OR = 1.12). There is no significant heterogeneity or publication bias between individual studies, and removal of any single study still remained significant associations between rs1006737 and schizophrenia. Discussion: Our results further confirmed that rs1006737 should be categorized as an authentic risk SNP for schizophrenia in the general populations.

The Curie surface is compared with the regional heat flow, Bouguer anomalies, Moho, and seismicity. The interior block has strong wide-distributed magnetic anomalies, well corresponding to the basement lithofacies. The surrounding areas have weak anomalies of various strikes and intensities. The magnetic anomaly confirms the geological finding that the Yabulai and Bayanhot Basins are small blocks detached from the northern Ordos block. The magnetic anomalies at the satellite altitude reveal that deep materials flow northward from the northeast margin of Tibet Plateau to the Qilian fold belt. The depth of Curie surface ranges from 24 to 42 km, and the Ordos block is dominated by Curie surface depth over 32 km and average heat-flow value of 44 mW/m(2). The distribution of Bouguer anomalies is consistent with that of magnetic anomalies. The well correlation between the Curie surface and the seismicity is also explained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These two novel probes displayed an instant turn-on fluorescence response specific towards Pi without interference from ATP and PPi. A selective 23-fold increase in fluorescence for 1 (in DMSO HEPES) and a 20-fold increase for 2 (in DMSO) were observed. The proposed sensing mechanism for these compounds is Pi-triggered acetamide bond cleavage leading to release of the blue fluorophore coumarin, which was supported by H-1 NMR and mass spectrometry data. Probe 1 was successfully used to image endogenous and exogenous Pi in living cells and to trace Pi released from ATP by apyrase in Caenorhabditis elegans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Further, the catalytic activities of obtained sponge-like nanoporous silver were investigated by photometrically monitoring the reduction of p-nitrophenol (4-NP) by an excess of NaBH4. The results reveal that the sponge-like silver is very promising catalytic candidate for the reduction of 4-NP because of simple preparation route and superior catalytic activity.

In the present study, colonization characteristics, diversity and cadmium tolerance of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) colonizing the roots of Nepal alders were assessed along environmental gradients in a Pb, Zn, and Cd mine tailing, southwestern China. All Nepal alder roots surveyed were conspicuously colonized by DSEs with 23.1-35.8% colonization intensity. In total, 72 culturable strains of melanized root-associated fungi were isolated from the 45 root samples. Most strains were closely related to well-known DSE fungi, such as fungi belonging to the genera Phialophora, Leptodontidium, Cladosporium, and Exophiala. DSEs from heavily metal-polluted sites showed a higher Cd2+ tolerance in vitro than those from the slightly polluted plots. These findings stressed that DSE was an integral component of the root system of Nepal alder growing in metal-contaminated soils, and it is more feasible to obtain heavy metal (HM) tolerant DSEs from mining areas than from no HM-polluted environments for their potential application in phytoremediation. We concluded with a discussion of further research for addressing the unresolved roles of DSEs in A. nepalensis restoration during the early stage of plant establishment in the freshly metal-exposed mining soils.

Effect of microscopic interface asymmetry on optical properties of short-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices	THIN SOLID FILMS			English	Article						Indium arsenide; Gallium antimonide; Type-II band alignment; Superlattices; Interface asymmetry; Polarization; Absorption coefficients	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; BAND-STRUCTURE; TRANSITION; DETECTORS	We theoretically investigate the effect of microscopic interface asymmetry (MIA) on the optical properties of short-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices (SLs) which can serve for the mid-infrared (mid-IR) detection. To calculate the band structures of such SLs, we use a modified eight-band Kane model which includes the MIA effect. With the band structures, we can evaluate the optical matrix elements and joint density of states for the corresponding SL systems. Based on these obtained results, we employ the Boltzmann equation approach to calculate the optical absorption coefficients for the corresponding SL systems. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the MIA effect can greatly influence the electronic and optical properties of short-period InAs/GaSb type-II SLs. For the band structures, we find that the MIA effect causes strong interactions between different SL subbands and creates large spin splittings of these subbands. For the optical properties, the MIA effect activates the forbidden optical transition channels for TM polarization, enhances the absorption strength considerably and induces remarkable red-shifts for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, where TE and TM refer to light polarizations along the in-plane and growth directions of SL structure. Different absorption features for TE and TM polarizations are well manifested by corresponding optical matrix elements. Moreover, in conjunction with recent experiment, we calculate the polarization-dependent absorption spectra for mid-IR InAs/GaSb type-II SLs. Our theoretical results can explain those observed experimentally. The present work sheds the significant importance of MIA effect in short-period InAs/GaSb type-II SLs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

KLF5 protein degradation is increased by several E3 ubiquitin ligases, including WWP1 and SCFFbw7, through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the deubiquitinase (DUB) of KLF5 has not been demonstrated. In this study, we identified ATXN3L as a KLF5 DUB by genome-wide siRNA screening. ATXN3L directly binds to KLF5, decreasing its ubiquitination and thus degradation. Functionally, knockdown of ATXN3L inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation partially through KLF5. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of ATXN3L in the regulation of KLF5 stability in breast cancer. ATXN3L might be a therapeutic target for breast cancer.

These two probes showed high selectivity for Pi detection without interference from ATP, PPi, or other anions. Dramatic color changes from colorless to light yellow were observed by addition of Pi to solutions of 1 and 2 in DMSO/HEPES buffer (0.02 M, pH 7.4) (V/V = 8:2). This qualitative color shift was accompanied by red-shifts in the UV-vis absorbance spectrum of approximately 43 nm for 1 and 46 nm for 2. Fluorescence quenching was observed in solutions of I (Phi = 0.31) and 2 (Phi = 0.23) upon addition of Pi. Probes 1 and 2 are the first two 1,8-naphthyridine-based boron complexes developed which serve as colorimetric probes capable of highly selective detection of Pi over other phosphate-based chemical species including P2O74-, ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, GMP, UP, TDP, TMP, UTP, UDP, and UMP. The in vivo imaging results demonstrate that 1 and 2 are able to permeate into the HeLa cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to detect Pi via a strong fluorescence intensity change.

The same function, with different constants d and k, also describes the relationship between Gamma(gamma) and peak Compton frequency nC. This behavior is derived analytically using an equipartition blazar model with a log-parabola description of the electron energy distribution (EED). In the Thomson regime, k=k(EC)=3b/4 for external Compton (EC) processes and k=k(SSC)=9b/16for synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, where b is the log-parabola width parameter of the EED. The BL Lac object Mrk 501 is fit with a synchrotron/SSC model given by the log-parabola EED, and is best fit away from equipartition. Corrections are made to the spectral-index diagrams for a low-energy power-law EED and departures from equipartition, as constrained by absolute jet power. Analytic expressions are compared with numerical values derived from self-Compton and EC scattered gamma-ray spectra from Lya broad-line region and IR target photons. The Gamma(gamma) versus ns behavior in the model depends strongly on b, with progressively and predictably weaker dependences on gamma-ray detection range, variability time, and isotropic gamma-ray luminosity. Implications for blazar unification and blazars as ultra-high energy cosmic-ray sources are discussed. Arguments by Ghisellini et al. that the jet power exceeds the accretion luminosity depend on the doubtful assumption that we are viewing at the Doppler angle.

However, little is known about whether biogeography affects Nocardiopsis distribution in various hypersaline environments. Such information is essential for understanding the ecology of Nocardiopsis. Here we analyzed 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and sodA genes of 78 Nocardiopsis strains isolated from hypersaline environments in Yunnan and Xinjiang Provinces of western China. The obtained Nocardiopsis strains were classified into five operational taxonomic units, each comprising location-specific phylo- and genotypes. Statistical analyses showed that spatial distance and environmental factors substantially influenced Nocardiopsis distribution in hypersaline environments: the former had stronger influence at large spatial scales, whereas the latter was more influential at small spatial scales.

The results indicated that the existence of 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole ring, substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a 2-bromobenzyl or naphthylacyl group, as well as alkyl chain length between carbazole and imidazole ring were important for the antitumor activity. Compound 61, bearing a 2-bromobenzyl substituent at position-3 of the 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole, showed powerful inhibitory activities and was more selective to HL-60, SMMC-7721, MCF-7 and SW480 cell lines with IC50 values 0.51-2.48 mu M. Mechanism of action studies revealed that this new compound could remarkably induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. This work provides alternative novel way for future drug development based on carbazole and imidazolium salt scaffolds.

The formation of PDDA-RGO nanocomposite was confirmed by SEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of PDDA-RGO nanocomposite to the oxidation of QY was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed sensor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance towards detection of QY. The linear range is from 0.01 to 10 mu M, and the detection limit is down to 0.002 mu M (S/N = 3). The proposed sensor also exhibited excellent anti-interference property, repeatability and stability.

The expression of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) from the metastable state to the stable state is derived. Based on the expression, the effects of periodic force on the MFPT were analyzed. The results indicate that: (i) For the case of the multiplicative noise induced transition, the multiplicative noise and the periodic force weaken the stability of the metastable state; (ii) For the case of the additive noise induced transition, the stability of the metastable state is weakened by the additive noise when the periodic force takes value of the first half cycle, while the stability of the metastable state is enhanced by the additive noise when the periodic force takes value of the second half cycle; (iii) For the case of the correlation between the multiplicative and the additive noise induced transition, the correlation between the multiplicative and the additive noises and the periodic force weaken the stability of the metastable state.

We orthogonally manipulated chamber height and base diameter and determined swimming activity, average swimming velocity and grazing rates of the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Moina micrura (on two algae Scenedesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris; leading to four aquatic algae-cladoceran systems in total) under different microcosm conditions. Across all the four aquatic systems, increasing chamber height at a given base diameter significantly decreased the duration and velocity of horizontal swimming, and it tended to increase the duration but decrease the velocity of vertical swimming. These collectively led to decreases in both average swimming velocity and grazing rate of the cladocerans in the tall chambers (at a given base diameter), in accordance with the positive relationship between average swimming velocity and grazing rate. In contrast, an increase of base diameter at a given chamber height showed contrasting effects on the above parameters. Consistently, at a given chamber volume increasing ratio of chamber height to base diameter decreased the average swimming velocity and grazing rate across all the aquatic systems. In general, increasing chamber depth and base diameter may exert contrasting effects on zooplankton behavior and thus phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions. We suggest that spatial shape plays an important role in determining ecological process and thus should be considered in a theoretical framework of spatial ecology and also the physical setting of aquatic microcosm experiments.

J	Ai, SM; Gao, JJ; Liu, SQ; Fu, YX				Ai, Shi-Meng; Gao, Jian-Jun; Liu, Shu-Qun; Fu, Yun-Xin			Efficient Estimation of Mutation Rates during Individual Development by Minimization of Chi-Square	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; GERMLINE MUTATION; MOUSE	Mutation primarily occurs when cells divide and it is highly desirable to have knowledge of the rate of mutations for each of the cell divisions during individual development. Recently, recessive lethal or nearly lethal mutations which were observed in a large mutation accumulation experiment using Drosophila melanogaster suggested that mutation rates vary significantly during the germline development of male Drosophila melanogaster. The analysis of the data was based on a combination of the maximum likelihood framework with numerical assistance from a newly developed coalescent algorithm. Although powerful, the likelihood based framework is computationally highly demanding which limited the scope of the inference. This paper presents a new estimation approach by minimizing chi-square statistics which is asymptotically consistent with the maximum likelihood method. When only at most one mutation in a family is considered the minimization of chi-square is simplified to a constrained weighted minimum least square method which can be solved easily by optimization theory. The new methods effectively eliminates the computational bottleneck of the likelihood. Reanalysis of the published Drosophila melanogaster mutation data results in similar estimates of mutation rates. The new method is also expected to be applicable to the analysis of mutation data generated by next-generation sequencing technology.

In this model, two electron components are considered: a low-energy electron component, which has a power-law form, and a high-energy electron component, which has a power-lawform or a relativistic Maxwellian plus a high-energy power-law tail. After fitting the observed multiband data of the Crab nebula using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of the chi(2)-minimization procedure, we show the following. (i) Electron injection with a relativistic Maxwellian plus a power-law tail (i.e. one electron population) cannot account for the observed multiband emission of the Crab nebula. (ii) Two distinct electron populations are required, although their origins are still under debate, and moreover there would be a low-energy electron component having a power-law form with a slope of similar to 1.6 for the Crab nebula and Crab-like pulsar wind nebulae.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	ARGO-YBJ OBSERVATION OF THE LARGE-SCALE COSMIC RAY ANISOTROPY DURING THE SOLAR MINIMUM BETWEEN CYCLES 23 AND 24	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic rays; methods: data analysis; methods: observational	AIR-SHOWER ARRAY; SIDEREAL ANISOTROPY; ARRIVAL DIRECTIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SKY SURVEY; TEV; INTENSITY; DETECTOR; ICECUBE; MILAGRO	This paper reports on the measurement of the large-scale anisotropy in the distribution of cosmic-ray arrival directions using the data collected by the air shower detector ARGO-YBJ from 2008 January to 2009 December, during the minimum of solar activity between cycles 23 and 24. In this period, more than 2 x 10(11) showers were recorded with energies between similar to 1 and 30 TeV. The observed two-dimensional distribution of cosmic rays is characterized by two wide regions of excess and deficit, respectively, both of relative intensity similar to 10(-3) with respect to a uniform flux, superimposed on smaller size structures. The harmonic analysis shows that the large-scale cosmic-ray relative intensity as a function of R.A. can be described by the first and second terms of a Fouries series. The high event statistics allow the study of the energy dependence of the anistropy, showing that the amplitude increases with energy, with a maximum intensity at similar to 10 TeV, and then decreases while the phase slowly shifts toward lower values of R.A. with increasing energy. The ARGO-YBJ data provide accurate observations over more than a decade of energy around this feature of the anisotropy spectrum.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

To provide insights for understanding putative functions of CFEM, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of CFEM domains by systematic comparative genomic analyses among diverse animals, plants, and more than 100 fungal species, which are representative across the entire group of fungi. We here show that CFEM domain is unique to fungi. Experiments using tissue culture demonstrate that the CFEM-containing ESTs in some plants originate from endophytic fungi. We also find that CFEM domain does not occur in all fungi. Its single origin dates to the most recent common ancestors of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, instead of multiple origins. Although the length and architecture of CFEM domains are relatively conserved, the domain-number varies significantly among different fungal species. In general, pathogenic fungi have a larger number of domains compared to other species. Domain-expansion across fungal genomes appears to be driven by domain duplication and gene duplication via recombination. These findings generate a clear evolutionary trajectory of CFEM domains and provide novel insights into the functional exchange of CFEM-containing proteins from cell-surface components to mediators in host-pathogen interactions.

Studies, however, have mainly been limited to the information exposed on the surface of the slabs. Thus far, structures preserved inside the slabs were accessed by careful removal of the matrix, in many cases with the unfortunate sacrifice of some "less important" structures, which destroys elements of exceptionally preserved specimens. Here, we show for the first time that microtomography (micro-CT) can reveal structures situated inside a Chengjiang fossil slab without causing any damage. In the present study a trilobitomorph arthropod (Xandarella spectaculum) can be reliably identified only with the application of micro-CT. We propose that this technique is an important tool for studying three-dimensionally preserved Chengjiang fossils and, most likely, also those from other biota with a comparable type of preservation, specifically similar iron concentrations.

NO and CO have high formation energies under O-poor condition therefore they are not suitable for p-type doping Ag3PO4. Though FO, ClO, and SP have shallow transition energies, they have high formation energies, thus F-O, Cl-O, and S-P may be compensated by the intrinsic defects (such as Ag vacancy) and they are not possible lead to n-type conductivity in Ag3PO4.

The strain grew well on most media tested and no diffusible pigment was produced. The aerial mycelium formed wrinkled single spores and short spore chains, some of which were branched. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, mannose, ribose, galactose and rhamnose. The predominant nnenaquinones were MK-10(H-4), MK-10(H-6), MK-10(H-8) and MK-10(H-2). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, some unknown phospholipids, glycolipids and polar lipids.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							ALBA SP NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; SOIL; HALOACTINOPOLYSPORA	A novel endophytic actinomycete, designated strain EGI 60009(T), was isolated from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis F. collected from Xinjiang Province, north-west China. The isolate was able to grow in the presence of 0-9 % (w/v) NaCI. Strain EGI 60009(T) had particular morphological properties: the substrate mycelia fragmented into rod-like elements and aerial mycelia differentiated into short spore chains. LL-2, 6-Diaminopimelic acid was the cell-wall diamino acid and rhamnose, galactose and glucose were the cell-wall sugars. MK-9(H4) was the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids of strain EGI 60009T were iso-C-15 :0, anteiso-C-15 :0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-17:0, iso-C-17: 1 and Vanteiso-C-17:0 B. Mycolic acids were absent. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 60009T was 70.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain EGI 60009T belongs to the family Jiangellaceae and formed a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree. 168 rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain EGI 60009(T) and other members of the genera Jiangella and Haloactinopolyspora were 96.1-96.4 and 95.7-96.0 %, respectively. Based on these results and supported by morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic data and numerous phenotypic differences, a novel species of a new genus, Phytoactinopolyspora endophytica gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of Phytoactinopolyspora endophytica is EGI 60009(T) (=KCTC 29657(T)=CPCC204078(T)).

In three greenhouse gas emission scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1), the ClO, Cl, ClONO2, and HCl concentrations would gradually decrease with time as emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS) steadily decrease. The rates of the changes in the ClO, Cl, ClONO2, and HCl concentrations are different in the same emission scenario and the rates of change in the same composition concentration are different for different emission scenarios. The ClO, Cl, and ClONO2 concentrations decrease fastest in scenario A2, next fastest in scenario A1B, and slowest in scenario B1. In contrast, the HCl concentration decreases fastest in scenario B1. The ozone concentration recovers quickly, and is highest in scenario A2. The results show that a rapid decrease in the ClO concentration is an important reason for the accelerated recovery of the ozone layer in scenario A2.

Based on the delay Fokker-Planck equation and the entropy balance equation, the time dependence of the entropy flux and entropy production of the system is derived when the delay time is small. Our calculation shows how the relaxation time depends on the delay time. We also consider how the non-equilibrium constraint is affected by the system parameters, such as the cross-correlation intensity, strength of dissipation, and delay time. The interplay among the non-equilibrium constraint, dissipation, time delay, and inter-correlated noises reveals some interesting extremal nature in the time dependence of the entropy flux and entropy production.

The prediction types of mineral resources of nickel deposits are magmatic type, marine sedimentary type and regolith type. The formation age is from the Neoarchean to the Cenozoic with two peaks in the Neoproterozoic and the late Paleozoic. The nickel deposits formed in the Neoproterozoic are located on the margin of the North China Block and Yangtze Block, and those formed in the late Paleozoic are mainly distributed in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), Emeishan and the Tarim Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). Magmatic nickel deposits are mainly related with broken-up continental margin, post-collision extension of the orogenic belt and mantle plume. According to different tectonic backgrounds and main characteristics of magmatism, the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE metallogenic series types of ore deposits related with mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic rocks can be divided into 4 subtypes: (1) the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE metallogenic series subtype of ore deposits related with mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic rocks in the broken-up continental margin, (2) the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE metallogenic series subtype of ore deposits related with mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic rocks in mantle plume magmatism, (3) the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE metallogenic series subtype of ore deposits related with mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic rocks in the subduction of the orogenic belt, and (4) the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE metallogenic series subtype of ore deposits related with mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic rocks in post-collision extension of the orogenic belt. We have discussed in this paper the typical characteristics and metallogenic models for Neoproterozoic Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits related with broken-up continental margin, Cambrian marine sedimentary Ni-Mo-V deposits related with black shale, early Permian Ni-Cu deposits related with post-collision extension of the orogenic belt, late Permian Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits related with Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), and Cenozoic Ni-Au deposits related with regolith. The broken-up continental margin, mantle plume and post-collision extension of the orogenic belt are important ore-forming geological backgrounds, and the discordogenic fault, mafic-ultramafic intrusion, high MgO primitive magma (high-MgO basaltic magma), deep magmatism, sulfur saturation and sulfide segregation are 6 important geological conditions for the magmatic nickel deposits.

This study validated the daily increment formation of Gymnocypris selincuoensis, as a representative of Schizothoracine fish, by monitoring the growth of hatchery-reared larvae group and wild-caught post-yolk-sac larvae group under controlled experiments. The results from monitoring the hatchery-reared larvae group showed that sagittae and lapilli were found in yolk-sac larvae, and formed 5-7days before hatching, but asterisci were not found until 11days post-hatching. The first increment in sagittae and lapilli was formed in the first day after hatching. The daily periodicity of increment formation was examined and confirmed in sagittae and lapilli of both larvae groups. However, sagittae were better for age determination than lapilli for larvae at earlier days. For larval G.selincuoensis older than 50days, lapilli were the only otolith pair suitable for larvae daily age determination. This study validated the daily increment formation in Schizothoracine fish for the first time has primary implications to other fishes from this subfamily.

Nonomuraea indica sp nov., novel actinomycetes isolated from lime-stone open pit mine, India	JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS			English	Article							DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; DNA HYBRIDIZATION; SOIL	A Gram-positive, aerobic, nonmotile actinomycete strain designated DRQ-2(T) was isolated from the soil sample collected from limestone open pit mine from the Gulbarga region, Karnataka province, India. Strain DRQ-2(T) was identified as a member of the genus Nonomuraea by a polyphasic approach. Strain DRQ-2(T) could be differentiated from other members of the genus Nonomuraea on the basis of physiology and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of strain DRQ-2(T) showed highest sequence similarity to Nonomuraea muscovyensis DSM 45913(T) (99.1%), N. salmonea DSM 43678(T) (98.2%) and N. maheshkhaliensis JCM 13929(T) with 98.0%, respectively. Chemotaxonomic properties showing predominant menaquinones of MK-9 (H-4), MK-9(H-2) and MK-9(H-6), major polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmono methyl ethanolamine (PME), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), hydroxy-PME (OH-PME), hydroxy PE (OH-PEE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), ninhydrin-positive phosphoglycolipid and unknown phospholipid, fatty acids with major amounts of i-C-16:0, ai-C-15:0 and ai-C-17:0 supported allocation of the strain to the genus Nonomuraea. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain DRQ-2(T) from closely related species. The genomic DNA G+C content of the organism was 72.5 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotypic and molecular characteristics, strain DRQ-2(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name N. indica sp. nov. is proposed, with type strain DRQ-2(T) (= NCIM 5480(T) = CCTCC AA 209050(T)).

The antioxidant activities of 85% ethanolic extract of P. pashia flowers and derived soluble fractions were evaluated for the first time using four different test systems. The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of each fraction were also determined. It was found that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant effect. An investigation of this flower's chemical constituents was carried out and led to the isolation of a new phenolic glycoside, 4-O-Z-coumaroylarbutin (1), along with twenty-seven other phenolic compounds (2-28). Hydroquinone (13) showed the highest content and powerful activity, which implied that the compound plays an important role in the antioxidant activity of this flower. Thus, P. pashia flowers could serve as a valuable natural antioxidant source for potential application in functional foods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we numerically investigated an N-polar GaN/AlGaN/GaN HEMT device in which the two-dimension electron gas is induced at the top GaN/AlGaN interface. Characteristics of the device were determined by using experimental data to calibrate the few adjustable parameters of our simulations. Effects of interface charges on the device were researched by changing the component of Al. In addition, the dependency of scaling the device dimensions on direct current (DC) output characteristics, such as the gate length and the barrier height was also analyzed in details. Our simulations showed that increases of Al mole fraction and AlGaN barrier height and a decrease of the gate length can improve the DC performance of HEMT device to some extent. That could be a significant guidance for designing or optimizing the structure of N-polar GaN-based devices.

It can capture nematodes by producing a special mycelial structure called adhesive network or trap. The trap is also a signature of the fungus switching from the saprophytic lifestyle to the predacious lifestyle. At present, little is known about the mechanism of lifestyle switch in nematode-trapping fungi. Here we describe the effect of a cell wall protein called AoMad1 on lifestyle switch. The disruption of the AoMad1 encoding gene in A. oligospora resulted in the formation of more traps in the presence of nematodes. Interestingly, the mutant strain was more sensitive to certain nitrogen sources as trap inducers than the wild type strain. The microscopic examinations revealed that the AoMad1-deletion mutant lacked cell surface adhesive materials and the cell wall structures were more porous than wild-type strains. A great of genes were differentially expressed by transcriptomic analysis when trap formation was induced by sodium nitrate compared to the wild type strain, many of them were related to nitrogen metabolism, host-pathogen interaction and mycelia development. The results suggest that AoMad1 plays an important role in life style switching in A. oligospora. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

APSES proteins share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (APSES domain) of about 100 amino acids, whose central domain is predicted to form a typical bHLH structure. Besides APSES domain, several APSES proteins also contain additional domains, such as Ki1A-N and ankyrin repeats. In recent years, an increasing number of APSES proteins have been identified from diverse fungi, and they involve in numerous biological processes, such as sporulation, cellular differentiation, mycelial growth, secondary metabolism and virulence. Most fungi, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Candida albicans, Fusarium graminearum, and Neurospora crassa, contain five APSES proteins. However, Cryptococcus neoformans only contains two APSES proteins, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains six APSES proteins. The phylogenetic analysis showed the APSES domains from different fungi were grouped into four clades (A, B, C and D), which is consistent with the result of homologous alignment of APSES domains using DNAman. The roles of APSES proteins in clade C have been studied in detail, while little is known about the roles of other APSES proteins in clades A, B and D. In this review, the biochemical properties and functional domains of APSES proteins are predicted and compared, and the phylogenetic relationship among APSES proteins from various fungi are analyzed based on the APSES domains. Moreover, the functions of APSES proteins in different fungi are summarized and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Spurious-free dynamic ranges (SFDRs) are calculated and measured. Both the calculation and experiments show that not only the RF signal power is significantly increased, but also both the second-and third-, as well as fifth-order nonlinearities are suppressed. For our considered EAM, when the second-order nonlinearity is suppressed maximally, the SFDRs with respect to second-order harmonic distortion and second-order intermodulation distortion are improved by 11.5 and 8.5 dB, respectively. In the mean time, the SFDRs with respect to third-order harmonic distortion (HD3) and third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) are improved by 1.8 and 1.3 dB, respectively. When the third order is suppressed maximally, the SFDRs with respect to HD3 and IMD3 are improved by 8.1 and 20.4 dB, respectively. The fifth-order intermodulation distortion is also suppressed at the same time. The RoF transmissions for WiFi signals are also verified. As a result, 3.5 dB at 2.4-GHz improvement and 2.8 dB at 5-GHz improvement of error vector magnitude are obtained for an RoF system by using the DWL technique.

Despite these large-scale studies, additional comprehensive RNA-seq data from different subregions of the human brain are required to fully evaluate the evolutionary patterns experienced by the human brain transcriptome. Here, we provide a total of 6.5 billion RNA-seq reads from different subregions of the human brain. A significant correlation was observed between the levels of alternative splicing and RNA editing, which might be explained by a competition between the molecular machineries responsible for the splicing and editing of RNA. Young human protein-coding genes demonstrate biased expression to the neocortical and non-neocortical regions duringevolution on the lineage leading to humans. We also found that a significantly greater number of young human protein-coding genes are expressed in the putamen, a tissue that was also observed to have the highest level of RNA-editing activity. The putamen, which previously received little attention, plays an important role in cognitive ability, and our data suggest a potential contribution of the putamen to human evolution.

Based on anisotropic Kuwahara filtering in conjunction with line integral convolution, our method abstracts shapes and colors simultaneously while preserving features of images. In particular, we develop an edge detection and dilation method, to draw attention to salient features and image boundaries. This proposed algorithm is incremental and iterative, and therefore the degree of flow and abstraction can be controlled. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of our method in producing a coherent and flow-like abstraction stylization is satisfactory yet preserving features and directions from photographs.

This paper focuses on the decision problem about how to offload computation-intensive applications in mobile ad hoc network-based cloud computing environments. A set of online and batch scheduling heuristics were proposed to offload dynamically arriving independent tasks among mobile nodes. The heuristics were validated in a simulation environment, and their performances with respect to both user-centric and system-centric metrics such as the average makespan, the average waiting time, the average slowdown and the average utilization, were investigated with comprehensive experiments. Experimental results show that it is not appropriate to map tasks only based on the expected bandwidth, execution time or the overall offloading time, On the contrary, the expected completion time must be taken into account. Furthermore, the MCTComm heuristic seems to be the best choice from the standpoint of the tradeoff between the complexity and the performance.

The dependence of LITV signals upon the doping carrier density is investigated by changing the Ce content of the films. The optimum Ce dopant corresponding to the largest voltage is found and is attributed to the two-dimensional transport behaviors of the localized electrons. The shorter laser irradiation always induces the larger voltage signals in samples with richer Ce content, suggesting the optimum dopant level is sensitive to the wavelength of excitation source. Thus, the behaviors of LITV signals are resulted from both effects of the anisotropic thermoelectric transport and the optical properties of the thin films. The doping dependence related with an anisotropic charge transport may come from the change in carrier density and the modification in energy band configuration.

It is interesting to note that both complexes are a pair of enantiomers: 1 exhibits 1D right-handed helical chain of [Zn-COO-](infinity) and 2 is 1D left-handed helical chain of [Zn-COO-](infinity). There are various hydrogen bonds between the adjacent helical chains which result in a 2D homochiral supramolecular layer structure. Notably, under similar synthetic procedure by using the NO3-, CH3COO-, Cl- salts of Zn2+ ion as a starting reagent, and identical compounds were obtained. In addition, the chiral nature of complexes I and 2 are confirmed by the results of circular dichroism (CD) spectra measurements. Thermal stability and luminescence properties were also investigated.

All picoline ligands coordinate to the axial sites of Rh-2(O2CCH3)(4) via the pyridine nitrogen atoms, and interestingly, the coordination of 2-picoline in 1 is assisted by two intramolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds formed between the methyl of 2-picoline and the oxygen atoms of Rh2(O2CCH3)(4). Moreover, the intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions play the main role in the structural stacking of 1-3. Their catalytic activity was evaluated in the C-H insertion reactions for the preparation of 4-nitrobenzyl-(4R, 5R, 6S)-6-((R)-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-3,7-dioxo-1-azabicyclo [3.2.0] heptane-2-carboxylate, a key intermediate of Meropenem. The isolated yields for 1, 2 and 3 are 44%, 16% and 22%, respectively, significantly lower than the value of Rh2(O2CCH3) 4 (73%), indicating that the axial ligands have negative but different influence on the catalytic activity. The activities of 1-3 are related to the displacement rate of the axial ligands, and essentially related to the Rh-N bond lengths which strong affect the displacement rate. Therefore, it is possible to tune the catalytic activity of Rh-2(O2CCH3)(4) by changing its axial ligands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent research supports the hypothesis that bacteria often associated with plant-parasitic nematodes, function as nematode parasites, symbionts, or commensal organisms etc. In this study, we explored the bacterial consortia associated with M. incognita at different developmental stages, including egg mass, adult female and second-stage juvenile using the pyrosequencing approach. The results showed that Proteobacteria, with a proportion of 71-84%, is the most abundant phylum associated with M. incognita in infected tomato roots, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes etc. Egg mass, female and second-stage juvenile of M. incognita harbored a core microbiome with minor difference in communities and diversities. Several bacteria genera identified in M. incognita are recognized cellulosic microorganisms, pathogenic bacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and antagonists to M. incognita. Some genera previously identified in other plant-parasitic nematodes were also found in tomato RKNs. The potential biological control microorganisms, including the known bacterial pathogens and nematode antagonists, such as Actinomycetes and Pseudomonas, showed the largest diversity and proportion in egg mass, and dramatically decreased in second-stage juvenile and female of M. incognita. This is the first comprehensive report of bacterial flora associated with the RKN identified by pyrosequencing-based analysis. The results provide valuable information for understanding nematode-microbiota interactions and may be helpful in the development of novel nematode-control strategies.

The character states were coded and optimized onto a maximum-likelihood tree based on previous molecular data with Fitch parsimony and hierarchical Bayesian analysis to trace the evolution of character states throughout all internodes in the phylogenetic tree for Gaultherieae. Leaf epidermal characters were found to be largely consistent within species, but highly variable at interspecific and higher taxonomic levels. The most recent common ancestral states of 15 characters diagnosed various lineages recovered from prior studies, some with no prior morphological support. Relatively high frequencies of state change occur in the eastern Asian clade Gaultheria series Gymnobotrys+Diplycosia, the American clade G. subsection Dasyphyta p.p., the core East Asian clade and the Australia/New Zealand clade. The characters with the highest frequencies of state change are the outer stomatal ledge ornamentation type, the stomatal apparatus level, stomatal density and area, and the type of abaxial trichomes. These character state change patterns may provide insight into the ecological adaptions of Gaultherieae during their evolutionary history.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 178, 686-710.

The new treatment options with completely novel mechanism of therapeutic activity are needed for lung cancer to improve patient outcome. The present study was aimed at testing the efficacy of recombinant adenovirus H101 as an oncolytic agent for killing human lung cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression on human lung cancer cell lines by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry staining. Viral infectivity and viral replication in lung cancer cells was assayed by flow cytometry and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. After H101 treatment, cytotoxic effect, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were further examined by lactate dehydrogenase release assay and flow cytometry in vitro, respectively. In vivo, antitumor effects of H101 were assessed on SCID Beige mice xenografted with human lung cancer cells. Receptor characterization confirmed that human lung cancer cell lines expressed CAR receptor for adenovirus type 5. Lung cancer cells were sensitive to infection by the H101 virus. H101 infection and replication resulted in very potent cytotoxicity, G2/M phase arrest and cell lysis. In vivo, we also showed that H101 significantly inhibited tumor growth following intratumoral injection, with virus replication, cell degeneration and necrosis in the tumor tissue. These results have important implications for the treatment of human lung cancer.

A suitable filter can overcome the checkerboard and mesh-dependency. And the historical information on accurate elemental sensitivity numbers are used to keep the objective function converging steadily. Apart from rational intervals of the relevant important parameters, the concept of distinguishing between active and non-active elements design is proposed, which can be widely used for improving the function and artistry of structures directly, especially for a one whose accurate size is not given. Furthermore, user-friendly software packages are developed to enhance its accessibility for practicing engineers and architects. And to reduce the time cost for large time-consuming complex structure optimization, parallel computing is built-in in the MATLAB codes. The program is easy to use for engineers who may not be familiar with either FEA or structure optimization. And developers can make a deep research on the algorithm by changing the MATLAB codes. Several classical examples are given to show that the improved BESO method is superior for its handy and utility computer program software.

Treatment normally involves bacterial eradication; however, this type of treatment only has a rate of effectiveness of <80%. Thus, it is a matter of some urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies. Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins, has been proven to be effective in removing a vast range of pathogens, including H. pylori. In the present study, we examined the effectiveness of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLf) isolated from transgenic goats as a treatment for H. pylori in vitro and in vivo. For the in vivo experiments, BALB/c mice received an intragastric administration of 0.1 ml of a suspension of H. pylori. The mice were then divided into 4 groups: group A, treated with saline; group B, treated with 1.5 g of rhLF; group C, treated with the standard triple therapy regimen; and group D, treated with the standard triple therapy regimen plus. 5 g of rhLF. Following sacrifice, the stomach tissues of the mice were histologically examined for the presence of bacteria. For the in vitro experiments, the bacteria were cultured in BHI broth and RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were carried out to determine the mRNA and protein levels of virulence factors (CagA and VacA) in the cultures. Our results revealed that rhLf not only inhibited the growth of H. pylori, but also suppressed the expression of two major virulence factors. Moreover, rhLf markedly increased bacterial eradication and effectively reduced the inflammatory response when combined with the standard triple therapy regimen. These results provide evidence supporting the use of rhLF as an adjuvant to traditional therapeutic strategies in the treatment of H. pylori.

Cells of the strain were rod-shaped and colonies were yellow and circular. The strain grew at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and 50-70 degrees C (optimum, 60-65 degrees C). The predominant menaquinone was MK-8 and the DNA G+C content was 66.4 molo/o. Major fatty acids (>10 %) were iso-C-15:0 and iso-C(17:0.)The polar lipids consisted of one aminophospholipid, one phospholipid and two glycolipids. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain YIM 77409(T) formed a cluster with Thermus scotoductus DSM 8553T, Thermus antranikianfi DSM 12462(T), Thermus caliditerrae YIM 77925(T) and Thermus tengchongensis YIM 77924(T), with highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to T. scotoductus DSM 8553(T) (97.57 %). However, DNA DNA hybridization indicated that strain YIM 77409(T) should be viewed as a representative of a novel species, as there was only 30.6 +/- 1.6 To reassociation with T. scotoductus DSM 8553T" On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, as well as the genotypic data, it is proposed that strain YIM 77409(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermus, with the name Therm us amyloliquefaciens sp. nov. The type strain is YIM 77409(T) (=DSM 25898(T)=KCIC 32024(T)).

A robust least squares cross-validation bandwidth is proposed, which significantly improves the classical least squares cross-validation bandwidth for its variability and undersmoothing, adapts to different kinds of densities, and outperforms the existing bandwidths in statistical literature and software.

The samples exhibit seven photoluminescence (PL) peaks peaked at 1.68, 1.75, 1.84, 1.93, 2.00, 2.70, and 3.10 eV. There are also two excitation bands in the PL excitation (PLE) spectra peaked at 4.90 and 5.19 eV. Raman spectra are employed to observe and understand structural variations in SiO2 matrix during the formation of nc-Ge and defects. Within the frame of the quantum confinement (QC) theory and Oswald ripening growth model, the origin and evolution of the seven PL peaks and two PLE bands are identified clearly demonstrated by the proposed energy-level and generated process diagrams. Our results indicate that both the implanting dose and annealing temperature play a dominant role in modulating the optical properties of the nc-Ge-embedded SiO2 films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Their structures were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses. Whereas compounds 5 and 6 exhibited potent antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis (32 mu g/mL) and Escherichia coli (16 mu g/mL), the new saponin 2 showed only moderate antibacterial activities against these pathogens. The relationship between the antibacterial activities and the structures of these saponins are described. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Obtaining spore-deficient strains and understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of such strains are important for breeding work. In this study, we crossed monokaryotic strains isolated from the edible fungi Agrocybe salicacola to obtain three spore-deficient strains with losses of the sterigmata on the surface of the lamella. A mating test revealed that recessive alleles distributed in some strains might control sterigmata development during the mitotic or meiotic phases. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the majority of the genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, base excision repair, and homologous recombination exhibited down-regulated expression patterns in the mutant fruiting bodies. Five genetic fragments, which were highly similar to the GTP-cyclohydrolase encoding gene, the DNA repair gene rad 8, and cell wall integrity and stress response component-encoding genes, were all expressed exclusively in the wild-type strains; these findings provide important information for the study of the spore development of edible fungi.

The N/Ni ratio increased (N/Ni=0.3-1.1) while the peak (200) shifted to lower angles with increasing N-f. It revealed that there was significant variation in the preferred orientation and Neel temperature (T-N) for the films with increasing N-f. Strong indication for a frozen state is found, determined from the difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations. The ac susceptibility measurements show a peak position shifting as a function of the driving frequencyf and magnetization value does not saturate in the field range. These findings consistently demonstrate that Mn3NiNx thin films exhibit a spin-glass state at low temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is rigorously proved that, as the double parameter flux perturbation vanishes, any Riemann solution containing two shock waves and a possibly one-contact-discontinuity tends to a delta shock solution to the transport equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted delta-measure which forms the delta shock wave; any Riemann solution containing two rarefaction waves and a possibly one-contact-discontinuity tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Some numerical results are also given to present the processes of concentration and cavitation as the flux perturbation decreases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The initial data are constants in three sectors centered at the origin, which only involve three contact discontinuities. By the generalized characteristic analysis method and the phase plane analysis method, we find that the solutions are not unique for certain values of the initial data. We propose an additional stability condition for the interaction of the contact discontinuities. By this stability condition, all of the exact solutions and their corresponding criteria can be obtained. The solutions exhibit various geometrical structures. In particular, envelope rarefaction waves develop in some solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Pochonia chlamydosporia can be found in diverse nematode-suppressive soils as a parasite of-nematode eggs and is one of the Most studied potential biological control agents of nematodes. However, little is known about the functions of small molecules in the process of infection of nematodes by this parasitic fungus or about small-molecule-mediated interactions between the pathogenic fungus and its host. Out recent study demonstrated that a P. chlamydosporia strain isolated from root knots of tobacco infected by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita produced a class of yellow pigment metabolite aurovertins, which induced the death of the free-living nematode Panagrellus redivevus. Here we report that nematicidal P, chlamydosporia strains obtained from the nematode worms tended to yield a total yellow pigment autovertin production exceeding the inhibitory concentration shown in nematicidal bioassays. Aurovertin D was abundant in the pigment metabolites of P. chlamydosporia strains. Aurovertin D showed strong toxicity toward the root-knot nematode M incognita and exerted profound and detrimental effects on the viability of Caenorhabditis elegans even at a subinhibitory concentration. Evaluation of the nematode mutation in the beta subunit of F-1-ATPase, together with the application of RNA interference in screening each subunit of F1FO-ATPase in the nematode worms, demonstrated that the beta subunit of F-1-ATPase might not be the specific target for aurovertins in nematodes. The resistance of C. elegans daf-2(e1370) and the hypersensitivity of C. elegans daf-16(mu86) to aurovertin D indicated that DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in nematodes was triggered in response to the aurovertin attack. These findings advance our understanding of the roles of aurovertin production in the interactions between nematodes and the pathogen fungus P. chlamydosporia.

However, only very small amounts are available for biological tests due to its limited content from plant sources. Fungi of genus Fusarium have been reported to have the ability to convert C-27-steroids into C-19-steroids. In this study, Asparagus filicinus, containing a high content of 20-hydroxyecdysone, was utilized to accumulate rubrosterone through solid fermentation by Fusarium oxysporum. The results showed that F. oxysporum had the ability to facilitate the complete biotransformation of 20-hydroxyecdysone to rubrosterone by solid-state fermentation. The present method could be an innovative and efficient approach to accumulate rubrosterone with an outstanding conversion ratio.

By establishing some dynamic inequalities on time scales, a permanence result for the model is obtained. Furthermore, by means of the almost periodic functional hull theory on time scales and Lyapunov functional, some criteria are obtained for the existence, uniqueness and global attractivity of almost periodic solutions of the model. Our results complement and extend some scientific work in recent years. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the main results.

The anatomy and emission pattern of leaf traces are well studied in extant vascular plants, but remain poorly understood in fossil lineages. We quantitatively analysed the leaf traces in the late Permian conifer Ningxiaites specialis from Northwest China based on serial sections through pith, primary and secondary xylems. A complete leaf traces emission pattern of a conifer is presented for the first time from the late Palaeozoic. Three to five monarch leaf traces are grouped in clusters, arranged in a helical phyllotaxis. The leaf traces in each cluster can be divided into upper, middle and lower portions, and initiate at the pith periphery and cross the wood horizontally. The upper leaf trace increases its diameter during the first growth increment and then diminishes completely, which indicates leaf abscission at the end of the first year. The middle trace immediately bifurcates once or twice to form two or three vascular bundles. The lower trace persists as a single bundle during its entire length. The intricate leaf trace dynamics indicates this fossil plant had a novel evolutionary habit by promoting photosynthetic capability for the matured plant.

The gamma-ray emission of 3C 207 is confirmed and significant variability of the light curve is identified. We do not find statistically significant gamma-ray emission from other LDQs. 3C 275.1 is the known gamma-ray quasar with the lowest core dominance parameter (i.e., R=0.11). We also show that both the northern radio hotspot and parsec jet models can reasonably reproduce the gamma-ray data. The parsec jet model, however, is favored by the potential gamma-ray variability on a timescale of months. We suggest that some dimmer gamma-ray LDQs will be detected in the future and LDQs could contribute non-ignorably to the extragalactic gamma-ray background.

Seed germination was more strongly negatively affected by LAE than seedling growth. Responses of seed germination and seed growth to LAE differed differently among the target species. LAE more strongly negatively affected seed germination, but less strongly negatively affected seedling growth, in non-legume species than in legume species. LAE more strongly negatively affected seed germination and seedling growth in native species than naturalized exotic species. Therefore, naturalized exotic non-legume seedlings are more suitable than seeds of native legume species for restoration of Mikania-invaded habitats.

Amorphous carbon can be loaded on the CoS2 nanoparticles uniformly in the solvothermal alcoholysis process, and the subsequent calcination results of the formation of hollow structures. The capacity of the sample can remain stable as high as 720 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles, and it also exhibits good rate capacity. The nano-scaled characteristics of CoS2 nanosheets embedded in the aggregates ensure the electrode having a high capacity and the fast Li-ion diffusion in the electrode. The in-situ introduction of carbon renders the electrode having a good electronic conductivity and can effectively prevent the formation of polysulfide anions. The unique hollow structures can shorten the length of Li-ion diffusion, which is benefit for the rate performance. The hollow structure also offers a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Therefore, the prepared hierarchical hollow CoS2@C materials constructed by nanosheets exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the MSCE equipment and operation procedures were designed. Then, the optimal parameters of MSCE were obtained by using single-factor experiments and Box-Behnken design (BBD) as follows: extraction temperature of 46.6 degrees C, CaO to raw material ratio of 6:100, water to raw material ratio of 8.8:1 and extraction time of 51.7 min. Finally, the performance of MSCE was compared against the single pot extraction (SPE) under optimal conditions. The results demonstrated that MSCE was a time-saving, energy-saving, and cost-saving extraction technology for manufacturing resveratrol from peanut sprouts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Collinsium belongs to a highly derived clade of lobopodians within stem group Onychophora, distinguished by a substantial dorsal armature of supernumerary and biomineralized spines (Family Luolishaniidae). As demonstrated here, luolishaniids display the highest degree of limb specialization among Paleozoic lobopodians, constitute more than one- third of the overall morphological disparity of stem group Onychophora, and are substantially more disparate than crown group representatives. Despite having higher disparity and appendage complexity than other lobopodians and extant velvet worms, the specialized mode of life embodied by luolishaniids became extinct during the Early Paleozoic. Collinsium and other superarmored lobopodians exploited a unique paleoecological niche during the Cambrian explosion.

An assessment of three satellite-based precipitation data sets as applied to the Thailand region	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						precipitation; satellite-derived precipitation estimates; rain gauge network; Thailand	RAIN-GAUGE NETWORKS; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; CLIMATOLOGY PROJECT; QUALITY-CONTROL; ANALYSIS TMPA; PRODUCTS; TRMM; VALIDATION; BASIN; UNCERTAINTY	The study examines three satellite-based data sets to estimate long-term precipitation for the Thailand region: the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) 3B43, the Climate Prediction Centre morphing technique (CMORPH), and a locally developed regression model using the geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS) covering the Thailand region. Data for the first two sets were available at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees, while the local regression model used data from the GMS at a resolution of 5kmx5km. The statistical regression model was developed by relating long-term monthly average precipitation from 27 rain gauge stations with concurrent satellite data in the visible and thermal infrared bands. The model was then tested against independent data from 27 rain gauge stations. Satellite/rain gauge ratios were estimated, and a smooth spline surface was used to correct the error from the model. Data from the three approaches were compared with a rain gauge network.

A grotesque variant of Silurus asotus (Teleostei: Siluridae) from Hongshuihe River basin, Guizhou, China	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES			English	Article						Variant; Silurus asotus; Siluridae; Guizhou; China	FIN EROSION; NATURAL HYBRID; CYPRINIDAE; ABNORMALITIES; HYBRIDIZATION; FISHES; GREECE	One grotesque catfish specimen was collected in Zhangjiang River (upper reach of a secondary tributary of Hongshuihe River) in Libo County, Guizhou Province, China. This specimen bears surprising character of four dorsal fins, which have not appeared in any other silurid fishes. But other morphological characters, such as two pairs of barbels, lower jaw projecting beyond upper jaw, the first dorsal fin with one un-branched ray and 4 branched rays, mouth cleft shallow, anterior spine margin of pectoral spine prominently serrated, vomerine tooth band continuous across midline, show much similarities with that of Silurus asotus. This result supports that this variant originated from S. asotus for some special causations. The present study provided description and comparison with S. asotus.	[Chen, Z.

A rapid and simple one-step extraction-derivatization method combined with ultra high performance liquid chromatography was established for the determination of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in paper packaging materials and food stimulants. The linear correlation coefficients (R-2) were greater than 0.9999 in the range of 0.14-35.7 mg/m(2) for both formaldehyde and 0.20-49.1 mg/m(2) for acetaldehyde, with detection limits of 0.03 mg/m(2) for formaldehyde and 0.04 mg/m(2) for acetaldehyde. The recoveries were 90.1%-108.6% for paper sample and Tenax. The migration behaviors of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde at different temperatures and migration times were investigated. Both for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, the amount of migration gradually increased with time first, then decreased, finally reached a steady value. The migration rates of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were differently influenced by temperature. After reaching a steady value, the maximum migration rate for formaldehyde was at 30 degrees C, and for acetaldehyde was at 70 degrees C and 50 degrees C. The migration rates of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde greatly varied, and the migration rate of acetaldehyde was far more than the migration rate of formaldehyde when reaching a steady value.

The taxonomic status of strain YIM 78110(T) was confirmed by a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain YIM 78110(T) belongs to the genus Cecembia, displaying 96.8% and 94.7% sequence similarity with the two most closely related type strains, Cecembia calidifontis RQ-33(T) and Cecembia lonarensis LW9(T), respectively. The low value of DNA DNA hybridization (52.3 +/- 2.3%) between strain YIM 78110(T) and its closest neighbour, Cecembia calidifontis RQ-33(T), indicated that this new isolate represented a different genomic species in the genus Cecembia. The temperature for growth ranged from 30 to 50 degrees C. The pH for growth ranged from pH 4.0 to 10.0, with NaCl tolerance of 0.5-6.0% (w/v). The predominant menaquinone of strain YIM 78110(T) was MK-7 and the major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and C-15:0. The DNA G+C content was 47.1 mol%. On the basis of physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic analyses, it is proposed that strain YIM 78110(T) represents a novel species of the genus Cecembia, for which the name Cecembia rubra sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78110(T) (=CCTCC AB2013287(T)=DSM 28057(T)).

A. Mey collected from Urumqi, Xinjiang province, north-west China. Growth occurred at 5-35 degrees C (optimum 25-30 degrees C), at pH 5-10 (optimum pH 7-8) and with 0-13% NaCl (w/v) (optimum 0-5%). The predominant menaquinone was MK-9 (93.1%). The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0 (49.5%) and iso-C-(15:0) (15.1%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained lysine, alanine and glutamic acid. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two unknown phospholipids and one unknown glycolipid. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 6500322(T) was 62.0 mol%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the nearest phylogenetic neighbours of strain EGI 6500322(T) were identified as Arthrobacter ardleyensis DSM 17432(T) (98.38%) and Arthrobacter bergerei DSM 16367(T) (98.37 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain EGI 6500322(T) and Arthrobacter ardleyensis DSM 17432T and Arthrobacter bergerei DSM 16367(T) was 53.4 +/- 4.1% and 30.5 +/- 1.7%, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis, chemotaxononnic data, physiological characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain EGI 6500322(T) should represent a novel species of the genus Arthrobacter, for which the name Arthrobacter endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed.

To further improve the covariance-based methods such as PCA (or KPCA), this paper firstly proposed an entropy matrix to load the uncertainty information of random variables similar to the covariance matrix loading the variation information in PCA. Then an entropy-difference matrix was used as a weighting matrix for transforming the original training images. This entropy-difference weighting (EW) matrix not only made good use of the local information of the training samples, contrast to the global method of PCA, but also considered the category information similar to LDA idea. Then the EW method was integrated with PCA (or KPCA), to form new feature extracting method. The new method was used for face recognition with the nearest neighbor classifier. The experimental results based on the ORL and Yale databases showed that the proposed method with proper threshold parameters reached higher recognition rates than the usual PCA (or KPCA) methods.

The observations of the synchrotron emission from the supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006 indicate a bilateral morphology, which is mainly characterized by two opposite bright limbs with knots and filaments along the boundary of the remnant. The morphology is not strictly circular with disturbances and bumps at the rim of the remnant. For instance, one big bump is located on the northeastern (NE) limb and several relatively small ones on the southwestern (SW) limb on the detected morphologies from the observations in the radio and X-rays. Aims. The generation of the asymmetric morphology of non-thermal X-rays for SN 1006 is investigated through three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the density distribution of the ambient material can be investigated by comparing the resulting synchrotron morphology with the detected images of the hard X-ray emission. Methods. First, the remnant was simulated as a supernova explosion evolved in a turbulent plasma with a relatively small amplitude for the turbulence. In the model, several spherical cavities with lower densities compared with the background plasma were employed to reproduce the detected bumps at the bright limbs. Second, the effect of the modification on the morphology of the remnant due to efficient cosmic ray acceleration was investigated by adopting a lower adiabatic index. Results. If we assume that the injection efficiency of electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process at the shock follows the quasi-parallel scenario, the hard X-ray morphology of SN 1006 with bumps in the bright NE and SW regions can be generally reproduced by employing cavities in the background medium in the non-modification scenario. Furthermore, in the modification case with a lower adiabatic index of 1 : 2 for the remnant evolved in a uniform medium, bubbles can be produced with relatively small extensions on the SNR boundary that result from the hydrodynamical instabilities that in turn overtake the forward shock. Conclusions. The SNR propagating in the turbulent medium with a relatively small amplitude can reproduce the knotty and filamentary morphology of the remnant better than what evolved in the uniform environment; moreover, the big bump on the NE limb can be explained as the result of a lower-density region, which has a radius of about 2.5 pc and a density of about 0.4 times of the general ambient medium, swept by the shock front, and the other smaller ones on the SW limb can either be reproduced with smaller regions with lower densities swept by the shock or be explained as the protrusions in the scenario of the efficient cosmic ray acceleration when the instability fingers effectively overtake the forward shock.

Taiwania thrives in unstable habitats on riverbanks in deep valleys, on steep slopes, on cliffs, on roadsides and by mountain paths at the altitudes of 1175-2500 m a. s. l. All these locations were subject to frequent landslides, whereas Taiwania was very rare at similar altitudes on stable gentle slopes or on mountain ridges free of major disturbances. The maximum age of Taiwania was calculated to be c. 1,872 yr, with 358 cm DBH (diameter at a height of 1.3 m) and 70 m high. The size and age classes of Taiwania in old-growth forests were multimodal, indicating that the regeneration varied by chance, depending on disturbances. In the old-growth forests where above-ground competition for light was intense, shade-intolerant and long-lived coniferous Taiwania became emergent (40-70 m), rising above a forest canopy comprised of more shade-tolerant evergreen broad-leaved trees. The reproduction of the species was mainly by means of minute wind-dispersed seeds falling into rock crevices on cliffs or a rocky forest floor, or on disturbed sites. These populations depended on disturbances or gap regeneration to survive. Taiwania gave way to evergreen broad-leaved tree species of Lithocarpus, Cyclobalanopsis, and Manglietia, and to other conifers such as Tsuga dumosa, where landslides were infrequent. Our results provide insights into the ecological characteristics and survival mechanisms of this East Asian paleoendemic conifer, and contribute to our understanding of the differentiation of forests.

The calculated results show that the octahedral dipole moments of TiO2 are increased by nonmetal doping owing to the changes of lattice parameters, bond length and charges on atoms, which is very effective for the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. Because the impurity energy levels are formed by hybridizing with dopants' p states, O 2p states and Ti 3d states, most dopants could narrow the band gap, resulting in its fundamental absorption edge red-shift to visible-light region. According to the calculated results, the effects of nonmetal doping on electronic structure and optical properties of anatase TiO2 were analyzed and compared, and the roles of nonmetal atoms in TiO2 photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation were clarified. The calculated results could explain the reasons that some nonmetal-doped TiO2 have higher photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation.

Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of M. oleifera. This assembly represents 91.78% of the estimated genome size and contains 19,465 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis between M. oleifera and related woody plant genomes helps clarify the general evolution of this species, while the identification of several species-specific gene families and positively selected genes in M. oleifera may help identify genes related to M. oleifera's high protein content, fast-growth, heat and stress tolerance. This reference genome greatly extends the basic research on M. oleifera, and may further promote applying genomics to enhanced breeding and improvement of M. oleifera.

J	Chen, X; Zhao, Y				Chen, Xu; Zhao, Yue			A linear approach for determining camera intrinsic parameters using tangent circles	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Camera intrinsic parameters; Circular points; Vanishing point; Tangent circle	QUASI-AFFINE INVARIANCE; CALIBRATION	A linear approach using three tangent circles is proposed for determining the intrinsic parameters of cameras. A projected circle can be used to compute the image coordinate of the centre of each tangent circle and to find the points in the image corresponding to the tangent points associated with the images of the centres of the projected circles. The vanishing point can be determined along the circle diameter according to the invariance of the cross-ratio. Solving the equations for the tangent lines produced a curve in the image of the tangent point and its corresponding point. The other vanishing point can be obtained from the intersection point of the two tangent lines. With vanishing points in two orthogonal directions, the intrinsic parameters can be linearly determined. The results of our experiments show that this approach is effective and highly precise.

However, a conventional CDS circuit inevitably introduces new noise since it consists of several active analog components such as operational amplifiers. This paper proposes a digital CDS circuit technique, which transforms the pre-amplified CCD signal into a train of digital presentations by a high-speed data acquisition card directly without the noisy CDS circuit, then implements the digital CDS algorithm through a numerical method. A readout noise of 3.3 e(-) and an energy resolution of 121 eV@5.9 keV can be achieved via the digital CDS technique.

The propagation properties of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam of circular and elliptical symmetry are investigated. According to the Collins formula under paraxial conditions, analytical formulas of the average intensity and the effective beam radius of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam are derived. Compared with a general flat-topped hollow beam by using numerical simulation, the propagation characteristics of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam are studied in detail. The relationships between the effective beam radius and propagation distance z are also provided graphically. From the graphical outputs of the receiver plane, it is observed that a flat-topped vortex hollow beam propagating to the far field still maintains a dark hollow spot and the radius of the dark hollow spot will get gradually larger as the propagation distance is extended. Furthermore, the flat-topped vortex hollow beam carrying the orbital angular momentum can be widely applied in atomic optics.

Due to their self-similarity, the analytical results of the exact controllability are obtained, and the minimum sets of driver nodes (drivers) are also identified by elementary transformations on adjacency matrices. For these two types of undirected networks, no matter their links are unweighted or (nonzero) weighted, the controllability of networks and the configuration of drivers remain the same, showing a robustness to the link weights. These results have implications for the control of real networked systems with self-similarity.

The fundamental parameters influencing PhOH transport, such as pH of the feed solution, stirring speed, carrier concentration, initial PhOH concentration and NaOH concentration in the stripping solution, were determined. The most acceptable for PhOH transport efficiency was observed under the following conditions: stirring speed of 800 rpm in both phases, 20% (v/v) BESO in kerosene as carrier, 2.13 mmol L-1 (200 mg L-1) PhOH in pH 2.00 solution and 0.20 mol L-1 NaOH as the stripping solution. Up to 91% of the PhOH in solution was transported from the feed phase to the stripping phase after 12 h of transport process at a permeation coefficient of 735 x 10(-6) rn s(-1) under optimum conditions. A model depicting PhOH transport across the SLM was proposed. Experimental results revealed that the diffusion coefficient of the PhOH complex across the membrane was 6.15 x 10(-11) m(2) S-1 and the thickness of the aqueous diffusion layer was calculated to be 7.74 x 10(-5) m. The results achieved in this study indicate that the SLM system developed with BESO/kerosene as the carrier could be a useful tool for removing PhOH from wastewaters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the commonly used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are sensitive to noise interference. To resolve the problem, a robust feature extraction method, called harmonic Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (HMFCCs), is proposed for acoustic target classification. By combining an acoustic signal's harmonic model with the MFCC method, the HMFCC has the ability to emphasize the signals emitted by the principal acoustic components of the target. In the experiment conducted for this study, three data sets are sampled under the same conditions, except for wind power levels. Then the classifier, which is trained by one of the three data sets, is used to recognize the others data sets. According to the experimental results, the HMFCC-based classification accuracies of the three data sets are higher than those of other state-of-the-art methods, indicating that HMFCC is a kind of noise-insensitive feature.

The results found that PECGp had a 96 kDa molecular weight. The backbone chains were composed of alpha-D-Glc and alpha-L-Rha linked by (1 -> 4) glycosidic bonds. (1 -> 4,6) linked alpha-D-Glc and (1 -> 2,4) linked alpha-L-Rha in backbone chains with branches consisting of (1 -> 4) linked alpha-D-Glc and terminal alpha-D-Glc-6-COOH. The assay of cardioprotective activities demonstrated that PECGp could significantly reduce the ST-segment elevation, prevented abnormal changes of heart muscle morphology, reverse abnormal hemodynamic and hemorheological parameters, rectify disorganized superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB fraction and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The results suggested that PECGp could be considered as a potential candidate for developing novel cardioprotective agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we are to achieve the global uncertain knowledge during a period of time for decision-making or action selection by fussing or combining the participating uncertainties of multiple time slices consistently while satisfying the demands of high efficiency and instantaneousness. We adopt qualitative probabilistic network (QPN), the qualitative abstraction of BN, as the underlying framework of modeling and fusing time-series uncertain knowledge. The BNs in continuous time slices constitute time-series BNs, from which we derive time-series QPNs. Taking time-series BNs as input, we propose a QPN-based approach to fuse time-series uncertainties in line with temporal specialties. First, for each time slice, we enhance the implied QPN by augmenting interval-valued weights derived from the corresponding BN, and then obtain the QPN with weighted influences, denoted EQPN (Enhanced Qualitative Probabilistic Network), which provides a quantitative and conflict-free basis for fusing uncertain knowledge. Then, we give the method for fusing the graphical structures of time-series EQPNs based on the concept of Markov equivalence. Following, we give a superposition method for fusing qualitative influences of time-series EQPNs. Experimental results show that our method is not only efficient, but also effective. Meanwhile, the simulation results when applying time-series EQPNs and the fusion algorithm to a robotic system show that our method is applicable in realistic intelligent situations.

The adp is one candidate gene which potentially play a vital role in the colonization from our previous random mutagenesis screening results. To analyse the functional role of this gene, we constructed the adp knockout mutant through customized transcription activator-like effectors nucleases (TALEN), which has been successfully used in yeasts, nematodes, zebrafish and human pluripotent cells. Here, we first time report this knockout method in bacteria on this paper. Bioassay experiments demonstrated that the adp knockout mutant of B16 showed considerably lower colonization activity, reduced numbers of intestines and less than 80% nematocidal activity compared with the wild-type strain when infected for 48 h. However, no obvious change on proteolytic activity was observed in the mutant. Conversely, the complementation of adp gene restored most of the above deficient phenotypes. These results indicated that the adp gene was involved in surface adhesion and played a comparatively important role in colonizing host nematodes. Moreover, TALENs successfully disrupt target genes in bacteria.

The taxonomic position of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) belong to the genus Actinomadura. Both strains form extensively-branched substrate and aerial mycelia which differentiated into short spore chains. The cell wall of the two strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, while the whole-cell sugars detected were glucose, madurose, mannose and rhamnose. The polar lipid profile of strain YIM 77502(T) was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified polar lipid, while strain YIM 77510(T) consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and phosphatidylinositol. The respiratory quinones of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8). The major fatty acids (> 10 %) of strain YIM 77502(T) were C-17:0, iso-C-16:0, C(17:0)10-methyl and iso-C-18:0, and those of strain YIM 77510(T) were iso-C-16:0, C(17:0)10-methyl and iso-C-18:0. The G+C contents of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were determined to be 71.3 and 70.2 mol%, respectively. The DNA-DNA hybridization values of strains YIM 77502(T), YIM 77510(T) and their closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinomadura echinospora BCRC 12547(T) and Actinomadura umbrina KCTC 9343(T) were less than 70 %. Based on the morphological and physiological properties, and phylogenetic analyses, strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) are considered to represent two novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the names Actinomadura amylolytica sp. nov. (type strain YIM 77502(T) = DSM 45822(T) = CCTCC AA 2012024(T)) and Actinomadura cellulosilytica sp. nov. (type strain YIM 77510(T) = DSM 45823(T) = CCTCC AA 2012023(T)) are proposed.

Clonal facultative epiphytes occur in both forest canopies (epiphytic habitats) and forest understories (terrestrial habitats). Because environmental conditions, especially water and nutrients, are more stressful and heterogeneous in the canopy than in the understorey, this study hypothesizes that clonal integration is more important for facultative epiphytes in epiphytic habitats than in terrestrial habitats. Methods In a field experiment, an examination was made of the effects of rhizome connection (connected vs. disconnected, i.e. with vs. without clonal integration) on survival and growth of single ramets, both young and old, of the facultative epiphytic rhizomatous fern Selliguea griffithiana (Polypodiaceae) in both epiphytic and terrestrial habitats. In another field experiment, the effects of rhizome connection on performance of ramets were tested in small (10 x 10 cm(2)) and large (20 x 20 cm(2)) plots in both epiphytic and terrestrial habitats. Key Results Rhizome disconnection significantly decreased survival and growth of S. griffithiana in both experiments. The effects of rhizome disconnection on survival of single ramets and on ramet number and growth in plots were greater in epiphytic habitats than in terrestrial habitats. Conclusions Clonal integration contributes greatly to performance of facultative epiphytic ferns, and the effects were more important in forest canopies than in forest understories. The results therefore support the hypothesis that natural selection favours genotypes with a higher degree of integration in more stressful and heterogeneous environments.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	The analog Resistive Plate Chamber detector of the ARGO-YBJ experiment	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						Air shower detection; RPC detector; Calorimetry	EXTENSIVE AIR-SHOWERS; GEOMAGNETIC-FIELD; READ-OUT; CALIBRATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; RPCS; LEP	The ARGO-YBJ experiment has been in stable data taking from November 2007 till February 2013 at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Observatory (4300 m a.s.l.). The detector consists of a single layer of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) (6700 m(2)) operated in streamer mode. The signal pick-up is obtained by means of strips facing one side of the gas volume. The digital readout of the signals, while allows a high Space-time resolution in the shower front reconstruction, limits the measurable energy to a few hundred TeV. In order to fully investigate the 1-10 PeV region, an analog readout has been implemented by instrumenting each RPC with two large size electrodes facing the other side of the gas volume. Since December 2009 the RPC charge readout has been in operation on the entire central carpet (similar to 5800 m(2)). In this configuration the detector is able to measure the particle density at the core position where it ranges from tens to many thousands of particles per m(2). Thus ARGO-YBJ provides a highly detailed image of the charge component at the core of air showers. In this paper we describe the analog readout of RPCs in ARGO-YBJ and discuss both the performance of the system and the physical impact on the EAS measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fan, H; He, DM; Wang, HL				Fan, Hui; He, Daming; Wang, Hailong			Environmental consequences of damming the mainstream Lancang-Mekong River: A review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Review						Dam construction; Environmental impacts; Ecosystem responses; Lancang cascade dams; Mekong River; Transboundary waterway	HYDROPOWER DAM CONSTRUCTION; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; MANWAN RESERVOIR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENT LOAD; IMPACTS; BASIN; PHYTOPLANKTON	Damming rivers to generate hydropower can help mitigate the world's energy crisis and reduce the risk of global climate change; however, damming can also produce enormous negative effects on the environment and ecosystems. The mainstream Lancang-Mekong River within China has been planned as one of the thirteen state hydropower bases. To date, there have been six operational dams along the mainstream Lancang River, and the 15 remaining dams of the proposed Lancang cascade will be completed in the next decades. In this paper, we examined several crucial environmental changes and ecological responses that have resulted from the construction and operation of the existing dams of the Lancang cascade. The current literature and observational data suggest that the commissioned dams have led to a decline in the flood season water discharge and annual sediment flux within China's borders, reservoir aggradations, and water quality degradation in the reservoirs, which has negatively affected riverine aquatic biological communities and fish assemblages. In contrast, the dams have only had small unfavorable effects on downstream environments and ecosystems outside of China. Because of the potential environmental and geopolitical risks of the Lancang cascade dams, a long-term basin-wide terrestrial and aquatic monitoring program is urgently required to ensure that regional sustainable development occurs in the Iancang-Mekong River Basin.

Here, we assembled a de novo genome of a Tibetan chicken and resequenced whole genomes of 32 additional chickens, including Tibetan chickens, village chickens, game fowl, and Red Junglefowl, and found that the Tibetan chickens could broadly be placed into two groups. Further analyses revealed that several candidate genes in the calcium-signaling pathway are possibly involved in adaptation to the hypoxia experienced by these chickens, as these genes appear to have experienced directional selection in the two Tibetan chicken populations, suggesting a potential genetic mechanism underlying high altitude adaptation in Tibetan chickens. The candidate selected genes identified in this study, and their variants, may be useful targets for clarifying our understanding of the domestication of chickens in Tibet, and might be useful in current breeding efforts to develop improved breeds for the highlands.

J	Gongbuzeren; Li, YB; Li, WJ				Gongbuzeren; Li, Yanbo; Li, Wenjun			China's Rangeland Management Policy Debates: What Have We learned?	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coupled social-ecological system; nomad settlement; rangeland ecological restoration; rangeland management; rangeland tenure	ECOLOGICAL RESETTLEMENT; INNER-MONGOLIA; WESTERN CHINA; DEGRADATION; ECOSYSTEMS; PROPERTY; HERDERS	In China, three major rangeland management policies have caused dramatic social, economic, and ecological changes for pastoral regions in the past 30 yr: the Rangeland Household Contract Policy (RHCP), Rangeland Ecological Construction Projects (RECPs), and the Nomad Settlement Policy (NSP). The impacts of these policies are greatly debated. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of academic perspectives on the impacts of the three policies and the causes of ineffective and negative effects. The findings demonstrate that academics increasingly report negative impacts of RHCP on the ecosystem, animal husbandry, pastoralist livelihoods, and pastoral society. An increasing number of scholars, although not the majority, attribute the negative impacts to improper policy itself rather than incomplete implementation. Regarding the RECPs, most academics believe that policies have improved the rangeland ecosystem but with obvious negative impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and pastoral society; they attribute the problems to incomplete policy implementation. For the NSP, most academics report positive impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and animal husbandry, although recent researchers have identified negative impacts on pastoral society and the ecosystem. Although they are not in the mainstream, more and more academics attribute the negative impacts to improper policy. Finally, we apply the concept of coupled social-ecological systems (SES) to further analyze the outcomes of these three policies and propose a more flexible and inclusive land tenure policy that recognizes the diverse local institutional arrangements; an integrated RECP framework that considers coadaptation between social and ecological systems; and facilitating voluntary choice in nomad settlement and developing innovative approaches to provide social services for pastoralists who would like to remain in pastoral areas. As these three policy approaches are applied in rangeland management and pastoral development worldwide, this paper may provide useful implications for future policy development in pastoral regions on a global scale.

Using the resummation of the damping rates method developed by Hou and Li, the infrared divergence that appeared in the effective potential calculations of transverse gluon is avoided. The comparisons between the transverse and the longitudinal contributions for heavy quarkonia are discussed. The results show that the dissociation scales of quarkonia in thermal medium are decreased by the transverse gluon contributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To obtain a good imaging quality, we have done a detailed study to acquire optimal configurations for these two optics. In this paper, first, a proper curvature radius for the reflector, an optimized location for the camera, as well as a tolerance for the distortion of images for two designs have been presented. Furthermore, using such optimal configurations, the features of Cherenkov images initiated by proton and iron showers both with two optics have been investigated. Based on these results, it can be concluded that spherical design has the prior optical properties, such as a wider FOV of 16 degrees, a higher and more homogeneous resolution for all incident directions within the 16 degrees FOV and a lower light loss in the spots, as well as more signals collected in an Cherenkov image, relatively shorter arrival time difference for lights in a shower and brighter PMTs in the central part of a shower track. Thus it will be chosen as WFCTA optics. Finally, the optical properties of the two designs with 10 degrees FOV have also been investigated. It should be mentioned that with such a smaller FOV, Davies-cotton optics is an effective design for it has a great imaging quality comparing with the setup of 16 degrees FOV. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cosmic ray proton plus helium energy spectrum measured by the ARGO-YBJ experiment in the energy range 3-300 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; SUPERNOVA REMNANT; AIR-SHOWERS; DETECTOR; SHELL	The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full-coverage air shower detector located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory (Tibet, People's Republic of China, 4300 m a.s.l.). The high altitude, combined with the full-coverage technique, allows the detection of extensive air showers in a wide energy range and offer the possibility of measuring the cosmic ray proton plus helium spectrum down to the TeV region, where direct balloon/space-borne measurements are available. The detector has been in stable data taking in its full configuration from November 2007 to February 2013. In this paper the measurement of the cosmic ray proton plus helium energy spectrum is presented in the region 3-300 TeV by analyzing the full collected data sample. The resulting spectral index is gamma = -2.64 +/- 0.01, the error is dominated by systematic uncertainties. The accurate measurement of the spectrum of light elements with a ground based air shower detector demonstrates the possibility of extending these measurements at larger energies, where galactic cosmic ray sources should run out of power in accelerating light elements.

J	Shen, SK; Wu, FQ; Wang, YH				Shen Shikang; Wu Fuqin; Wang Yuehua			Does the passage of seeds through frugivore gut affect their storage: A case study on the endangered plant Euryodendron excelsum	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GERMINATION PATTERNS; BIRD INGESTION; DISPERSAL; CONSEQUENCES; BEHAVIOR; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; TEMPERATURE; SURVIVAL; DISTANCE	Plant-frugivore mutualism serves an important function in multiple ecological processes. Although previous studies have highlighted the effect of frugivore gut passage on fresh seed germinability, no study has investigated the effect on seed storage after frugivore gut passage. We used the endangered plant, Euryodendron excelsum, to determine the combined effects of frugivore gut passage and storage conditions on the germination percentage and rate of seeds. In particular, three treatments that included storage periods, storage methods, and seed types were designed in the experiment. We hypothesized that seeds that passed through the gut will exhibit enhanced germination capacity and rate during storage. Results showed that the final germination percentage decreased in seeds that passed through the gut, whereas the germination rate increased during seed storage. Germination decreased in most types of seeds under both dry and wet storage after 6 months compared with storage after 1 and 3 months. The results suggest that after frugivore gut passage, E. excelsum seeds cannot form persistent soil seed bank in the field, and were not suitable for species germplasm storage. These finding underscore that seeds that passed through frugivore gut have long-term impact on their viability and germination performance.

Old-World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) have fully developed eyes; the eyes of insectivorous bats are generally degraded, and these bats rely on well-developed echolocation. An exception is the Emballonuridae, which are capable of laryngeal echolocation but prefer to use vision for navigation and have normal eyes. In this study, integrated methods, comprising manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), f-VEP and RNA-seq, were utilized to verify the divergence. The results of MEMRI showed that Pteropodidae bats have a much larger superior colliculus (SC)/inferior colliculus (IC) volume ratio (3:1) than insectivorous bats (1:7). Furthermore, the absolute visual thresholds (log cd/m(2).s) of Pteropodidae (-6.30 and -6.37) and Emballonuridae (-3.71) bats were lower than those of other insectivorous bats (-1.90). Finally, genes related to the visual pathway showed signs of positive selection, convergent evolution, upregulation and similar gene expression patterns in Pteropodidae and Emballonuridae bats.

Simultaneous trace analysis of three phenols (4-aminophenol, 4-AP; 4-chlorophenol, 4-CP; 4-nitrophenol, 4-NP) in tap-water and wastewater samples was performed based on the constructed sensor. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the properties of the modified electrode. The proposed DB beta-CD-MWCNT-modified electrode displayed electrochemical signal superior to those of beta-CD-MWCNT and MWCNT towards 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP. Under optimal conditions, differential pulse voltammetry was used to simultaneously quantify 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP within the concentration range of 0.01-20, 0.1-200, and 0.1-200 mu M, respectively. The detection limits (S/N=3) of the DB beta-CD-MWCNT nanohybrid electrode for 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP were 0.0042, 0.028, and 0.048 mu M, respectively. Satisfactory results revealed that this proposed electrochemical sensor can provide a promising candidate for the simultaneous trace analysis of 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP in environmental monitoring of water and wastewater samples. The present work might broaden the channel toward the application of bridged CD in the electrochemical sensing or biosensing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The bi-MBs could capture and separate avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 AIV) from complex samples efficiently based on the specific reaction between antigen-antibody and their good magnetic response, which simplified sample pretreatment and saved the detection time. Taking advantages of their high surface to volume ratio and rich surface functional groups, multiple alkaline phosphatase (ALP) signal molecules were tethered on the surface of bi-MBs which greatly amplified the detection signal. As an efficient signal amplification strategy, enzyme-induced metallization had been integrated with bi-MBs and anodic stripping voltammetry to construct an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for H7N9 AIV detection. Under the optimal conditions, the introduction of bi-MBs could amplify the detection signal in about four times compared with the same immunoassay without MBs, and the method showed a wide linear range of 0.01-20 ng/mL with a detection limit of 6.8 pg/mL. The electrochemical immunosensor provides a simple and reliable platform with high sensitivity and selectivity which shows great potential in early diagnosis of diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Terahertz plasmon-polariton modes in graphene driven by electric field inside a Fabry-Perot cavity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MONOLAYER GRAPHENE; PHONON MODES; SURFACE; EXCITATION; OPTICS	We present a theoretical study on plasmon-polariton modes in graphene placed inside an optical cavity and driven by a source-to-drain electric field. The electron velocity and electron temperature are determined by solving self-consistently the momentum-and energy-balance equations in which electron interactions with impurities, acoustic-, and optic-phonons are included. Based on many-body self-consistent field theory, we develop a tractable approach to study plasmon-polariton in an electron gas system. We find that when graphene is placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity, two branches of the plasmon-polariton modes can be observed and these modes are very much optic-or plasmon-like. The frequencies of these modes depend markedly on driving electric field especially at higher resonant frequency regime. Moreover, the plasmon-polariton frequency in graphene is in terahertz (THz) bandwidth and can be tuned by changing the cavity length, gate voltage, and driving electric field. This work is pertinent to the application of graphene-based structures as tunable THz plasmonic devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Zhao, C. X.; Xu, W.; Li, L.

J	Mellah, H; Zhang, XP; Shen, DY				Mellah, Hakim; Zhang, Xiupu; Shen, Dongya			Analysis of optical fiber-based LP01 <-> LP02 mode converters for the O-, S-, and C-Band	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							MULTIPLEXER; TRANSMISSION; CONVERSION; COUPLERS; WAVELENGTH	This paper proposes a double fiber taper-based mode converter that converts LP01 to LP02 and vice versa. The first taper is used to convert LP01 to some higher order LP0m (m > 1) modes while the second taper suppresses the undesired higher order modes (m > 2) and results in LP02 overwhelmingly dominated. A simulation shows that conversion efficiency of almost 100% at the central wavelength of O-, S-, and C-Band, and above 98% over the S- and C-Band was achieved. Moreover, suppression of undesired higher order modes is more than 10 dB over the whole O-, S-, and C- Band. In particular, the suppression is more than 19 dB for the whole C-Band. The analysis also shows that the performance of the mode converter is not sensitive to slight variations of the converter's parameters. The same converter also can be used to convert LP02 back to LP01. It is shown that conversion efficiency higher than 99% and suppression of undesired higher order modes higher than 30 dB can be obtained. Further, a (de) multiplexer for an LP02 and an LP01 mode was designed using the mode converter combined with a symmetric directional coupler. The multiplexer is broadband and has an insertion loss less than 0.5 dB in the C-Band.

The energy range covered by this analysis, from similar to 350 GeV to similar to 2 TeV, allows the connection of the region explored by Fermi with the multi-TeV measurements carried out by Milagro. Our analysis has been focused on two selected regions of the Galactic plane, i.e., 40 degrees < l < 100 degrees and 65 degrees < l < 85 degrees (the Cygnus region), where Milagro observed an excess with respect to the predictions of current models. Great care has been taken in order to mask the most intense gamma-ray sources, including the TeV counterpart of the Cygnus cocoon recently identified by ARGO-YBJ, and to remove residual contributions. The ARGO-YBJ results do not show any excess at sub-TeV energies corresponding to the excess found by Milagro, and are consistent with the predictions of the Fermi model for the diffuse Galactic emission. From the measured energy distribution we derive spectral indices and the differential flux at 1 TeV of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the sky regions investigated.

HUST012 was isolated from the stems of the medicinal plant Dracaena cochinchinensis Lour. Strain HUST012 showed antimicrobial and antitumor activities which were significantly much higher than those of dragon's blood extracted from D. cochinchinensis Lour. On further analysis, the strain was found to produce two metabolites, SPE-B11.8 (elucidated to be a novel metabolite (Z)-tridec-7-ene-1,2,13-tricarboxylic acid) and SPE-B5.4 (elucidated as Actinomycin-D). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration values of SPE-B11.8 against a set of test bacterial organisms (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermis ATCC 35984, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883) ranged between 15.63 and 62.5 mu g/ml while that for SPE-B5.4 ranged between 0.04 and 2.24 mu g/ml. The compound SPE-B11.8 showed cytotoxic effect at 41.63 and 29.54 mu g/ml IC50-values against Hep G2 and MCF-7, respectively, while the compound SPE-B5.4 exhibited stronger activities against them at 0.23 and 0.18 mu g/ml IC50-values.

Their removal capacities of organic substance and nitrogen as well as the effects of loading rate (LR), outflow temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration were investigated and compared. Efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD) eliminations were achieved by the IVCWs, with the mass removal rates increasing linearly with the increasing LRs strongly, achieving average value of 56.07g m(-2) d(-1) at the highest loading rate. Nevertheless, the effluent COD concentrations also increased, with the average value exceeding Class I A discharge standard (< 50mg L-1) for municipal wastewater treatment plants in China at the highest loading rate. Greater total nitrogen (TN) mass removal rates but lower efficiencies were obtained at the high LR for both types of wastewater, and better removal was achieved for nitrified wastewater (NW) in comparison to domestic wastewater (DW), probably due to the prevailing anoxic conditions inside the IVCW beds restricted nitrification process of DW. The influences of LR, temperature and DO on COD removal were slight, but all remarkable on TN reduction. As compared to DO, temperature was more crucial for nitrogen removal, and the temperature dependence coefficient for TN removal of low LR of NW was significantly greater than others.

Based on this, a quick method to measure the liquid diffusion coefficient is proposed, i.e. using a specially designed asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens as both diffusive pool and imaging element. By means of this system with the liquid-core cylindrical lens to measure the diffusion coefficient, we can eliminate the spherical aberration and improve the accuracy in refractive index measurement. Based on the spatially resolving ability of the cylindrical lens in measuring the refractive index, only one instantaneous diffusive picture is required. Depending on the correspondence between the image width and the refractive index, we thus can quickly calculate the diffusion coefficient D by the Fick's second law. Then the diffusive process of ethylene glycol in water at 25 degrees C is investigated by this method. We calculate the diffusion coefficient between 660-3000 s with the method to analyse an instantaneous diffusion picture. At the beginning, injection will cause the liquid turbulent, and thus create a larger diffusion coefficient. In the course of diffusion, the influence of turbulence on the diffusion coefficient gradually decreases, but the image narrowing can make inaccurate results. Therefore, this method is required to be used at an appropriate time and an appropriate position to reduce experimental errors. After repeated experiments we can conclude that, between 1500-2700 s we may select the appropriate measurement of location for measuring liquid diffusion coefficient by the method to analyze an instantaneous diffusive picture. This not only can avoid the effect of turbulence but also avoid the effect of fewer sampling points. Compared with other methods reported in the literature, the results show that this method is characterized by short time (similar to 20 ms) in data acquisition, faster measurement (<1 s), high-accuracy (relative error <3%), and easy operation, thus providing a new method for measuring the diffusion coefficient of liquids rapidly.

These have been first applied in the chemiluminescence field with outstanding performance. The functionalized MOFs not only maintain an excellent catalytic activity inheriting from Hemin but also can be cyclically utilized as solid mimic peroxidases in the neutral condition. The synthesized Hemin@HKUST-1 composites have been used to develop practical sensors for H2O2 and glucose with wide response ranges and low detection limits. It was envisioned that catalyst-functionalized MOFs for chemiluminescence sensing would have promising applications in green, selective, and sensitive detection of target analytes in the future.

NOV.; GLYCOMYCES; MEMBER; SOIL	A novel endophytic actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 64602(T), was isolated from healthy stems of Tripterygium wilfordii. It grew at 15-40 degrees C, pH 6.0-9.0 and in the presence of 0-3% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain VIM 64602(T) belongs to the genus Stackebrandtia. Whole-cell hydrolysates of strain YIM 64602(T) contained the amino acid meso-diaminopimelic acid with the sugars mannose, rhamnose and glucose, and a trace of ribose. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphati-dylmethylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine. MK-10(H-6), MK-10(H-4) and MK-11(H-4) were the predominant components in the quinone system. The fatty-acid pattern was mainly composed of the saturated branched-chain acids iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-10:0 and iso-C-17:0. The DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed the highest pairwise sequence identity (96.0798.5%) with the members of the genus Stackebrandtia. Strain VIM 64602(T) displayed a DNA-DNA relatedness of 43.9+/-0.4% with the type strain Stackebrandtia albiflava YIM 45751(T). Based on evidence from this polyphasic study, strain YIM 64602(T) (=BCRC 16954(T)=DSM 45928(T)) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Stackebrandtia, for which the name Stackebrandtia endophytica is proposed.

Yet the impact of the latter was often ignored by previous EF determinations. We developed piecewise statistical models (PMs) to explain how the N2O EFs in agricultural soils depend upon various predictors such as climate, soil attributes, and agricultural management. The PMs are derived from a new Bayesian Recursive Regression Tree algorithm. The PMs were applied to the case of EFs from agricultural soils in China, a country where large EF spatial gradients prevail. The results indicate substantial improvements of the PMs compared with other EF determinations. First, PMs are able to reproduce a larger fraction of the variability of observed EFs for upland grain crops (84%, n=381) and paddy rice (91%, n=161) as well as the ratio of EFs to nitrogen application rates (73%, n=96). The superior predictive accuracy of PMs is further confirmed by evaluating their predictions against independent EF measurements (n=285) from outside China. Results show that the PMs calibrated using Chinese data can explain 75% of the variance. Hence, the PMs could be reliable for upscaling of N2O EFs and fluxes for regions that have a phase space of predictors similar to China. Results from the validated models also suggest that climatic factors regulate the heterogeneity of EFs in China, explaining 69% and 85% of their variations for upland grain crops and paddy rice, respectively. The corresponding N2O EFs in 2008 are 0.840.18% (as N2O-N emissions divided by the total N input) for upland grain crops and 0.650.14% for paddy rice, the latter being twice as large as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 defaults. Based upon these new estimates of EFs, we infer that only 22% of current arable land could achieve a potential reduction of N2O emission of 50%.

While the development of methods for microarray data with only two classes is relevant, developing more efficient algorithms for classification with any number of classes is important. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection approach for multi-class classification, which can identify relevant genes by assessing sets of genes jointly. We consider a multinomial probit model with a generalized g-prior for the regression coefficients. An efficient algorithm using simulation-based MCMC methods are developed for simulating parameters from the posterior distribution. This algorithm is robust to the choice of initial value, and produces posterior probabilities of relevant genes for biological interpretation. We demonstrate the performance of the approach with two well-known gene expression profiling data: leukemia data, lymphoma data, SRBCTs data and NCI60 data. Compared with other classification approaches, our approach selects smaller numbers of relevant genes and obtains competitive classification accuracy based on obtained results.

In order to design and find potent B-Raf inhibitors (BRIs), 3D pharmacophore models were created using the Genetic Algorithm with Linear Assignment of Hypermolecular Alignment of Database (GALAHAD). The best pharmacophore model obtained which was used in effective alignment of the data set contains two acceptor atoms, three donor atoms and three hydrophobes. In succession, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed on 39 imidazopyridine BRIs to build three dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) models based on both pharmacophore and docking alignments. The CoMSIA model based on the pharmacophore alignment shows the best result (q(2) = 0.621, r(pred)(2) = 0.885). This 3D QSAR approach provides significant insights that are useful for designing potent BRIs. In addition, the obtained best pharmacophore model was used for virtual screening against the NCI2000 database. The hit compounds were further filtered with molecular docking, and their biological activities were predicted using the CoMSIA model, and three potential BRIs with new skeletons were obtained.

The source was in an active state during the whole monitoring campaign, showing intraday variability in 11 of 72 days. The average magnitudes in each band were B = 14.398, V = 13.821, R = 13.255, and I = 12.885. The overall variability amplitudes were Delta B = 1.(m)834, Delta V = 2.(m)167, Delta R = 2.(m)148, and Delta I = 1.(m)912. The structure function showed that typical timescales for intraday variability were between approximately 2 and 7.5 hr. The intraday variability amplitudes were from a few percent to approximately 30%. We found typical variation rates of approximately 0.05 mag hr(-1) in both the rising and falling phases, with a minimal variability timescale of 130 minutes. A 10 day period short-term variability was observed simultaneously in the BVRI bands. The discrete correlation function suggests that there is significant correlated variability between the B- and I-band light curves. However, no significant time lags were detected. The spectral behaviors in the different variability episodes were studied, and our observations show bluer-when-brighter behavior on long, short, and intraday timescales for the blazar S5 0716+714. The variability and relevant spectral trends can be explained by the shock-in-jet scenario.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated when periodic signal is introduced additively (or multiplicatively). The impacts of the parameter mu of the reaction, time delay tau, strength K of the feedback loop, multiplicative (D) and additive (Q) noise strengths and cross-correlation strength lambda between two noises on the SNR are discussed. When the periodic signal is introduced additively, our results show (i) the SNR as a function of the parameter mu exhibits a maximum, the existence of the maximum is a characteristic of the parametric resonance (PR) phenomenon; (ii) the SNR as a function of D exhibits only a maximum, however, for the case of SNR as a function of Q exhibits not only a maximum, but also a minimum. The existence of the maximum and minimum in the SNR is the identifying characteristics of the stochastic resonance (SR) and reverse-resonance (RR); and (iii) the increases of tau, K and lambda enhance the SR and weaken the RR. Finally, we compare the resonant phenomenon for the additive periodic signal with that for multiplicative one in the chemical system.

Developing environmental friendly control methods such as novel pheromone and RNAi-related control strategies is imperative to control this pest. In the present study, the full-length cDNA encoding the diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (DH-PBAN) was identified and characterized in S. litura. This 809-bp transcript contains a 573-nucleotide ORF encoding a 191-amino acid protein, from which five putative neuropeptides, including PBAN, DH, and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subesophageal ganglion neuropeptides, were derived. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both the whole protein and each of the five neuropeptides have high similarities to those of DH-PBANs from other insect orders particularly Lepidoptera. Females treated with TKYFSPRLamide (the active core fragment of PBAN) produced significantly more four types of pheromone compounds (A; B; C; D) than controls. RNA interference by injection of PBAN dsRNA significantly reduced the relative expression levels of this gene in adult females (approximately reduced by 60%). As a consequence, females treated with PBAN dsRNA produced significantly less four types of pheromone compounds (A; B; C; D) than controls. These results suggest that PBAN function in activating sex pheromone biosynthesis and the RNAi of DH-PBAN gene can be induced by the injection of dsRNA into the body cavity in S. litura. This study suggests the possibility of novel pheromone-related pest control strategies based on RNAi techniques.

Methods-In vitro, the appearances of 3 samples of different flat mesh and a mesh plug on both ABVS and handheld US examinations were evaluated. In vivo, 97 patients received both ABVS and handheld US examinations in the incisional region. The frequency used for handheld US was 11 MHz. The presence of the previously implanted mesh in the incisional region was evaluated and compared between the US modalities. The identified results were confirmed by surgical findings. Results-In the in vitro study, the ABVS had more visualized and efficient imaging results for implanted mesh than handheld US. In the in vivo study, among 97 cases, 39 and 32 were identified as regions with mesh by the ABVS and handheld US, respectively. The ABVS had better identification performance than handheld US in terms of accuracy (94.8% versus 83.5%), sensitivity (90.5% versus 69.0%), and specificity (98.2% versus 94.5%). The kappa values showed that handheld US had substantial agreement with surgical findings (kappa = 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.90), whereas the ABVS had almost perfect agreement with surgical findings (kappa = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.00). More importantly, the ABVS could display the texture of light weight mesh in the coronal plane. The specificity and sensitivity for mesh texture were 100.0% (55 of 55) and 94.4% (17 of 18), respectively. Conclusions-The use of an ABVS may help identify the presence of implanted mesh after incisional hernia repair in some cases in which the implant is difficult to appreciate on handheld US imaging with an 11-MHz transducer.

The results show that the spatial distribution of the magnetic anomalies in Tarim Basin coincides with the regional tectonic structure, i.e., a basin sandwiched between mountain ranges. Shallow parts of the Curie surface are located in uplifted zones of the basin and correspond well to high values of heat flow. In contrast, deep parts of the Curie surface, having low values of heat flow, are distributed along the depression zones of the basin. The Curie point depth is consistent with the measured heat flow value, with a correlation coefficient of 0.65.

This strategy could accumulate the enzyme-generated product on the surface of the magneto electrode by means of silver deposition, which amplified the detection signal about 80 times. The use of magnetic beads (MBs) and the magneto electrode could also amplify the detection signal. Furthermore, a bi-electrode signal transduction system was introduced into this immunosensor, which is also beneficial to the immunoassay. A concentration as low as 0.011ngmL(-1) of H7N9 AIV could be detected in about 1.5h with good specificity. This study not only provides a simple and sensitive approach for virus detection but also offers an effective signal enhancement strategy for the development of highly sensitive MB-based electrochemical immunoassays.

Corrosion inhibition of mild steel by methyl violet and bromide ion in sulfuric acid solution	MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION			English	Article						corrosion; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; methyl violet; mild steel; polarization curves	COLD-ROLLED STEEL; CHLORIDE-ION; SYNERGISTIC INHIBITION; GEMINI SURFACTANT; POTASSIUM-IODIDE; O-PHENANTHROLINE; SODIUM-CHLORIDE; ADSORPTION; BENZOTRIAZOLE; DISSOLUTION	The corrosion inhibition behavior of methyl violet in the absence and presence of bromide ion on mild steel in sulfuric acid solution has been studied by weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that the corrosion of mild steel is obviously reduced by methyl violet in combination with bromide ion. Electrochemical studies show that methyl violet and bromide ion act as mixed type inhibitors retarding the cathodic and anodic corrosion reactions with emphasis on the former and do not change the mechanism of either hydrogen evolution reaction or mild steel dissolution. The corrosion reaction is controlled by charge-transfer process. The adsorption of the inhibitors on the mild steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The calculated thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (Delta G(ads)(o), Delta H-ads(o), Delta S-ads(o), Delta K-ads, and E-a) reveal a strong interaction between inhibitors and mild steel surface. The values of Delta G(ads)(o) show that the inhibitors are adsorbed on the mild steel surface in sulfuric acid by chemical adsorption mechanism.

Processing mineralogy and mineral phase reconstruction behavior at high temperature and slow cooling treatment were examined by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Anosovite solid solution is the main titanium product by the direct reduction and smelting process. Results of slow-cooling experiments show that crystal volume and size increase as cooling rate decreases. Anosovite and gangue mineral crystals develop fully with large crystal volume and size at a cooling rate of 2 K.min(-1). Moreover, the growth of anosovite crystal was characterized by crystal nucleation and growth theory. These results provide further insights into the separation of anosovite from gangue by mineral processing.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain YIM Y792(T) belongs to the genus Delftia. Strain YIM Y792(T) shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Delftia lacustris DSM 21246(T) (93.96 %), Delftia tsuruhatensis NBRC 16741(T) (93.74 %), and Delftia acidovorans NBRC 14950(T) (93.62 %). Growth of the strain YIM Y792(T) was found to occur at 20-45 A degrees C (optimum at 30 A degrees C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum at pH 7.0), and salinities of 0-3.0 % NaCl (optimum at 1.0 %). The new bacterium exhibits typical chemotaxonomic features of the genus Delftia with ubiqinone-8 (Q-8) as the predominant quinone and C-16:0, Summed feature 3, Summed Feature 8 as major fatty acids (> 10 %). The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid, two unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified lipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain YIM Y792(T) was found to be 70.3 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain YIM Y792(T) and D. lacustris DSM 21246(T), D. tsuruhatensis NBRC16741(T), D. acidovorans NBRC14950(T) were 35.5 +/- A 2.0, 17.1 +/- A 1.8, 26.2 +/- A 2.0 %.

The strain formed well-branched substrate mycelia with no fragmentation, and abundant aerial mycelia that differentiated into long spores. The strain was found to grow at 10-55 A degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-7 % (w/v) NaCl. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 70.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 690053(T) belongs to the genus Marinactinospora, and it shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Marinactinospora thermotolerans SCSIO 00652(T) (98.96 %). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between the two strains was 37.85 +/- A 2.77 %. Based on the differences in the molecular and biochemical characteristics from its closest relative, strain YIM 690053(T) is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Marinactinospora, for which the name Marinactinospora endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 690053(T)(=KCTC 29664(T) = DSM 46799(T)).

Porous Co3O4-CeO2 was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscopy imaging, N-2 adsorption/desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause. Co3O4-CeO2 with the 3D hierarchical porous structure consisting of nanoparticles is a coral-like shape with a size of tens of micrometers and exhibits the hierarchically porous morphology, in which the walls of the macropores contain smaller mesopores. The catalytic performance of the porous Co3O4-CeO2 for CO oxidation has been studied. Among the obtained catalysts, the porous Co3O4-CeO2 with 20 wt% Co exhibits the best catalytic activity and the 50 % CO conversion can be reached at 74 A degrees C. The presence of transition metal element Co can promote the production of oxygen vacancies and improve oxygen mobility, which result in enhancing the oxygen-storage capacity of porous Co3O4-CeO2 and its catalytic performance for CO conversion.

A relatively simple, low input cultivation technique and the sustainability of its products are the main drivers for a future expansion of the hemp crop. In Europe, the large political support of bioenergy in recent years has fuelled numerous studies on the potential cultivation of hemp for bioenergy production. In China the main drivers for a renewed interest in hemp are its traditional applications. For any given destination, the main target of hemp cultivation is the maximization of biomass production, but each end-use destination has specific quality requirements in terms of properties of the bast fibre, characteristics of the oil and proteins in the seeds, or profile of secondary metabolites in the inflorescence. In this paper, traditional and innovative end use destinations and cultivation systems for hemp are introduced, together with some notes on hemp botany, biology, and resource use efficiency. This information, together with a review of the practical experience of hemp cultivation in Europe and China and knowledge gathered form scientific literature, highlights the effect of agronomic factors in determining the yield potential and quality level of hemp for specific end use destinations. To conclude, future perspectives and recommendations for hemp cultivation and research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We developed a computer-aided system to improve the reliability of three components of the Lenke classification. The system semi-automatically measured the Cobb angles and identified the apical lumbar vertebra and its pedicles on digitized radiographs. The system then classified the curve type, lumbar modifier, and thoracic sagittal modifier of the Lenke classification based on the computerized measurements and identifications. The system was tested by five operators for 62 scoliotic cases. The kappa statistic was used to assess the reliability. With the aid of computer, the average intra- and interobserver kappa values were improved to 0.89 and 0.81 for the curve type, to 0.83 and 0.81 for the lumbar modifier, and to 0.94 and 0.92 for the sagittal modifier of the Lenke classification, respectively, relative to the classification by two of the operators without the aid of computer. Results indicate that the computerized system can improve reliability for all three components of the Lenke classification.

Here, we report the first de novo assembled 1.35 Gb genome sequences for D. officinale by combining the second-generation Illumina Hiseq 2000 and third-generation PacBio sequencing technologies. We found that orchids have a complete inflorescence gene set and have some specific inflorescence genes. We observed gene expansion in gene families related to fungus symbiosis and drought resistance. We analyzed biosynthesis pathways of medicinal components of D. officinale and found extensive duplication of SPS and SuSy genes, which are related to polysaccharide generation, and that the pathway of D. officinale alkaloid synthesis could be extended to generate 16-epivellosimine. The D. officinale genome assembly demonstrates a new approach to deciphering large complex genomes and, as an important orchid species and a traditional Chinese medicine, the D. officinale genome will facilitate future research on the evolution of orchid plants, as well as the study of medicinal components and potential genetic breeding of the dendrobe.

The obtained samples were characterized by a series of techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption/desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The results show that CdS nanoparticles were dispread and embedded on the MIL-100 crystals. The CdS/MIL-100 composites exhibited significant activities for photocatalytic degradation of nitrite ions through a disproportionation process in a neutral aqueous solution without any sacrificial reagents. When 20 wt% of CdS was embedded, the highest degradation yield of 92 % was achieved in 10-ppm NaNO2 aqueous solution under simulated solar light irradiation, which was fivefold of bare CdS. The enhancement in photocatalytic activities could be contributed to photosensitization and supporting of metal-organic framework scaffold.

To address these issues, we have screened 14,198 individuals (4208 from this study) and analyzed 112 mitogenomes (41 new sequences) to trace west Eurasian maternal ancestry. This has led to the identification of two autochthonous subhaplogroups-HV14a1 and U1a1a4, which are likely to have originated in the Dravidian-speaking populations approximately 10.5-17.9 thousand years ago (kya). The carriers of these maternal lineages might have settled in South India during the time of the spread of the Dravidian language. In addition to this, we have identified several subsets of autochthonous U7 lineages, including U7a1, U7a2b, U7a3, U7a6, U7a7, and U7c, which seem to have originated particularly in the higher-ranked caste populations in relatively recent times (2.6-8.0 kya with an average of 5.7 kya). These lineages have provided crucial clues to the differentiation of the caste system that has occurred during the recent past and possibly, this might have been influenced by the Indo-Aryan migration. The remaining west Eurasian lineages observed in the higher-ranked caste groups, like the Brahmins, were found to cluster with populations who possibly arrived from west Asia during more recent times.

Therefore, this work explores gold(I) extraction using hydrophobic imidazolium-based ionic liquids. RESULTSIt was found that an increase in the alkyl group chain substituted on the cation ring of the ionic liquid corresponded with an increase in gold(I) extraction. Almost all of the gold(I) (>98%) was extracted from the aqueous phase into the organic phase using pure [C(8)mim][PF6] as an extractant. With increased reaction temperature, the gold extraction efficiency also increased. The transfer mechanism of Au(CN)(2)(-) into the ionic liquid was proved to be an anion exchange reaction. Most of the gold(I) (>90%) in the [C(8)mim][PF6] phase could be directly deposited on a copper cathode through electrowinning. Energy dispersive spectrometry analysis and X-ray diffraction patterns suggested that the yellow deposits on the copper cathode were pure gold. Results of three recycling experiments indicated the excellent stability of the [C(8)mim][PF6]. CONCLUSIONIonic liquid extraction followed by direct electrodeposition from the organic phase is a feasible method for gold recovery from alkaline aurocyanide solutions.

Analysis using the solution leads to a conclusion that for a tube with radius at the order of pore size or smaller, tube flow arises dominantly from the Beavers-Joseph condition. For an infinite fine tube, the average velocity approaches the specific flux in the matrix. This paper theoretically reveals the existence of a hyporheic zone in the extreme case of no boudinage, and thickness of the zone is quantified using the intrusion depth of tube water into the matrix.

Although the genus is well delimited, its subdivisions into sections and series have not been the subject of an explicit test of monophyly based on molecular data. A comprehensive examination of the evolutionary relationships within the genus is thus still lacking. We present a fossil-calibrated, molecular phylogeny of Deutzia based on two nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS and 26S) and three chloroplast DNA regions (matK, rbcL, and trnL-F intergenic spacer). Within this framework, we examine character evolution in petal arrangement, filament shape, and the number of stamens, and infer the ancestral area and biogeographic history of the genus. Our molecular phylogeny suggests that Deutzia is monophyletic. Two major clades are recovered: one composed of the species of sect. Neodeutzia from Mexico, and the other containing all remaining Deutzia species of sections Mesodeutzia and Deutzia from SW China and Northeast Asia. The latter two Asian sections were each revealed to be polyphyletic. The induplicate petals, 2-dentate filaments, and polystemonous androecia are inferred to be ancestral character states. Biogeographic reconstructions suggest a Northeast Asian origin for the genus and subsequent spread to Mexico during the Oligocene and to SW China during the Miocene. Based on our results, a new infrageneric classification of Deutzia inferred from molecular phylogeny is required. We propose to merge sections Mesodeutzia and Deutzia to ensure the monophyly at the sectional level. Cooling trends during the Oligocene resulted in isolation, separating eastern Asian and Mexican taxa, while the warm period during the middle Miocene stimulated the diversification from Northeast Asia to SW China. The uplift in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and monsoon regimes are important in promoting high species diversification of Deutzia in SW China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Chabamide, a dimeric alkaloid isolated from Piper chaba Hunter, shows antimalarial, antituberculosis, and cytotoxic activities. However, its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. In this study, the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity and downregulation of P-gp expression by chabamide in adriamycin-resistant human leukemia cells (K562/ADR) was clarified. Results show that chabamide inhibited the growth of K562/ADR cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which was associated with an obvious increase in p21 and decrease in cyclin D1 and CDK2/4/6 protein expression. Moreover, chabamide could regulate the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, increase the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bax and cytochrome c, and decrease the protein expression levels of Bcl-2, caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP-1, and p-Akt. In addition, we found that JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 were regulated by chabamide in K562/ADR cells. Further studies indicated that the decrease in the reactive oxygen species level inhibited intrinsic P-gp expression. Therefore, chabamide-induced apoptosis in K562/ADR cells was associated with Akt/MAPK and the inhibition of P-gp. These results provide a biochemical basis for possible clinical applications of chabamide in the treatment of leukemia. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the early pollen organs are underrepresented, so that their structure and evolution remain poorly known. Here we report a new taxon of pollen organ Placotheca minuta from the Late Devonian. The synangium consists of many basally and more or less laterally fused microsporangia borne on the margin of a pad. The prepollen is spherical and trilete. The appearance of Famennian synangia especially in Placotheca does not support the current understanding that the earliest pollen organs closely resembled the fructifications of the ancestral progymnosperms. Placotheca indicates earlier diversification of pollen organs than previously expected and is highly derived among the early pollen organs with trilete prepollen. It is suggested that, immediately after the origination of seed plants, pollen organs had evolved at a rapid rate, whereas their prepollen remained primitively spore-like.

This paper reports that various combinations of active materials can be strategically selected to construct OLEDs with device working voltages below the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of emitters; i.e., emitted photon energies are higher than applied electrical energies. The operation mechanism of this type of OLED is found to be related to ballistic Auger-electron injection at organic heterojunctions. This Auger-electron injection acts as a built-in voltage booster. The Auger-electron process predicts that the turn-on voltage scales linearly with the energy difference between an acceptor's LUMO and a donor's HOMO. This prediction is in excellent agreement with experimental data.

Through tuning its flowability, the PDMS solution could effectively wet PS NPs, wherein the PS NPs can be embedded in the PDMS during the curing process. This technical innovation saves ill-posed transfer steps as present in traditional operations which may cause damaged nanostructures, and it could be beneficial for preparing a large scale, high quality, and flexible SERS active substrate.

Calibration of the RPC charge readout in the ARGO-YBJ experiment with the iso-gradient method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						RPC; Response difference; Calibration; Iso-gradient method		The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full coverage at of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with an active area of 5800 m(2). In order to eliminate the response difference of the charge readout horn the RPCs, a calibration procedure is carried out with the iso-gradient method. This method also allows the extension of the absolute calibration with the muon telescope including scintillation detectors to all the RPCs in the array. The overall systematic uncertainty in measurements of the number of particles by the RPCs is 10.7%. In general, the method gives results consistent with those from a totally different approach also used in the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is demonstrated that tunneling spectroscopy measurement on Al/AlOx/Pb junction is systematically subjected to hydrostatic pressure up to 2.2 GPa. Under such high pressure, the normal state junction resistance is sensitive to the applied pressure, reflecting the variation of band structure of the barrier material upon pressures. In superconducting state, the pressure dependence of the energy gap Delta(0), the gap ratio 2 Delta(0)/k(B)T(c), and the phonon spectral energy is extracted and compared with those obtained in the limited pressure range. Our experimental results show the accessibility and validity of high pressure tunneling spectroscopy, offering wealthy information about high pressure superconductivity. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Yunnan province is within this region and is a major overwintering area for S. furcifera in China. This field study was carried out over 4 yr (2010-2013) and focused on S. furcifera distribution, population density, and demography, as well as the relationship between various environmental factors and the distribution and density of overwintering S. furcifera in Yunnan. Our study demonstrated that overwintering populations of S. furcifera mainly occurred in valleys and lowlands below 25.02 degrees N and 1,680m above sea level (a.s.l.), where ratooning rice was present. The overwintering range of S. furcifera has expanded in Yunnan compared with 20 yr ago, and regional climate change is believed to be the main contributing cause for this expansion. Environmental factor analysis showed that the mean air temperature of the coldest quarter and precipitation of the coldest quarter were two key factors that were strongly linked to the overwintering distribution and density of S. furcifera in Yunnan. Wintertime temperature was the principal influencing factor to determine the distribution and density of S. furcifera, while the effect of precipitation was indirect in that it influenced the insect's distribution via its host. This study documented the major overwintering areas of S. furcifera in Yunnan, which can be used to predict outbreak potential in the following spring. Hence, key climatic factors, overwintering distribution, and density of S. furcifera should be used when forecasting outbreaks in spring.

Uniformly rd-piecewise almost periodic functions with applications to the analysis of impulsive Delta-dynamic system on time scales	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Time scales; Uniformly rd-piecewise almost periodic functions; Exponential dichotomy; Impulsive dynamic systems; Almost periodic solutions	NICHOLSONS BLOWFLIES MODEL; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; EXPONENTIAL DICHOTOMY; HARVESTING TERM; EXISTENCE; ROUGHNESS; STABILITY; PSEUDO; DELAYS	In the present work, we introduce two equivalent concepts of uniformly rd-piecewise almost periodic functions on time scales and their equivalence is proved, based on this, some basic properties of them are obtained. Then, some new criteria of exponential dichotomy are established for homogeneous D-dynamic system on time scales. Also, some completely new theorems are established on time scales for impulsive almost periodic dynamic systems such as Favard's theorem and exponential dichotomy theorem. As applications, we provide a method to obtain an almost periodic solution for a given nonhomogeneous impulsive dynamic system. Furthermore, we introduce an impulsive non-autonomous Nicholson's blowflies system model with patch structure and multiple nonlinear harvesting terms for which the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solutions are studied, which shows that our results can be applied feasibly and effectively.

This herb is used to validate a target-based drug screening platform called Herbochip(R) and evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of Geranium wilfordii ethanolic extract (GWE) using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as a drug target together with subsequent in vitro and in vivo assays. Methods: A microarray-based drug screening platform was constructed by arraying HPLC fractions of herbal extracts onto a surface-activated polystyrene slide (Herbochip(R)). Using TNF-alpha as a molecular probe, fractions of 82 selected herbal extracts, including GWE, were then screened to identify plant extracts containing TNF-alpha-binding agents. Cytotoxicity of GWE and modulatory effects of GWE on TNF-alpha expression were evaluated by cell-based assays using TNF-alpha sensitive murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells as an in vitro model. Results: The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of GWE were further assessed by animal models including carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats and xylene-induced ear edema in mice, in comparison with aspirin. The hybridization data obtained by Herbochip(R) analysis showed unambiguous signals which confirmed TNF-alpha binding activity in 46 herbal extracts including GWE. In L929 cells GWE showed significant inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha expression with negligible cytotoxicity. GWE also significantly inhibited formation of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema and xylene-induced ear edema in animal models, indicating that it indeed possessed anti-inflammatory activity. Conclusion: We have thus validated effectiveness of the Herbochip(R) drug screening platform using TNF-alpha as a molecular target. Subsequent experiments on GWE lead us to conclude that the anti-RA activity of GWE can be attributed to inhibitory effect of GWE on the key inflammatory factor, TNF-alpha. Our results contribute towards validation of the traditional use of GWE in the treatment of RA and other inflammatory joint disorders.

Optical conductivity of topological insulator thin films	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							HGTE QUANTUM-WELLS; SINGLE DIRAC CONE; SURFACE; BI2SE3; BI2TE3	We present a detailed theoretical study on the optoelectronic properties of topological insulator thin film (TITFs). The k . p approach is employed to calculate the energy spectra and wave functions for both the bulk and surface states in the TITF. With these obtained results, the optical conductivities induced by different electronic transitions among the bulk and surface states are evaluated using the energy-balance equation derived from the Boltzmann equation. We find that for Bi2Se3-based TITFs, three characteristic regimes for the optical absorption can be observed. (i) In the low radiation frequency regime (photon energy (h) over bar omega < 200 meV), the free-carrier absorption takes place due to intraband electronic transitions. An optical absorption window can be observed. (ii) In the intermediate radiation frequency regime (200 < (h) over bar omega < 300 meV), the optical absorption is induced mainly by interband electronic transitions from surface states in the valance band to surface states in the conduction band and an universal value sigma(0) = e(2) / (8<(h)over bar>) for the optical conductivity can be obtained. (iii) In the high radiation frequency regime ((h) over bar omega > 300 meV), the optical absorption can be achieved via interband electronic transitions from bulk and surface states in the valance band to bulk and surface states in the conduction band. A strong absorption peak can be observed. These interesting findings indicate that optical measurements can be applied to identify the energy regimes of bulk and surface states in the TITF.

NOV.; CAVE; STREPTOMYCES; GENETICS	Studies on actinobacterial diversity in limestone habitats are scarce. This paper reports profiling of actinobacteria isolated from Hundung limestone samples in Manipur, India using ARDRA as the molecular tool for preliminary classification. A total of 137 actinobacteria were clustered into 31 phylotypic groups based on the ARDRA pattern generated and representative of each group was subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Generic diversity of the limestone isolates consisted of Streptomyces (15 phylotypic groups), Micromonospora (4), Amycolatopsis (3), Arthrobacter (3), Kitasatospora (2), Janibacter (1), Nocardia (1), Pseudonocardia (1) and Rhodococcus (1). Considering the antimicrobial potential of these actinobacteria, 19 showed antimicrobial activities against at least one of the bacterial and candidal test pathogens, while 45 exhibit biocontrol activities against at least one of the rice fungal pathogens. Out of the 137 actinobacterial isolates, 118 were found to have at least one of the three biosynthetic gene clusters (PKS-I, PKS-II, NRPS). The results indicate that 86% of the strains isolated from Hundung limestone deposit sites possessed biosynthetic gene clusters of which 40% exhibited antimicrobial activities. It can, therefore, be concluded that limestone habitat is a promising source for search of novel secondary metabolites.

Recently, many studies have been focused on the syntheses of MOFs with permanent porosity for various applications. However, no attention has been paid to controllable disassembly of MOFs and related applications. In this work, for the first time we synthesized novel tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized MOFs (i.e., RuMOFs) that could be ion-responsively disassembled and release massive guest materials loaded in the frameworks. The synthesized RuMOFs exhibited much stability in aqueous solutions containing H+, and many metal ions, but could be selectively and sensitively disassembled by Hg2+ ions, resulting in the release of large quantities of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). The target-responsive release mechanism was investigated and discussed in detail. On the basis of the ion-responsive disassembly and release, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence sensing method for Hg2+ has been developed with a very low limit of detection (5.3 X 10(-13) M). It was envisioned that the RuMOFs and similar target-responsive functional MOF materials would have promising applications in ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensing and even in accurately controllable drug delivering and releasing.

Strain JSM 100118(T) was able to grow with 0-13% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2-5 %), at pH 5.5-10.0 (optimum pH 7.5) and at 5-50 degrees C (optimum 30-35 degrees C). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7 and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, C-16:0 and C-16:1 omega 11c. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown glycolipid and an unknown phospholipid. The genomic DNA G +C content was 35.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain JSM 100118(T) belonged to the genus Bacillus, and was most closely related to Bacillus litoralis SW-211(T) (98.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Bacillus halosaccharovorans E33(T) (98.3 %), Bacillus niabensis 4T19(T) (97.8%) and Bacillus herbersteinensis D-1,5a(T) (97.1 %). The combination of results from the phylogenetic analysis, DNA DNA hybridization, and phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization supported the conclusion that strain JSM 100118(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus crassostreae sp. nov. is proposed.

Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and data from phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain NIO-1109(T) was related to the genus Exiguobacterium. Strain NIO-1109(T) exhibited >98.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to Exiguobacterium indicum HHS 31(T) (99.5%) and Exiguobacterium acetylicum NCIMB 9889(T) (99.1 %); the type strains of other species showed <98% similarity. Levels of DNA DNA relatedness between strain NIO-1109(T) and E. acetylicum DSM 20416(T) and E indicum LMG 23471(T) were less than 70% (33.0 +/- 2.0 and 37 +/- 32%, respectively).

In this study, we presented a simple method for rapidly and accurately mapping rubber plantations in the Xishuangbanna region of southwest China using phenology-based vegetation index differencing. Temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Tasselled Cap Greenness (TCG) for rubber trees, natural forests and croplands were constructed using 11 Landsat 8 OLI images acquired within one year. These vegetation index time series accurately demonstrated the unique seasonal phenological dynamics of rubber trees. Two distinct phenological phases (i.e., defoliation and foliation) of rubber trees were clearly distinguishable from natural forests and croplands. Rubber trees undergo a brief defoliation-foliation process between late December and mid-March. Therefore, vegetation index differencing between the nearly complete defoliation (leaf-off) and full foliation (leaf flushing) phases was used to delineate rubber plantations within fragmented tropical mountainous landscapes. The method presented herein greatly improved rubber plantation classification accuracy. Overall classification accuracies derived from the differences of the five vegetation indices varied from 92% to 96% with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0.84-0.92. These results demonstrate the promising potential of phenology-based vegetation index differencing for mapping and monitoring rubber expansion at the regional scale.

J	Jiang, R				Jiang, Rong			A Novel Risk Metric for Staff Turnover in a Software Project Based on Information Entropy	ENTROPY			English	Article						staff turnover; risk metric; software project; information entropy	MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM	Staff turnover in a software project is a significant risk that can result in project failure. Despite the urgency of this issue, however, relevant studies are limited and are mostly qualitative; quantitative studies are extremely rare. This paper proposes a novel risk metric for staff turnover in a software project based on the information entropy theory. To address the gaps of existing studies, five aspects are considered, namely, staff turnover probability, turnover type, staff level, software project complexity, and staff order degree. This paper develops a method of calculating staff turnover risk probability in a software project based on the field, equity, and goal congruence theories. The proposed method prevents the probability of subjective estimation. It is more objective and comprehensive and superior than existing research. This paper not only presents a detailed operable model, but also theoretically demonstrates the scientificity and rationality of the research. The case study performed in this study indicates that the approach is reasonable, effective, and feasible.

It is located on the northeast side of the collision belt between the Indian and Euroasian plates. It is a part of Myanmar Arc seismic structure, belonging to the Himalayan strong-earthquake belt. There are 68 volcanoes distributed in the region of 90 km long in the north-south direction and 50 km wide in the east-west direction. Among them are 4 Holocene (Q(4)) volcanoes, 18 Late-Pleistocene (Q(3)) volcanoes, and 38 Early-Pleistocene (Q(1)) volcanoes. To study the geologic evolution and volcanic activity of the Tengchong Volcano Area, we need to investigate the variation of crustal thickness and the distribution of the Poisson's ratio in the area, as well as the detailed thickness and topography of the lithosphere. We use the seismic data observed by 9 digital broadband stations of Tengchong Earthquake-Monitoring Net from July 2007 through December 2011. The P receiver functions are used to study the crustal thickness and the Poisson's ratio in the region, while the converted phases at the Moho and the LAB in the S receiver functions are utilized to get the depths of the Moho and the LAB. To reduce the noises and remove the effect of the heterogeneity, we stack the P and S receiver functions beneath each station, respectively, to get an averaged trace of P receiver functions and an average trace of S receiver functions. Before the stacking of the weak converted phases from the Moho and the LAB, each seismic event is moveout corrected to the reference epicentral distance of 67 degree (corresponding to the ray parameter of 6.40 s/deg). Based on the IAS91 model, the receiver functions are transformed from the time domain to the depth domain. 1) The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km. 2) The Poisson's ratio of the area mainly varies from 0.26 to 0.32. The ratio beneath 6 stations is over 0.29, which is attributed to the increase of mafic component in the crust. There may exist two magma chambers. 3) The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km. The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km, with a feature of being thick at the north and south ends but thin in the middle (or the Moho is uplifted in the middle part). The Poisson's ratio is between 0.262 and 0.322. Six stations present high Poisson's ratio, and the crust may be partially melted in some local areas. There probably exist two magma chambers on the east side of Mazhang and the area of Tengchong-Shaba, but their scopes need further determination. The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km, being thinner than that of the surrounding area. In the center of the volcano area (i.e., the convergence between the Tengchong volcanic fault and the Yingjiang-Longchuan fault), both the crust and the lithosphere are uplifted. The lithosphere presents a dome shape obviously, caused by the extension and thinning of the lithosphere by the upwelling of the asthenosphere (or the uplift of mantle hot materials).

In this paper, by stochastic simulations, the stationary probability distribution and the mean first passage time are investigated in a groundwater-dependent ecosystem under the influences of environmental fluctuations, seasonal rainfall oscillation and time delay. We investigate a variety of noise-induced behaviors affecting regime shifts between ecosystem states. The results indicate that the phenomena of regime shift, noise enhanced stability (NES) and resonant activation (RA) may emerge in the dynamics of phreatophyte vegetation. Moreover, we also show that the direction of regime shifts depends on the time delay and the cross-correlation between noises. The cross-correlation between noises, the time delay, and the periodic force play a significant role on the NES and RA phenomena.

Mechanical behaviour of masonry walls strengthened by BFRP composites	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						BFRP composite; Strengthening; Masonry wall; In-plane; Seismic performance	FRP	This paper evaluates the in-plane mechanical behaviour of masonry walls strengthened by basalt fibre-reinforced polymer composite material. Based on the seismic performance tests of three masonry walls without any strengthening scheme and three walls with basalt fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening directly under increasing cyclic lateral loading and constant vertical compression loading, the damage characteristics of each specimen were observed. Besides, the ultimate shear strength and deformation performance, ratio of residual deformation, hysteretic behaviour, energy dissipation behaviour, degradation characteristics of bearing capacity and stiffness, fibre strain were analysed. The study results show that the strengthening technique of bonding basalt fibre-reinforced polymer composite material can effectively improve the ultimate shear strength and deformation performance, and the improvement extent of the latter is much larger than that of the former. Those basalt fibre-reinforced polymer-strengthened masonry walls show a distinct slowdown degradation of bear capacity and stiffness, and have better energy dissipation capacity as well as deformation recovery capability.

In this scenario, ultrahigh energy (UHE) protons are assumed to exist in the blazar jet and produce gamma-rays through synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic protons and pair cascades (resulted from p gamma interaction); meanwhile, some of these UHE protons may escape from the jet and are injected into intergalactic space. Therefore, we assume that UHE cosmic rays (UHECRs) originate from relativistic protons in the jet and use energy-independent escape time-scale to obtain UHECR injection spectrum. Both contributions of gamma-rays injected by the source and secondary gamma-rays produced in interactions of UHECRs emitted by the blazar with photon background during their propagation through intergalactic space are calculated. Our results show that this scenario is able to reproduce the GeV-TeV spectrum of PKS 1424+ 240 self-consistently in a broad range of redshifts 0.6 < z < 1.3. The required relativistic jet power L-p similar or equal to 3 x 10(46) erg s(-1) only moderately depends on the assumed source redshift, while the proton escape time-scale (and the injected UHECR luminosity) strongly depends on z. We compare the integral TeV fluxes predicted in our scenario with the sensitivity of the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array, and discuss the implications to future observations.

Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of copper bonding wire during continuous annealing	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Copper bonding wire; Annealing; Microstructure; Mechanical property; Recrystallisation	PAD; RELIABILITY	In this study, the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties during continuous annealing for the copper bonding wire containing trace Mg and Ag were investigated. The relationship of microstructure evolution about recovery, recrystallisation and grain growth with breaking strength, hardness and elongation was analysed under different annealing temperatures for the studied copper wire with an area reduction of 99.95%. The results showed that the recovery occurred during annealing at 300-350 degrees C, accompanying that breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased progressively. The recrystallisation happened during annealing at 350-460 degrees C, and it accompanied that the breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased rapidly. The cold-drawn fibrous microstructure transformed into the recrystallised equiaxed grain. Annealing over 460 degrees C caused the recrystallised grain growth and accompanying that breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased slowly. The proper combination of breaking strength and elongation was obtained by optimising continuous annealing during recrystallisation. Their results suggested that the high performance of copper bonding wire for semiconductor packaging can be developed by microstructure control through a proper continuous annealing.

The strain MPKL 26T was Gram positive, bent rod in shape. The optimum pH and temperature for growth was 7.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain MPKL 26T was closely related to S. atrocyanea DSM 20127T (98.09%), S. flava CW 108(T) (98.04%), S. soli CW 59(T) (97.99%) and S. notoginsengisoli SYP-B575(T) (97.0%) and showed DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness (46.05 +/- 1.2, 33.56 +/- 2.55, 32.56 +/- 1.7 and 26.79 +/- 2.5, respectively, between these strains) less than the threshold value for the delineation of genomic species. The peptidoglycon type was A3 alpha type with glycine, alanine, lysine and glutamic acid as the amino acids. The whole-cell sugars were fructose, ribose, mannose, glucose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol along with three unknown polar lipids. The fatty acid profile contained C-14:0, C-16:0, iso-C-14:0, iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0, anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and summed feature 4 (17:1 iso I/anteiso B). The predominant respiratory quinine was MK-9(H-2) with MK-10(H-2), MK-8(H-2) and MK-8(H-4) as minor respiratory quinines. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.8 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics, the strain MPKL 26(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sinomonas, for which the name Sinomonas mesophila sp. nov. is proposed with MPKL 26(T) as the type strain (=NCIM 5552(T) = JCM 30094(T)).

Recent studies have implicated genes involved in the immune response pathway in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a virus-immune-related gene, activates the transcription of several interferon-induced genes, and functionally interacts with several schizophrenia susceptibility genes. To test whether IRF3 is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, we analyzed the associations of its SNPs with schizophrenia in independent population samples as well as reported data from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in healthy individuals. We observed multiple independent SNPs in IRF3 showing nominally significant associations with schizophrenia (P < 0.05); more intriguingly, a SNP (rs11880923), which is significantly correlated with IRF3 expression in independent samples (P < 0.05), is also consistently associated with schizophrenia across different cohorts and in combined samples (odds ratio = 1.075, P-meta = 2.08 X especially in Caucasians (odds ratio = 1.078, P-meta = 2.46 x 10(-5)). These results suggested that IRF3 is likely a risk gene for schizophrenia at least in Caucasians. Although the clinical associations of IRF3 with diagnosis did not achieve genome-wide level of statistical significance, the observed odds ratio is comparable with other susceptibility loci identified through large-scale genetic association studies on schizophrenia, which could be regarded simply as small but detectable effects.

In order to search for potent non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) with lower side effects and overcome cellular resistance, Genetic Algorithm with Linear Assignment of Hypermolecular Alignment of Database was used to derive 3D pharmacophore models. The obtained best pharmacophore model contains one acceptor atom, one donor atom, and two hydrophobes, which was used in effective alignment of dataset. In succession, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed on 84 structurally diverse NSAIs to build 3D-QSAR models based on both pharmacophore and docking alignments. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models based on the pharmacophore alignment show better statistical results (CoMFA: q (2) = 0.634, r (ncv) (2) = 0.986, r (pred) (2) = 0.737; CoMSIA: q (2) = 0.668, r (ncv) (2) = 0.926, r (pred) (2) = 0.708). This 3D-QSAR approach provides significant insights that can be used to develop novel and potent NSAIs. In addition, the best pharmacophore model was used as a 3D query for virtual screening against NCI2000 database. The hit compounds were further filtered by docking, and their biological activities were predicted by the CoMFA and CoMSIA models, and six structurally diverse compounds with good predicted pIC(50) values were obtained, which are expected to design novel NSAIs with new skeletons.

Despite that the classical theory states that the condensations of methylolureas only form methylene ether bridges at alkaline pH, the competing formation of methylene bridges was observed in this study. The NMR spectra show that the methylene ether bridges are exclusively formed under conditions of 80 and 90 A degrees C with F/U = 2/1. At 80 A degrees C with F/U = 1/1, the linear methylene bridge (-NH-CH2-NH-) began to compete with ether bridges, but it was minor. At 90 A degrees C with F/U = 1/1, the methylene bridges were found to be much more competitive. The theoretically calculated energy barriers for the formation of different types of methylene ether bridges are lower than those for methylene bridges by 12-26 kJ/mol. The steric hindrance was proposed to be another important effect that suppresses the condensations between di- and tri-methylolureas to form the branched methylene bridges [-(HOCH2)N-CH2-NH- or -(HOCH2)N-CH2-N(CH2OH)-]. However, the reaction between a free amino group -NH2 and a methylol group -CH2OH was proposed to encounter no steric hindrance. Hence, once the higher temperature and lower F/U ratio were guaranteed, the competitive formation of linear methylene bridges was observed.

Since the 1950s, the bioconversion of nicotine by microbes has received increasing attention, and several NDMs have been identified, such as Arthrobacter nicotinovorans, Microsporum gypseum, Pellicularia filamentosa JTS-208, and Pseudomonas sp. 41. In recent years, increasing numbers of NDMs have been isolated and identified from tobacco plantation soil, leaf, and tobacco waste. Meanwhile, the metabolic pathway and degradation mechanism of nicotine have been elucidated in several NDMs, such as A. nicotinovorans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33, Aspergillus oryzae, and Pseudomonas putida S16. Moreover, several NDMs have been used in improving the quality of cigarettes, treating tobacco waste, and producing valuable intermediates of nicotine. Here, we summarize the diversity, phylogenetic analysis, and potential applications of NDMs.	[Liu, Jianli; Chen, Tao] Tobacco Co Chongqing, Chongqing 400023, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guanghui; Hou, Ying; Yang, Shihua] Yunnan Comtestor Co Ltd, Kunming 650106, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke-Qin; Yang, Jinkui] Yunnan Univ, Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bio Resources, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China	Yang, JK (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bio Resources, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.	jinkui960@ynu.edu.cn			Science and Technology Program of Chongqing Tobacco Company [NY20120802070020]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31060012]; Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University	We are grateful to Prof. Jianping Xu of the Dept. of Biology, McMaster University for valuable comments and critical discussions.

The results indicate that Ta codoping could improve the S incorporated into TiO2 lattice under reducing conditions. And the incorporation of Ta into S-doped TiO2 further increases the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation compared with that of the S-doped TiO2: the distance from S-related impurity energy levels to the top of valence band is obviously decreased in S+Ta-codoped TiO2; and the calculated band gap of S+Ta-codoped TiO2 is smaller than that of S-doped TiO2; furthermore, through the synergistic effects between S and Ta, S+Ta-codoped TiO2 not only has the similar high absorption rate to S-doped TiO2 in the UV-light region, but also has higher absorption rate than Stra-doped TiO2 in the visible-light region.

It lives on a bamboo-dominated diet at present, but it still retains a typical carnivorous digestive system and is genetically deficient in cellulose-digesting enzymes. To find out whether this endangered mammalian species, like other herbivores, has successfully developed a gut microbiota adapted to its fiber-rich diet, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene-based large-scale structural profiling of the giant panda fecal microbiota. Forty-five captive individuals were sampled in spring, summer, and late autumn within 1 year. Significant intraindividual variations in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota across seasons were observed in this population, which were even greater than the variations between individuals. Compared with published data sets involving 124 gut microbiota profiles from 54 mammalian species, these giant pandas, together with 9 captive and 7 wild individuals investigated previously, showed extremely low gut microbiota diversity and an overall structure that diverged from those of nonpanda herbivores but converged with those of carnivorous and omnivorous bears. The giant panda did not harbor putative cellulose-degrading phylotypes such as Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroides bacteria that are typically enriched in other herbivores, but instead, its microbiota was dominated by Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus bacteria. Members of the class Clostridia were common and abundant in the giant panda gut microbiota, but most of the members present were absent in other herbivores and were not phylogenetically related with known cellulolytic lineages. Therefore, the giant panda appears not to have evolved a gut microbiota compatible with its newly adopted diet, which may adversely influence the coevolutionary fitness of this herbivore. IMPORTANCE The giant panda, an endangered mammalian species endemic to western China, is well known for its unique bamboo diet. Unlike other herbivores that have successfully evolved anatomically specialized digestive systems to efficiently deconstruct fibrous plant matter, the giant panda still retains a gastrointestinal tract typical of carnivores. We characterized the fecal bacterial communities from a giant panda population to determine whether this animal relies on its symbiotic gut microbiota to cope with the complex carbohydrates that dominate its diet, as is common in other herbivores. We found that the giant panda gut microbiota is low in diversity and highly variable across seasons. It also shows an overall composition typical of bears and entirely differentiated from other herbivores, with low levels of putative cellulose-digesting bacteria. The gut microbiota of this herbivore, therefore, may not have well adapted to its highly fibrous diet, suggesting a potential link with its poor digestive efficiency.

Protein-coding operons have not been reported in the Fungi even though they represent a very diverse kingdom of organisms. Here, we report a functional operon involved in the secondary metabolism of the fungus Glarea lozoyensis belonging to Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota). Two contiguous genes, glpks3 and glnrps7, encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase, respectively, are cotranscribed into one dicistronic mRNA under the control of the same promoter, and the mRNA is then translated into two individual proteins, GLPKS3 and GLNRPS7. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans shows that the GLPKS3-GLNRPS7 enzyme complex catalyzes the biosynthesis of a novel pyrrolidinedione-containing compound, xenolozoyenone (compound 1), which indicates the operon is functional. Although it is structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus has a monophylogenic origin from fungi rather than having been horizontally transferred from prokaryotes. Moreover, two additional operons, glpks28-glnrps8 and glpks29-glnrps9, were verified at the transcriptional level in the same fungus. This is the first report of protein-coding operons in a member of the Fungi. IMPORTANCE Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in eukaryotes. Three operon-like gene structures for secondary metabolism that were discovered in the filamentous fungus Glarea lozoyensis are the first examples of protein-coding operons identified in a member of the Fungi. Among them, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon is responsible for the biosynthesis of xenolozoyenone, which is a novel tetramic acid-containing compound. Although structurally similar to prokaryotic operons, the glpks3-glnrps7 operon locus did not result from horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. In addition, operonlike structures have been predicted in silico to be common in other fungi. The common occurrence and operonlike structure in fungi provide evolutionary insight and essential data for eukaryotic gene transcription.

NOV.; IRRIGATED RICE; PLANT RESIDUE; HIGH-YIELD; MEMBER; JAPAN; SITE	A Gram-stain negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strain, YN2-31A(T), was isolated from rice-field soil, Taoyuan Village, Yunnan province of China. The bacterium was observed to grow at 20-45 A degrees C (optimum 28 A degrees C), at pH 5.0-10.0 (optimum 7.0), and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0-1 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YN2-31A(T) is most closely related to Arenimonas daejeonensis DSM 18060(T) (96.1 %), Arenimonas malthae DSM 21305(T) (95.9 %), Arenimonas donghaensis DSM 18148(T) (95.1 %), Arenimonas composti DSM 18010(T) (94.8 %) and Arenimonas maotaiensis JCM 19710(T) (94.8 %). The major cellular fatty acids (> 10 %) were found to be iso-C-18:1 omega 9c, iso-C-15:0, Sum In Feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 6c), and C-16:0. The major ubiquinone was identified as Q-8 and the major cellular polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and unidentified phospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 72.3 mol%. The results of the phylogenetic, genetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses suggest that strain YN2-31A(T) represents a novel species of the genus Arenimonas, for which the name Arenimonas taoyuanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YN2-31A(T) (=DSM 26777(T) = CCTCC AB2012964(T)).

The methanogenic archaeal diversity in four rural biogas digesters (BNA, JSA, LJA, and XGA) was investigated by a culture-independent rRNA approach in different climatic regions in Yunnan. Community structure composed of 711 clones in the all libraries. A total of 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, and major groups of methanogens were the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales. 63.2 % of all archaeal OTUs belong to the order Methanosarcinales which mostly contain acetotrophic methanogens. Methanomicrobiales (19.5 % in all OTUs) were detected in considerable number. Additionally, there were minor rates of uncultured archaea. The principal component analysis indicated that the genus Methanosaeta was mainly affected by the fermentation temperatures.

The structures, morphologies and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the products are Ni doped KMn8O16 nanorods after the introduction of NiSO4 center dot H2O during the reaction process. The electromagnetic characteristics and microwave absorption properties of the materials were carried out with a vector network analyzer (VNA) and the transmission line (TML) theory. The dielectric loss and microwave absorption properties of the cryptomelane materials are improved after Ni doping. The thickness dependent reflection loss shows that the peak frequency and effective absorption bandwidth all decrease with the increasing material thickness. With the increase of Ni doping concentration, the peak frequency shifts to higher frequency bands and the effective absorption bandwidth increases. The electromagnetic performance of cryptomelane can be attributed to its unique tunnel structures and the improvement of Ni doping can be due to the enhanced electromagnetic polarization.

However, the biological functions of PrkA are less known in prokaryote cells. Here, we explored the function of PrkA as well as its underlying molecular mechanisms using the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis 168. When PrkA is inhibited by 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) in the wild type strain or deleted in the AprkA mutant strain, we observed sporulation defects in B. subtilis 168, suggesting that PrkA functions as a sporulation-related protein. Transcriptional analysis using the lacZ reporter gene demonstrated that deletion of prkA significantly reduced the expression of the transcriptional factor sigma(K) and its downstream genes. Complementation of sigK gene in prkA knockout mutant partially rescued the phenotype of Delta prkA, further supporting the hypothesis that the decreased sigma(K) expression should be one of the reasons for the sporulation defect resulting from prkA disruption. Finally, our data confirmed that Hpr (ScoC) negatively controlled the expression of transcriptional factor sigma(K), and thus PrkA accelerated sporulation and the expression of sigma(K) by suppression of Hpr (ScoC). Taken together, our study discovered a novel function of the eukaryotic-like STPK PrkA in spore development as well as its underlying molecular mechanism in B. subtilis.

It was almost eliminated by logging during the past century. We measured size and age structures and interpreted regeneration dynamics of stands of the species in a variety of topographic contexts and community associations. Forest communities containing T. sutchuenensis were of three types: (1) the Thuja community dominated by T. sutchuenensis, growing on cliffs; (2) the Thuja-Quercus-Cyclobalanopsis community dominated by T. sutchuenensis, Quercus engleriana and Cyclobalanopsis oxyodon, along with Fagus engleriana and Carpinus fargesiana, on steep slopes; (3) the Thuja-Tsuga-Quercus community dominated by T. sutchuenensis, Tsuga chinensis, and Quercus spinosa, on crest ridges. The established seedlings/saplings were found in limestone crevices, on scarred cliff-faces, cliff-edges, fallen logs, canopy gaps and forest margins. The radial growth rate was 0.5-1.1 mm per year. Its growth forms were distorted. It had strong sprouting ability after disturbances. The T. sutchuenensis population thrives on cliffs where there is little competition from other species because of harsh conditions and rock-slide disturbances. It is shade-intolerant but stress-tolerant. Its regeneration has depended on natural disturbances.

In this paper, an equivalent circuit method for realizing ETD using transmission line (TL) metamaterials is presented. The validity of such a method and the transparent effect of the device are demonstrated through the Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) circuit simulator. Moreover, the influence of the quality factor of lumped elements on the performance of the device and its broadband characteristics are also investigated. This work suggests an alternative way to achieve the broadband electromagnetic transparency and has great guiding significance for the practical fabrication of ETD.

The jet-quenching effects for fragmentation processes with p(T) > 2 GeV and the jet-medium interaction with pT > 4 GeV for the fast jets passing through the quark-gluon plasma in Pb-Pb collisions are also considered. The numerical results of photoproduction processes can improve the contribution of dileptons, photons, and light vector meson production in p-p and Pb-Pb collisions at Large Hadron Collider energies.

Transparent glass-ceramics were obtained after heat treatment at their first crystallization temperature. Compared with the glass samples before heat treatment, high efficiency luminescence of Eu3+/Tb3+ co-doped was observed in the glass-ceramics under excitation 377 nm, and the emission intensity of Eu3+-doped showed different tendency to that emission intensity of Tb3+-doped after nanocrystals precipitate, resulting in color tunable luminescence. In addition, the energy transfer between the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions are also investigated. The results suggest that the Eu3+/Tb3+ co-doped transparent glass-ceramics could be potentially applicable in the solid-state color displays. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So far, nine gamma-ray GCs have been identified and a few candidates, such as 2MS-GC01 and IC 1257, have been suggested. In this work, after analysing the publicly available Fermi Large Area Telescope data, we confirm the significant gamma-ray emission from 2MS-GC01 and IC 1257 and report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from NGC 5904 and 6656 within their tidal radii. Also, strong evidence of significant gamma-ray emission is found from FSR 1735. From the observed gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the numbers of millisecond pulsars that are expected to be present in these GCs.	[Zhou, J. N.; Zhang, P. F.; Huang, X. Y.; Li, X.; Liang, Y.

J	Yang, CY; Zhang, L; Wang, JC				Yang, Chuyuan; Zhang, Li; Wang, Jiancheng			On the escape and propagation of high-energy protons near young supernova remnants	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						acceleration of particles; ISM: clouds; cosmic rays; ISM: supernova remnants	NONLINEAR PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; GALACTIC COSMIC-RAYS; DIFFUSIVE SHOCK ACCELERATION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; GAMMA-RAYS; RADIATION; WAVES; DISCOVERY; VICINITY	The escape and propagation of high-energy protons near young supernova remnants (SNRs) are investigated in the frame of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) model by using two methods. In the first method, the particle diffusion is assumed to be different inside and outside the absorbing boundary of the particles accelerated in the SNR shock, and the proton spectra at a given distance of the outer region and corresponding pi(0) decay gamma-ray spectra can be calculated if a molecular cloud is assumed to be at the distance. In the second method, the total spectrum of high-energy protons escaping from an absorbing boundary during the SNR evolution time is treated as injection rate of the protons and the proton spectrum is calculated in the accumulative diffusion model. Our results show that (1) the spectrum of high-energy protons escaping from a young SNR does not have a power-law form and the protons concentrate on high-energy region and (2) the escaping proton spectra and corresponding pi(0) decay gamma-ray spectra predicted in both methods are different, indicating that the second method overestimates the propagation effect. We may conclude that the first method is a more realistic description of the escape and propagation of high-energy protons near SNRs.

In the present study, twenty four GST genes from the transcriptome of ametal-tolerant dark septate endophyte (DSE), Exophiala pisciphila, were identified based on sequence homology, and their responses to various heavy metal exposures were also analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 24 GST genes from E. pisciphila (EpGSTs) were divided into eight distinct classes, including seven cytosolic classes and one mitochondrial metaxin 1-like class. Moreover, the variable expression patterns of these EpGSTs were observed under different heavy metal stresses at their effective concentrations for inhibiting growth by 50%(EC50). Lead (Pb) exposure caused the up-regulation of all EpGSTs, while cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) treatments led to the significant up-regulation of most of the EpGSTs (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Furthermore, although heavy metal-specific differences in performance were observed under various heavy metals in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with EpGSTN-31, the overexpression of this gene was able to enhance the heavy metal tolerance of the host cells. These results indicate that E. Pisciphilaharbored a diverse of GST genes and the up-regulated EpGSTs are closely related to the heavy metal tolerance of E. pisciphila. The study represents the first investigation of the GST family in E. pisciphila and provides a primary interpretation of heavymetal detoxification for E. pisciphila.

However, little was known on its reproductive biology and pattern of trunk attack on Yunnan pine. The objectives of this study were to better understand the reproductive biology of T. brevipilosus by investigating the seasonality of trunk attacks by parent adults for the purpose of reproduction (i.e., breeding attacks) and the within-tree pattern of these attacks. Our results showed that T. brevipilosus breeding attacks in P. yunnanensis generally started in early March and ended in early June in Anning County, Yunnan. T. brevipilosus exhibited two general patterns of infestation. From early March to mid-April, T. brevipilosus bred preferentially in the trunks of Yunnan pine trees that were already infested by Tomicus yunnanensis Kirkendall and Faccoli and Tomicus minor (Hartig), colonizing spaces along the trunk (mostly in the mid-and lower trunk) that were not already occupied by the other two Tomicus species. Later, from about mid-April to early June, when there were no Yunnan pine trees newly infested by T. yunnanensis and T. minor, T. brevipilosus attacked Yunnan pine by itself, infesting the lower parts of the trunk first and then infesting progressively upward along the trunk into the crown. Infestation by T. brevipilosus extends the total period that P. yunnanensis trees are under attack by Tomicus beetles in southwestern China, which helps explain why Yunnan pine has suffered high levels of tree mortality in recent decades.

Although previous observations already resolved the W3(H2O) into two or three subcomponents, the physical and chemical properties of the two sources are not well constrained. Our SMA observations clearly resolved the W3(OH) and W3(H2O) continuum cores. Taking advantage of the line fitting tool XCLASS, we identified and modeled a rich molecular spectrum in this complex, including multiple CH3CN and CH3OH transitions in both cores. HDO, C2H5CN, (OCS)-C-13, and vibrationally excited lines of HCN, CH3CN, and CH3OCHO were only detected in W3(H2O). We calculate gas temperatures and column densities for both cores. The results show that W3(H2O) has higher gas temperatures and larger column densities than W3(OH) as previously observed, suggesting physical and chemical differences between the two cores. We compare the molecular abundances in W3(H2O) to those in the Sgr B2(N) hot core, the Orion KL hot core, and the Orion Compact Ridge, and discuss the chemical origin of specific species. An east-west velocity gradient is seen in W3 (H2O), and the extension is consistent with the bipolar outflow orientation traced by water masers and radio jets. A north-south velocity gradient across W3(OH) is also observed. However, with current observations we cannot be assured whether the velocity gradients are caused by rotation, outflow, or radial velocity differences of the subcomponents of W3(OH).

Molecular modelling calculations have been carried out to rationalise the experimental findings and predict the stable molecular structure of the inclusion complex. The stability of the inclusion complexes were confirmed by energetic and thermodynamic properties (Delta E, Delta H, Delta G and Delta S) and HOMO, LUMO orbital.

The increasing number of sequenced reptilian genomes is enabling a deeper understanding of vertebrate evolution, although the genetic basis of the loss of limbs in reptiles remains enigmatic. Here we report genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for the Asian glass lizard Ophisaurus gracilis, a limbless lizard species with an elongated snake-like body form. Addition of this species to the genome repository will provide an excellent resource for studying the genetic basis of limb loss and trunk elongation. Findings: O. gracilis genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform resulted in 274.20 Gbp of raw data that was filtered and assembled to a final size of 1.78 Gbp, comprising 6,717 scaffolds with N50 = 1.27 Mbp. Based on the k-mer estimated genome size of 1.71 Gbp, the assembly appears to be nearly 100% complete. A total of 19,513 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 884.06 Mbp of repeat sequences (approximately half of the genome) were annotated. The draft genome of O. gracilis has similar characteristics to both lizard and snake genomes. Conclusions: We report the first genome of a lizard from the family Anguidae, O. gracilis. This supplements currently available genetic and genomic resources for amniote vertebrates, representing a major increase in comparative genome data available for squamate reptiles in particular.

Here we propose and numerically study a corrugated parallel plate waveguide (CPPW) with gradient grooves which is capable of directly converting transmission modes to surface plasmon modes and could hence serve as a powerful chemical sensor. Such a waveguide can be designed to exhibit a wide pass band covering an extended portion of a molecule absorption spectrum. Broadband sensing of toluene and ethanol thin layers is demonstrated by calculating the transmission coefficient of the waveguide and is shown to correspond exactly to their infrared spectra. In addition, the upper limit and the lower limit of the bandgap are mainly dependent on the minimum and maximum groove height, respectively, which provide an effective way of tuning the working frequency of the device in order to support surface plasmon modes within a desired frequency range according to a specific application.

Based on the electromagnetic theory the dispersion relation and field distributions in a plasmon-assisted parallel-plated waveguide are deduced. The transmission property of such a waveguide is obtained and confirmed by the full-wave simulation. Results show that the plasmon-assisted parallel-plated waveguide shows a band gap characteristic, and the cutoff frequency of the upper sideband is equal to the plasmon frequency; generally, the thinner the plasmon layer, the higher the cutoff frequency will be, and the narrower the bandwidth will become. Emergence of the band gap is due to the excited surface plasmon polaritons, and the coupling between surface plasmon and the medium in the waveguide. Besides, the influence of plasmon frequency and collision frequency on the transmission properties is investigated, and a method for adjusting the filter characteristic of the waveguide by tuning the plasmon frequency is proposed. Moreover, the plasmon layer is realized by a textured metallic structure, and a sensing model based on the parallel-plated waveguide is designed. Simulation results show that a 0.1 percent change in permittivity of the sample materials filling in the groove will give rise to a significant change of the cutoff frequency, which is 1.8 GHz in average; interestingly, different liquid samples such as nitrogen, gasoline, paraffin, glycerine and water can be identified through detecting the change of cutoff frequency, which further confirms the excellent terahertz sensing characteristic of the proposed sensor. This work may be helpful for the study of terahertz wave transmission, and may have potential applications in the design of terahertz devices.

The activities of Pd/CeO2 catalysts are higher than that of Pd supported on Al2O3, and the activity of 1 wt.% Pd/CeO2 can be enhanced obviously and its T-90 (which denotes the temperatures at which a 90% conversion of the initial reactants is attained) is as low as -5.6 degrees C. The intrinsic hollow nature as well as high porosity of the unique nanostructures of CeO2 support contributes greatly to the formation of large numbers of surface oxygen vacancies on the as-prepared Pd/CeO2 catalysts, and therefore it exhibits outstanding catalytic activity. This strategy method is simple, of low cost, which may shed light on a new avenue for fast synthesis of hollow cube-like nano functional materials for catalyst, drug delivery, energy storage and other new applications.

We explored the adaptive significance of woolly and overlapping leaves for reproduction in Eriophyton wallichii, a perennial herb native to the subnival belt of the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains. Methods We examined whether the trichomes could influence the leaf wettability, temperature and leaf reflectance spectra in the lab. And we investigated the thermal benefits of the woolly and overlapping leaves for flowers and fruits in the field. Pollen viability and seed germination were also examined in the lab to assess whether these leaves enhance reproductive fitness. Important Findings Our results showed that dense trichomes impart good water repellency, absorption of solar radiation and accumulation of leaf heat. The woolly and overlapping leaves increased the interior temperature of flowers and fruits to an optimal level on sunny hours, but prevented them from overheating when transient intense solar radiation occurs. This kept optimal temperatures in plants' reproductive organs, thus promoting the development of pollen and seed in alpine environment.

In this study, we applied dendrochronology methods to develop a growth index chronology with otolith increment widths of Selincuo naked carp (Gymnocypris selincuoensis), which is an endemic species in Lake Selincuo (4530 m), and investigated the relationships between fish growth and climate variables (regional and global) in the last three decades. A correlation analysis and principle component regression analysis between regional climate factors and the growth index chronology indicated that the growth of G. selincuoensis was significantly and positively correlated with length of the growing season and temperature-related variables, particularly during the growing season. Most of global climate variables, which are relevant to the Asian monsoon and the midlatitude westerlies, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation Index, the Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and North America Pattern, showed negative but not significant correlations with the annual growth of Selincuo naked carp. This may have resulted from the high elevation of the Tibetan Plateau and the high mountains surrounding this area. In comparison, the Pacific Decade Oscillation (PDO) negatively affected the growth of G. selincuoensis. The reason maybe that enhancement of the PDO can lead to cold conditions in this area. Taken together, the results indicate that the Tibetan Plateau fish has been affected by global climate change, particularly during the growing season, and global climate change likely has important effects on productivity of aquatic ecosystems in this area.

J	Jiang, R				Jiang, Rong			Research and Measurement of Software Complexity Based on Wuli, Shili, Renli (WSR) and Information Entropy	ENTROPY			English	Article							PROJECT COMPLEXITY	Complexity is an important factor throughout the software life cycle. It is increasingly difficult to guarantee software quality, cost and development progress with the increase in complexity. Excessive complexity is one of the main reasons for the failure of software projects, so effective recognition, measurement and control of complexity becomes the key of project management. At first, this paper analyzes the current research situation of software complexity systematically and points out existing problems in current research. Then, it proposes a WSR framework of software complexity, which divides the complexity of software into three levels of Wuli (WL), Shili (SL) and Renli (RL), so that the staff in different roles may have a better understanding of complexity. Man is the main source of complexity, but the current research focuses on WL complexity, and the research of RL complexity is extremely scarce, so this paper emphasizes the research of RL complexity of software projects. This paper not only analyzes the composing factors of RL complexity, but also provides the definition of RL complexity. Moreover, it puts forward a quantitative measurement method of the complexity of personnel organization hierarchy and the complexity of personnel communication information based on information entropy first and analyzes and validates the scientificity and rationality of this measurement method through a large number of cases.

It was one of the most commonly used non-human primates in biomedical research. Thus, to illustrate the maternal phylogenetic status of M. fascicularis in primates based on the whole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome and determine a reference sequence for future population genetic studies by taking mtDNA as molecular marker, in this study, the high quality whole mtDNA genome of M. fascicularis was amplified and sequenced. Our data showed that the whole mtDNA genome of M. fascicularis includes 16,571 base pairs (bps). Further phylogenetic analyses of M. fascicularis were performed by incorporating the 83 available whole mtDNA genomes belonging to 77 primate species with Tupaia belangeri as outgroup. Our result supported that M. fascicularis belongs to Macaca, Cercopithecinae, Cercopithecidae, Anthropoidea, Primates, which has the closest genetic affinity with Macaca mulatta. In addition, the ancestral divergence between the tarsier and other primate species was supported with evidence from the whole mtDNA genomes.

To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to understand the physical mechanism of the haze pollution there. Therefore, the pollutant transport mechanisms of a haze event over the BTH region from 23 to 24 September 2011 were studied using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the FLEXible-PARTicle dispersion model to understand the effects of the local atmospheric circulations and atmospheric boundary layer structure. Results suggested that the penetration by sea-breeze could strengthen the vertical dispersion by lifting up the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and carry the local pollutants to the downstream areas; in the early night, two elevated pollution layers (EPLs) may be generated over the mountain areas: the pollutants in the upper EPL at the altitude of 2-2.5 km were favored to disperse by long-range transport, while the lower EPL at the altitude of 1 km may serve as a reservoir, and the pollutants there could be transported downward and contribute to the surface air pollution. The intensity of the sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations played an important role in the vertical transport and distribution of pollutants. It was also found that the diurnal evolution of the PBLH is important for the vertical dispersion of the pollutants, which is strongly affected by the local atmospheric circulations and the distribution of urban areas.

We describe a suite of ichthyosaur fossils from the Early to Middle Jurassic of Skye, which to our knowledge are the first ichthyosaurs from Scotland to be described and figured in detail. These fossils span approximately 30 million years, from the Sinemurian to the Bathonian, and indicate that ichthyosaurs were a major component of Scottish marine faunas during this time. The specimens include isolated teeth that could represent the most northerly known occurrences of the widespread Sinemurian species Ichthyosaurus communis, a characteristic component of the famous Lyme Regis faunas of England, suggesting that such faunas were also present in Scotland during the Early Jurassic. An associated humerus and vertebrae from Toarcian-Bajocian-aged deposits are named as a new genus and species of basal neoichthyosaurian, Dearcmhara shawcrossi. The taxonomic affinities of this taxon, which comes from a critical but poorly sampled interval in the fossil record, suggest that non-ophthalmosaurid neoichthyosaurians dominated European assemblages around the Early-Middle Jurassic boundary, and were later replaced by ophthalmosaurids, whose radiation likely took place outside Europe. Many of these specimens were collected by amateurs and donated to museum collections, a co-operative relationship essential to the preservation of Scotland's fossil heritage.

Basic local alignment search tool analyses showed that this isolate had the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 97.41% with Streptomyces rimosus subsp. paromomycinus DSM 41429(T). Phylogenetic tree revealed that strain 11A07(T) formed a distinct lineage clustered with Streptomyces panacagri Gsoil 519(T), Streptomyces sodiiphilus YIM 80305(T) and Streptomyces albus subsp. albus NRRL B-2365(T) having similarities of 97.30%, 97.10% and 96.83%, respectively. Multilocus sequence analysis further demonstrated that the new isolate was different from the selected representatives of Streptomyces as a separate phylogenetic line. Strain 11A07(T) produced straight or rectiflexibile spore chains with smooth surface, white aerial mycelia and brown diffusible pigments on international streptomyces project 2 medium. Maximum tolerated NaCl concentration for growth was 11.0%. Whole-cell sugars were mannose, ribose, glucose, galactose and xylose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-2), MK-9(H-4) and MK-9 (H-6). The fatty-acid profile contained iso-C-16:0, C-18:0 10-methyl (tuberculostearic acid) and anteiso-C-17:0 as the major compositions. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unknown phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.4 mol%. These morphological, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties showed that strain 11A07(T) could be readily distinguished from the most closely related members of the genus Streptomyces. Thus, based on the polyphasic taxonomic data, strain 11A07(T) (= JCM 19630(T)=CCTCC AA 2013020(T)=KCTC 29263(T)) represents a novel species within the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces bohaiensis sp. nov. is proposed.

Among those, ass-like equids have remained particularly unstudied and their phylogenetic relations were poorly understood, most probably because they inhabit extreme environments in remote geographic areas. To gain further insights into the evolutionary history of ass-like equids, we have used a non-invasive sampling approach to collect representative fecal samples of extant African and Asiatic ass-like equid populations across their distribution range and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing analyses to examine intraspecific genetic diversity and population structure, and to reconstruct phylogenetic relations among wild ass species/subspecies. Sequence analyses of 410 base pairs of the fast evolving mtDNA control region identified the Asiatic wild ass population of Kalamaili (China) as the one displaying the highest diversity among all wild ass populations. Phylogenetic analyses of complete cytochrome b sequences revealed that African and Asiatic wild asses shared a common ancestor approximately 2.3 Mya and that diversification in both groups occurred much latter, probably driven by climatic events during the Pleistocene. Inferred genetic relationships among Asiatic wild ass species do not support E. kiang monophyly, highlighting the need of more extensive studies in order to clarify the taxonomic status of species/subspecies belonging to this branch of the Equus phylogeny. These results highlight the importance of re-assessing the evolutionary history of ass-like equid species, and urge to extend studies at the population level to efficiently design conservation and management actions for these threatened species.

J	Li, LL; Xu, W				Li Long-Long; Xu Wen			Thermoelectric Transport by Surface States in Bi2Se3-Based Topological Insulator Thin Films	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							SINGLE DIRAC CONE; NANORIBBONS; BI2TE3	We develop a tractable theoretical model to investigate the thermoelectric (TE) transport properties of surface states in topological insulator thin films (TITFs) of Bi2Se3 at room temperature. The hybridization between top and bottom surface states in the TITF plays a significant role. With the increasing hybridization-induced surface gap, the electrical conductivity and electron thermal conductivity decrease while the Seebeck coefficient increases. This is due to the metal-semiconductor transition induced by the surface-state hybridization. Based on these TE transport coefficients, the TE figure-of-merit ZT is evaluated. It is shown that ZT can be greatly improved by the surface-state hybridization. Our theoretical results are pertinent to the exploration of the TE transport properties of surface states in TITFs and to the potential application of Bi2Se3-based TITFs as high-performance TE materials and devices.

The effects of key fabrication parameters (AgNO3 concentration, Fe(NO3)(3) concentration, and etching time) on the silicon nanowire nanostructure were carefully investigated. The Raman spectra of silicon nanowires prepared under different etching times have been recorded and analyzed. The porosity and length of the nanowire increases with the increase in AgNO3 concentration from 0.002 mol L-1 to 0.1 mol L-1, which indicates that the re-dissolved Ag+ ions would work as the main oxidative species and catalyze the vertical and lateral etching of nanowires, leading to silicon nanowire growth and porous structure formation.

This study aimed to evaluate the drug-excipient compatibility of binary mixtures (BMs) (1:1 BMs, w/w), initially by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and subsequently, by complementary techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) if there was any evidence of interaction. The samples were stored under accelerated stability conditions (40 A degrees C at 75 % relative humidity). The DSC curves of estradiol and the BMs with excipients (corn starch, lactose, xanthan gum, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, dibasic calcium phosphate, and talc) were obtained. The results show that estradiol was compatible with all the selected excipients. XRPD and HPLC analysis were instrumental in interpreting the DSC results and excluding relevant pharmaceutical incompatibilities in all cases. Overall, the compatibility of the selected excipients with estradiol was successfully evaluated using a combination of thermal and spectroscopic methods, and the formulations developed using the compatible excipients were found to be stable.

Strong terahertz absorption in long-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices with inverted band structures	SUPERLATTICES AND MICROSTRUCTURES			English	Article						InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices; Band inversion and electron hole hybridization; Strong terahertz absorption	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; GAP; DETECTORS	We present a theoretical investigation on the terahertz (THz) absorption by long-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices (SLs) with inverted band structures. It is found that in such SLs the band inversion causes a significant electron-hole hybridization and a strong THz absorption can be induced by this hybridization. The THz absorption coefficient is even larger than mid-infrared absorption coefficient for short-period InAs/GaSb SLs. Moreover, we find that the strong THz absorption can be further improved and optimized by the proper choice of InAs/GaSb layer widths. The interesting absorption features are well manifested in hybridization gaps and optical transition matrix elements. This study is pertinent to the potential application of long-period inverted InAs/GaSb typeII SLs as high-efficiency THz photodetectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Li, L.

For producing a laser by means of the backscattering of an incident laser and a monochromatic electron beam, the intensity of the incident laser must be large. The incident laser can form a laser standing wave in a laser standing wave cavity. When the coherence conditions are satisfied, the laser standing wave can cause temporal coherence and spatial coherence of the backscattering light, so the backscattering light can form a quasi-laser or laser. A way of obtaining a better monochromatic electron beam is proposed. An example is given.

Co3O4 NRs were initially fabricated by a facile hydrothermal reaction and then ZnO was coated via a simple thermal decomposition. The results verified that the surface of the p-type Co3O4 core was uniformly assembled by the n-type ZnO nanoparticles with approximate 20 nm thickness. Compared with pristine Co3O4 NRs, Co3O4/ZnO core/shell NRs was exhibited to have a much higher photocatalytic properties in the decomposition of a model dye compound, methylene blue (MB), under ultraviolet irradiation. As confirmed by Photoluminescence (PL) spectra, the formation of p-n junction heterostructures gives rise to the enhanced photocatalystic performance of Co3O4/ZnO core/shell NRs.

The taxonomic positions of the two new isolates were determined by using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridizations showed that strains Y24(T) and H9(T) were two different novel species belonging to the genus Paenibacillus, with Paenibacillus hunanensis FeL05(T) as their closest relative. The genomic DNA G + C contents of the two isolates Y24(T) and H9(T) were 48.1 and 46.6 mol %, respectively. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinone was both as MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, C-16:0, iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-15:0. The polar lipid profiles consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and two glycolipids as the major components. On the basis of their phenotypic characteristics, the two isolates represent two different novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the names Paenibacillus wulumuqiensis sp. nov. (type strain Y24(T) = CPCC 100602(T) = JCM 30284(T)) and Paenibacillus dauci sp. nov. (type strain H9(T) = CPCC 100608(T) = JCM 30283(T)) are proposed.

Most of them exhibit cytotoxic activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480) using MTT assays. Among the synthesized compounds, epipodophyllotoxin alpha-D-galactopyranoside 8b, epipodophyllotoxin a-D-arabinopyranoside 8e, and podophyllotoxin beta-D-glucopyranoside 11a show the highest potency of anticancer activity with their IC50 values ranging from 0.14 to 1.69 mu M. Structure activity relationship analysis indicates that the type of glycosidic linkage, the configuration at C-4 of the podophyllotoxin scaffold, and the substitution at 4'-position (OH vs OCH3) can all have significant effect on the potency of their anticancer activity. Several compounds are more active than the control drugs Etoposide and Cisplatin, suggesting their potential as anticancer agents for further development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The gene was 1332 bp long and encoded a 443-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 45.9 kDa. The purified recombinant endoglucanase had optimal activity at 55 A degrees C and pH 8.5. Thcel6A showed high hydrolytic activities at 25-55 A degrees C and retained 58 % of initial activity after incubation at 90 A degrees C for 1 h. It retained more than 80 % of activity after incubation for 12 h at pH values from 4 to 12. Thcel6A displayed higher hydrolytic activities in 5-15 % NaCl (w/v) than at 0 % NaCl. Activity increased 2.5-fold after incubation with 20 % (w/v) NaCl at 37 A degrees C for 10 min. These properties suggest that this novel endoglucanase has potential for specific industrial application.

We use an empirical distribution function to describe the uncertainty of scores obtained from historical transactions. We then propose an approach to discovering the admissible set of services including alternative services that are not dominated by any other alternatives according to the expected utility criterion. Stochastic dominance (SD) rules are used to compare two services with uncertain scores regardless of the distribution form of their uncertain scores. By using the properties of SD rules, an algorithm is developed to reduce the number of SD tests, by which the admissible services can be reported progressively. We prove that the proposed algorithm can be run on partitioned or incremental alternative services. Moreover, we achieve some useful theoretical conclusions for correct pruning of unnecessary calculations and comparisons in each SD test, by which the efficiency of the SD tests can be improved. We make a comprehensive experimental study using real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed algorithm.

The simulations predicted negative DRFs of -0.87 W m(-2) at the surface and -1.40 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere by sea salt. Results from the simulations suggest the forcing of sea salt produces a slight positive temperature anomaly and a reduction in precipitation over Southern China, accompanied by an opposite trend north of 40 degrees N in Northern and Northeastern China. The tendency of wetting in North and drying in South by sea salt was mainly determined by the wind field, the vertical motion, as well as the local evaporation anomalies. The impacts of sea salt on SST suggest that the net surface shortwave radiative flux and the changes in convective cloud are important in forming the decreased SST throughout the year, while the northward oceanic heat transport anomaly and the other heat flux anomalies contribute relatively smaller. The feature by sea salt on SST imposes an extra force from the atmosphere to the ocean. The sea salt could also diminish the land-sea temperature contrast (LSTC) in summer and therefore the climatological summer circulation over East Asia, leading to reduced precipitation in Southern China. All these climatic feedbacks, such as LSTC and precipitation anomaly, will be attenuated when the SST is fixed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impacts of Mn contents on their morphologies and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analysis reveals that the obtained composites are one-dimensional (1D) rod-like nanostructures. The catalytic behaviors of Mn-Ce-O-x nanomaterials were investigated for CO oxidation. The Mn-Ce-O-x catalysts were found to be more active than catalysts based on ceria alone. The catalytic activities of all one dimensional Mn-Ce-O-x materials for CO conversion are quite high (142 < T-50% < 229 degrees C). Among the obtained nanocatalysts, the Mn-Ce-O-x composite nanomaterials with 40 wt% Mn exhibit the best catalytic activity and the 50% CO conversion can be reached at 142 degrees C. The presence of transition metal element Mn can promote the production of oxygen vacancies and improve oxygen mobility, which result in enhancing the oxygen-storage capacity of the one dimensional Mn-Ce-O-x materials and its catalytic performance for CO conversion.

It is therefore vitally important to better understand the behavior of Earth's climate system on regional scale and advance the knowledge of regional responses to global climate. With their ability to represent meso-scale forcings, such as coastline, complex topography, anthropogenic aerosols and land cover/use changes, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are developed and used worldwide to investigate the effects of the above-mentioned meso-scale forcings on the local circulations that regulate the regional distribution of climatic variables. Considering the complexity of Asian Monsoon system, which is not only a physical process but also modulated by the interaction among physical, biological, chemical and social processes, a modeling framework Regional Integrated Environmental Modeling System (RIEMS) was proposed, developed and well tested before it was widely used in regional climate studies in the East Asia monsoon region.

Schischk	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; GEN. NOV.; HYBRIDIZATION; MEMBER; WELLS	A novel endophytic actinobacterium, designated EGI 6500707(T), was isolated from the surface-sterilized root of a halophyte Anabasis elatior (C. A. Mey.) Schischk collected from Urumqi, Xinjiang province, north-west China, and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, short rods and produced white colonies. Growth occurred at 10-45 degrees C (optimum 25-30 degrees C), at pH 5-10 (optimum pH 8) and in presence of 0-4% (w/v) NaCL (optimum 0-3%). The predominant menaquinone was MK-9. The diagnostic phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 6500707(T) was 69.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 6500707(T) should be placed in the genus Frigoribacterium (family Microbacteriaceae, phylum Actinobacteria), and that the novel strain exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Frigoribacterium faeni JCM 11265(T) (99.1 %) and Frigoribacterium mesophilum MSL-08(T) (96.5 %). DNA-DNA relatedness between strain EGI 6500707(T) and F. faeni JCM 11265(T) was 47.2%. On the basis of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNADNA relatedness data, strain EGI 6500707(T) represents a novel species of the genus Frigoribacterium, for which the name Frigoribacterium endophyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 6500707(T) (=JCM 30093(T)=KCTC 294937(T)).

We found that when increasing the silver triangular nanoplates added to certain concentrations of fluorescent bovine serum albumin (BSA) /Rhodamine 6G complex, the fluorescence of Rhodamine 6G would be quenched up to 80% due to the FRET between the quencher and donor. However, in the presence of cobalt ions, the disassociation of the fluorescent complex from silver triangular nanoplates occurred and the fluorescence of the Rhodamine 6G recovered. The recovery of fluorescence intensity rate (I//I-0) has a good relationship with the cobalt ion concentration (c(CO2+)) added. Thus, the authors developed a fluorescence method for the detection of cobalt ions based on the FRET of silver triangular nanoplates and Rhodamine 6G.

Here, we focused on the Yunnan province, a typical mountainous region in southwest China, where soil productivity plays a key role in agricultural development. The objectives were to assess spatial variation and sustainable utilization of soil productivity in the Yunnan province. We constructed a soil database based on 706 soil profiles collected from China's second national soil survey, and assessed soil productivity with a soil productivity index model. We found significant differences in the soil productivity indexes among soil types; the indexes ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 and averaged 0.47. Higher productivity soils generally occurred in forest areas within the west and northwest sub-regions of Yunnan, while lower productivity soils tend to be located at low or extremely high elevations. The soil productivity index was lowest for barren land, followed by dry farmland, grassland, paddy fields, horticultural land, and forest lands. We found the productivity index to increase significantly as latitude increased and to vary with altitude at lower elevations. The soil productivity index ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 generally from the southeast sub-region to the northwest sub-region. Conversion of forest land or grassland to dry farmland may seriously degrade soil productivity. Local governments should consider soil productivity conservation practices when seeking to exploit land resources in mountainous areas. Yunnan's western sub-region has high potential for agricultural development. Effective soil remediation measures and soil and water conservation are needed in the central and southeast sub-regions to maintain sustainable soil productivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The source exhibits strong variability both in intraday and long-term timescale. The chi(2) test suggests that 171 out of 285 nights in R band present intraday variability, and the typical intraday timescale is 0.02-0.1 day. The strong correlation between color index B-I and the brightness in I band imply that there is a general redder-when-brighter trend in faint state of I > 14 mag, in the sense that the spectrum steepens as the brightness increases. However, when the source is in the bright state, I < 14 mag, the spectrum remains unchanged. Using the minimum intraday timescale of 0.02 +/- 0.01 day and the typical Doppler factor delta(D)= 25, the radius of emission region of 3C 454.3 is estimated to be (7.0 +/- 3.5) x 10(14) cm, and the upper limit of the central black hole is estimated to be M = (1.9 +/- 1.0) x 101(0) M-circle dot.

The shapes and sizes can be controlled just by varying the concentrations of the water-soluble polymer. When a suitable PAMPAS concentration was utilized, uniform well-defined and mono-dispersed chrysanthemum-like ZnO microstructures based on nanorod building blocks were obtained. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical structure was presented. The structured studies using XRD, HRTEM and SAED reveal these ZnO nanorods are composed of a single phase nature with wurtzite structure and grow along with the c-axis. FTIR spectrum indicated the incorporation of a trace of PAMPSA into ZnO crystals. HRTEM, Raman and XPS analyses showed that the hierarchical ZnO microstructures contain high concentration of oxygen vacancies which enable them exhibiting a significant intense deep-level emission centered at green luminescence in its photoluminescence spectra. They also show enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in degradation of methylene blue. It is hoped that the present work may provide a simple method to fabricate ZnO hierarchical microstructures and a positive relationship among polar plane, oxygen vacancy and green emission.

J	Wang, CJ; Shi, DY; Xu, XL				Wang, Changji; Shi, Dongyuan; Xu, Xilei			AIB-OR: Improving Onion Routing Circuit Construction Using Anonymous Identity-Based Cryptosystems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENCRYPTION	The rapid growth of Internet applications has made communication anonymity an increasingly important or even indispensable security requirement. Onion routing has been employed as an infrastructure for anonymous communication over a public network, which provides anonymous connections that are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. However, existing onion routing protocols usually exhibit poor performance due to repeated encryption operations. In this paper, we first present an improved anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption (AMRIBE) scheme, and an improved identity-based one-way anonymous key agreement (IBOWAKE) protocol. We then propose an efficient onion routing protocol named AIB-OR that provides provable security and strong anonymity. Our main approach is to use our improved AMRIBE scheme and improved IBOWAKE protocol in onion routing circuit construction. Compared with other onion routing protocols, AIB-OR provides high efficiency, scalability, strong anonymity and fault tolerance. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that our proposed AIB-OR can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet.

Anamorphic strains were obtained from three teleomorph specimens which were collected at different sites and dates. The anamorph is characterized by cylindric-ellipsoid to oblong conidia, mainly 1-septate, growing either singly or mostly from 2-10 denticles in a capitate arrangement on the tip of conidiophores. These morphological characters are similar to those of the nematophagous anamorph genus Arthrobotrys, but the present isolates lack the ability to produce any trapping devices when contacting with nematodes. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS rDNA sequences on different groups within Orbilia showed that the isolates of O. laevimarginata clustered together in a clade separate from Orbilia crenatomarginata (= Hyalinia crystallina). The two species are close to O. scolecospora and an undescribed species, which all have a crenulate to dentate apothecial margin composed of solid glassy processes. The group clustered distant from those species identified within the nematode-trapping anamorph genera Arthrobotrys, Dactylellina and Drechslerella, but also distant from the non-predacious anamorph genus Dactylella. By combining morphological and phylogenetic analysis, we conclude that the three isolates belong to a single undescribed holomorph species. The morphological differences among the three isolated anamorphic strains, and phylogenetic divergence of nematode-trapping fungi and related species are discussed.

It was observed that hydrogenation of silicene at room temperature results in a perfectly ordered gamma-(3 x 3) superstructure. A theoretical model, which involves seven H atoms and rearranged buckling of Si atoms, was proposed and agrees with experiments very well. Moreover, by annealing to a moderate temperature, about 450 K, a dehydrogenation process occurs and the clean silicene surface can be fully recovered. Such uniformly ordered and reversible hydrogenation may be useful for tuning the properties of silicene as well as for controllable hydrogen storage.	[Qiu, Jinglan; Fu, Huixia; Xu, Yang; Oreshkin, A.

The reactivity of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes as arylation reagents is enabled in the presence of Cs2CO3 under the reaction conditions. This arylation method is highly efficient and occurs without the use of silver salt. The reaction tolerates a broad substrate scope that was not demonstrated by other silver salt-free C(sp(3))-H bond arylation conditions. The synthetic utility of the method is further illustrated in the synthesis of the psychotropic drug phenibut. A detailed mechanism study has been conducted to understand the reaction pathway.

The female has a distinct branch-cutting behavior in conjunction with oviposition in the acorns of its host plant. This study analyzed the factors influencing oviposition preference by carrying out continuous field surveys over the course of 2009-2010 and through laboratory rearing. The field survey showed that for both of the hosts, Cyclobalanopsis glaucoides Schottky (Fagales: Fagaceae) and Quercus franchetii Skan, M. ursulus preferred branches with fewer acorns and larger acorns on the same branch for oviposition. Laboratory rearing experiments showed offspring performance (i.e., survival rate and fresh weight of larvae) was significantly and positively correlated with acorn size. Preference for larger acorns could maximize the fitness of offspring by providing sufficient food source and space.

However, only one genome is available for all amphibians, that of Xenopus tropicalis, which is distantly related from the majority of frogs. More than 96% of frogs belong to the Neobatrachia, and no genome exists for this group. This dearth of amphibian genomes greatly restricts genomic studies of amphibians and, more generally, our understanding of tetrapod genome evolution. To fill this gap, we provide the de novo genome of a Tibetan Plateau frog, Nanorana parkeri, and compare it to that of X. tropicalis and other vertebrates. This genome encodes more than 20,000 protein-coding genes, a number similar to that of Xenopus. Although the genome size of Nanorana is considerably larger than that of Xenopus (2.3 vs. 1.5 Gb), most of the difference is due to the respective number of transposable elements in the two genomes. The two frogs exhibit considerable conserved whole-genome synteny despite having diverged approximately 266 Ma, indicating a slow rate of DNA structural evolution in anurans. Multigenome synteny blocks further show that amphibians have fewer interchromosomal rearrangements than mammals but have a comparable rate of intrachromosomal rearrangements. Our analysis also identifies 11 Mb of anuran-specific highly conserved elements that will be useful for comparative genomic analyses of frogs. The Nanorana genome offers an improved understanding of evolution of tetrapod genomes and also provides a genomic reference for other evolutionary studies.

To exploit the underlying geometrical structure, NSC-NPE constructs a global information-based dual-objective optimization function for modeling the process data. Besides the local variance information refined by the neighborhood preserving embedding algorithm, NSC-NPE also considers to utilize the meaningful nonlocal variance information via maximizing the Euclidean distance between the points outside the neighbors. The objective that having the local and nonlocal characteristics preserved in the low-dimensional space is achieved by minimizing the local scatter and maximizing the nonlocal scatter simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to fault detection based on the Hotelling's T-2 and squared prediction error (SPE) statistics. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electronic properties of single Ge/Si quantum dot grown by ion beam sputtering deposition	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Ge/Si single quantum dot; conductive atomic force microscopy; resonant tunneling; Coulomb blockade effect	ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY; SPECTROSCOPY; ISLANDS; SI(001); VOLTAGE; LAYER	The dependence of the electronic properties of a single Ge/Si quantum dot (QD) grown by the ion-beam sputtering deposition technique on growth temperature and QD diameter is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM). The Si-Ge intermixing effect is demonstrated to be important for the current distribution of single QDs. The current staircase induced by the Coulomb blockade effect is observed at higher growth temperatures (>700 degrees C) due to the formation of an additional barrier between dislocated QDs and Si substrate for the resonant tunneling of holes. According to the proposed single-hole-tunneling model, the fact that the intermixing effect is observed to increase as the incoherent QD size decreases may explain the increase in the starting voltage of the current staircase and the decrease in the current step width.

The simulation results indicate that various parameters such as the external driving force, the friction coefficient, the mass of the particle, the recycling strength, and the delay time can induce the current reversal phenomenon when the sign of the recycling strength is in agreement with the sign of the external bias force, otherwise the current reversal cannot be observed. Additionally, the asymptotic mean velocity as a function of the delay time of the recycled noise always shows a resonance-like behavior with the presence of a maximum current. These results demonstrate that the delay time and the recycling strength of the recycled noise can be used as the feasible and flexible control parameters for the amplitude and direction of the current.

Spectroscopic analysis, X-ray single crystal diffraction, and C-13 NMR DFT calculations confirmed that compound 1 and other duclauxin analogues possess the unified S configuration at C-9', which corrects a long-standing misrepresentation of duclauxins as C-9'R epimers. A plausible biosynthetic pathway for duclauxins is proposed on the basis of previous acetate labeling results for duclauxin and sclerodin.

They are also rather fragile due to the special physical geography conditions on the plateau. Based on Landsat MSS data in 1975, Landsat ETM+data in 2000, and Landsat TM data in 2008, geologic information of three major wetlands in northwestern Yunnan plateau as well as their temporal changes were investigated and their most influential factors were analyzed. The results indicate that the wetlands in northwestern Yunnan are not well developed due to the influence of mountainous landforms. Although the overall changes in the wetlands were not significant, there were significant spatial variations among the three regions because of different tectonic movements and human activities. The survey demonstrated that the marsh and lake wetlands in the northwestern Yunnan increased steadily from 1975 to 2000. This suggests that the improved awareness of environment protections has resulted in enhanced protection measures. Some marsh and lake wetlands were listed as Nature Reserves so that those wetland environments have been effectively protected and their area has been increased. The tectonic movement could also have contributed to the increase in lake and marsh wetlands. Wetland degradation and reduction between 2000 and 2008 were caused by regional climate changes, the expansion of farming lands around wetlands, and overgrazing on the mountain slopes.

J	Li, YJ; Cong, PY; Zhao, J; Hou, XG				Li, Yu-Jing; Cong, Pei-Yun; Zhao, Jun; Hou, Xian-Guang			New observations on morphological variation of genus Vetulicola with quadrate carapace from the Cambrian Chengjiang and Guanshan biotas, South China	PALAEOWORLD			English	Article						Cambrian; Chengjiang Biota; Guanshan Biota; Vetulicola; Sexual dimorphism; Evolution	DEUTEROSTOMES; LAGERSTATTE; DIMORPHISM; EVOLUTION; FAUNA	Vetulicolians are enigmatic fossils with a debated phylogenetic position; they first appeared during the Cambrian evolutionary explosion. The early Cambrian Chengjiang and Guanshan biotas from South China exhibit the highest taxonomic diversity of vetulicolians, with ten species described to date. Here we conduct a comparative study on the most common members of Genus Vetulicola that bear a quadrate carapace from these two biotas. Two morphotypes are recognized both within Vetulicola rectangulata from the Chengjiang Biota and within a new undetermined species, Vetulicola sp. from the Guanshan Biota. In both localities morphotypes differ from each other in the presence/absence of a posteroventral projection in the anterior body, and this is interpreted to possibly represent sexual dimorphism. These two Vetulicola species from the Chengjiang and Guanshan biotas also exhibit other morphological differences. Most notable is the position of the junction between the anterior and posterior parts of the body which is further towards the anterior in the specimens from the Guanshan Biota than those from the Chengjiang Biota. In addition, the expansion of the distal portion of the posterior body occurs from the third segment in the Chengjiang specimens but from the fourth segment in the Guanshan specimens. The most likely interpretation of these differences is that they reflect evolutionary adaption of the swimming ability of Vetulicola with a quadrate carapace from the Chengjiang to the Guanshan Biota.

J	Chen, AL; Muller, WEG; Hou, XG; Xiao, S				Chen, Ai-Lin; Mueller, W. E. G.; Hou, Xian-Guang; Xiao, Shuhai			New articulated protospongiid sponges from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota	PALAEOWORLD			English	Article						Cambrian; Chengjiang biota; Porifera; Hexactinellida; Reticulosa; Protospongiidae	HEXACTINELLID SPONGES; HOUSE RANGE; DRUM MOUNTAINS; BODY FOSSILS; SHALE; LAGERSTATTE; HISTORY; RECORD; ANHUI	Sponges are among the earliest diverging crown-group animals and widely regarded as the earliest biomineralizing animals Indeed, unambiguous hexactine sponge spicules first occur in the lowermost Cambrian strata of the Fortunian Stage. Articulated sponge skeletons interpreted as hexactinellids and demosponges have been reported from Cambrian Stage 2-3 strata at multiple localities. Articulated sponge skeletons in the Chengjiang biota (Cambrian Stage 3), however, are dominated by forms interpreted as demosponges, despite the exceptional preservation in this biota. Here, we report new articulated sponge skeletons from the Chengjiang biota, including Paradiagoniella magna n. gen. n. sp. and P xiaolantianensis n. gen. n. sp. The skeleton of both species consists of ranked stauractines and rare oxeas (straight or curved diactines), as well as hexactines in the former species. Their stauractines form irregular, nested, local sub-quadrules oriented obliquely to the sponge body axis. Sub-quadrules of different ranks are not in parallel arrangement. The two species are tentatively placed in the family Protospongiidae, which as currently defined may be a paraphyletic group including members of the total-group hexactinellids and perhaps stem-group siliceans. The phylogenetic placement of P magna and P xiaolantianensis is uncertain but, like many other protospongiids, they could be members of the total-group hexactinellids or stem-group siliceans. The diactines in the two species could be secondarily reduced hexactine-based spicules; alternatively, these two species may represent an evolutionary grade of stem-group siliceans with both diactines and hexactine-based spicules, the latter of which was lost in demosponges. A comprehensive cladistics analysis is needed to resolve the exact phylogenetic placement of the two species described here.

We aimed to investigate mutations and to characterize phenotypes in Chinese EOFAD families. Detailed clinical assessments and genetic screening for mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2, amyloid precursor protein, and APOE genes were carried out in 4 EOFAD families. Two PSEN1 mutations (p.R352C and p.M233L) were identified in 2 EOFAD families, respectively. Mutation p.M233L was associated with prominent very early onset, rapidly progressive dementia, and neurologic symptoms, whereas p.R352C was associated with a progressive dementia, psychiatric syndrome, and chronic disease course. Both mutations are predicted to be pathogenic. Our results showed that mutations in PSEN1 gene might be common in Chinese EOFAD families. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To address this question, we established rat models of hypothyroidism using (131)iodine (I-131) and hyperthyroidism using levothyroxine (LT4). Serum free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3) significantly decreased in the hypothyroid of rats with single injections of I-131 (5 mCi/kg). These.rats exhibited decreased depression-like behaviors in forced swimming test and sucrose preference tests, as well as decreased anxiety-like behaviors in an elevated plus maze. Diminished levels of brain serotonin (5-HT) and increased levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were found in the hypothyroid rats compared to the control saline-vehicle administered rats. LT4 treatment reversed the decrease in thyroid hormones and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, hyperthyroidism induced by weekly injections of LT4 (15 mu g/kg) caused a greater than 10-fold increase in serum FT4 and FT3 levels. The hyperthyroid rats exhibited higher anxietyand depression-like behaviors, higher brain 5-HT level, and lower hippocampal BDNF levels than the controls. Treatment with the antidepressant imipramine (15 mg/kg) diminished serum FT4 levels as well as anxietyand depression-like behaviors in the hyperthyroid rats but led to a further increase in brain 5-HT levels, compared with the controls or the hypothyroid rats. Together, our results suggest that hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have bidirectional effects on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats, possibly by modulating hippocampal BDNF levels.

MN8, a cold-adapted bacterium isolated from lead-zinc-rich soil. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coil BL21(DE3). The resultant 505-residue polypeptide (InuAMN8) showed the highest identity (81.1%) with the putative levanase from Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans Sphe3 (ADX73279) and shared 57.8% identity with the exo-inulinase from Bacillus sp. snu-7 (AAK00768). The purified recombinant InuAMN8 (rInuAMN8) showed an apparently optimal activity at 35 degrees C, and 753%, 39.4%, and 15.8% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 0 degrees C, respectively. After pre-incubation for 60 min at 50 degrees C and 55 degrees C, the rInuAMN8 exhibited 69.8% and 17.7% of its initial activity, respectively. The apparent K-m values of rInuAMN8 towards inulin were 2.8, 1.5, 1.2, 5.3, and 8.2 mM at 0 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C, respectively. Inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers were effectively hydrolyzed to release fructose by rInuAMN8 at 0 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. Compared with its hyperthermophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the exo-inulinase had less aromatic amino acid F and more hydrophobic amino acid A. In addition, the purified rInuAMN8 retained 127.9%-88.4% inulinase activity at 3.5%-15.0% (w/v) NaCl concentrations. Zn2+ and Pb2+ at 10 mM exhibited little or no effect on the enzyme activity. This paper is the first to report a cold-active and/or NaCl-tolerant exo-inulinase from the genus Arthrobacter. The exo-inulinase rInuAMN8 shows a potential for use in the production of fructose at low temperatures. (C) 2014, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

Global delay induced transition in a bistable system with multiplicative and additive noises	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Bistable system; Global delay; Transition; Noise	STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; TIME DELAYS; DRIVEN	Global time delay is introduced to a bistable system driven by multiplicative and additive noises. Approximation of small delay and numerical simulations are employed to investigate the delay induced transition. The stationary probability distribution function P-st(x) and the first order moment < x >(st) are derived. Results indicate that with the increase of global time delay, P-st(x) undergoes a transition from a bimodal structure to a unimodal shape and < x >(st) as a function of the multiplicative noise intensity exhibits suppression-like and resonance-like behavior. For the case of multiplicative noise with delay, P-st(x) undergoes a transition from a monostable to a bistable system. These results illustrate that global delay can control the transition of a bistable system effectively.	[Du, L. C.; Mei, D.

J	Yan, DH; Zhang, L				Yan, Dahai; Zhang, Li			Understanding the TeV emission from a distant blazar PKS 1424+240 in a lepto-hadronic jet model	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 1424+240; gamma-rays: galaxies	EXTRAGALACTIC BACKGROUND LIGHT; BL LACERTAE OBJECTS; GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA; MRK 421; ACCELERATION PROCESSES; SELF-CONSISTENT; RADIO QUASARS; LAC OBJECTS; LOWER-LIMIT; FERMI	We investigate the formation of the TeV spectrum of a distant blazar PKS 1424+240 residing at a redshift z >= 0.6 in two scenarios in the frame of a lepto-hadronic jet model, taking the uncertainties of both extragalactic background light (EBL) and its redshift into account. In the first scenario, TeV emission is attributed to the synchrotron emission of pair cascades resulting from the p gamma interaction. In the second scenario, TeV emission is attributed to the proton-synchrotron emission, and an internal absorption due to interaction with the photons around the jet is included. Our results show that in the first scenario the 68 per cent upper limit of its redshift, within which this scenario can explain the VERITAS TeV spectrum in 2009 well, is similar to 0.75. In the second scenario, this upper limit of the redshift becomes similar to 1.03. However, the second scenario can be excluded because it requires an unreasonable photon field around the jet with a luminosity of similar to 10(43) erg s(-1). In conclusion, the jet model can explain its TeV spectrum with a low EBL density if 0.6 < z < 0.75.

Sequence data were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference, and selected morphological traits were mapped onto the molecular tree. The molecular results strongly supported monophyly of Urticeae, excluding Gyrotaenia, which is related to Elatostemateae. All genera were monophyletic except for Urtica, Laportea, and Urera. Two Hesperocnide species are nested within Urtica. Laportea and Urera are divided into three groups with a strong geographical signal. The inferred phylogeny indicates five well-supported clades in Urticeae: clade A including Urtica (with Hesperocnide), Zhengyia, Laportea I, and Nanocnide; clade B comprising Dendrocnide and Discocnide; clade C including only Girardinia; clade D including Laportea II; and clade E including Obetia, Urera I, II, III, and Poikilospermum. Although it is difficult to identify morphological synapomorphies for these well-defined clades within Urticeae, character analysis shows that the herbaceous habit and alternate leaves are the ancestral states in the tribe. The presence of stinging hairs is the derived status in Urticeae, and it might have been a key innovation triggering species diversification in the tribe.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the newly synthesized compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group C2/c and Z = 4. [P4O12](4-) anionic rings and HoO8 polyhedra display a three-dimensional (3D) framework by corner-sharing. The ten-coordinated potassium atoms are located in the delimited tunnels. KHoP4O12 exhibits the blue light emission under the excitation of 330 nm. To gain further insights into electronic properties of crystal KHoP4O12, theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) was performed using the total-energy code CASTEP with the LDA + U approach. The calculated bandgap with U = 3.0-3.5 eV is in good agreement with the experimental measurement.

J	Xue, H; Li, SY; Chang, J				Xue, Hui; Li, Shiyu; Chang, Jie			Combining ecosystem service relationships and DPSIR framework to manage multiple ecosystem services	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem service relationship; Mechanisms; Direct interaction; Single land-use/land-cover	TRADE-OFFS; AGRICULTURE; LAND; SCENARIOS; SYNERGIES; IMPACTS; FUTURE; REGION; STATE; TOOL	Ecosystem service (ES) relationship occurs due to two types of mechanisms: (1) interact directly or (2) interact through the impact of a shared factor. Identifying such mechanisms behind ES relationship within a single land-use/land-cover category and combining it with a system thinking framework is especially necessary for effective decision-making to manage multiple ESs generated by this land-use/land-cover. In this study, we use tea plantations in China to investigate mechanisms behind ES relationships. We find that tea production is positively correlated with four regulating services (i.e., carbon sequestration, soil N protection, soil P protection, and water conservation). Several regulating services, such as carbon sequestration and soil N, P, and K protection, have positive correlations with each other. Tea production, carbon sequestration, and soil retention are significantly correlated with local annual mean temperature and precipitation. We then establish driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework for tea plantations, which has been widely used for environmental management issues. Integrating our findings of ES relationship into DPSIR framework, we can estimate how ES change is responding to two types of responses: response to control drivers and response to maintain or restore state. Scenario analysis showed that the responses to control drivers have a larger impact on ES. We discuss that DPSIR would favor managing multiple ES because it enables a more precise understanding of how ES interacts through the effects of factors from various hierarchies. Finally, we suggest integrating ES direct interaction into DPSIR framework. We think such integration could improve the ability of DPSIR framework to support decision-making in multiple ES management, specifically in at least three aspects: (1) favor to identify all possible response alternatives, (2) enable us to evaluate ES which cannot be assessed if without such combining, and (3) help to identify ecological leverage points where small management investment can yield substantial benefits.

However, the microbial physiology and community structure can be influenced by environmental conditions. In this study, four pilot-scale integrated vertical-flow constructed wetlands (IVCWs) were employed to treat domestic and nitrified wastewaters. The microbial properties, along with their response to wastewater quality characteristics and seasonal variation, were determined. The results showed higher Shannon-Weiner diversity (H) and evenness (E) index of fatty acids (FAs), and relative abundances of signature FAs in down-flow cells and in the systems fed with domestic wastewater (DW). The relative abundances of fungi and gram-negative and aerobic bacteria were greater in up-flow cells. The dominant anaerobic bacteria found in most cells might be accounted for the prevailing anaerobic environment within the wetland beds, which could mean that the system fed with nitrified wastewater (NW) should perform better in nitrogen removal. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that pollutant concentrations, especially organic matter, influence the FA compositions greatly, and the most significant difference of microbial community structures was detected in down-flow cells fed with DW and up-flow ones with NW. The branched FAs, which could be used to represent anaerobic bacteria, were observed in down-flow cells treating DW and had a significant positive correlation with chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration, probably suggesting the important role of anaerobic bacteria in organic matter degradation in the IVCWs. Seasonal variation, however, did not greatly influence the microbial community structure in the IVCWs.

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; DIVERSITY; MEMBER; LAYER; WELLS	A white bacterial strain, designated EGI 650022(T), was isolated from the roots of Salsola affinis C. A. Mey, collected from Urumqi City, Xinjiang, north-western China. The strain was found to be aerobic, Gram-stain positive, oxidase-positive and catalase-positive. Cells were non-motile and irregular rods. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 7 % (w/v), temperatures between 5 and 45 A degrees C, and pH 6.0-9.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain EGI 650022(T) belongs to a clade with the genera Okibacterium and Plantibacter in the family Microbacteriaceae. The novel strain EGI 650022(T) showed highest levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with members of the genera Okibacterium and Plantibacter (97.2-98.0 %). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained glutamate, homoserine, glycine, alanine and lysine. The predominant menaquinones (MKs) were MK-11, MK-12 and MK-12 (H-4). The polar lipid pattern comprised phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, two unknown glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The DNA G+C content was 66.0 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain EGI 650022(T) with Okibacterium fritillariae DSM 12584(T), Plantibacter flavus DSM 14012(T) and Plantibacter auratus DSM 19586(T) were 39.7, 19.7 and 22.0 %. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain EGI 650022(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Okibacterium, for which the name Okibacterium endophyticum sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is EGI 650022(T) (=JCM 30086(T) = KCTC 29492(T)).

The results show that both mercaptopyrimidine derivatives act as good inhibitors, and inhibition efficiency follows the order: AHMP > DHMP. The adsorption of either inhibitor on steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Two mercaptopyrimidine derivatives are mixedtype inhibitors. The inhibitor molecules adsorb on the Fe (001) surface in the nearly flat manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study targeting the Meloidogyne incognita-Phytophthora nicotianae complex, DAB from the tobacco rhizosphere were identified and screened against the diseases caused by one or both pathogens in tobacco. RESULTSFrom 450 soil tobacco rhizosphere samples, 26 DAB were identified and had in vitro nematicidal and antifungal efficacies of 37.2-100% and 32.9-73.4% respectively. These DAB were classified into 19 species of 11 genera. In pot experiments, Streptomyces flavofunginiSNA26, Pseudomonas putidaSNB53 and Serratia marcescens subsp. sakuensisSNB54 effectively suppressed black shank (control effect 72.0-80.2%), root knot (70.0-81.7) and the disease complex (58.7-68.5%) caused by P. nicotianae, M. incognita and both pathogens in tobacco respectively. CONCLUSIONNineteen DAB species were demonstrated to be antagonists against the M. incognita-P. nicotianae complex. Because S. flavofunginiSNA26, P. putidaSNB53 and S. marcescens subsp. sakuensisSNB54 significantly suppressed the infection of M. incognita and P. nicotianae in tobacco, these species have potential for development as biocontrol agents against the diseases and complex caused by these two pathogens.

This system and another parallel duckweed system without carriers were operated for 1.5 years. The results indicated the addition of the carrier did not significantly affect the growth and composition of duckweed, the recovery of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and CO2 or the removal of TP. However, it significantly improved the removal efficiency of TN and NH+4-N (by 19.97% and 15.02%, respectively). The use of 454 pyrosequencing revealed large differences of the microbial communities between the different components within a system and similarities within the same components between the two systems. The carrier biofilm had the highest bacterial diversity and relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria (3%) and denitrifying bacteria (24% of Rhodocyclaceae), which improved nitrogen removal of the system. An efficient N-removal duckweed system with enhanced microorganisms was established. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, toxicological information on their effects on red blood cells (RBCs) and the High mechanisms involved remain sparse. In this article, we examined the size dependent nanotoxicity of AgNPs using three different characteristic sizes of 15 rim (AgNPs15), 50 rim (AgNPs50), and 100 nm (AgNP5100) against fish RBCs. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations showed that AgNPs exhibited a size effect on their adsorption and uptake by RBCs. The middle sized AgNP550, compared with the smaller or bigger ones, showed the highest level of adsorption and uptake by the RBCs, suggesting an optimal size of rim for passive uptake by RBCs. The toxic effects Low determined based on the hemolysis, membrane injury, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme production were fairly size and dose dependent. In particular, the smallest sized AgNPs15 displayed a greater ability to induce hernolysis and membrane damage than AgNPs50 and AgNPs100. Such cytotoxicity induced by AgNPs should be attributed to the direct interaction of the nanoparticle with the RBCs, resulting in the production of oxidative stress, membrane injury, and subsequently hemolysis. Overall, the results suggest that particle size is a critical factor influencing the interaction between AgNPs and the RBCs.

Porous Co3O4 material was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause. Co3O4 with the 3D hierarchical porous structure consisting of nanoparticles has a coral-like shape with a size of tens of micrometers and exhibits the hierarchically porous morphology, in which the walls of the macropores contain smaller mesopores. The catalytic performance of the porous Co3O4 for CO oxidation has been studied with a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz microreactor. The porous Co3O4 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for CO oxidation, the CO conversion rate reaches 100% at 140 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthesized mesoporous titania samples were characterized using a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as N-2 adsorption/desorption measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results of physicochemical characterizations showed that the as-synthesized sample was a composite of highly crystalline mesoporous anatase titania and graphitic carbon (gc-MTiO2), which implies the dual function of hypocrellins as template and "dopant". The in situ doped graphitic carbon significantly increased the visible-light absorbance of TiO2. The gc-MTiO2 exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity under visible-light for photodegradation of acetaldehyde, a common indoor air pollutant. The photophysics and electron dynamics in this photocatalytic process were studied by time-resolved FT-IR spectra, in particular on the nano- to milli-second time scale. It is observed that electrons were injected into the conduction band of gc-MTiO2 and they were decayed to deep traps caused by graphitic carbon. The reported strategies could open up new uses for mesoporous titania self-doped with carbon in applications such as solar cells, photocatalysts, photoelectrical devices, and photo-induced sensors.

The sensor was prepared by electropolymerizing o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in the presence of PPT as template, and then removing the template by immersing the modified GCE in ethanol. Experimental parameters such as the types of monomer, scan cycles, concentration of o-PD and extraction condition were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the sensor exhibits a good selectivity and high sensitivity. A good linearity was obtained in the range of 4 x 10(-8) mol.L-1 to 3.2 x 10(-5) mol.L-1 with an estimated detection limit of 4.8 x 10(-9) mol.L-1. The sensor was applied to the determination of PPT in podophyllum hexandrum and human serum samples with satisfactory results.

J	Tang, AM; Tang, NS				Tang, An-Min; Tang, Nian-Sheng			Semiparametric Bayesian inference on skew-normal joint modeling of multivariate longitudinal and survival data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian local influence analysis; centered Dirichlet process prior; joint models; skew-normal distribution; survival data	LATENT VARIABLE MODELS; FAILURE TIME DATA; EVENT DATA; P-SPLINES; DISTRIBUTIONS; ERROR	We propose a semiparametric multivariate skew-normal joint model for multivariate longitudinal and multivariate survival data. One main feature of the posited model is that we relax the commonly used normality assumption for random effects and within-subject error by using a centered Dirichlet process prior to specify the random effects distribution and using a multivariate skew-normal distribution to specify the within-subject error distribution and model trajectory functions of longitudinal responses semiparametrically. A Bayesian approach is proposed to simultaneously obtain Bayesian estimates of unknown parameters, random effects and nonparametric functions by combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Particularly, a Bayesian local influence approach is developed to assess the effect of minor perturbations to within-subject measurement error and random effects. Several simulation studies and an example are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It has been suggested that the dynamic assembly of septin, including the processes from septin initially localizing to the presumptive bud site to the septin collar finally splitting into two cells, coordinates closely with the checkpoint response of cell cycle. Here, we discovered that over-expression of Alcohol sensitive Ring/PHD finger 1 protein (Asr1p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae triggered the Swe1p-dependent cell cycle checkpoint for a G2/M transition delay, and this G2/M transition delay was caused by the septin defect. Since it was shown that Asr1p affected actin dynamics through the interaction with Crnlp and crn1 should be epistatic to asr1 in the regulation of actin, the gene knockout of crn1 in the Asr1 p over-expression strain restored the defects in septin and cell cycle along with the disordered actin dynamics. Our investigation further showed that the disturbed septin assembly caused by abnormal Asr1p lead to the abnormal localization of the checkpoint proteins such as Gla4/PAK and Cdc5/Polo, and finally triggered the Swe1p-dependent G2/M transition arrest. Additionally, the Ring finger/PHD domains of Asr1p were illustrated to be required but not sufficient for its role in septin. Taken together, our current data suggested a close relationship in the assembly between septin and actin cytoskeleton, which also partially explained how actin cytoskeleton participated in the regulation of the checkpoint of G2/M.

This probe contains two tailored DNA sequence. One is a signal probe contains a cytosine-rich sequence template for AgNCs synthesis and link sequence at both ends. The other is a guanine-rich sequence for signal enhancement and link sequence complementary to the link sequence of the signal probe. After hybridization, the fluorescence of hybridized double-strand DNA/AgNCs is 200-fold enhanced based on the fluorescence enhancement effect of DNA/AgNCs in proximity of guanine-rich DNA sequence. The double-strand DNA/AgNCs probe is brighter and stable than that of single-strand DNA/AgNCs, and more importantly, can be used as novel fluorescent probes for detecting mercury and copper ions. Mercury and copper ions in the range of 6.0-160.0 and 6-240 nM, can be linearly detected with the detection limits of 2.1 and 3.4 nM, respectively. Our results indicated that the analytical parameters of the method for mercury and copper ions detection are much better than which using a single-strand DNA/AgNCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The risks and vulnerabilities arise in three areas: (1) serious issues of water security arise, both internally and externally, relating to water quantity and water quality; (2) transboundary waters management is hampered by weak capacity across the region; and (3) underdeveloped legal regimes, including procedural requirements for the exchange of information, prior notification and early warning mechanisms, make it difficult to realize effective international transboundary water cooperation.

Chen & S.Y. Yang is a cycad endemic to the Red River drainage region that occurs under evergreen forest on steep limestone slopes in Southwest China and northern Vietnam. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collecting for the ornamental plant trade, and only several populations remain. In this study, we assess the genetic variation, population structure, and phylogeography of Cycas multipinnata populations to help develop strategies for the conservation of the species. 60 individuals from six populations were used for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing and 100 individuals from five populations were genotyped using 17 nuclear microsatellites. High genetic differentiation among populations was detected, suggesting that pollen or seed dispersal was restricted within populations. Two main genetic clusters were observed in both the cpDNA and microsatellite loci, corresponding to Yunnan China and northern Vietnam. These clusters indicated low levels of gene flow between the regions since their divergence in the late Pleistocene, which was inferred from both Bayesian and coalescent analysis. In addition, the result of a Bayesian skyline plot based on cpDNA portrayed a long history of constant population size followed by a decline in the last 50,000 years of Cycas multipinnata that was perhaps affected by the Quaternary glaciations, a finding that was also supported by the Garza-Williamson index calculated from the microsatellite data. The genetic consequences produced by climatic oscillations and anthropogenic disturbances are considered key pressures on Cycas multipinnata. To establish a conservation management plan, each population of Cycas multipinnata should be recognized as a Management Unit (MU). In situ and ex situ actions, such as controlling overexploitation and creating a germplasm bank with high genetic diversity, should be urgently implemented to preserve this species.

Using atomic force microscopy, lots of new short islands with smaller diameters, high islands with transition dome (TD) shape, and super islands with similar to 20 nm in height are observed after the Ge layer deposition. This anomalous experimental finding is well clarified by a model of regeneration and secondary growth. It is found that the density of the super islands increases rapidly at the initial stage when the Ge coverage exceeds similar to 1.2 nm. This is essentially the result of the selective aggregation of Ge adatoms on the pre-SiGe island layer. The Ge content and stored strain in SiGe islands calculated based on Raman spectra decrease with the increase of the Ge coverage. It is demonstrated that the chemical potential difference-induced lateral atomic migration (LAM) from amorphous SiGe alloy into SiGe islands can be responsible for this phenomenon. The LAM also leads to the formation of very large dome islands. Finally, the overlap behavior of neighbor islands in the sample with 2.2 nm-thick Ge layer is explained by the combined action of denser nucleation centers, faster growth rates of super islands in lateral direction, and coarsening of neighbor small islands.

To date, little is known about the WRKY TF family in Brassica oleracea. Recently, the completed genome sequence of cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata) allows us to systematically analyze WRKY genes in this species. A total of 148 WRKY genes were characterized and classified into seven subgroups that belong to three major groups. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed that the repertoire of cabbage WRKY genes was derived from a common ancestor shared with Arabidopsis thaliana. The B. oleracea WRKY genes were found to be preferentially retained after the whole-genome triplication (WGT) event in its recent ancestor, suggesting that the WGT event had largely contributed to a rapid expansion of the WRKY gene family in B. oleracea. The analysis of RNA-Seq data from various tissues (i.e., roots, stems, leaves, buds, flowers and siliques) revealed that most of the identified WRKY genes were positively expressed in cabbage, and a large portion of them exhibited patterns of differential and tissue-specific expression, demonstrating that these gene members might play essential roles in plant developmental processes. Comparative analysis of the expression level among duplicated genes showed that gene expression divergence was evidently presented among cabbage WRKY paralogs, indicating functional divergence of these duplicated WRKY genes.

X-ray diffraction spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the morphology and microstructure of SnO2 nanorods boscages. The results show that the SnO2 nanorods boscage consists of single crystalline, rutile SnO2 nanorods with a diameter of 4-10 nm and length of about 200 nm. The formation and growth of the boscage-like SnO2 nanorods can be rationally expressed by the Ostwald-ripening assisted oriented attachment mechanism as a kinetically controlled nonclassical crystallization process.

TiO2-WC was prepared by the dip-sol-gel method, which was followed by calcination. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption/desorption measurement, element analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that titania particles of 10-20 nm were dispersed on the wood charcoal which had a mimicked wood tissue structure. And the titania in composites was found to be composed of 75-80 wt% anatase and 20-25 wt% rutile. The mass ratios of wood charcoal in TiO2-WC were 28.20-39.94 wt%. The adsorption ability and photocatalytic activity of the prepared TiO2-WC composites were evaluated by the removal ratio of bisphenol A (BPA). The results showed that the prepared TiO2-WC composites had extraordinary adsorption ability for BPA and good photocatalytic activity. The hydrophobic BPA in water can be efficiently removed by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on TiO2-WC composites synergistically. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The tadalafil electrochemical signal could be dramatically amplified by introducing 40% of acetonitrile in buffer medium and further enhanced by the host-guest molecular recognition capacity of beta-cyclodextrin. Uniform and monodispersed similar to 5.0 nm Au NPs were anchored on the SiC-NH2 surface via a chemical reduction process by using polyethylene glycol and sodium citrate as dispersant and stabilizing agent. CM-beta-CD was covalently bound on Au@SiC by combining the amine group of SiC-NH2 with the carboxyl group of CM-beta-CD with the aid of EDC/NHS coupling agent. SH-beta-CD could tightly attach to the surface of Au@SiC by the strong coordinating capability between Au and thiol. Differential pulse voltammetry was successfully used to quantify tadalafil within the concentration range of 0.01-100 mu M under optimal conditions with a detection limit (S/N=3) of 2.5 nM. In addition, the beta-CD-Au@SiC nanohybrid electrochemical sensor showed high selectivity to two other erectile dysfunction drugs sildenafil and vardenafil. The proposed electrochemical sensing platform was successfully used to determine tadalafil in raw materials, herbal sexual health products, and spiked human serum samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Under the optimal conditions, the sensor named as ART-MIM/G/GCE exhibited a good selectivity, high sensitivity and considerably better resistance against some analogs of artemisinin such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artemether (ARM) and artesunate (ARTS). The calibration graph for the determination of artemisinin by the sensor was linear in the range of 1.0 x 10(-8) mol L-1 to 4.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1 with the detection limit of 2.0 x 10(-9) mol L-1. Meanwhile, this sensor possessed of good regeneration, stability and practicability. It could retain more than 94% of its original response after used at least 80 times or stored in water at room temperature for 60 days. The obtained sensor was successfully applied to determine the contents of artemisinin in the extract of Artemisia annua L with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.5% (n=5).

General considerations for the miniaturization of radiative antennae	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							FIELD ENHANCEMENT; SCATTERING; RESONANCES; PLASMONICS	The small size of plasmonic nanostructures compared to the wavelength of light is one of their most distinct and defining characteristics. It results in the strong compression of an incident wave to intense hot spots which have been used most remarkably for molecular sensing and nanoscale lasers. But another important direction for research is to use this ability to design miniaturized interconnects and modulators between fast, loss-less photonic components. Here we show that despite their high absorption, conductors are still the best materials to reach the sub-wavelength regime for efficient antennae when compared to polar crystals and high-index dielectrics, two classes of material which have shown a lot of potential recently in nanophotonic applications. By identifying the relevant dimensionless properties for the three materials considered, we present an unified understanding of the behaviour of sub-wavelength components which are at the heart of current photonic research and cast the upper achievable limits for radiative antennae crucial to the development of real-life implementation.

The Case of Meehania (Lamiaceae)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DISPERSAL-VICARIANCE ANALYSIS; SCRUB MINTS LAMIACEAE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; NONCODING REGIONS; EVOLUTION; NUCLEAR; GENUS; DNA; HYBRIDIZATION; PATTERNS	Despite considerable progress, many details regarding the evolution of the Arcto-Tertiary flora, including the timing, direction, and relative importance of migration routes in the evolution of woody and herbaceous taxa of the Northern Hemisphere, remain poorly understood. Meehania (Lamiaceae) comprises seven species and five subspecies of annual or perennial herbs, and is one of the few Lamiaceae genera known to have an exclusively disjunct distribution between eastern Asia and eastern North America. We analyzed the phylogeny and biogeographical history of Meehania to explore how the Arcto-Tertiary biogeographic hypothesis and two possible migration routes explain the disjunct distribution of Northern Hemisphere herbaceous plants. Parsimony and Bayesian inference were used for phylogenetic analyses based on five plastid sequences (rbcL, rps16, rpl32-trnH, psbA-trnH, and trnL-F) and two nuclear (ITS and ETS) gene regions. Divergence times and biogeographic inferences were performed using Bayesian methods as implemented in BEAST and S-DIVA, respectively. Analyses including 11 of the 12 known Meehania taxa revealed incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear trees, particularly in the positions of Glechoma and Meehania cordata, possibly indicating allopolyploidy with chloroplast capture in the late Miocene. Based on nrDNA, Meehania is monophyletic, and the North American species M. cordata is sister to a clade containing the eastern Asian species. The divergence time between the North American M. cordata and the eastern Asian species occurred about 9.81 Mya according to the Bayesian relaxed clock methods applied to the combined nuclear data. Biogeographic analyses suggest a primary role of the Arcto-Tertiary flora in the study taxa distribution, with a northeast Asian origin of Meehania. Our results suggest an Arcto-Tertiary origin of Meehania, with its present distribution most probably being a result of vicariance and southward migrations of populations during climatic oscillations in the middle Miocene with subsequent migration into eastern North America via the Bering land bridge in the late Miocene.

In the glass-ceramic material the Eu3+ ions are embedded in both silica network and in the sites of the PbF2 nanocrystals structure. The nanocomposite exhibited intense blue and green emissions originating from the D-5(1,2,3) levels of Eu3+ incorporated in the low-phonon-energy PbF2 nanocrystals, and red emission corresponding to the Eu3+:D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions, under the excitation of single wavelength light at 394 nm. By adjusting the Eu3+ doping content, various luminescent colors, were easily tuned through cross relaxation processes between Eu3+ ions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gao, L; Li, YT; Wang, RW				Gao, Lei; Li, Yao-Tang; Wang, Rui-Wu			The shift between the Red Queen and the Red King effects in mutualisms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FIG-WASP MUTUALISM; HOST SANCTIONS; CLEANER FISH; EVOLUTIONARY STABILITY; YUCCA MOTHS; COOPERATION; GAMES; DYNAMICS; COMPETITION; DILEMMAS	Interspecific mutualisms consist of partners trading services that yield common benefits to both species. Until now, understanding how the payoffs from mutualistic cooperation are allocated among the participants has been problematic. Two hypotheses have been proposed to resolve this problem. The Red Queen effect argues that faster-evolving species are favoured in co-evolutionary processes because they are able to obtain a larger share of benefits. Conversely, the Red King effect argues that the slower-evolving species gains a larger share of benefits. The model we propose shows that the allocations for a common benefit vary when the effect of a reward mechanism is included in the model. The outcome is a shift from the Red Queen effect to the Red King effect and vice versa. In addition, our model shows that either an asymmetry in payoff or an asymmetry in the number of cooperative partners causes a shift between the Red Queen effect and the Red King effect. Even in situations where the evolutionary rates are equal between the two species, asymmetries in rewards and in participant number lead to an uneven allocation of benefits among the partners.

There are a limited number of studies on its photophysical and photosensitive properties. In this study, formation of semiquinone anion radical and EA autosensitized photooxidation reactions were examined. Rate constant of semiquinone anion radical formation under anaerobic condition, and rate constant of autosensitized photooxidation reaction under aerobic condition were measured for Elsinochrome A (EA) by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-visible spectra, respectively. The rate constant of formation was estimated at 0.767 min(-1) (R-2 = 0.963) using the zero-order reaction equation. The autosensitized photooxidation reaction occurred only when irradiation and oxygen co-existed in the EA solution. The average reaction rate constant was 3.22 +/- 0.36 (x10(-9), mol.s(-1)), and EA half-life was 4.48 +/- 0.52 (h) in the tetrachloromethane solution.

NOV.; FLAVOBACTERIACEAE; FAMILY	A novel, Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped yellow bacterium, designated VBW088(T) was isolated from a shallow water hydrothermal vent in Espalamaca in the Azores. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain VBW088(T) clustered with three type strains of species of the genus Vitellibacter and exhibited a sequence similarity of 97.3% with Vitellibacter soesokkakensis RSSK-12(T). However, strain VBW088(T) and V. soesokkakensis RSSK-12(T) exhibited low DNA-DNA relatedness (12.7 +/- 3.5 %). Strain VBW088(T) was positive for catalase and oxidase. Growth occurred at 10-37 degrees C, with the optimum at 80 degrees C, and at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 6.0) and in up to 5% (w/v) NaCl with optimum growth at 1-2% (w/v) NaCl. The major fatty acids (>10%) were iso-C-15:0 (33.5%) and iso-C-17:0 3-OH (32.0%). The polar lipids detected in strain VBW088(T) consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and three unidentified phospholipids. The DNA G+C content of strain VBW088(T) was 36.7 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic inference, DNA-DNA relatedness, chemotaxonomic analysis and physiological data, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Vitellibacter, for which the name Vitellibacter nionensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain as VBW088(T).

The fungus differs from previously known Orbilia species in that it has rod-shaped ascospores with a tear-shaped spore body. An anamorph that was obtained from ascospore isolates is characterized as producing long, curved macroconidia and much smaller, partly helicoid microconidia. Morphologically, this anamorph fits the polyphyletic genus Anguillospora. Based on a sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) gained from two isolates, O. yuanensis nested near species of the Orbilia luteorubella aggregate, although at a rather high distance. To date, there have been two reports regarding a connection between Orbilia species and their Anguillospora anamorph. The connection between O. yuanensis and its Anguillospora anamorph discussed here is the third published report. In this paper, both teleomorph and anamorph are illustrated and described.

These qualities lead to excellent performance in magneto-optical devices, magnetic resonance imaging, ferrofluids and magnetic separation. The purpose of this study is to fabricate P-type one dimensional CuAlO2-based diluted magnetic semiconductor nanofibers. First, we fabricated CuAl0.95Co0.05O2 nanofibers with an average diameter of 1 mu m with the electrospinning method. The annealed nanofibers were thermally treated at a temperature of 1 100 degrees C and then shrunk to a diameter of about 650 nm. We used X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectra to confirm that the CuAl0.95Co0.05O2 nanofibers had a single impurity free delafossite phase. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that Co was present in the +2 oxidation state, resulting in an room temperature ferromagnetism in the CuAl0.95Co0.05O2 fiber. This contrasts with nonmagnetism in pristine CuAlO2 fiber. The coercivity (H-c) value of 65.26 Oe and approximate saturation magnetization (M-s) of 0.012 emu/g demonstrate good evidence of ferromagnetism at room temperature for CuAl0.95Co0.05O2 nanofibers.

This study aimed to exploit expressed sequence tags-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) and to analyse the population genetic differentiation of C militaris. The SSR frequency of C. militaris in ESTs was 24.3%. Monorepeats were the most abundant motif (83.4%), and the most frequent mono-repeat was A/T (98.8%). The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) of the seven populations of C militaris ranged from 11.7% to 73.7% with a mean of 34.7%.Shannon's information index ranged from 0.0576 to 0.3021 with a mean of 0.1623. The total genetic diversity of C militaris was 0.1907, and the genetic diversity within the population was 0.1049. The coefficient of gene differentiation was 0.4500, indicating extensive genetic differentiation of this species. The mean Nei's genetic distance among the C militaris populations was 0.1184. The UPGMA dendrogram exhibited a low correlation between the genetic and geographic distances, which can also be confirmed by the Mantel test. The high level of diversification among populations may be due to deforestation and forest fragmentation in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of cytotoxicity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480) using the MTT assay shows that some of these glycosylated derivatives have good anticancer activity. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 21a shows the highest activity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 6.70 mu M, which is more potent than the control drugs etoposide and cisplatin. Compound 21a is characterized by a perbutyrylated alpha-D(+)-galactosyl residue, the absence of an additional linking spacer between the sugar residue and the triazole ring, as well as a 4'-OH group on the E ring of the podophyllotoxin scaffold.

The differences between the structure and evolution of a 15M(circle dot) rotating star with and without magnetic fields are discussed. Our results show that the magnetic fields have an effect on the structure and evolution of the star mainly during the central helium burning phase; and this influences the physical quantities in the stellar envelope where hydrogen and helium are partially ionized. This may influence stellar pulsation.

Understanding the distribution characters of BD circulation is very important to further study the influence of stratosphere and troposphere exchange and forecast the global climate change. The BD circulation is described as the Lagrangian-mean circulation, it is difficult to diagnose directly from meteorological observations. The methods of the transformed Eulerian-mean (TEM) equations, and integrating residual meridional velocity in the vertical were used to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution characters of BD circulation, by using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data for 1979-2011 at 12:00 UTC. We further compared the distribution characters of BD circulation with the result calculated by the method of DC (downward control) principle and studied the relationship between the stratospheric zonal mean temperature and BD circulation. The BD circulation was calculated from ERA-Interim reanalysis data for 1979-2011 by integrating residual meridional velocity in the vertical. The results showed that: (1) The ascending centers of BD circulation were varied with seasons. It ascended at 300 degrees S in the stratosphere for December to February (DJF), for June to August (JJA) it ascended between 25 degrees N and 300 degrees N, the circulation pattern in the winter hemisphere is stronger than the summer hemisphere. In March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON), the ascending center were between equator to 5 degrees N, and circulation were relatively symmetrically for two hemispheres. (2) The maximum mass flux in the tropical and extratropical northern hemisphere appeared during DJF, the minimum appeared during JJA. The mass flux in extratropical southern hemisphere was just the opposite. Mass flux across the 100 hPa and 50 hPa pressure surface in tropical and extratropical trended to decreasing, and also had obviously seasonal variation. (3) The long-term trend of stratospheric zonal mean temperature was consistent with the long-term weakening trend of BD circulation, this indicated that the global BD circulation has been weakened. Meanwhile, the zonal mean temperature in different altitude and latitude bands varied with seasons. From the perspective of the global mass transportation, the stratospheric BD circulation has been weakened in the past 33 years, especially in the middle and lower stratosphere, and was consistent with the long-term trend of temperature. This weakened trend was consistent with the observation study in the age of stratospheric air and other model results. But the method of DC principle, GCMs model and other studies showed that the stratospheric BD circulation has been enhanced in the past years. Using different methods and data would lead the trend estimation of BD circulation were unreliable. Therefore, further research will be required to improve the reliability of BD circulation.

We relocate sequences via the hypoDD method using the cross-correlated arrival times. The phase picking errors by the human analysts had only 0.01 s difference before and after 2009; however, the P-phase picking precision increased from the tenths to the hundredths place after 2009, and the relocation errors of hypoDD simultaneously decreased by a factor of 2. The rupture dimensions are about 2-4 km for the five sequences. The hypoDD relocation errors are only 0.36 or 0.63 km for the two test clusters, which are much smaller than the dimensions of the rupture areas. The synthetic tests show no location bias from the distribution of the Yunnan regional seismic network. The relocations identify four linear features with the northwest, north-northwest, or northeast direction for the 21 March 2008, 3 September 2008, 10 March 2011, and 30 May 2014 sequences orthogonal to the known major fault traces. The relocations also suggest that the 10 March 2011 sequence is on a double-layered fault dipping roughly 71 degrees to the southwest. Focal mechanisms reveal a mixture of strike-slip, normal, and reverse faulting.

Continent-Wide Maps of Lg Coda Q for North America and Their Relationship to Crustal Structure and Evolution	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							LAKE SHEAR ZONE; UNITED-STATES; INTRINSIC ATTENUATION; RANGE PROVINCE; UPPER-MANTLE; SCATTERING; WAVES; LITHOSPHERE; SEPARATION; BASIN	We have obtained tomographic maps of Lg coda Q and its frequency dependence at 1 Hz for all of North America assuming that all of our coda Q data can be described by a power law. Our map of Q(0) displays highest values (700-1000) throughout a large region that coincides with the Canadian Shield and exhibits sharp changes in Q(0) across much of the boundary separating the high values of the shield from lower values outside it. A second high Q region appears as a small oval of high Q(0) values (650-700) overlying much of the Ozark uplift in the central United States. A band of low values (200-350) covers most of Central America and Mexico and extends northward from California into western Canada before broadening in Alaska. A north-south- trending band of high eta values, extending from northern Canada to the gulf coast, separates the North American Cordillera from stable portions of central North America. We compared our Q(0) and eta determinations with those found in five earlier studies in two regions of the United States. In the present study, in each region these values agree with values found in the earlier studies when earthquake-station distances are greater than 300 km but differ when distances are less than that. The similarity of our Q(0) measurements to previous direct Lg and Lg coda measurements and the inverse correlation we find of Q(0) with upper mantle temperatures suggest that we may predominantly be measuring intrinsic Q(0). We propose a mechanism for explaining why scattering dominates over intrinsic attenuation for Lg and Lg coda propagation at short distances but can be secondary to intrinsic attenuation at long distances. It can be nicely described using a ray characterization for Lg and understanding that at short distances many near-vertical traveling rays are multiply reflected in the crust and much energy is lost to the mantle. At greater distances (say 300 km), virtually all of the reflected waves exceed the critical angle and so cannot easily be lost to the mantle.

The expressions for the average escape time from the left metastable state T (L) and from the right metastable state T (R) are derived. The results indicate that: i) The NES effect is suppressed as the correlation time tau increases for two metastable states; ii) The increase in tau speeds up the escape process from the right state for positively correlated noise, whereas its role is reverses for negatively correlated; iii) In the escape process from the left state, the role of tau is opposite to that in escape from the right state.

First, texture features of an image are analyzed by using the improved quadtree (QT) decomposition. Then, the optimal homogeneous and the obvious heterogeneous regions are selected from QT decomposition results. Finally, diffusion parameters and diffusion process are automatically decided based on the properties of these two selected regions. The computing time needed for 2-D speckle reduction is very short. However, the computing time required for 3-D speckle reduction is often hundreds of times longer than 2-D speckle reduction. This may limit its potential application in practice. Because this new filter can adaptively adjust the time step of iteration, the computation time is reduced effectively. Both synthetic and real 3-D ultrasound images are used to evaluate the proposed filter. It is shown that this filter is superior to other methods in both practicality and efficiency.

J	Wu, H; Pei, YJ; Li, B; Kang, ZZ; Liu, XX; Li, H				Wu, Hao; Pei, Yijian; Li, Bo; Kang, Zongzhan; Liu, Xiaoxin; Li, Hao			Item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems via heuristic data fusion	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Collaborative tagging systems; Recommender systems; Data fusion; Item recommendation; Performance comparison	OF-THE-ART; DIVERSITY; MODELS	Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models.

NOV.; EQUI; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION	A Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore forming strain, designated DSD51W(T), was isolated using a resuscitative technique from a soil sample collected from Kyoto park, Japan, and characterized by using a polyphasic approach. The morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of the isolate were typical of those of members of the genus Rhodococcus. Strain DSD51W(T) was found to form a coherent cluster with Rhodococcus hoagii ATCC 7005(T), Rhodococcus equi NBRC 101255(T), Rhodococcus defluvii Call(T) and Rhodococcus kunmingensis YIM 45607(T) as its closest phylogenetic neighbours in 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values with the above strains were 58.2 +/- A 2.2, 58.4 +/- A 1.9, 45.1 +/- A 1.4 and 40.3 +/- A 4.7 %, respectively. In combination with differences in physiological and biochemical properties, strain DSD51W(T) can be concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Rhodococcus, for which the name Rhodococcus soli sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain DSD51W(T) (=KCTC 29259(T) = JCM 19627(T) = DSM 46662(T) = KACC 17838(T)).

Growth was found to occur from 10 to 37 A degrees C, pH 6.0-8.0, and with 2-11 % of NaCl. 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the strain SSW136(T) belongs to the family Rhodobacteraceae. Strain SSW136(T) exhibited 96.3, 95.9, 95.7 and 95.5 sequence similarity to the type strains Oceanicola litoreus M-M22(T), Roseovarius aestuarii SMK-122(T), Marivita geojedonensis DPG-138(T), and Pseudoruegeria aquimaris SW-255(T) respectively. Neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SSW136(T) was affiliated to the family Rhodobacteraceae and formed a separate branch. The G+C content was 63.5 mol%. The major respiratory quinone was found to be Q-10. The polar lipids of strain SSW136(T) consisted of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, two unidentified aminolipids and three unidentified phospholipids. The major fatty acids were C-18:1 omega 7c (46.5 %), Cyclo-C-19:0 omega 8c (16.0 %) and C-16:0 (12.8 %). On the basis of the morphological, genotypic, chemotaxonomic characteristics and low DNA-DNA relatedness, strain SSW136(T) is proposed to represent a novel genus and novel species, Nioella nitratireducens gen. nov., sp. nov., in the family Rhodobacteraceae. The type strain is SSW136(T) (=KCTC 32417(T) = NCIM 5499(T)).

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effect of -ZAL is mediated by oestrogen receptor (ER) as -ZAL owns the benzene ring structure may interact with ER. The present results showed a significant increase in apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells after a 24-hr exposure to amyloid -peptide fragment 25-35 (A(25-35)), accompanied by decreasing of bcl-2 expression and increasing bax expression, whereas a pre-treatment with -ZAL ameliorated these changes induced by A(25-35). In addition, the -ZAL-mediated cytoprotection was abrogated by ER antagonist but not by ER antagonist. In summary, these data suggest that -ZAL intervenes against A-induced apoptosis via intersecting bcl-2-bax apoptotic pathway in an ER-sensitive manner.

First round SAR study picked two imidazonaphthyridinone frameworks with 1,8- and 3,5-disubstitution pattern as class I and class II c-Met kinase inhibitors, respectively. Further structural optimization on type II inhibitors by truncation of the imidazonaphthyridinone core and incorporation of an N-phenyl cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide pharmacophore led to the discovery of novel imidazopyridine-based c-Met kinase inhibitors, displaying nanomolar enzyme inhibitory activity and improved Met kinase selectivity. More significantly, the new chemotype c-Met kinase inhibitors effectively inhibited Met phosphorylation and its downstream signaling as well as the proliferation of Met-dependent EBC-1 human lung cancer cells at submicromolar concentrations.

Although the unicellular and colonial strains of M. aeruginosa were both inhibited by A. calamus, unicellular algae were more sensitive than the colonial algae. The measurement results for EPS, MDA, CAT, and POD showed that unicellular M. aeruginosa had higher levels of stress related damage than colonial strains when they were exposed to the same density of A. calamus, and the cellular defense system of colonial M. aeruginosa was stronger than that of unicellular M. aeruginosa. Natural blooms of Microcystis are typically composed of colonial forms of M. aeruginosa, therefore future efforts to control such blooms, possibly through the development of new algicides, should focus on the unique characteristics of colonial M. aeruginosa strains.

The evolution of the microstructure of the formed AgNiCu15-5 strips was analyzed through X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. The deposition billet had a rapid solidification microstructure consisting of beta-Ni particles dispersed in alpha-Ag matrix. ARB significantly refined the microstructure of the AgNiCu15-5 samples. There was no further decrease in the grain size after the 9th ARB cycle. Thus, UASF combined with extrusion and ARB is suitable for producing high-performance AgNiCu15-5-based electrical contact materials efficiently and economically.

With the retrieved products of the sun-photometer, a comparative investigation was conducted on aerosol optical depth (ADD), single scattering albedo (SSA) and size distribution during ozone-polluted episodes and clean background. Contrary to expectations, aerosol loading was found to be positively-correlated with ozone concentration: daily averaged ADD at 500 nm in ozone episodes (similar to 0.78) displayed 2.4 times higher than that in clean days (similar to 032). Large Angstrom exponent (similar to 1.51) along with heavy aerosol loading indicated a considerable impact of fine particles on optical extinction. The dynamic diurnal fluctuation of these parameters also implied a complex interaction between aerosols and photo-chemical reactions. The bimodal lognormal distribution pattern for aerosol size spectra exhibited in both ozone-polluted and clean days. The occurrence of maximum volume concentration (similar to 0.28) in fine mode (radius <0.6 mu m) was observed at 3 p.m. (local time), when ozone was substantially generated. Pronounced scattering feature of aerosol was reproduced in high-concentration ozone environment. SSA tended to increase continuously from morning (similar to 0.91 at 440 nm) to afternoon (similar to 0.99), which may be associated with secondary aerosol formation. The scattering aerosol (with moderately high aerosol loading) may favor the ozone formation through increasing solar flux in boundary layer. Utilizing the micro-pulse lidar (MPL), a more developed planet boundary layer (PBL, top height similar to 1.96 km) was discovered during ozone-polluted days than clean condition (similar to 1.4 km). In episodes, the maximum extinction ratio (similar to 0.5 km(-1)) was presented at a height of 12 km in the late afternoon. The humidity profile by sounding also showed the extreme value at this altitude. It suggested that optical extinction was mainly attributed to the aerosol in middle PBL, where the intense photochemical reactions and hydroscopic growth may occur. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

PGM is responsible for the linkage between sugar catabolism and sugar anabolism. The effects of PGM gene overexpression on intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) content, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production and transcription levels of three genes encoding the enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, including PGM, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP), and beta-1,3-glucan synthase (GLS), were investigated. The maximum IPS content and EPS production in G. lucidum overexpressing the PGM gene were 23.67 mg/100 mg dry weight and 1.76 g/L, respectively, which were higher by 40.5 and 44.3 % than those of the wild-type strain. The transcription levels of PGM, UGP and GLS were upregulated by 4.77-, 1.51- and 1.53-fold, respectively, in the engineered strain, suggesting that increased polysaccharide biosynthesis may result from a higher expression of those genes.

J	Li, YG; He, DM; Hu, JM; Cao, J				Li, Yun-Gang; He, Daming; Hu, Jin-Ming; Cao, Jie			Variability of extreme precipitation over Yunnan Province, China 1960-2012	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						extreme precipitation index; daily precipitation; trend analysis; Yunnan Province; China	DAILY CLIMATE EXTREMES; DAILY TEMPERATURE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; RIVER-BASIN; TRENDS; REGRESSION; RAINFALL; INDEXES; EVENTS; EUROPE	This study investigated spatial and temporal variations of extreme precipitation over Yunnan Province during 1960-2012. On the basis of a dataset from 120 meteorological stations covering the region, ten precipitation indices derived from daily precipitation were computed and analysed. Our results indicate the precipitation indices showed spatially complex trends. Most precipitation indices present increasing trends in western Yunnan and decreasing trends in eastern Yunnan. The western, southern and central regions experienced an increase in consecutive dry days (CDDs) and decrease in consecutive wet days (CWDs). In addition, a widespread increase was also found in precipitation intensity over Yunnan. On a region-wide scale, a weak decrease was observed in total precipitation, accompanied by an increase in precipitation intensity. CDDs tended to be prolonged while the CWDs tended to be shortened. The days with precipitation amounts totaling more than 10mm and maximum 5-day precipitation amount had decreasing but not significant trends. In contrast, insignificant increases were found for the maximum 1-day precipitation and annual total precipitation exceeding 95th and 99th percentiles. The contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation increased during 1960-2012. Overall, occurrences of extreme precipitation are more concentrated in time. The weakening of the Asian summer monsoon strength and local topography had contribution to the variations of extreme precipitation over Yunnan. However, the forcing mechanisms are very complicated and need to be studied in subsequent work.

The prepared hybrid materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that P25 nanoparticles with size of 20-30 nm were dispersed on RGO sheets after the hydrothermal process. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2-RGO was evaluated by degrading bisphenol A (BPA) under UV light illumination. The photocatalytic degradation process was fitted well by the pseudo-first order reaction model. The degradation rate constants were strongly affected by the mass ratio of RGO in the hybrid materials and the optimal mass ratio of RGO to commercial TiO2 (P25) was 3.0 wt%. Under the optimal degradation conditions, the rate constant of BPA over P25-3RGO (-0.0132 min(-1)) was 2.93 times of that over P25 (-0.00451 min(-1)). The results indicated that the introduction of RGO in P25 not only can enhance the adsorption ability for BPA, but also improve the photocatalytic activity of P25 for degradation of BPA greatly.

In this study, uniform, monodispersed 4.5 nm gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were anchored onto carboxylic graphene nanosheets (CGS) using a green approach performed under mild conditions and without using any additional surfactant or reductant. A dual beta-CD (SH/NH2-beta-CD)-functionalized Au@CGS (beta-CD-Au@CGS) nanohybrid was successfully fabricated by subsequent conjugation of beta-CD with the aid of thiol and carboxyl groups. Simultaneous electrochemical determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and p-nitrophenol (PNP) using a beta-CD-Au@CGS nanohybrid-modified glassy carbon electrode was conducted. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to simultaneously quantify HQ and PNP within the concentration range of 0.01-200 mu M under optimal conditions. The limits of quantification for both HQ and PNP were 0.01 mu M. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of the beta-CD-Au@CGS-nanohybrid electrode for HQ and PNP were 6.5 and 3.8 nM, respectively. Interference study results demonstrated that several similar aromatic compounds did not interfere during the determination of HQ and PNP, indicating the high selectivity of the beta-CD-Au@CGS-nanohybrid electrode. The low detection limit and high selectivity of the proposed electrochemical sensor were caused by the high surface area, the excellent conductivity, and the high host-guest molecular recognition capability of the beta-CD-Au@CGS nanohybrids.

A new and high response gas sensor for methanol using molecularly imprinted technique	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						Methanol; Molecular imprinting; Gas sensor	SENSING PROPERTIES; FORMALDEHYDE; NANOFIBERS; PEPTIDES; POLYMER	A new gas sensor with high response and selectivity was fabricated by using molecularly imprinted powders (MIPs) which provide special recognition sites to methanol. The MIPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The gas sensing properties of MIPs to methanol were investigated. The experimental results indicate that the sensors based on the MIPs show excellent gas sensing properties to methanol vapor, and the properties of the sensor with x = 1:4 (x = methanol: methyl acrylic acid, molar ratio) are the best. At the optimal operating temperature of 130 degrees C, the response of the sensor (x = 1: 4) to 1 ppm methanol is 41, and the response and recovery times are 40 s and 50 s, respectively. Those good gas sensing properties make the MIPs the promising candidates for determining methanol vapor in air. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhu, Q.; Zhang, Y. M.; Zhang, J.; Zhu, Z.

The effect of structural irregularity on lateral shift is evaluated by stationary-phase approach. Our results show that the lateral shift can be modulated by varying the structural irregularity in quasiperiodic structure. Besides, the position of peak in lateral shift spectrum stays sensitive to the chiral factor of chiral materials. In comparison with that of periodic structure, quasiperiodic structure provides an extra degree of freedom to manipulate the lateral shift.

To address the scarcity of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data provided by authorized databases and to make SNP data more easily/friendly usable and available, we propose DoGSD (http://dogsd.big.ac.cn), the first canidae-specific database which focuses on whole genome SNP data from domesticated dogs and grey wolves. The DoGSD is a web-based, open-access resource comprising similar to 19 million high-quality whole-genome SNPs. In addition to the dbSNP data set (build 139), DoGSD incorporates a comprehensive collection of SNPs from two newly sequenced samples (1 wolf and 1 dog) and collected SNPs from three latest dog/wolf genetic studies (7 wolves and 68 dogs), which were taken together for analysis with the population genetic statistics, Fst. In addition, DoGSD integrates some closely related information including SNP annotation, summary lists of SNPs located in genes, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs, sampling location and breed information. All these features make DoGSD a useful resource for in-depth analysis in dog-/wolf-related studies.

Target gene expression is generally normalized by a stably expressed endogenous reference gene; however, reference gene expression may differ among tissues under various circumstances. Because no valid reference genes have been documented for human breast cancer cell lines containing different cancer subtypes treated with transient transfection, we identified appropriate and reliable reference genes from thirteen candidates in a panel of 10 normal and cancerous human breast cell lines under experimental conditions with/without transfection treatments with two transfection reagents. Reference gene expression stability was calculated using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and comparative delta Ct), and the recommended comprehensive ranking was provided using geometric means of the ranking values using the RefFinder tool. GeNorm analysis revealed that two reference genes should be sufficient for all cases in this study. A stability analysis suggests that 18S rRNA-ACTB is the best reference gene combination across all cell lines; ACTB-GAPDH is best for basal breast cancer cell lines; and HSPCB-ACTB is best for ER+ breast cancer cells. After transfection, the stability ranking of the reference gene fluctuated, especially with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent in two subtypes of basal and ER+ breast cell lines. Comparisons of relative target gene (HER2) expression revealed different expressional patterns depending on the reference genes used for normalization.

In this work metal-organic framework MIL-53(Al) without any functionalization was directly employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-furaldehyde (5-HMF) in aqueous phase. A 5-HMF molar yield of 40.3% and total reducing sugar (TRS) molar yield of 54.2% were obtained with water as single solvent at 473 K for 4 h. The catalyst could be reused three times without losing activity to a greater extent. With the remarkable advantages such as the use of water as single solvent and MIL-53( Al) as a novel heterogeneous green catalyst, the work provides a new platform for the production of value added chemicals and liquid fuels from biomass.

The type strain Halomonas lutea YIM 91125T was isolated from a hypersaline lake in China. The genome of strain YIM 91125T becomes the twelfth species sequenced in Halomonas, and the thirteenth species sequenced in Halomonadaceae. We described the features of H. lutea YIM 91125T, together with the high quality draft genome sequence and annotation of its type strain. The 4,533,090 bp long genome of strain YIM 91125T with its 4,284 protein-coding and 84 RNA genes is a part of Genomic Encyclopedia of Type Strains, Phase I: the one thousand microbial genomes (KMG-I) project. From the viewpoint of comparative genomics, H. lutea has a larger genome size and more specific genes, which indicated acquisition of function bringing better adaption to its environment. DDH analysis demonstrated that H. lutea is a distinctive species, and halophilic features and nitrogen metabolism related genes were discovered in its genome.

Probe 1 undergoes a unique Pi induced hydrolytic reaction in DMSOHEPES (V/V = 9:1) buffered (0.02 M, pH 7.4) solutions that produces a colorimetric change associated with a 62 nm red-shift in the UVvis absorption maximum and up to a 780-fold enhancement in the fluorescence intensity. The mechanistic proposal that these spectroscopic changes are associated with reaction Pi with 1 to form coumarin gains support from the results of theoretical calculations and mass spectrometry studies. Observations made in fluorescence imaging studies with HeLa cells and C. elegans show that 1 can be employed to monitor Pi production in vivo caused by apyrase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, probe 1 was utilized to show that apoptosis of hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells is caused by Inx3 promoted dephosphorylation of Akt (RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase), leading to an elevation of the concentration of Pi. Overall, the study has produced the first fluorescent sensor 1 for endogenous inorganic phosphate. Moreover, the utility of 1 for measuring Pi release in vitro has been demonstrated and utilized to elucidate the mechanism of Inx3 action in hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells.

Recognition and negotiation with social partners can maintain cooperation, but are often not possible. If recognition and negotiation are not always the mechanism by which cooperative partnerships avoid collective tragedies, what might explain the diverse social cooperation observed in nature? Assuming that individuals interact asymmetrically and that both "weak'' and "strong'' players employ a super-rational strategy, we find that tragedy of the commons can be avoided without requiring either recognition or negotiation. Whereas in the volunteer's dilemma game a rational "strong'' player is less likely to volunteer to provide a common good in larger groups, we show that under a wide range of conditions a super-rational "strong'' player is more likely to provide a common good. These results imply that the integration of super-rationality and asymmetric interaction might have the potential to resolve the tragedy of the commons. By illuminating the conditions under which players are likely to volunteer, we shed light on the patterns of volunteerism observed in variety of well-studied cooperative social systems, and explore how societies might avert social tragedies.

The integrated signal, consisting of similar to 3.3 x 10(5) events, reached the statistical significance of 21.1 standard deviations. The obtained energy spectrum in the energy range 0.3-20 TeV can be described by a power law function dN/dE = I-0 (E/2TeV)(-alpha), with a flux normalization I-0 = (5.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(-12) photons cm(-2) s(-1) TeV (1) and alpha = 2.63 +/- 0.05, corresponding to an integrated flux above 1 TeV of 1.97 x 10(-11) photons cm(-2) s(-1). The systematic error is estimated to be less than 30% for the flux normalization and 0.06 for the spectral index. Assuming a power law spectrum with an exponential cutoff dN/dE = I-0 (E/2 TeV)(-alpha) exp (-E/E-cut), the lower limit of the cutoff energy E-cut is 12 TeV, at 90% confidence level. Our extended data set allows the study of the TeV emission over long timescales. Over five years, the light curve of the Crab Nebula in 200-day bins is compatible with a steady emission with a probability of 7.3 x 10(-2). A correlated analysis with Fermi-LAT data over similar to 4.5 yr using the light curves of the two experiments gives a Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.56 +/- 0.22. Concerning flux variations on timescales of days, a "blind" search for flares with a duration of 1-15 days gives no excess with a significance higher than four standard deviations. The average rate measured by ARGO-YBJ during the three most powerful flares detected by Fermi-LAT is 205 +/- 91 photons day(-1), consistent with the average value of 137 +/- 10 day(-1).

The catalyst exhibited very high substrate conversion (100%) and relatively good product (carvone) selectivity (40.2%) for allylic oxidation of limonene to carvone using air as oxidant and acetic anhydride as solvent without adding any initiator. Fast hot catalyst filtration experiment proved that the catalyst acted as a heterogeneous one and it can be recycled easily and reused two times without significant loss of activity and selectivity.

The calculated results revealed that the lattice constants variation of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4) alloys obey the Vegard's law; and the wurtzite-derived alloys have better alloy solubility and component-uniform compared with zincblende-derived alloys. In the whole range of x, the calculated lattice constants, band gaps, dielectric constants, and refractive index are nearly linear varying with Se compositions. Using the fitting functional relationships, one not only designs suitable Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4) alloys as absorber materials for solar cells, but also determines the composition of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4) alloys by conventional optical measurements in practice.

Ecological water demand of regional vegetation: The example of the 2010 severe drought in Southwest China	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						regional drought; plant-soil biosystem; regional vegetation; restoration; ecological water demand (EWD)	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; RUBBER PLANTATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; TRANSPIRATION; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; RIVER; REQUIREMENT; COMPONENTS; DIVERSITY	To determine the cause of the severe drought that hit five provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) of Southwest China in 2010, the ecological water demand (EWD) of regional vegetation was explored. The key scientific question was whether the plantation of Eucalyptus and Hevea trees in this area could have led to the breaking of the regional EWD balance, thereby causing a regional drought. Therefore, major research progress and trends related to EWD of vegetation, such as characterization of vegetation water consumption from transpiration and eco-hydrological effects, were explored. Theories, methods, and practices regarding EWD of vegetation, and the correlation between regional vegetation types and droughts were evaluated. Finally, suggestions were made for specific scientific research on temporal and spatial evolution of typical artificial vegetation in Southwest China and on the relationship between EWD from regional vegetation and droughts. Thus, future research should include the following three aspects: (i) historical evolution and distribution pattern of regional artificial vegetation; (ii) water consumption from transpiration, water saving for drought prevention, and water and soil conservation of regional artificial vegetation; and (iii) the relationship between EWD of regional artificial vegetation and regional droughts. The proposed research focus is expected to provide a scientific basis for identifying the causes of regional droughts and the reasonable allocation of water resources. In addition, it will be of great importance in guiding restoration and reconstruction of regional artificial vegetation.	[Yu, F. K.; Duan, C. Q.; Zhang, G.

Methods: hUCMSCs were isolated and identified by detection of surface antigens via flow cytometry. In T group and H group, ALF rats received hUCMSC transplantation through the tail vein and intrahepatic injection, respectively. In hUCMSC group, healthy rats received hUCMSCs transplantation via the tail vein. In ALF group, rats received injection of normal saline through the tail vein. Results: The TBil and ALT in ALF rats with and without transplantation were significantly higher than in healthy rats (P<0.05). HE staining of the liver showed obvious hepatocyte regeneration and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, and liver pathology was improved in T group and H group as compared to ALF group. At 3 d after transplantation, CK18 expression was detectable in both H group and T group. At 1 w and 2 w, the mRNA expressions of CK8, CK18 and AFP in H group and T group were significantly different from those in ALF group (P<0.05). The liver function and differentiation of stem cells were comparable between H group and T group (P>0.05). Conclusion: hUCMSCs transplantation can improve the liver function and promote the liver repair following ALF. hUCMSCs transplantation via tail vein has similar therapeutic efficacy to that through intrahepatic injection.

Cloning, sequence characterization, and expression patterns of members of the porcine TSSK family	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Banna mini-pig inbred line; Splice isoform; Testis-specific serine kinase; Expression pattern; Gene structure; Phylogenetic analysis	MINIPIG INBRED LINE; SERINE/THREONINE KINASE; PROTEIN-KINASES; MALE-FERTILITY; HUMAN SPERM; TESTIS; GENE; MOUSE; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION	Testis-specific serine kinases (TSSKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases highly expressed in the testes that are responsible for regulating many spermatogenesis-related protein activities. Mutations in this family have a positive relationship with oligospermia and azoospermia in human and mouse. Here, five members of the TSSK family from a Banna mini-pig inbred line (BMI) were cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The full-length coding sequences of BMI TSSKs varied from 807 (TSSK3) to 1095 bp (TSSK1) and encoded 268 to 364 amino acids with molecular weights in the range 30.11 to 41.34 kDa. Following comparison with TSSK4 genes in other species, BMI TSSK4 was found to contain three alternatively spliced variants, inform1, inform 3, and inform 4. BMI TSSK1 and TSSK2 are co-localized on the Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 14, and consist of a single exon; TSSK3, TSSK4, and TSSK6 are on SSC6, SSC7, and SSC2, and consist of two, four, and one exon, respectively. Multiple protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the regions spanning the S_TKc domains were more conserved between pig and other animals: with TSSK1 and TSSK2 and TSSK3 and TSSK6 displaying the greatest degree of homology across species, and the TSSK4 protein clearly distinct from other members. Multi-tissue RT-PCR showed BMI TSSK1, TSSK3, and TSSK4 were only expressed in the testes and seminal vesicle, TSSK2 was confined to testes only, while TSSK6 was expressed widely in adult tissues but was highest in the testes.

J	Liu, H; Li, GQ				Liu, Hong; Li, Guangquan			A SIMPLE DIAGNOSTIC MODEL TO ESTIMATE TOTAL SINK RECHARGE BASED ON DYE TRACING EXPERIMENTS	ACTA CARSOLOGICA			English	Article						sink; conduit network; spring; breakthrough curve; advection	TRACER TESTS; FLORIDAN AQUIFER; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; KARST; CONDUITS; EXCHANGE; MATRIX; WATER; FLOW	Dye tracing experiments are an active, effective and promising approach to investigate karst aquifers. In this paper, we develop a simple diagnostic model for calculating total recharge of sinks using dye tracing results. The conceptual model is that all sinks are convergent to a major conduit which then branches into several conduits and finally to several springs. Under the assumption that advection is dominant over dispersion at springs, breakthrough curve at a single spring can be used to calculate total recharge. The model is advantageous in that for such a conduit network, it is not necessary to measure breakthrough curves at all springs. Then the model with two dye tracing experiments is used to infer the conduit network in a karst aquifer in Luxi, southwest China. This paper represents a preliminary effort aiming to using dye tracing results to calculate the total recharge of sinks and infer the network of conduits.

The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Monotrete leiurus is 16,448 bp long and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and 1 control region (CR). The base composition of the genome is 29% A, 23.8% T, 31.8% C and 15.4% G and this composition shows a bias for A+T. The mitochondrial genes from Monotrete leiurus are overlapped in a total of 34 bp at seven locations and interleaved with a total of 64 bp intergenic spacers at 13 locations. The results can not only help clarify the classification problem in sibling freshwater puffers, but also provide information for their protection in the future.

However, its phylogenetic status is still debated. Here, to clarify the phylogenetic status of P. cristatus within Phasianidae, we analyzed its mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome was determined using 34 pairs of primers. Our data show that the mtDNA genome of P. cristatus is 16,686 bp in length. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of P. cristatus was performed along with 22 complete mtDNA genomes belonging to other species in Phasianidae using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, where Aythya americana and Anas platyrhynchos were used as outgroups. Our results show that P. critatus has its closest genetic affinity with Pavo muticus and belongs to clade that contains Gallus, Bambusicola and Francolinus.

J	Chen, X; Zhao, Y				Chen, Xu; Zhao, Yue			The projected circle centres and polar line for camera self-calibration	OPTIK			English	Article						Camera intrinsic parameters; Vanishing line; Polar line; Circular points; Circle centre		Epipolar geometry is an important concept in projective geometry, and it has been applied to camera calibration only gradually. In this study, using three non-concentric circles as a calibration pattern to ascertain the coordinates of the projected circle centres, the vanishing line could be computed by taking advantage of the linear relationship between the pole and the polar line to determine the camera's intrinsic parameters. In the image plane, the line passing through the two projected circle centres is a degenerate conic section, so it can be written in the form of a linear combination of two projected circles. In addition, the projected circle centre can be obtained by solving a linear equation. Because the relationship between the centre of a circle and the vanishing line is similar to the relationship between the pole and the polar line, the vanishing line can be determined by solving a linear equation. The results of our experiments show that this approach is effective and has high precision. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The structure, morphology, surface chemical state and specific surface area were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) and N-2-sorption isotherm, respectively. The obtained products are anatase-type TiO2 with a small grain size (7.5 +/- 1.4 nm) and a high specific surface area (181.15 m(2) g(-1)). Tungsten element presents in the +6 oxidation state. The resistance-temperature measurements indicate that tungsten dopant leads to the decrease in resistance. The as-prepared pure and W-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were used to fabricate gas sensor devices. Gas response toward 3000 ppm butane is increased from 6 to 17.8 through the doping of 5% tungsten. Meanwhile, the response and recovery time toward 3000 ppm butane are as fast as 2 and 12 s, respectively. Moreover, the sensor also possesses low detection limit, good linear dependence, good repeatability and long-term stability, indicating the potential of using W-doped TiO2 nanoparticles for butane gas detection. In addition, a possible mechanism for the enhanced sensitivity of W-doped TiO2 nanoparticles toward butane is also offered.

The as-synthesized materials with the Sm/Si molar ratio ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements. All obtained compounds possess an ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure with a high surface area, a large pore volume, and uniform pore size. The mesoporous composites were used as the novel adsorbents for phosphate ion (H2PO4) removal from synthetic aqueous solutions. The phosphate removal capacity of Sm-MCM-41 with a Sm/Si molar ratio of 0.6 was up to 20 mg P/g. The Sm functionalized mesoporous silica materials show a higher phosphate removal capacity compared to MCM-41 and Sm2O3 particles, making them promising candidates for water quality control and protection.

The distinction between our method and that of H. Sagan is that we provide the generation process analytically and represent it as a graph of a series function which looks like the Weierstrass function. With these arithmetic expressions, we further analyze and prove some of the fractal properties of the Koch-type curves such as the self-similarity, the Holder exponent and with the property of continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. Then, we will show that the Kochtype curves can be approximated by different constructed generators. Based on the analytic transformation of the Koch-type curves, we also constructed more continuous but nowhere-differentiable curves represented by arithmetic expressions. This result implies that the analytical expression of a fractal has theoretical and practical significance.

To design appropriate germination and seedling establishment protocols for a species conservation and restoration program, we studied the effects of temperature, photoperiod, storage, and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatment on seed germination in a laboratory experiment. The effects of soil substrate and sowing depth on seedling emergence were studied in a greenhouse experiment. We hypothesized that photoperiod is a limiting factor for seed germination of big tree rhododendron, and soil type and sowing depth would affect seedling emergence. Results showed that seeds of big tree rhododendron were non-dormant, and temperature significantly affected germination percentages (GP) and mean germination time (MGT). The optimal temperatures for seed germination were relatively low (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). High temperature negatively affected seed germination. The seeds had less than 5% of GP when incubated in complete darkness, suggesting that darkness significantly inhibits seed germination. Storage period and temperature had significant effect on GP and MGT of big tree rhododendron seeds, and the effect of their interaction on MGT was also significant. GA(3) treatment increased GP and germination speed. Soil substrates did not significantly affect seedling emergence, but native soil is beneficial to seedling growth. When the seeds were sown on the soil surface, seedling emergence was higher than 80%, but it decreased with increasing sowing depth, and no seedling emerged at 3 cm soil depth. We present some suggestions for the ex situ conservation and restoration program, including seed germination and seedling artificial propagation of big tree rhododendron based on the research results.

In this process, a tetragonal-cubic transition of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx has been observed using a variety of characterization techniques, e.g., X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical and Hall effect measurements. According to the XRD, the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx changed into the cubic phase when the temperature increased to above the transition temperature, at which point all iodine atoms move towards the central axis while PbI6 rotates around the C-N bond. After annealing, the stable cubic structure of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx has a smaller band gap and a better optical absorption than the original tetragonal structure. Meanwhile, the microstructure has shown an increase of grain size after annealing, which could be given the fastest mobility of 13.5 cm(2) V-1 S-1, yielded from the Hall effect measurements. The potential benefits of the stable cubic structure and large grain size in the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClx are to improve the device performance of solar cells from the viewpoint of bandgap engineering and crystalline quality.

J	Wang, Y; Guan, HT; Du, SF; Wang, YD				Wang, Yan; Guan, Hongtao; Du, Shangfeng; Wang, Yude			A facile hydrothermal synthesis of MnO2 nanorod-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites possessing excellent microwave absorption properties	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							MANGANESE-DIOXIDE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; PERMITTIVITY; NANOSTRUCTURES; FABRICATION; ELECTRODE; LAYER	Pure MnO2 nanorods and MnO2 nanorod/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites are prepared for microwave absorption by using a simple one-step hydrothermal method without using any toxic solvents. The results demonstrate that the MnO2 phases possess a high crystallization degree in both the pure nanorods and the nanocomposites but the nanocomposites exhibit two hybrid Mn phases, distinct from MnO2 in the pure nanorods. The electromagnetic characteristics and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption properties of the materials are investigated. The thickness dependent reflection loss shows that the peak frequency and effective absorption bandwidth all decrease with the increasing material thickness. Compared with the pure MnO2 nanorods, the introduction of RGO enhances the microwave absorbing intensity and effective absorption bandwidth. The maximum reflection loss value of the nanocomposites reaches -37 dB at 16.8 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm and the wide bandwidth corresponding to the reflection loss below -10 dB starts from 13 GHz until a value of -22 dB at 18 GHz. The enhanced microwave absorbing properties can be ascribed to the improved permittivity, dielectric loss and especially the synergistic effects between MnO2 nanorods and RGO nanosheets at their interfaces in the unique nanostructures of the MnO2/RGO nanocomposites.

Micritic heavily tectonically crushed and heavily recrystallized limestone with stylolites dominates throughout the entire geological column and is very uniform. Analyzing Ca and Mg with complexometric titration method of rock samples showed very pure total carbonate and exceeds 96.5 %. Rock composition anables development of clear development of rock features, the smallest, as well. The specific rock relief of the mogote bears witness to the gradual denudation of the rock and the transformation of subsoil rock forms into forms carved by rainwater and water creeping down the walls. The article brings new knowledge about special but typical shaping of the rock under dense tropical vegetation, this time under vegetation covering the mogote. On denuded surfaces that emerged from the soil, for this circumstances characteristic rock features develop under the weathered debris that accumulates under dense vegetation. Different rock beds in the studied mogote respond in a similar way to karstification.

The structural characterizations reveal that sub-micrometer NiO hollow microspheres (350-400 nm) were formed by assembling NiO nanosheets of 20-40 nm thickness. The gas responses to the five reductive gases, including isopropanol, acetone, methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde, at a low concentration of 50 ppm are 11.3, 9.9, 8.2, 7.7 and 5.0, respectively. NiO hollow microspheres showed higher responses for VOCs compared to other NiO nanostructures previously reported in the literature. The gas sensor based on NiO hollow microspheres shows a high response and fast response and recovery towards VOCs, making it a promising candidate for a practical detector of VOCs. The improved performance of NiO hollow microspheres was attributed to hollow spaces that offer a high surface-to-volume ratio and an intrinsically large specific surface area of 167.31 m(2) g(-1), leading to an improved surface activity. It was suggested that a layer of adsorbed oxygen over the NiO surface possibly decreases the thickness of the space charge layer in VOC gases and leads to an increase in resistance and therefore response.

Duality theory of convex vector optimization problems applied to this class of MINLPs is deeply investigated. With the help of duality, we use the generalized Benders decomposition method to establish an algorithm for solving this MINLP. Several convergence theorems on the algorithm are also presented.

In this work, Au@CMK-3 was prepared for immobilizing large amounts of redox probe-methylene blue (MB), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and secondary antibodies (Ab2), leading to the formation of Au@CMK-3-MB-Ab2-HRP bioconjugate. Furthermore, Au/Pd@SnO2 was utilized as the biosensor platform to immobilize the primary antibodies (Ab1) leading a further enhancement in the sensitivity of immunosensor. With the synergistic effects among the Au/Pd@SnO2 platform, the Au@CMK-3 nanocarrier, the ultrafine Pd NPs electrocatalyst, and HRP enzymatic reactions, an almost doubled amplified detection signal was achieved in the presence of H2O2, so as to improve the detection limit of the proposed immunosensor effectively. The constructed immunosensor exhibited desirable performance for determination of PSA with a wide linearity in the range from 0.01 to 100 ng mL(-1) and a relatively low detection limit of 3 pg mL(-1). The proposed immunosensor was also used to determine PSA in human serum with satisfactory results, implying potential applications in immunoassays.

The chemosensor's sensing mechanism is based on the Pi-driven cleavage of an amide bond which releases a fluorophore. The chemosensor exhibits a rapid response and high sensitivity towards Pi in DMSO-HEPES buffer (0.02 M, pH = 7.0) (v/v = 9 : 1). A colorimetric change with a 70 nmred-shift in the UV-vis absorbance spectrum and a 72-fold enhancement in the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 656 nm and 552 nm were observed. The practical utility of this chemosensor was demonstrated by employing it to detect Pi in Paramecium and C. elegans.

J	Li, YK; Li, B; Meng, XF				Li, Yongkun; Li, Bing; Meng, Xiaofang			Almost automorphic functions on time scales and almost automorphic solutions to shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks on time scales	JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time scales; Almost automorphic functions; Dynamic equations; Exponential dichotomy	ALMOST-PERIODIC SOLUTIONS; GLOBAL EXPONENTIAL STABILITY; DYNAMIC EQUATIONS; DISTRIBUTED DELAYS; WEIGHTED PSEUDO; PREDATOR-PREY; EXISTENCE; INFINITE; SYSTEMS	In this paper, we first propose a new definition of almost automorphic functions on almost periodic time scales and study some of their basic properties. Then we prove a result ensuring the existence of an almost automorphic solution for both the linear nonhomogeneous dynamic equation on time scales and its associated homogeneous equation, assuming that the latter admits an exponential dichotomy. Finally, as an application of our results, we establish the existence and global exponential stability of almost automorphic solutions to a class of shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks with time-varying delays on time scales. Our results about the shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks with time-varying delays on time scales are new both for the case of differential equations (the time scale T = R) and difference equations (the time scale T = Z).

The estimation procedures would be more efficient when high-frequency data is taken into the model. However, high-frequency data brings noises and outliers which may lead to big bias of the estimators. Therefore, robust estimates should be taken into consideration. Asymptotic results are derived from the robust M-estimates without the finite fourth moment of the innovations. A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the model and its estimates. Robust M-estimate of GJR model is also applied in predicting VaR for real financial time series.

The chemical structures, crystalline properties, phase change properties and thermal stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). An accelerated thermal cycling test was carried out to reveal the thermal reliability of the synthesized SSPCMs. The XRD patterns showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have a completely crystalline structure and defective crystallization compared with the pristine PEG. The DSC results showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have suitable phase change temperatures of 37-48 degrees C and high latent heats in the range of 120-130 J g(-1). TG results showed that the synthesized SSPCMs possess good thermal stability.

Due to the host-guest interaction, MB molecules can enter into the hydrophobic inner cavity of beta-CD, and the beta-CD/PNAANI/Gra modified glassy carbon electrode displays a remarkable anodic peak. In the presence of cholesterol, a competitive interaction to beta-CD occurs and the MB molecules are displaced by cholesterol. This results in a decreased oxidation peak current of MB as MB is a well known redox probe and hence can be easily detected using the differential pulse voltammetery technique. A linear response range of 1.00 to 50.00 mu M for cholesterol with a low detection limit of 0.50 mu M (S/N = 3) was obtained by using the indirect method. The proposed method could be successfully utilized to detect cholesterol in serum samples, and may be expanded to analysis of other non-electroactive species. Besides, the host-guest interaction between cholesterol and beta-CD was studied by molecular modeling calculations, which revealed that the complexation could reduce the energy of the system and the complex of 2 : 1 host-guest stoichiometry had the lowest DE value of -10.45 kcal mol(-1). The molecular docking studies suggested that hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions should be the major driving forces for the formation of the inclusion complex.

Disulfide linked beta-cyclodextrin dimer (SS-beta-CD) was non-covalently bonded to the surface of Pd@RGO. By combining the merits of Pd@RGO and the SS-beta-CD, a highly sensitive electrochemical sensing platform was developed based on the SS-beta-CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrids. Simultaneous electrochemical detection of baicalin and luteolin using a SS-beta-CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrid-modified electrode is described for the first time. The SS-beta-CD showed a higher supramolecular recognition capability than the native beta-CD, which may be caused by the cooperative binding abilities of two adjacent CD units. Due to the synergistic effects from the Pd@RGO (e.g. good electrochemical properties and large surface area) and SS-beta-CD (e.g. hydrophilic external surface, high supramolecular recognition, and good enrichment capability), the SS-beta-CD-Pd@RGO modified electrode was found to have linear response ranges of 0.02-20.00 mu M for baicalin and 0.01-10.00 mu M for luteolin with relatively low detection limits of 0.0052 mu M for baicalin and 0.0070 mu M for luteolin. The results indicated that SS-beta- CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrids are excellent sensing materials for the electrochemical determination of flavonoids. The proposed method could be successfully utilized to detect baicalin and luteolin in serum samples, and has a promising application in practice.

Compound 37 can remarkably induce the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells.

In this study, two ARRDC genes (ARRDC1 and ARRDC5) of Diannan small-ear pigs were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and cloned for the first time (accession nos.: KF589202 and KF589203). The full-length coding sequence of ARRDC1 was 1284 nucleotides in length (molecular weight, 45.6 kDa; pI, 7.61) and encoded 427 amino acids. The ARRDC5 CDS was 1014 nucleotides in length (molecular weight, 37.5 kDa; pI, 7.08) and encoded 337 amino acids. Sequence homology analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of Diannan small-ear pig ARRDC1 had 94.1%, 93.9%, 93.4%, 92.3%, 89.4%, 88.3%, and 84.7% identity with those of Bos taurus, Tursiops truncatus, Felis catus, Canis lupus, Capra hircus, Homo sapiens, and Mus musculus, respectively; Diannan small-ear pig ARRDC5 had 84.9%, 86.9%, 81.2%, 86.9%, 84.3%, 81.2%, and 71.2% identity with the same species, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of ARRDC1 and ARRDC5 from 7 species showed that swine have close genetic relationships with Tursiops truncatus. Tissue expression analyses by quantitative PCR revealed that the mRNA expression levels of ARRDC1 and ARRDC5 were different in various tissues of the Diannan small-ear pig. ARRDC1 was highly expressed in the testis, thyroid, submandibular gland, and kidney, while ARRDC5 was only expressed in the testis, thyroid, and thymus. This study will aid investigations regarding the role of porcine ARRDC1 and ARRDC5 in regulating signal transduction within cells.

The existence conditions of three different solitary wave solution structure for the short-wave field are given by the theory of extreme value analysis. By controlling the wave number of the background plane wave we may control the the behavior of rational solitary wave.

As a result, it is verified that there exists a global solution in the semihyperbolic patch up to the sonic boundary and that the sonic boundary has C-1-regularity. The study of the semihyperbolic patches of solutions for the Euler system was initiated by Li and Zheng [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 201 (2011), pp. 1069-1096]. This type of solution appears in the transonic flow over an airfoil and Guderley reflection and is common in the numerical configurations of 2-D Riemann problems.

The widely used King classification is subject to human measurement and judgment errors. To reduce the variability of King classification, a computer-aided method is proposed and its reliability is evaluated in this study. METHODS: At the first step, endplate inclination and position of each vertebra are measured by a computerized system on the posteroanterior radiograph. Based on these measurements, the apical and end vertebrae are identified and then the Cobb angles are calculated automatically. The system subsequently classifies the curve types automatically based on the computerized Cobb measurements, the vertebral inclination, and the analysis of the relationship between the center sacral vertical line, and the apical lumbar vertebra. Five observers participated in the experiments. The kappa statistic was used to evaluate the variability. RESULTS: Classifications of 105 scoliotic cases by the five observers showed that with the aid of our system, the average intraobserver and interobserver kappa values improved from 0.75 to 0.90 and from 0.66 to 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the proposed computerized system can assist a surgeon with the King classification of scoliosis.

Cells of the strain were short-rod-shaped and colonies were yellowish and circular. The strain grew at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.0-9.0) and 10-55 degrees C (optimum, 40-50 degrees C). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison demonstrated that strain YIM 78141(T) belongs to the family Neisseriaceae, and strain YIM 78141(T) also showed low levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (below 93.4%) with all other genera in this family. The only quinone was ubiquinone 8 and the genomic DNA G+C content was 67.3 mol%. Major fatty acids (>5%) were C-12:0, C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 7c and summed feature 3. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-methylethanolamine, phospholipids of unknown structure containing aminoglycophospholipid and three unidentified polar lipids. On the basis of the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics as well as genotypic data, this strain should be classified as a representative of a novel genus and species of the family Neisseriaceae, for which the name Crenobacter luteus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78141(T) (=BCRC 80650(T)=KCTC 32558(T)=DSM 27258(T)).

The required material parameters are independently obtained and expressed as functions of the introduced generator. Scattering magnifying ability of the concentrator and two applications for antenna miniaturization and military camouflage are also investigated. Moreover, to remove the anisotropic parameters and simplify the practical realization of the concentrator, a fan-shaped layered concentrator composed of only alternating isotropic materials is presented based on the effective medium theory. Full-wave simulation results are provided for verification. This work paves a new way for designing metamaterial devices without the need to know the underlying transformation function, and has great guiding significance for the fabrication and application of the concentrator.

The progress, however, is impeded by the poor understanding of the physical mechanism for GQDs in these devices. In this paper, chlorine doped GQD (Cl-GQD) based photovoltaic photodetectors have been fabricated using a solution process, and it was found that the presence of Cl-GQDs can significantly enhance the performance of the device. The improved performance of Cl-GQD based devices has been investigated by systematically studying the structural, morphological, optical, electrical, electrochemical and photoelectrical properties. The important photovoltaic detectors parameters such as the saturation current densities (J(0)), barrier heights (F-b), built-in potentials (V-bi), carrier concentrations (N) and depletion layer widths (W-d) have been calculated and discussed by studying the I-V and C-V characteristics under different illuminations. The frequency dependent capacitance and conductance have also been discussed. The results provide guidance for developing high-performance graphene based optoelectronic devices.

The obtained catalysts, with a Cu/CeO2 atomic ratio in the range of 0-40%, were characterized as to their structure, morphology, and redox features by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption, and temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen. The experimental results show that the particles are highly crystalline CeO2 nanopowders of 5-8 nm primary particle size and the Cu nanoparticles indeed coexist with the CeO2 nanoparticles (cubic fluorite CeO2). The influence of Cu contents on their catalytic performance for CO oxidation was also studied. As for the catalytic reactivity, nanosized Cu-CeO2 composites have a higher catalytic activity than CeO2 in CO oxidation. It is ascribed to the effect between the cycle transition of Ce4+/Ce3+, oxygen vacancies and surface area, which are induced by copper. The catalytic activity of the Cu-CeO2 composites exhibits Cu content dependence where the best catalytic activity occurs at a Cu/CeO2 atomic ratio of 30%. In addition, nanosized Cu-CeO2 composites also show high catalytic activity for selective oxidation of CO in excess H-2 at relatively low temperature.

In order to protect habitat and the biodiversity, the secondary ever-green broad-leaved forest were selected as "protection source", land cover types, altitude, slope and soil texture were selected as resistance factors, to construct a medium-security and high-security level landscape eco-security patterns for Eucalyptus introduction regions by using the minimum cumulative resistance model and GIS technology. The patterns were composed of the eco-security pattern compositions and ecological function zones. The eco-security pattern compositions were composed of corridor, radiating routes and strategic point etc. The ecological function zones were composed of key eco-protection zone, eco-buffer zone, eco-transition zone, Eucalyptus planting zone, Eucalyptus banned zones, farming zone, living zone etc.	[Zhao, X.

Consequently, many efforts have been made for synthesis of NMDA, but there exist some flaws yet. In this paper, we report an improved method for Large-Scale Synthesis of optically pure NMDA by Eschweiler-Clarke reaction and deprotection of benzyl by ACE-Cl reagent. The synthesis has been achieved in five steps with an overall yield of 70% and an enantiomeric excess over 99.5%, in particularly, the method avoided the use of toxic methylation reagent. This method can be scaled up to kilogram quantities, providing a solid basis for its further bioactivity studies and drug development.

Here, we present a CNP-based fluorescent nanoprobe, in which fluorophores (rhodamine B, RB) and quenchers (methylene blue, MB) were spontaneously enfolded by coordination networks self-assembled of adenine, biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (BDA) and zinc ions. The aggregation of fluorophores and quenchers in CNPs resulted in a quenched state fluorescence of RB. RB and MB could be released from CNPs in the presence of phosphate, which triggered the fluorescence of RB. On the basis of recognition-driven disassembly principle, a novel turn-on fluorescent probe for the determination of PO43- with a wide response range (0.5-50 mu M) has been successfully applied in the detection of phosphate in human serum samples. This work not only develops a probe for phosphate but also provides a general strategy for designing nanoprobes or nanocarriers towards various targets by altering organic linkers or metal ions.

The morphology and phase structure of the multi-layered SnO2 nanorod arrays were examined using X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman scattering spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the multi-layered SnO2 nanoarray structure consists of two storeys of rutile SnO2 nanorods oriented in opposite directions with a diameter of 25 nm and a length of 200-400 nm. The dependence of the morphological evolution process of the layered SnO2 nanorod arrays on the pH value, concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time were investigated. The results show that Sn(OH)(6)(2-) ions play a key role in the formation of the multi-layered SnO2 nanorod array, and the pH value of the precursor solution is an important parameter for creating the multi-layered structure. A nonclassical crystallization process, i.e. an Ostwald ripening process followed by an in situ oriented growth mechanism, is proposed based on the detailed observations from the morphology dependent crystal evolution process.

This method can effectively reduce the reaction intensity and the coefficient of the synthetic risk. The purity of NND which we synthesized is 94.23%, and the yield is 91.06%. UV analysis shows that the characteristic absorption peak wavelength of the NND is 276 nm, and its absorbance is 0.901. Based on the interaction of NND + Mn+ (Mn+ = Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+) and the quantum chemical calculation analysis of the NND and ethyl xanthate, we can conclude that the flotation performance of NND should be better than that of ethyl xanthate.

The 72 h EC50 of the most active extracts were measured. The results demonstrated the obvious species-specific activities of macrophytes on algae. Anabaena flosaquae and Aphanizomenon flosaquae was sensitive to the three macrophytes extracts, while unicellular M aeruginosa was only sensitive to A. calamus and O. javanica extracts under the extracts concentration of 100 mg.L-1. Only the extract of A. calamus roots showed high growth inhibition on the natural phytoplankton assemblages in Dianchi Lake (Microcystis water bloom). The 72 h EC50 of A. calamus roots hexane extract on unicellular M aeruginosa was 13.59 mg.L-1, while that on natural phytoplankton assemblages was 48.75 mg.L-1. These results demonstrated that the growth inhibitory activities of allelochemicals on unicellular M aeruginosa cannot instead of the efficacies for controlling Microcystis bloom completely. And according to the different sensitivities of Microcystis species, the colonial Microcystis strains or natural Microcystis bloom will be proposed as the target organism when searching for Microcystis bloom control.

Comprehensive studies on the genetic diversity and structure of endangered species are urgently needed to promote effective conservation and management activities. The big tree rhododendron, Rhododendron protistum var. giganteum, is a highly endangered species with only two known endemic populations in a small area in the southern part of Yunnan Province in China. Unfortunately, limited information is available regarding the population genetics of this species. Therefore, we conducted amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to characterize the genetic diversity and variation of this species within and between remaining populations. Twelve primer combinations of AFLP produced 447 unambiguous and repetitious bands. Among these bands, 298 (66.67 %) were polymorphic. We found high genetic diversity at the species level (percentage of polymorphic loci = 66.67 %, h = 0.240, I = 0.358) and lowgenetic differentiation (G(st) = 0.110) between the two populations. Gene flow between populations (N-m) was relatively high at 4.065. Analysis of molecular variance results revealed that 22 % of the genetic variation was partitioned between populations and 78 % of the genetic variation was within populations. The presence of moderate to high genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation in the two populations can be explained by life history traits, pollen dispersal and high gene flow (Nm = 4.065). Bayesian structure and principal coordinate analysis revealed that 56 sampled trees were clustered into two groups. Our results suggest that some rare and endangered species are able to maintain high levels of genetic diversity even at small population sizes. These results will assist with the design of conservation and management programmes, such as in situ and ex situ conservation, seed collection for germplasm conservation and reintroduction.

Two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to model the emission properties of TeV-bright shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) and to explore their nature. Methods. In the leptonic scenario for the TeV emission, the.-ray emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering of background soft photons by high-energy electrons accelerated by the shocks of the SNRs. In a previous paper, we showed that since the energy densities of the cosmic microwave background radiation and that of the IR/optical background photons are much higher than that of the photons produced by the same high-energy electrons via the synchrotron process, the observed correlation between X-ray and TeV brightness of SNR RXJ1713.7-3946 can be readily explained with the assumption that the energy density of relativistic electrons is proportional to that of the magnetic field. The TeV emissivity is therefore proportional to the magnetic field energy density and MHD simulations can be used to model the TeV structure of such remnants directly. Two-dimensional MHD simulations for SNRs are then performed under the assumption that the ambient interstellar medium is turbulent with the magnetic field and density fluctuations, following a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum. Results. (1) As expected, these simulations confirm early 1D and 2D modelings of these sources, namely the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock waves and amplification of magnetic field by Rayleigh-Taylor convective flows and by shocks propagating in a turbulent medium; (2) we reproduce rather complex morphological structure for.-rays, for example, the bright thin rim and significant asymmetry, suggesting intrinsic variations of the source morphology not related to the structure of the progenitor and environment; and (3) the observed radial profile of several remnants are well reproduced with an ambient medium density of 0.1-1 cm(-3). An even lower ambient density leads to a sharper drop of the TeV brightness with radius than what is observed near the outer edge of these remnants. Conclusions. In a turbulent background medium, we can reproduce the observed characteristics of several shell-type TeV SNRs with reasonable parameters except for a higher ambient density than that inferred from X-ray observations.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of the UPR during immune responses. Using small RNA deep sequencing and reverse genetic analysis, we show that the microRNA mir-233 is required for activation of the UPR in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. P. aeruginosa infection up-regulates the expression of mir-233 in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Quantitative proteomic analysis identifies SCA-1, a C. elegans homologue of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, as a target of mir-233. During P. aeruginosa PA14 infection, mir-233 represses the protein levels of SCA-1, which in turn leads to activation of the UPR. Whereas mir-233 mutants are more sensitive to P. aeruginosa infection, knockdown of sca-1 leads to enhanced resistance to the killing by P. aeruginosa. Our study indicates that microRNA-dependent pathways may have an impact on innate immunity by activating the UPR.

The tubers of Bletilla striata were fermented with Fusarium avenaceum and Fusarium oxysporum. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the extracts from the fermented products were measured. Additionally, the extracts of both F. avenaceum and F. oxysporum fermented B. striata (FBS) were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the F. avenaceum and F. oxysporum FBSs possessed higher TPCs and exhibited stronger antioxidant and antibacterial activities (Bacillus subtilis) in comparison with original material not co-fermented with microorganisms. Chemical characterization of the two extracts with UV-vis, FT-IR, and H-1 NMR implied that some of the phenolic glycosides may be deglycosylated and that bibenzyl compounds and saccharides may be metabolized in both FBS systems. Microbial fermentation enhances the TPC as well as the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of B. striata. The present study suggests that F. avenaceum and F. oxysporum fermentations were effective in B. striata processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic analysis of the near-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain JXJ 0135(T) belongs to the genus Streptomyces and exhibited distinct subclade and also highest similarity (98.6%) to Streptomyces scopuliridis RB72(T). The strain developed well-branched substrate and aerial mycelia, and produced spiral spore chains. Spores were elliptical and the spore surface was smooth. The strain contained LL-diaminopimelic acid with whole-cell sugars of mannose, rhamnose, glucose and galactose. Phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, phosphotidylinositol dimannoside, an unidentified aminophospholipid and an unknown phospholipid. The menaquinones were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8). The major components of the fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0, C-16:0, iso-C-17:0 and iso-C-14:0. The G + C content was 69.3 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between JXJ 0135(T) and S. scopuliridis RB72(T) was 41.2 +/- 1.4%. On the basis of the polyphasic data, strain JXJ 0135(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lushanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JXJ 0135(T) (= DSM 42121(T) = JCM 19628(T) = KCTC 29261(T) = KACC 17834(T) = NRRL B-24994(T)).

Flows can be sudden, severe and destructive. Understanding debris flow erosion processes is the key to providing geomorphic explanations, but progress has been limited because the physical-mechanical properties, movement laws and erosion characteristics are different from those of sediment-laden flow. Using infinite slope theory, this research examines the process and mechanism of downcutting erosion over a moveable bed in a viscous debris flow gully. It focuses specifically on the scour depth and the critical slope for viscous debris flow, and formulas for both calculations are presented. Both scour depth and the critical conditions of downcutting erosion are related to debris flow properties (sand volume concentration and flow depth) and gully properties (longitudinal slope, viscous and internal friction angle of gully materials, and coefficient of kinetic friction). In addition, a series of flume experiments was carried out to characterize the scouring process of debris flows with different properties. The calculated values agreed well with the experimental data. These theoretical formulas are reasonable, and using infinite slope theory to analyze down cutting erosion from viscous debris flow is feasible.

Griseb., is one of the worst invasive weeds in the world. In the present study, the genome size of seven forms/biotypes of alligator weed from Argentina (native area), the USA (introduced area), and China (introduced area) was analyzed using flow cytometers; the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was cloned and sequenced. We found that the genome size of A. philoxeroides ranged from 5.72 to 8.50pg/2C nucleus, consisting of four levels of genome and three kinds of ploidy. Among them, three levels and two kinds (tetraploid and hexaploid) were found in samples from Argentina, two levels and one kind (pentaploid) in US samples, and one level and one kind (hexaploid) in samples from China. Contrary to the significant variation in genome size, we found that the intraspecific differentiation of the ITS sequences in the seven forms/biotypes was extremely low, and that six of them shared ITS sequences with no or one single substitution. These results show that the change of genome size played a major role in the differentiation of A. philoxeroides, and that forms/biotypes with higher ploidy seem to have stronger invasive ability. Furthermore, the differences of A. philoxeroides in ploidy between samples from the USA and China showed that alligator weeds from these two invaded areas certainly have different native progenitors.

To evaluate the effects of various restoration approaches on ecosystem recovery in the area, we analyzed vegetation characteristics of a Pinus plantation, natural successional plant communities (the shrubland, the secondary forest and the natural premature forest), and their leaf litter nutrients and soil chemical properties. The natural successional plant communities had better regeneration, higher species diversity, higher litter nutrient input, and higher soil fertility as compared with the Pinus plantation. The results indicate that the natural secondary succession facilitates regeneration to young and old secondary forests, promotes recovery of plant diversity and cycling of litter-soil-nutrients, yielding greater ecological benefits. The study will provide guidance for restoration of the vegetation and for forest management planning in this fragile mountainous ecosystem.

The effect of CuNPs on the enhancement upconversion emission intensity in the Tb3+/Yb3+ co-doped transparent glass-ceramics under 980 nm laser diode excitation were investigated. The structural investigation carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evidenced the formation of cubic BaF2 nanocrystals. The distribution of Copper nanoparticles and the average diameter size which were confirmed by the results of XRD, TEM measurements. Compared with the glass-ceramics sample without Cu2O element, the intensity of upconversion emission was significantly increased. Particularly, the red UC emission intensity bands at 588 and 624 nm strongly increased with the increase of Cu2O concentration and reached its maximum at 2.5 mol.%, then decreases due to the self-quenching effect. The possible mechanism responsible for the enhancement of upconversion emission intensity in the Tb3+/Yb3+ co-doped due to effectiveness of surface plasmon resonance was discussed.

However, the molecular pathogenesis of Kp in causing tissue injury and dysregulated host defense remains elusive, further dampening the development of novel therapeutic measures. We have previously screened a series of synthetic antimicrobial beta-sheet forming peptides and identified a peptide (IRIKIRIK; ie, IK8L) with a broad range of bactericidal activity and low cytotoxicity in vitro. Here, employing an animal model, we investigated the antibacterial effects of IK8L in acute infection and demonstrated that peritoneal injection of IK8L to mice down-regulated inflammatory cytokines, alleviated lung injury, and importantly, decreased mortality compared to sham-injected controls. In addition, a math model was used to evaluate in vivo imaging data and predict infection progression in infected live animals. Mechanistically, IK8L can kill Kp by inhibiting biofilm formation and modulating production of inflammatory cytokines through the STAT3/JAK signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings reveal that IK8L may have potential for preventing or treating Kp infection.

A vague graph is a generalized structure of a fuzzy graph that gives more precision, flexibility, and compatibility to a system when compared with systems that are designed using fuzzy graphs. In this paper, we introduce various types of vague bridges, vague cut-vertices, vague cycles and vague trees in vague graphs, and investigate some of their interesting properties. Most of these various types are defined in terms of levels. We also describe comparison of these types.

In this context, we present specimens of the tubiform priapulid Selkirkia sinica, preserved in situ, collected from the lower Cambrian (Stage 3) Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte, which show the diverse morphology of its intestinal contents within the dark-coloured gut and the formation of faecal pellets. The two digestive modes displayed by S.sinica suggest that it is a putative dietary generalist rather than a typical scavenger as previously thought. Moreover, the asymmetry exhibited by the paired caudal appendages of S.sinica provides direct evidence of the development of dorsoventral (DV) differentiation in Selkirkia, which aids our understanding of the lifestyle of this tubiculous worm.

The Curie surface is compared with the regional heat flow, Bouguer anomaly, Moho depth, and seismicity. The results show that the magnetic anomalies and Curie surface are both consistent with the geological structure. Sichuan Basin exhibits a high positive anomaly, while orogenic belts such as the Longmenshan, northwestern Sichuan, and western Yunnan, exhibit weak positive or negative anomalies. The distribution of magnetic anomaly confirms that escape flow from east Tibet branches into northeastward part and southward part on west Sichuan Basin, due to resistance by the rigid basin. The depth of Curie surface ranges from 20 to 34 km. The Curie surface beneath the Longmenshan, Xiaojiang and Lijiang-Xiaojinhe faults is shallow, with the uplift strike consistent with the faults. The Curie surface beneath Sichuan Basin and the central Bayan Har massif is deep, with sheet-like depressions. Strong earthquakes primarily occurred in the areas with the uplift of Curie surface. The heat flow values near Tengchong, Lijiang, Dali and Kunming are high and the Curie surface there is shallow. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results suggest that the existence of a substituted benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 2-naphthylmethyl group were vital for modulating the cytotoxic activity. Compound 25 was found to be the most potent derivative with IC50 values of 0.24-1.18 mu M, and exhibited cytotoxic activity selectively against MCF-7, SW480, SMMC-7721 and HL-60 cell lines, while compound 26 showed powerful inhibitory activities selectively against SMMC-7721 and A549 cell lines.

Although the fossil record of oribatid mites can be traced to the Early Devonian, the paleoecology of oribatid mites during the deep geological past remains poorly understood. Remarkably good preservation of tunnel networks in a permineralized conifer wood specimen is described from the Early Permian of Germany. This fossil provides evidence for four aspects of oribatid mite feeding habits. First, there is preferred consumption of the more indurated tissues from growth-ring cycles. Second, tracheids were targeted for consumption. Third, feeding on tissues resulted in fecal pellet accumulations at the bottoms of tunnels. And fourth, the absence of feeding on ambient decomposing fungi such as necroses and rots, but rather the processing of pristine plant tissues, indicate the presence of a self-contained, microorganismic gut biota. These rather specialized feeding habits allowed oribatid mites a prominent role in the decomposition of digestively refractory plant tissues in Early Permian ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We isolated 85 urease-positive bacterial strains from soil, compost, sludge, and animal faeces; they belonged to four clades and sixteen genera of Eubacteria based on 16S rRNA BLAST. Twenty-five representative strains were assessed for nematicidal and urease activities. The urease-positive bacteria were nematicidal. A cubic relationship with a critical threshold was found between a strain's nematicidal and urease activities. Sixteen strains with urease activity above this threshold had a 100 % nematicidal activity level. These 16 strains and urea alone were assessed for urease activity in pot experiments with tomato, which found that high-dose urea was nematicidal to root-knot nematodes (400-800 mg per kg soil) and phytotoxic (1,600 mg), while low-dose urea (a parts per thousand currency sign200 mg) was non-nematicidal. However, nematodes could be controlled at 200 mg urea per kg soil in combination with urease-positive bacteria from seven different strains, and the nematode control efficacy of urea was always non-linearly positively correlated with soil urease activity. To test bacterial persistence, soils were recycled for another experiment, in which nine strains were significantly nematicidal, with a stronger relationship between nematode control efficacy and soil urease activity. These results suggest ways to manipulate soil bacteria to improve soil urease activity for the management of plant-parasitic nematodes. While urease-positive bacteria may have practical applications in controlling nematodes, their use will require careful field investigation and appropriate environmental safety evaluation.

Little is known about the overall molecular response of DSE to excessive HMs. Therefore, RNA-seq was performed through Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing based on two cDNA libraries of the DSE strain Exophiala pisciphila, cultured under cadmium (Cd)-free and Cd-stressed conditions, and 21,376 unigenes were generated. In total, 575 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Approximately 40% of the DEGs (228 unigenes) were involved in 10 well-known HMs-tolerant pathways, conferring the extreme cadmium (Cd) tolerance of E. pisciphila, including metal ion binding and transportation, organic acid metabolism and transportation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, redox homeostasis, transcription factors production, sulfate assimilation, DNA repair and cell wall integrity maintenance, etc. Our results indicate that integral tactics associated with the collaboration of extracellular and intracellular mechanisms contribute to the enhanced HMs tolerance of this fungus. This study represents the first investigation of the transcriptome of DSE under Cd stress, and our results provide valuable information for future molecular studies of HMs tolerance in fungi.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains YIM 77920(T) and YIM 77921(T) exhibited sequence similarities of 96.59 and 96.66 % to Hymenobacter xinjiangensis X2-Y-T, respectively, and indicated that the two isolates belong to the genus Hymenobacter. The major fatty acids present in the two strains were identified as C-16:1 omega 5c, iso-C-15:0 and Summed Feature 4 (C-17:1 anteiso B/iso I). MK-7 was identified as the respiratory quinone component for both strains. The polar lipids profile of strain YIM 77920(T) was found to consist of phosphatidylethanolamine, four unidentified polar lipids, three unidentified aminophospholipids, two unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified aminolipids, while that of strain YIM 77921(T) consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, four unidentified polar lipids, two unidentified aminolipids, one unidentified phospholipid and four unidentified aminophospholipids. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 77920(T) and YIM 77921(T) were determined to be 57.5 and 59.6 mol%, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization between them had a low value (56.55 %).

Cloning and heterologous expression of UDP-glycosyltransferase genes from Bacillus subtilis and its application in the glycosylation of ginsenoside Rh1	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						3-O--d-glucopyranosyl-6-O--d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxatriol; Bacillus subtilis; biotransformation; ginsenoside Rh1; UDP-glycosyltransferase	SAPONINS	Bacillus subtilis CCTCC AB 2012913 can transform ginsenoside Rh1 to 3-O--d-glucopyranosyl-6-O--d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxatriol. Based on its genome sequence, strain B.subtilis 168 contains three UDP-glycosyltransferase genes. Here, we cloned the three UDP-glycosyltransferase genes (ydhE1, yojK1 and yjiC1) from B.subtilis CCTCC AB 2012913 and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with His-tag. The crude enzyme extracts were assayed, respectively, for their activities to transform ginsenoside Rh1. Extracts containing enzymes YojK1 and YjiC1 could use ginsenoside Rh1 as a substrate to produce 3-O--d-glucopyranosyl-6-O--d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxatriol, which had an additional glucopyranosyl linked with C-3 over the substrate. Enzyme YjiC1 was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA His Binding resin. The molecular mass of purified YjiC1 was c. 47kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. This is the first report of an in vitro biotransformation of ginsenoside Rh1 to 3-O--d-glucopyranosyl-6-O--d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxatriol using the recombinant UDP-glycosyltransferase. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe Chinese traditional medicinal plant Panax is reported to have multiple health benefits. Its main active ingredient is saponin, and different saponins have different activity spectrum. In the study, three UDP-glycosyltransferase genes, ydhE1, yojK1 and yjiC1, werecloned from Bacillus subtilis CCTCC AB2012913 and the three genes were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The enzyme YjiC1 was purified and converted ginsenoside Rh1 to 3-O--d-glucopyranosyl-6-O--d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxatriol in vitro. The compound is the first saponin possessing -glucopyranosyl at both C-3 and C-6 sites. We showed that the in vitro biotransformation was effective, and the reaction condition was easy to control. Our research suggests that a diversity of saponins could be generated through efficient and directed enzymatic biotransformation.	[Luo, S. L.; Zhang, K. Q.; Liang, L. M.; Li, G.

As the natural enemies of nematodes, nematophagous microorganisms offer a promising approach to control the nematode pests. Some of these microorganisms produce traps to capture and kill the worms from the outside. Others act as internal parasites to produce toxins and virulence factors to kill the nematodes from within. Understanding the molecular basis of microbe-nematode interactions provides crucial insights for developing effective biological control agents against plant-parasitic nematodes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the interactions between nematodes and nematophagous microorganisms, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms by which nematophagous microorganisms infect nematodes and on the nematode defense against pathogenic attacks. We conclude by discussing several key areas for future research and development, including potential approaches to apply our recent understandings to develop effective biocontrol strategies.

NOV.; CELLULOMONAS; BACTERIA; TREES; ACID	A Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, non-motile, coryneform bacterium, designated strain EGI 60002(T), was isolated from the halophyte Suaeda physophora. Cells were coryneform shaped and polymorphic. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the new isolate was closely related to Actinotalea ferrariae CF5-4(T) (95.8 % gene sequence similarity). The peptidoglycan type of strain EGI 60002(T) was A4 beta, containing l-Orn-d-Ser-d-Asp. The cell-wall sugars were mannose, ribose, rhamnose and glucose. The major fatty acids (> 5 %) of strain EGI 60002(T) were iso-C-14:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:1 A and anteiso-C-15:0. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-10(H-4). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), one unidentified phosphoglycolipid (PGL) and one unidentified phospholipid (PL1). The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.3 mol%. On the basis of morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic data, and phylogenetic analysis, strain EGI 60002(T) should be classified as a novel species within the genus Actinotalea, for which the name Actinotalea suaedae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 60002T (=JCM 19624(T) = KACC 17839(T) = KCTC 29256(T)).

Merr.) is a major source of plant protein for humans and livestock. Deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) in soybean protein is a main limitation of soybean meal as an animal feed ingredient. The objectives of this study were to identify and validate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with cysteine and methionine contents in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, and to analyze the genetic effects of individual QTLs and QTL combinations in soybean. Both the mapping population of SD02-4-59 x A02-381100 and validation population of SD02-911 x SD00-1501 were evaluated for cysteine and methionine contents in multiple environments. Correlation analysis indicated that there was a highly positive correlation between cysteine and methionine contents. Significant positive correlations were also observed between the sulfur-containing amino acid contents and protein content. In the mapping population, eight QTLs for both cysteine and methionine contents were consistently detected in any individual environment and the average data over all three environments. Three of these QTLs were confirmed in the validation population. A comparison with the previous studies indicated that most of the genomic regions linked to the QTLs for the sulfur-containing amino acids were also associated with protein content. Cumulative effects of multiple QTLs for the traits were significant in both populations. This information should be useful for the improvement of the levels of protein and amino acids in soybean seeds.

Methods: Healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, ALF group and BMSCs group. ALF was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 900 mg/kg D-GalN and 10 mu g/kg LPS. In BMSCs group, rats received BMSCs (1.0x10(7)) transplantation via the tail vein at 2 h after ALF induction. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of 900 mg/kg D-GalN and 10 mu g/kg LPS was able to induce ALF in rats. In ALF group, serum ALT and AST increased gradually over time. At 72 h, the serum ALT and AST in BMSCs group were significantly different from those in ALF group. HMGB1 expression in the serum and liver remained at a low level at any time point in control group, but increased significantly in ALF group and BMSCs group. The serum and liver HMGB1 expression increased progressively in ALF group, but reduced gradually in BMSCs group. Significant difference in serum and liver HMGB1 expression was observed between ALF group and BMSCs group at 24 h and 72 h. In addition, there was marked difference in the survival rate among three groups at 24 h (chi(2)=21.098, P<0.01). Conclusion: BMSCs transplantation is able to improve the liver function and liver pathology in ALF rats and decrease the serum and liver HMGB1.

However, there remains a key issue as how contextual information can be used to create intelligent and useful recommender systems. To assist the development and use of context-aware recommendation capabilities, we propose a graph-based framework to model and incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process in an advantageous way. A contextual graph-based relevance measure (CGR) is specifically designed to assess the potential relevance between the target user and the items further used to make an item recommendation. We also propose a probabilistic-based postfiltering strategy to refine the recommendation results as contextual conditions are explicitly given in a query. Depending on the experimental results on the two datasets, the CGR-based method is much superior to the traditional collaborative filtering methods, and the proposed postfiltering method is much effective in context-aware recommendation scenario.

In the present work, a highly effective graphitic carbon nitride/acidized multi-walled carbon nanotube (g-C3N4/aMWCNT) bilayer was deposited on a PS sphere for reducing its fire hazards. The PS sphere allowed the intimate assembly of the g-C3N4/aMWCNT bilayer on its surface through electrostatic interactions. Structural and morphological characterization revealed the successful assembly of PS/g-C3N4/aMWCNT systems. Enhanced thermal stability and flame retardancy (e.g. a decrease of ca. 45% and 47% in HRR and THR, respectively) were obtained for the ternary assembled systems instead of the binary materials. The phenomena were caused by two reasons: g-C3N4/aMWCNT bilayers induced the construction of the "tortuous path" which impeded the permeation of heat and the escape of pyrolysis volatile products; on the other hand, stacked g-C3N4 nanosheets or thermolabile aMWCNTs with an uncompact network structure led to poor thermal stability and fire resistance. Thus, this work paves a potential pathway to design efficient assembled fire-retardant systems for fire safety.

CuI complexes, however, mostly are neither soluble nor stable toward sublimation, which is a road block for the development of efficient CuI complex based OLEDs using traditional methods of synthesis, sublimation and vacuum evaporation. In this work, two isoquinolyl carbazole (CIQ) compounds 9-(8-(carbazol-9-yl)isoquinolin-5-yl)-carbazole (DCIQ) and 9-(4-(5-(4-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)isoquinolin-8-yl) phenyl)-carbazole (DCDPIQ) were synthesized to codeposition with copper iodide (CuI) to form red emissive dimeric CuI complex doped film in situ, which could be utilized directly as the emissive layer (EML) in OLEDs. After a systematic study of the two compounds and their codeposited CuI : CIQ films, as well as optimizing the CuI doping concentration, it is found that red OLEDs can be achieved, showing a maximum emission band, an external quantum efficiency (EQE), a luminance of 643 nm, 3.5%, 3290 cd m(-2) for DCIQ, and 635 nm, 3.6%, 853 cd m(-2) for DCDPIQ, respectively.

Tilted and non-tilted lamellar phases with interdigitated double layer structures (SmCd and SmAd, respectively) were found for the compounds with a single alkyl chain, whereas hexagonal columnar phases were formed by the compounds with two or three alkyl chains. The effect of protic solvents, like formamide, ethylene glycol and water, was investigated for representative examples. For the compounds with the single chain, induction and stabilization of SmA phases were observed, though broad regions of lyotropic SmC phases were retained in most cases. Depending on the structure of the polar group, the hexagonal columnar phases were either removed or drastically stabilized by the solvents. Photoisomerisation of an azobenzene chromophore was also studied.

In this study, 909 serum samples from ethnic minority people in China were obtained. Serological assay and HBV S-gene amplification were carried out, and phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics analysis of 62 HBV/I S-gene was performed. On this survey, 153 individuals were tested HBsAg-positive. Genotypes of S-gene were classified into three groups: C, B and I. Under the strict model and the relax model, the estimated evolutionary rates for HBV/I were 3.74x10(-4) and 6.93x10(-4) substitution/site/year, respectively. However, when the geographic origin was taken into account, the mean substitution rates were increased. Estimated time to most recent ancestor of genotype I varied from similar to 30 to similar to 70years ago. The Bayesian sky plot showed a rapid spread of HBV/I at the end of 1980s. Peculiar nucleotides distributed were observed in the subgenotype I1/I2. In conclusion, higher prevalence of HBV infection was observed in Mengla county. Multifactors like timescale and spatial locations should be integrated to provide a better interpretation of the HBV/I evolutionary history in the region.	[Shen, T.; Xiao, C.

The structure, morphology, chemical state and specific surface area were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N-2-sorption studies, respectively. The SnO2 nanoparticle cluster matrix consists of tens of thousands of SnO2 nanoparticles with an ultra-small grain size estimated to be 3.0 nm. And there are abundant random-packed wormhole-like pores, caused by the inter-connection of the SnO2 nanoparticles, throughout each cluster. The platinum element is present in two forms including metal (Pt) and tetravalent metal oxide (PtO2) in the Pt activated SnO2 nanoparticle clusters. The as-synthesized pure and Pt activated SnO2 nanoparticle clusters were used to fabricate gas sensor devices. It was found that the gas response toward 500 ppm of ammonia was improved from 6.48 to 203.44 through the activation by Pt. And the results indicate that the sensor based on Pt activated SnO2 not only has ultrahigh sensitivity but also possesses good response-recovery properties, linear dependence, repeatability, selectivity and long-term stability, demonstrating the potential to use Pt activated SnO2 nanoparticle clusters as ammonia gas sensors. At the same time, the formation mechanisms of the unique nanoparticle clusters and highly enhanced sensitivity are also discussed.

Importantly, it could be finished within 2 min at room temperature, making the synthesis much faster and easier. Compared with the most common AgNPs (such as sodium citrate coated AgNPs), the proposed AgNPs presented excellent properties such as high stability. Moreover, a new analytical assay was established for protease K with the colour turning from light yellow to brown when protease K was introduced into the AgNPs aqueous solution. It was found that the increase of AgNPs absorbance at 470 nm was proportional to the concentration of protease K in the range of 0.50-15 mg mL(-1) with the limit of detection as low as 0.47 mg mL(-1). This selective and colorimetric assay has a great application prospect in bioanalysis due to its simplicity and specificity for protease K detection.

The results indicated that ZnO QDs with good dispersion, ranging in size from 3.3 nm to 7.7 nm, could be controlled easily by the solvents. The ZnO QDs exhibited strong visible emission from green to orange. The reasons for the change in emission color are believed to be the quantum size effect and the change in defect concentration due to the different solvents used in their preparation.

Proposed affinities have ranged from stem bilaterian to stem vertebrate. A study of over seven hundred slabs, many newly collected, from five sections at two localities demonstrates that yunnanozoans have sclerotized dorsal and axial segments, a body cavity, a unique feeding region and a coiled alimentary canal. Although two genera have been previously discriminated, all specimens have the same number of filamentous arches (seven pairs) and of ventral circular structures (four pairs); this indicates that Haikouella Chen, Huang and Li, 1999 is a junior synonym of Yunnanozoon Hou, Ramskold and Bergstrom, 1991. Our analysis reveals new details of the putative pharyngeal pores of Yunnanozoon lividum, and although there are similarities with the gill slits of deuterostomes, the question of their homology remains moot. The filamentous arches and their supporting rods were probably sclerotized and represent a specialized feeding structure. Yunnanozoans exhibit characters that are open to a number of alternative interpretations of putative homology, encompassing comparisons with deuterostomes and protostomes (including members of the Platyzoa). Given their unique features, and the current lack of secure homologies, the affinities of yunnanozoans should continue to be considered in a wider bilaterian context.

The initial purpose of this work is to improve the photocatalytic performance of S mono-doped TiO2, in which S occupies the lattice Ti site and acts as a recombination center. Among eight nonmetal impurities that occupy the interstitial site of a TiO6 octahedron, the synergistic effects of B, C, and O with S could achieve this purpose: suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by inducing a local inner built-in electric field and eliminating the deep impurity energy bands of S mono-doped TiO2. Furthermore, the photon absorption could be extended to the visible-light region, owing to the overlap of impurity energy bands with the top of the valence band or the bottom of the conduction band.

Storminess over the North Atlantic and northwestern Europe - A review	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Review						storms; storm trends; extratropical cyclones; NAO; North Atlantic; wind	REGIONAL-CLIMATE MODEL; WINTER CYCLONE FREQUENCIES; INCREASING GREENHOUSE GASES; CIRCULATION WEATHER TYPES; NCEP-NCAR REANALYSIS; SEA-LEVEL VARIATIONS; SURFACE WIND SPEEDS; EXTREME HIGH WATERS; HEMISPHERE WINTER; 20TH-CENTURY REANALYSIS	This review assesses storm studies over the North Atlantic and northwestern Europe regarding the occurrence of potential long-term trends. Based on a systematic review of available articles, trends are classified according to different geographical regions, datasets, and time periods. Articles that used measurement and proxy data, reanalyses, regional and global climate model data on past and future trends are evaluated for changes in storm climate. The most important result is that trends in storm activity depend critically on the time period analysed. An increase in storm numbers is evident for the reanalyses period for the most recent decades, whereas most long-term studies show merely decadal variability for the last 100-150 years. Storm trends derived from reanalyses data and climate model data for the past are mostly limited to the last four to six decades. The majority of these studies find increasing storm activity north of about 55-60. N over the North Atlantic with a negative tendency southward. This increase from about the 1970s until the mid-1990s is also mirrored by long-term proxies and the North Atlantic Oscillation and constitutes a part of their decadal variability. Studies based on proxy and measurement data or model studies over the North Atlantic for the past which cover more than 100 years show large decadal variations and either no trend or a decrease in storm numbers. Future scenarios until about the year 2100 indicate mostly an increase in winter storm intensity over the North Atlantic and western Europe. However, future trends in total storm numbers are quite heterogeneous and depend on the model generation used.

Using the PES project, known as the 'retire livestock, restore rangeland' project in Alxa of Inner Mongolia as an example, the long-term ecological consequences of such projects is assessed, and the causes of the associated problems from the perspective of social-ecological system explored. Study findings demonstrate that PES, as used in the case study area, is unlikely to achieve the expected outcome of rangeland restoration in the long term. The root cause of such failure is that the PES approach focuses on end-point ecosystem services (outputs), while at the same time decoupling the feedbacks among social and ecological systems that are the key to generating such services. This drives the overall social-ecological system into an undesirable basin of attraction. It is concluded that a PES program for pastoral systems should aim to improve resilience of such a coupled social-ecological system to external shocks and changes, instead of simply maintaining ecological services without considering the origins of such services in the inter-relationship of humans and environment. It is argued that 'Payment for Ecosystem Services' should be displaced by 'Payment for Social-ecological System Resilience' in future policy discussions.

A cubic NiO phase was obtained by a mixed solution of an oxidizer of nickel nitrate and a fuel of ethylene glycol (EG) at 400 degrees C. The phases and the morphologies of the materials self-grown on an alumina tube were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the alumina tube was entirely covered by NiO nanosheets with several micrometers in thickness. The NiO nanosheets on the surface of the tube were assembled by a large number of nanoparticles of irregular shapes and pores with different sizes. The electronic and gas-sensing characteristics of the self-grown porous NiO nanosheets for volatile organic compound (VOC) vapours (ethanol, acetone, methanol, and formaldehyde) were investigated. The resistance of the sensor directly based on the self-grown NiO dramatically drops from 100-240 degrees C, and then slightly decreases with further increasing temperature to about 28 k Omega at 400 degrees C. The sensor based on the self-grown NiO exhibits low detection limit, fast response and recovery and wide dynamic range detection to VOC vapours, especially ethanol, at the respectively optimal operating temperatures.

J	Liu, QL; Zhao, ZY				Liu, Qing-Lu; Zhao, Zong-Yan			DFT study on microstructures and electronic structures of Pt mono-/bi-doped anatase TiO2 (101) surface	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PHOTOASSISTED HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; TIO2(101) SURFACE; PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; 1ST PRINCIPLES; WATER; CATALYSTS; LIGHT; OXIDATION; CLUSTERS	The microstructures and electronic structures of Pt mono-and bi-doped anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces were investigated by density functional theory calculations to elucidate the surface doping effects and the initial stages of Pt cocatalyst formation on a TiO2 photocatalyst surface. Several substitutional and interstitial configurations for the Pt impurity on the surface were studied, and the relative stability of different doping configurations was compared by the impurity formation energy. Under reducing conditions, surface interstitial (in other words, surface adsorbed) doping for Pt is more stable than any competitors (substitutional, bulk or subsurface doping) on an anatase TiO2 (101) surface. Compared with bulk doping, the metal induced gap states were very localized and outstanding in the case of Pt surface interstitial doping onto a TiO2 (101) surface. In the case of Pt substitutional doping, the surface doping effects were harmful for photocatalysis due to the metal induced gap states in the middle of the band gap. However, in the case of Pt interstitial doping, the surface doping effects were very favorable for photocatalysis due to the overlapping of metal induced gap states with the top of the valance band. Systematic calculations revealed that Pt doping is prone to occupy the interstitial sites on the (101) surface. In particular, in the case of Pt bi-doping, two Pt impurity atoms can be co-adsorbed on the surface to form a stable configuration due to the strong Pt-Pt atomic interaction. Therefore, Pt mono-/bi-doping on an anatase TiO2 (101) surface can be considered as the initial stage (nucleation process) of Pt cocatalyst loading onto a TiO2 photocatalyst surface. Therefore, the calculated results can form the basis for further investigations about Pt-n cluster loadings or Pt/TiO2 interface formation as well as water molecule adsorption or decomposition on a Pt/TiO2 composite photocatalyst.

Herein, one of the most important biosynthesized polymers, natural rubber latex from the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis in Xishuangbanna was directly used as a structure-directing agent in synthesis of thermally stable mesostructured TiO2. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, N-2 adsorption/desorption, TEM and UV-vis DRS. The synthesized TiO2 exhibited highly effective photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and rhodamine B under solar light. Furthermore, addition of acetylacetone (ACA) during the synthesis significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The reported strategies provide a new direction of using natural rubber latex as a template to prepare highly effective photocatalysts.

The structure, morphology, component and optical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that highly crystalline wurtzite-type ZnO nanoparticles matrices with an average grain size of 7.4 nm are obtained. Highly crystalline metallic Ag nanoparticles are observed on the ZnO matrix with a good combination. The absorption spectra of the Ag-ZnO heterostructure nanoparticles show the existence of a special two-absorption-region (strong UV-light and weak visible-light at 421 nm). The intensities of photoluminescence in the visible light region have a regular decrease with the increase in the load amount of Ag. The photoactivity of the as-synthesized samples was tested by measuring the degradation of azo dye Congo red (CR) under visible light irradiation. And it is found that both ZnO nanoparticles and Ag-ZnO heterostructured nanoparticles have better photocatalytic efficiency than commercial TiO2 (P-25), and an appropriate loading amount of Ag nanoparticles can significantly enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. The photodegradation mechanism as well as enhancement of the photoactivity in the presence of silver nanoparticles is further investigated. The experimental results indicate the potential of using Ag-ZnO heterostructured nanoparticles for degradation of Congo red dye.

The effects of the Zn2SnO4 additive on the structure, morphology and gas-sensing property of SnO2 were investigated in this study. It was confirmed that control of the Zn amounts in the precursor solution was effective in realizing well-developed one-and two-dimensional coexisting structured SnO2-Zn2SnO4 (SnZn) nanocomposites. The gas sensing properties of the resulting SnZn composites to HCHO vapor were tested. The results showed that the presence of Zn2SnO4 species in SnO2 powders could effectively enhance electrical conductivity, reduce optimal operating temperature and improve the gas response of the sensors. The composite exhibited the highest response towards HCHO in the case of 35 at% (ZnSnO4)-Sn-2 nanoplates coupling with hierarchical branched structures of SnO2 nanorods (SnZn35) at a relatively lower operating temperature of 162 degrees C. The good gas-sensing performance of the SnZn35 composite can be ascribed to the smaller particle size, the larger surface area and the more absorbed O-x(-) species, which all are favorable for gas diffusion and sensing reactions. This work renders great potential in the fabrication of gas sensors using a binary-ternary oxide composite, which can be further applied in indoor pollution detection.

The structural and the morphological characterizations of the ZnO nanoparticles were performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N-2-sorption isotherms. The obtained nanoparticles are highly crystalline wurtzite-type ZnO with a uniform near-spherical shape and an average particle size estimated to be 8.4 +/- 1.3 nm. Such a small particle size and slight agglomeration are attributed to the use of methanol, which acts as both a solvent and an inhibitor of growth and agglomeration. The assynthesized ZnO nanoparticles were directly used as a gas sensing material toward n-butanol gas. Such a designed sensor device exhibits several advantages such as a high and fast response, short recovery time, and good stability toward n-butanol gas. At the optimal operating temperature (320 degrees C), its gas response toward 500 ppm n-butanol is 805 and the response and recovery times are 22 and 6 seconds, respectively.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of infinite crystalline lattices with metal clusters and organic linkers may provide opportunities for the detection of cancer cells which have remained undiagnosed. Herein, we report that Fe-MIL-101 possesses an intrinsic enzyme mimicking activity similar to that found in natural horseradish peroxidase and shows highly catalytic activity even at neutral pH. The Michaelis constant (K-m) of Fe-MIL-101 with H2O2 as the substrate is about 616-fold (at pH 4.0) and 20-fold (at pH 7.0) smaller than free natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), indicating a much higher affinity for H2O2 than HRP and most of the peroxidase mimetics. Moreover, Fe-MIL-101 was successfully used to detect cancer cells by conjugating folic acid onto Fe-MIL-101 without any surface modification. The detection limit of the method for HeLa cells was estimated to be 50 cells and the reaction colour produced with 10 cells could also be observed by the naked eye. The proposed method holds considerable potential for simple, sensitive, universal, and specific cancer cell detection.

By simply adjusting the acidity of the reaction system, PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA composite nanotubes composed of anatase, a mixed phase TiO2 and different PANI redox state are obtained. The acidity of reaction system is tuned by HNO3, HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4, respectively. The traditional thermal treatment for crystalline transformation is not required, thus intact halloysite structure can be guaranteed. The XRD and UV-vis results show that the surface polyaniline sensitization has no effect on the crystalline structure of halloysite and the light response of TiO2 is extended to visible-light regions, respectively. The visible light photocatalytic activity of polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite with HCl tuning the acidity (pH 0.5) and 1% volume ratio of aniline to titanium isopropoxide in the preparation (P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl) is superior to those of samples with H2SO4, HNO3 and H3PO4 tuning the acidity in the preparation at the same acidity and volume ratio of aniline to titanium isopropoxide. Such superior photocatalytic activity of P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl is mainly due to the enhanced visible light adsorption and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, redoping P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl with H2SO4 and H3PO4 demonstrates its photocatalytic activity decreases, indicating the acid dopants in the preparation and redoping process play a important role to the photocatalytic activity of the polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes. Moreover, the supported catalyst allows them to be easily separated from the solution.

Effects of plastic mulch and crop rotation on soil physical properties in rain-fed vegetable production in the mid-Yunnan plateau, China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Plastic mulch; Soil structure; Organic carbon; Aggregate stability; K-sat	DIFFERENT TILLAGE; CARBON FRACTIONS; WATER MANAGEMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; SYSTEM; FILM; STRAW	Plastic mulch is widely used for vegetable cropping in the mid-Yunnan plateau, southwestern China. However, the effects of plastic mulch on soil physical properties are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different plastic mulch patterns (narrow and wide plastic mulch) and rotations (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat and broccoli-zucchini-fallow) on soil physical properties and soil organic carbon content in a vegetable production system at a research station in the region. The experiment comprised four treatments and laid out in the field using randomized complete block design replicated nine times. The soil (0-20 cm) under wide plastic mulch retained more water than the soil narrow plastic mulch under the vegetable growing season over 3 consecutive severe drought years. Significant decline (11%) of surface soil (0-5 cm) organic carbon was observed in 2012 compared with in 2010, but soil organic carbon and physical properties did not differ significantly between the two different plastic mulch patterns. The higher macro-porosity, aggregate stability, K-sat and lower bulk density in the plastic mulched ridges imply that the conversion from narrow-plastic-mulch to wide-plastic-mulch increases mulched area thereby conserving larger area soil structure in the croplands. Although increased catch crop stubble retention in the furrows apparently improved surface soil macro-porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the autumn rotary cultivation in broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat rotation system has significantly decreased (5%) surface soil organic carbon. The results suggested that continued use of vegetable-cereal crop rotation system, even with stubble retention, may result in loss soil organic carbon. Further research that covers wetter years should be taken to assess effects of vegetable-cereal crop rotation pattern on soil physical properties in this region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To assess yield response to soil erosion, a new method for gradually simulating eroded soil profiles was developed for experimentation with potted soybeans in which the top 20 cm layer simulated the cultivated layer, which was mixed with soils below due to annual soil loss and a plow depth of 20 cm. The experimental results of five treatments, including "no erosion" and soil losses of the top 20 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, and 70 cm, showed reduction rates of 5.06%, 5.97%, and 1.77% per 10 cm of soil loss on average for the biomass, yield, and harvest index, respectively. The response curve for soil erosion was concave, with a faster erosion rate at the top layer of 40 cm and a slower erosion rate for the lower layers. The declining yield rates were 9.44% and 1.51% per 10 cm of soil loss for the top and lower layers, and 7.6% and 2.48%, respectively, for declining rates of biomass. The yields were more sensitive to soil erosion than the biomass, whereas the harvest index was not as sensitive. Temperature is a factor that results in annual variations of productivity, however, the more soil loss that occurs, the less the temperature has an effect, and the more that soil erosion has an impact.

Well-dispersed NiO nanoparticles were introduced into the highly ordered mesoporous MCM-41 by chemical precipitation method to prepare the highly ordered mesoporous NiO/MCM-41 composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement were used to examine the morphology and the microstructure of the obtained composite. The morphological study clearly revealed that the synthesized NiO/MCM-41 composite has a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 435.9 m(2) g(-1). A possible formation mechanism is preliminary proposed for the formation of the nanostructure. The adsorption performance of NiO/MCM-41 composite as an adsorbent was further demonstrated in the removal azo dyes of methyl orange (MO), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB) and rhodaming B (RB) under visible light irradiation and dark, respectively. The kinetics and mechanism of removal methylene blue were studied. The results show that NiO/MCM-41 composite has a good removal capacity for organic pollutant MB from the wastewater under the room temperature. Compared with MCM-41 and NiO nanoparticles, 54.2% and 100% higher removal rate were obtained by the NiO/MCM-41 composite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The two contrasting populations were subjected to two CO2 regimes (350 and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) and two N levels (0 and 5 g N m(-2) year(-1)). Their net photosynthetic rate, nonstructural carbohydrate concentration, and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) increased under elevated CO2. However, the increases detected in the high-elevation (HE) population were significantly greater than those found in the low-elevation (LE) population. Under elevated CO2 and N application, the maximal carboxylation rate (V-cmax) increased in HE population, whereas no effects were found on V-cmax in LE population. The C to N ratio decreased under N application in both populations. N application also induced the HE population to show greater increases in free amino acids, soluble proteins, N concentration, and PNUE than LE population. These results suggested that the population from HE was more sensitive to elevated CO2 and (or) N application than LE population. Results of this study provided valuable knowledge for predicting forest development under increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and (or) N deposition.

With the help of numerical simulation, the propagation properties of CHFBs in different parameters are studied. Results indicate that in turbulent atmosphere, with the increase of propagation distance, the darkness of CHFBs gradually annihilate, and eventually evolve into Gaussian beams. Compared with the propagation properties in free space, the turbulent atmosphere enhances the diffraction effect of CHFBs and reduces the propagation distance for CHFBs to evolve into Gaussian beams. In strong turbulence atmospheric propagation, Airy disk phenomenon will disappear. The study on the propagation properties of CHFBs in turbulence atmosphere by using ABCD matrix is simple and convenient. This method can also be applied to study the propagation properties of other hollow laser beams in turbulent atmosphere. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.
