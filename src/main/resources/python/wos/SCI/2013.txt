By means of a lumped Markov chain model of a random walker, we propose two novel ways of inferring the lumped markov transition matrix. Furthermore, some useful results are proposed based on the analysis of the properties of the lumped Markov process. To find the best partition of complex networks, a novel framework including two algorithms for network partition based on the optimal lumped Markovian dynamics is derived to solve this problem. The algorithms are constructed to minimize the objective function under this framework. It is demonstrated by the simulation experiments that our algorithms can efficiently determine the probabilities with which a node belongs to different clusters during the learning process and naturally supports the fuzzy partition. Moreover, they are successfully applied to real-world network, including the social interactions between members of a karate club.

The as-obtained products keep the structure of filter paper, resulting in the formation of hollow NiO nanotube aggregates with strong framework and loose hollow mesoporous structure. As anode material for lithium ion batteries, it exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 620 mA h g(-1) and keeps over 600 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles except for the first cycle at current density of 200 mA g(-1). The NiO eletrode also exhibits good rate capability. The nanostructured characteristics of NiO particles embedded in the nanotube ensure the high capacity in the electrode. The unique hollow structures can shorten the length of Li-ion diffusion and offer a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Herein, the hollow NiO nanotubular electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sequence analysis revealed that cen219 encoded a protein of 367 amino acids. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified endoglucanase suggested that Cen219 was a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for endoglucanase activity of Cen219 was separately 50 degrees C and 6.0. It was stable from 30 to 50 degrees C, and from pH 4.0 to 7.0. The activity was significantly enhanced by Mn2+ and dramatically reduced by detergent SDS and metals Fe3+, Cu2+ or Hg2+. The enzyme hydrolyzed a wide range of beta-1, 3-, and beta-1, 4-linked polysaccharides, with varying activities. Activities towards microcrystalline cellulose and filter paper were relatively high, while the highest activity was towards oat gum. The K-m and V-max of Cen219 towards CMC was 17.37 mg/ml and 333.33 U/mg, respectively. The findings have an insight into understanding the molecular basis of host-parasite interactions in B. xylophilus species. The properties also make Cen219 an interesting enzyme for biotechnological application.

Xishuangbanna is a tropical region preserving one of the highest floristic diversity areas in China. In this study, leaf litter of four dominant plant species in Xishuangbanna was incubated in stream water for 42 days during which samples were taken regularly. Following DNA extraction, PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and clone-sequencing analyses were performed using bacterial and fungal specific primers. Leaf species have slightly influences on bacterial community rather than fungal community. The richness and diversity of bacteria was higher than that of fungi, which increased towards the end of the 42-day-incubation. The bacterial community was initially more specific upon the type of leaves and gradually became similar at the later stage of decomposition with alpha-proteobacteria as major component. Sequences affiliated to methanotrophs were obtained that indicates potentially occurrence of methane oxidation and methanogenesis. For the fungal community, sequences affiliated to Aspergillus were predominant at the beginning and then shifted to Pleosporales. Our results suggest that the microorganisms colonizing leaf biofilm in tropical stream water were mostly generalists that could exploit the resources of leaves of various species equally well.

Effect of plastic mulch and winter catch crop on water availability and vegetable yield in a rain-fed vegetable cropping system at mid-Yunnan plateau, China	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Plastic mulch; Soil moisture storage; WUE; Vegetable; Rain-fed	USE EFFICIENCY; ZUCCHINI SQUASH; WHEAT; SOIL; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; RADIATION; NITROGEN; TILLAGE; BALANCE	The fluctuation of rainfall is the primary limiting factor for sustainability of rain-fed vegetable cropping systems in mid-Yunnan plateau. Our objectives were to evaluate effects of an alternative plastic mulching practice (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and an additional catch crop (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow) on the soil moisture status, crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in the rain-fed vegetable cropping systems. Rainfall was much low and erratic during the entire experiment period compared with the long-term average (1971-2000). The 0-60 cm soil water storage (113 mm) of growing season was significantly higher under wide plastic mulch plots than narrow plastic mulch plots (99 mm). Fruit yield and water use efficiency of broccoli and zucchini were enhanced with wide plastic mulch during growing season in the three years experiment. Compared with the broccoli-zucchini-fallow plots, the broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat rotation treatment did not significantly decrease available soil water at broccoli transplanting stage. This implicated that the addition of winter wheat in the vegetable cropping system would not pose serious consequences for water storage. The results obtained in this study have practical implications for sustainability of the rain-fed vegetable culture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, G. S.; Hu, X. B.; Zhang, X.

However, the provision of environmental studies and the incorporation of environmental protection and sustainable development into the academic curricula have not been reported. Here, we analyzed the curricula of 267 out of 810 public universities and colleges in China- a sample of 30% from each of the 12 different types (China's universities are categorized 12 types as agriculture, forestry, engineering, comprehensive colleges, education, ethnic study, medicine, economics, law, arts, language and sports). The results showed that 19.47% of the sampled institutions failed to establish a comprehensive environmental education framework; the education is "greener" in agriculture- and forestry-based institutions, while those focus on sports, art and linguistics are less successful in addressing environmental problems; the institutions funded by the Ministry of Education provide relatively "greener" education than those funded by local and provincial governments. Moreover, the institutions located in underdeveloped areas are less concerned with environmental education than those in more developed area, as reflected by their academic curricula. The level of environmental education is also significantly higher in the "Project 985" universities (the top 39 universities in the country) and the "Project 211" universities (the top 116 universities in the country) than any other universities. The number of textbooks published that address environmental issues showed an increase between year 2005 and 2010, but less significantly in literature, philosophy and education-related textbooks. Our results indicate that environmental education needs to be improved in most of the institutions of higher education in China, and it should be systematically assessed and improved to meet-the nation's rising demands in sustainable development, nature and resource conservation.

J	Zhao, XQ; Dai, JH; Wang, JP				Zhao, Xiaoqing; Dai, Jinhua; Wang, Jianping			GIS-based evaluation and spatial distribution characteristics of land degradation in Bijiang watershed	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article								Land degradation is one of the significant issues the human beings are confronted with, which has become a bottleneck of restricting the sustainable development of the regional society and economy. In order to ascertain the root causes contributed to the land degradation and characteristics of land degradation, Bijiang watershed, the most important Lead-Zinc mine area of Lanping county of Yunnan Province, was selected as the study area. One evaluation index system for land degradation that consists of 5 single factors(water-soil erosion intensity, geological disaster risk, cultivation intensity of arable land, pollution of heavy metals in soil and biodiversity deterioration) was established and 13 indicators were chosen, and the entropy method was adopted to assign weights to each single factor. By using the tools of Geographic Information System (GIS), the land degradation degree was evaluated and one spatial distribution map for land degradation was accomplished. In this study, the land of the whole watershed was divided into 4 types, including extremely-severe degradation area, severely-degraded area, moderately-degraded area and slightly-degraded area, and some solutions for ecological restoration and rehabilitation were also put forward in this study. The study results indicated that: (1) Water-soil erosion intension and pollution of heavy metals in soil have made greater contribution to the comprehensive land degradation in Bijiang watershed; (2) There is an apparent difference regarding land degradation degree in Bijiang watershed. The moderately-degraded area accounts for the most part in the region, which covers 79.66% of the whole watershed. The severely-degraded area accounts for 15.98% and the slightly-degraded regions and extremely severe degradation area accounts for 1.08% and 3.28% respectively; (3) There is an evident regularity of spatial distribution in land degradation in Bijiang watershed. The moderately-degraded areas mainly distribute in the most part of the mid-stream and down-stream, the slightly-degraded areas distribute in the mid-stream, the severely-degraded areas distribute in the upstream and south-west part of down-stream, the extremely severe degradation areas distribute in the east and middle part of the upstream; (4) From the administrative division viewpoint, the slightly-degraded areas primarily distribute in Jiancao township, Baishi town and Nuodeng town. The moderately-degraded areas distribute in Changxin township, Baofeng township, Jiancao township, Baishi town and Nuodeng town. The severely-degraded areas distribute in Jinding town, Baofeng township and Lajing town. The extremely severe degradation areas distribute in Jinding town. By connecting the spatial distribution mode for land degradation with other natural, economical elements, we drew a conclusion that the pollution in heavy metals in soil, serious water erosion and geological disasters are the main causes of the land degradation in Bijiang watershed.

The as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that the morphologies of WO3 are controlled by the amount of Emim(+)Br(-). In 0.5 g Emim(+)Br(-)-added solution, the product is h-WO3 nanorod bundles composed of uniform WO3 nanorods with average diameter of 25 nm and length of 200 similar to 300 nm. The formation mechanism of h-WO3 nanorod bundles is proposed according to the experimental results.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	TeV GAMMA-RAY SURVEY OF THE NORTHERN SKY USING THE ARGO-YBJ DETECTOR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma rays: general; surveys	AIR-SHOWER ARRAY; LARGE-AREA TELESCOPE; SOURCE MGRO J1908+06; CRAB-NEBULA; GALACTIC SOURCES; POINT SOURCES; EMISSION; FERMI; HESS; MILAGRO	The Astrophysical Radiation with Ground-based Observatory at Yang Ba Jing (ARGO-YBJ) detector is an extensive air shower array that has been used to monitor the northern gamma-ray sky at energies above 0.3 TeV from 2007 November to 2013 January. In this paper, we present the results of a sky survey in the declination band from -10 degrees to 70 degrees, using data recorded over the past five years. With an integrated sensitivity ranging from 0.24 to similar to 1 Crab units depending on the declination, six sources have been detected with a statistical significance greater than five standard deviations. Several excesses are also reported as potential gamma-ray emitters. The features of each source are presented and discussed. Additionally, 95% confidence level upper limits of the flux from the investigated sky region are shown. Specific upper limits for 663 GeV gamma-ray active galactic nuclei inside the ARGO-YBJ field of view are reported. The effect of the absorption of gamma-rays due to the interaction with extragalactic background light is estimated.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

Under the assumptions that the activation functions only satisfy global Lipschitz conditions and the behaved functions only satisfy sign conditions, by applying the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, degree theory and some inequality technique, a novel LMI-based sufficient condition is established for global exponential stability of the concerned neural networks. In our result, the assumption on the activation functions is less conservative than the assumption for monotonicity in Nie and Cao (2009) [28] and the assumption on the behaved functions is also less conservative than the assumption for differentiability in Nie and Cao (2009) [28], Xia (2010) [30], Zhou and Wan (2009) [31] and Zhang et al.

Palladium(II) was extracted quantitatively with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in benzene. Ammonium thiocyanate solution could be used as stripping agent. Extraction parameters of Pd(II), including cetyltrimethylammonium bromide concentration, contact time of aqueous and organic phases, organic/aqueous (O/A) phase ratio and NH4SCN concentration of aqueous phase, were studied. Almost all of the Pd(CN)(4)(2-) (>99 %) was transferred from the aqueous phase into the organic phase. Most of the Pd(II) in the organic phase can be stripped with ammonium thiocyanate aqueous solutions. The possible mechanisms of extraction and stripping were discussed.

Adsorption capacities under optimum conditions were determined. The Pd(II) ions adsorption capacities increased by increased hexyl benzimidazolyl sulphide content and initial Pd(II) ions concentration and it reached the maximum value at 0.4 g L-1 initial Pd(II) ions concentration under the determined optimum conditions. Successful striping of palladium(II) from the microspheres were achieved with 0.8 mol L-1 thiourea solution. The microspheres can be reused at least in 20 cycles of extraction-stripping process.

The results indicated that the imprinted membrane derived from commercial cellulose acetate and nylon microfiltration membranes in tetrahydrofuran yielded the highest imprinting factor of 3.099. Characterization results by scanning electron microscopy and N-2 adsorption analysis showed that the optimized imprinted membrane (MICMopt) possessed different pore structure and surface morphology from the non-imprinted membrane (NICMopt). Under the drive of concentration difference, MICMopt can preferably transfer evodiamine and its transfer mechanism conforms to the "gate effect" mechanism. As a result of imprinting effect, MICMopt can enrich evodiamine from the crude extraction of the herb Evodia rutaecarpa with a concentration effect (1.72 times). The results show a promising application potential of MICMopt in the separation and enrichment of evodiamine in the complex system.

Developing a spatially-explicit, sustainable and risk-based insurance scheme to mitigate human-wildlife conflict	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Asian elephant; China; Compensation; Hevea brasiliensis; Risk; Rubber; Xishuangbanna	COMPENSATION; CONSERVATION; DEPREDATION; LIVESTOCK; RUBBER; CHALLENGES; ELEPHANTS; PREDATION; PATTERNS; PROGRAMS	Insurance may encourage coexistence between farmers and wildlife by reimbursing farmers' losses. China introduced an insurance scheme to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture in Yunnan Province, where elephants cause damage to rubber plantations. However, recent experience has suggested that the present insurance system exhibits poor performance related to funding shortfalls, undervaluing of plantations and insufficient payouts, and by limiting community involvement. To address these shortcomings we conducted attitude surveys with farmers, and developed an actuarial (risk-based) insurance model for rubber loss that incorporated spatially-explicit risk of depredation and net present value of rubber at damage, in order to calculate fair payouts at village and town levels for the year 2011. Farmers were largely dissatisfied with the current insurance system, and their level of satisfaction was associated with the compensation ratio (percentage of lost rubber reimbursed by insurance). The illustrative results based on 2011 rubber loss data revealed high variability in risk and therefore payouts (and further, premiums) and that fair insurance payouts would be approximately five times the current levels. To improve compensation and support long-term program sustainability, we considered an insurance cost-sharing mechanism that incorporated shared payments from government, rubber farmers, and Chinese tourists. We found that multiple stakeholders were willing to pay for elephant conservation, which could make significant contributions to insurance premiums over the long term. Importantly, this proposed insurance model could be broadly applicable to livestock and long-lived cash crop compensation systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The two Gram-staining-positive, aerobic strains produced branched substrate mycelia and aerial hyphae that were not fragmented, and no diffusible pigment was produced on the media tested. At maturity, spore chains and single spores were formed on aerial hyphae and substrate mycelium, respectively. Whole-organism hydrolysates of both strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the diagnostic sugars glucose and galactose. Their predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H-4), MK-10(H-6), MK-11(H-4), MK-11(H-6) and MK-11(H-8) for strain YIM 11335(T) and MK-10(H-4), MK-10(H-6), MK-11(H-4), MK-11(H-6) and MK-11(H-8) for strain 12A09(T). The polar lipids detected in the two strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and several unknown glycolipids, phospholipids and polar lipids. The major fatty acids (>10%) were iSO-C-16:0 and C-16:0 for strain YIM 11335(T) and iso-C-16:8 for strain 12A09(T). The G + C contents of the genomic DNA of strains YIM 11335(T) and 12A09(T) were 70.7% and 74.4%, respectively. DNA DNA hybridization relatedness values of these two isolates with the type strains Nocardiopsis arabia DSM 45083(T) and Streptomonospora halophila YIM 91355(T) supported the hypothesis they are representatives of two different species. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the two isolates belong to the genus Streptomonospora of the family Nocardiopsaceae and that the type strain of N. arabia should be reclassified as a representative of Streptomonospora arabica comb. nov. The names proposed for the two novel species are Streptomonospora sediminis sp. nov. (type strain YIM M11335(T)=DSM 45723(T)=CCTCC AB 2012051(T)) and Streptomonospora nanhaiensis sp. nov. (type strain 12A09(T)=KCTC 29145(T)=CCTCC AB 2013140(T)), respectively.

The strain showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Micromonospora echinaurantica DSM 43904(T) (98.4%), but formed a monophyletic clade with Micromonospora coerulea DSM 43143(T) (98.3%) in the neighbour-joining tree. DNA DNA hybridization experiments gave a DNA DNA relatedness value of 53.1% between MBRL 34(T) and M. coerulea DSM 43143(T). Strain MBRL 34(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, galactose and glucose in the whole-cell hydrolysates along with small amounts of mannose, xylose, rhamnose and ribose. The major polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositolmannoside, along with an unknown lipid. MK-10(H-6), MK-10(H-2) MK-11(H-4) and MK-10(H-4) were the predominant menaquinones detected. The major fatty acids were iso-C-16:0 and iso-C-16:0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 73.5%. Based on the taxonomic characteristics from a polyphasic study, strain MBRL 34(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Micromonospora for which the name Micromonospora kangleipakensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MBRL 34(T) (=DSM 45612(T)=JCM 17696(T)).

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM M11385(T) belongs to the genus Marininema, supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. The taxonomic position of this organism was further established by using a polyphasic approach. Strain YIM M11385(T) grew optimally at 28 degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 0-5% (w/v) NaCl. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain YIM M11385(T) and Marininema mesophilum SCSIO 10219(T) was 98.3%. Strain YIM M11385(T) exhibited a quinone system with only MK-7, the polar lipid profile included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine as major components, and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0. The level of DNA DNA relatedness between strain YIM M11385(T) and M. mesophilum SCSIO 10219(T) was 59.36%. On the basis of genotypic and phenotypic data, it is apparent that strain YIM M11385(T) represents a novel species of the genus Marininema, for which the name Marininema halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M11385(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012052(T)=DSM 45789(T)). In addition, we propose that the description of the genus Marininema should be further emended based on the results of the present study.

By surrounding a small section of LCOF with a glass capillary and a solution of Rhodamine 6G filled between them to separate fluorescent dye and Raman medium, the initial intensity of SRS is linearly amplified by external fluorescence seeding, and then the SRS of LCOF can be enhanced effectively. Experimental results show that both the concentration of fluorescent dye and the seeding position have an influence on enhancement of SRS. The maximum enhancement of Stokes lines is obtained when the concentration of dye solution is optimized at 10(-6)mol/l and seeding position is located at the input end.

The expression of hepcidin is significantly induced by iron overload, inflammation, and infection of pathogens. Recent studies have indicated that the expression of hepcidin in the liver is also regulated during liver regeneration. However, the mechanism of the regulation of hepcidin expression and its role in liver regeneration remain unclear. In this study, we found that the hepatocyte growth factor inhibited hepcidin expression in the liver during the late stage of liver regeneration. Meanwhile, we investigated the effect of hepcidin on liver regeneration. Mice overexpressing hepcidin-1 exhibited impaired hepatic regeneration after partial hepatectomy, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation cell nuclear antigen. Our results demonstrated a negative role of hepcidin in modulating liver regeneration, and suggested that a sustained high iron level by the down-regulation of hepcidin at the late stage of liver regeneration is required for hepatocyte proliferation.

To identify its underlying neural mechanisms, we investigated the aging effects on the primary visual cortex (V1) cells in early senescent (ES) monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Under anesthesia, receptive field properties of V1 cells were examined by extracellular single-unit recordings in the young adult (YA; 56 years old), ES (1924 years old), and late senescent (LS; 2832 years old) monkeys. We found clear indications of functional degradation in early senescence, including impaired stimulus selectivities, increased level of spontaneous activity and declined signal-to-noise ratio, and dynamic range of V1 cell responses. Importantly, the functional degradation in early senescence exhibited unique features that were different from the results for the LS animals, such as remarkable individual variability in orientation selectivity and unchanged peak response elicited by visual stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the function of V1 degrades during the early stage of aging in nonhuman primate, suggesting potential neural correlates for functional deficits observed in early senescence in human subjects. Moreover, these results provide new insight into the dynamics of the aging-related functional deterioration, revealing a more complex and heterogeneous picture of this process.

The shape and development of scour pit have an important effect on the stability and safety of debris flow sabo dam, which determines the foundational depth of the dam and the design of protective measures downstream. Study on the scouring law of sabo dam downstream can evaluate the erosion range and reasonably arrange auxiliary protective engineering. Therefore, a series of flume experiments are carried out including different debris flow characteristics (density is varying from 1.5 t/m(3) to 2.1 t/m(3)) and different gully longitudinal slopes. The result shows that the scour pit appears as an oval shape in a plane and deep in the middle while superficial at the ends in the longitudinal section, the position of the maximum depth point moves towards downstream with an increase of flume slope angle. The maximum depth of scour pit is mainly affected by the longitudinal slope of gully, density of debris flow, and the characteristics of gully composition (particle size and the viscosity of soil). The result also indicates that the viscosity of soil will weaken the erosion extent. The interior slopes of scour pit are different between the upstream and the downstream, and the downstream slope is smaller than the upper one. For the viscous and non-viscous sands with the same distribution of gradation, the interior slope of non-viscous sand is smaller than the viscous sand. According to the regression analysis on the experimental data, the quantitative relationship between the interior slope of scour pit, slope of repose under water and the longitudinal slope of gully is established and it can be used to calculate the interior slope of scour pit. The results can provide the basis for the parameter design of the debris flow control engineering foundation.

Yunnan province is a scarce example to testify biogeography patterns, causes and conservation challenge for its complex geography, high biodiversity and increasing human activities. Freshwater fishes are among the most effective faunas to explain biogeography for their limited ability to disperse. In the present study, totally 375 fish species in 146 genera, 26 families and 9 orders were included. Four key areas with higher diversity were randomly distributed in the province. Six environmental parameters as minimum temperature, mean precipitation, mean altitude, altitude range, river length, maximum slope, and their any combinations could effectively explain the current fish spatial patterns. A total of 625 individuals belonging to 30 dominated genera were grouped into six communities, each showing a better use of living spaces and food. Historical event was the primary factor to determine the current spatial distribution pattern of freshwater fishes in Yunnan Province, followed by the changing environment. Relationships among fish species with different personalities finally made the fauna more stable. The biogeography will move to a confusion pattern under the increasing human intervention and consequent environment changes.

The strain formed a monophyletic clade with Streptomyces spinoverrucosus NBRC 14228(T) (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 99.3 %) in the Neighbour-joining tree. DNA-DNA hybridization experiment gave a DNA-DNA relatedness value of 34.7 % between MBRL 179(T) and S. spinoverrucosus NBRC 14228(T). Strain MBRL 179(T) contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, xylose, glucose, and mannose in the whole cell-wall hydrolysates along with small amount of ribose. The major polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositolmannoside, with other unknown phospholipids and aminophospholipid. MK-9(H-6), MK-9(H-8) and MK-9(H-4) were the predominant menaquinones detected. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-16:0 (28.1 %), iso-C-16:0 (20.3 %), C-16:0 (9.4 %) and anteiso-C-17:0 (8.3 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.1 %. Based on the polyphasic experiment results, the strain MBRL 179(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces muensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MBRL 179(T) (=JCM 17576(T) = KCTC 29124(T)).

NOV; MEMBER; TREES; JAPAN; ACID	A novel bacterium, designated YIM M13075(T), was isolated from a sediment sample collected from the South China Sea. Growth occurred from 4 to 45 A degrees C (optimum 28 A degrees C), pH 6.0-11.0 (optimum pH 8.0). The strain formed yellow-cream colonies after 5 days incubation on TSA modified with 5 % NaCl medium at 28 A degrees C. Cells were Gram-positive, short rods and motile. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM M13075(T) was affiliated with the genus Geomicrobium (93.5 %). The strain YIM M13075(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. The predominant menaquinones were MK-7 and MK-6. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.7 mol%. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics as well as genotypic data, strain YIM M13075(T) represents a novel species in the genus Geomicrobium, for which the name Geomicrobium sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M13075(T) (=DSM 25540(T) =JCM 18144(T) =CCTCC AB 2013245(T)). An emended description of the genus Geomicrobium is also proposed in the light of the new data.

DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GEN. NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; CHROMATOGRAPHY; CHINA; TREES	An alkaliphilic actinobacterium, designated EGI 80050(T), was isolated from a desert soil sample of Xinjiang, north-west China, and characterized by a polyphasic approach. The isolate was observed to produce purple orange-yellow aerial mycelium and dark orange-yellow substrate mycelium on yeast extract-malt extract agar medium. Whole-cell hydrolysates of strain EGI 80050(T) were found to contain ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and galactose, glucose, rhamnose and mannose as the main sugars. The major fatty acids identified were C-16:0-iso (36.8 %), C-15:0-anteiso (17.3 %), 15:0-iso (13.2 %) and 14:0-iso (10.5 %). The predominant menaquinones detected were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8), while the characteristic polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and three unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 67.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated the strain EGI 80050(T) to the genus Streptomyces. Levels of 16 rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain EGI 80050(T) and Streptomyces candidus NRRL ISP-5141(T), Streptomyces cremeus NBRC 12760(T), Streptomyces spiroverticillatus NBRC 12821(T), Streptomyces violaceorectus NBRC 13102(T), Streptomyces cinereoruber subsp. cinereoruber NBRC 12756(T) were 96.7, 96.6, 96.6, 96.6 and 96.6 %, respectively. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain EGI 80050(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces fukangensis sp. nov. (type strain EGI 80050(T) = BCRC 16945(T) = JCM 19127(T)) is proposed.

Based on a particular semiparametric regression model for non-ignorable missing response, we propose a nonparametric/semiparametric estimation method and an augmented inverse probability weighted imputation method to estimate the distribution function and quantiles of a response variable. Under some regularity conditions, we derive asymptotic properties of the proposed distribution function and quantile estimators. Two empirical log-likelihood functions are also defined to construct confidence intervals for distribution function of a response variable. Simulation studies show that our proposed methods are robust. In particular, the semiparametric estimator is more efficient than the nonparametric estimator, and the inverse probability weighted imputation estimator is bias-corrected.

Here, we analysed water chemistry, archaeal lipids and amoA- and nirS genes from 37 Tibetan hot springs. Strong correlations between intact polar lipids and their degradation product core lipids indicate that these two pools of lipids are closely related and may be formed in situ in the hot springs. Cluster analysis resulted in three major groups, within each of which the individual samples showed better correlations between ring index or TEX86 (TetraEther Index of tetraethers with 86 carbons) and temperature, pH or geochemical variables (e.g. nitrite, phosphate) in the polar fraction than in the corresponding core fraction. Most of these relationships did not exist when all of the samples were considered as a whole. Abundances of amoA- and nirS genes were strongly correlated with some of the intact polar- or core lipids. Our results suggest link between specific microbial functions (e.g. ammonia oxidation or nitrite reduction) and the production of individual GDGT lipids and highlights the potential utility of GDGT lipids as proxies for biogeochemical processes.

However, the mechanism underlying its effect against nematodes remains unknown. In this study, we screened a random mutant library of B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 generated by the mariner transposon TnYLB-1 and identified a mutant strain F5 with attenuated nematicidal activity. Reversible polymerase chain reaction revealed that three candidate genes RAMB_007470, yhdY, and prkA that were disrupted by the transposon in strain F5 potentially contributed to its decreased nematicidal activity. Bioassay of mutants impaired in the three candidate genes demonstrated that directed deletion of gene RBAM_007470 resulted in loss of nematicidal activity comparable with that of the F5 triple mutant. RBAM_007470 has been reported as being involved in biosynthesis of plantazolicin, a thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin with hitherto unknown function. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) analyses of surface extracts revealed that plantazolicin bearing a molecular weight of 1,354 Da was present in wild-type B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, but absent in the Delta RABM_007470 mutant. Furthermore, bioassay of the organic extract containing plantazolicin also showed a moderate nematicidal activity. We conclude that a novel gene RBAM_007470 and its related metabolite are involved in the antagonistic effect exerted by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 against nematodes.

The adsorption of methyl violet on the steel surface is found to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with and without chloride ion. The studies reveal that the single methyl violet is not an effective inhibitor for cold rolled steel in sulphuric acid solution, but the complex of methyl violet and chloride ion shows a quite well inhibition. A synergistic effect was observed and discussed. The thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption free energy, adsorption heat and adsorption entropy, kinetic data such as apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated and discussed. Potentiodynamic polarization researches show that single methyl violet mainly acts as a cathodic-type inhibitor, however the mixture of methyl violet and sodium chloride acts as a mixed-type inhibitor and shows dominant effect on the cathodic reaction.

Various molecular tools and strategies have been developed for functional genomic analysis of filamentous fungi since the first DNA transformation was successfully achieved in Neurospora crassa in 1973. Increasing amounts of genomic data regarding filamentous fungi are continuously reported and large-scale functional studies have become common in a wide range of fungal species. In this review, various molecular tools used in filamentous fungi are compared and discussed, including methods for genetic transformation (e.g., protoplast transformation, electroporation, and microinjection), the construction of random mutant libraries (e.g., restriction enzyme mediated integration, transposon arrayed gene knockout, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation), and the analysis of gene function (e.g., RNA interference and transcription activator-like effector nucleases). We also focused on practical strategies, that could enhance the efficiency of genetic manipulation in filamentous fungi, such as choosing a proper screening system and marker genes, assembling target-cassettes or vectors effectively, and transforming into strains that are deficient in the nonhomologous end joining pathway.

Kallotenue papyrolyticum gen. nov., sp nov., a cellulolytic and filamentous thermophile that represents a novel lineage (Kallotenuales ord. nov., Kallotenuaceae fam. nov.) within the class Chloroflexia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							BACTERIUM HERPETOSIPHON-AURANTIACUS; PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; GLIDING BACTERIUM; SINGLE-CELL; HOT-SPRINGS; KEBRIT DEEP; RED-SEA; PEPTIDOGLYCAN; COMMUNITIES	Several closely related, thermophilic and cellulolytic bacterial strains, designated JKG1(T), JKG2, JKG3, JKG4 and JKG5, were isolated from a cellulolytic enrichment (corn stover) incubated in the water column of Great Boiling Spring, NV. Strain JKG1(T) had cells of diameter 0.7-0.9 mu m and length similar to 2.0 mu m that formed non-branched, multicellular filaments reaching >300 mu m. Spores were not formed and dense liquid cultures were red. The temperature range for growth was 45-65 degrees C, with an optimum of 55 degrees C. The pH range for growth was pH 5.6-9.0, with an optimum of pH 7.5. JKG1(T) grew as an aerobic heterotroph, utilizing glucose, sucrose, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, CM-cellulose, filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, xylan, starch, Casamino acids, tryptone, peptone, yeast extract, acetate, citrate, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol as sole carbon sources, and was not observed to photosynthesize. The cells stained Gram-negative. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the new isolates in the class Chloroflexia, but distant from other cultivated members, with the highest sequence identity of 82.5% to Roseiflexus castenholzii. The major quinone was menaquinone-9; no ubiquinones were detected. The major cellular fatty acids (>5%) were C-18:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-18:0, iso-C-17:0, C-16:0, iso-C-16:0 and C-17:0. The peptidoglycan amino acids were alanine, ornithine, glutamic acid, serine and asparagine. Whole-cell sugars included mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, ribose, arabinose and xylose. Morphological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results suggest that JKG1(T) is representative of a new lineage within the class Chloroflexia, which we propose to designate Kallotenue papyrolyticum gen. nov., sp. nov., Kallotenuaceae fam. nov., Kallotenuales ord. nov. The type strain of Kallotenue papyrolyticum gen. nov., sp. nov. is JKG1(T) (=DSM 26889(T)=JCM 19132(T)).

J	Fan, H; Hu, JM; He, DM				Fan Hui; Hu Jinming; He Daming			Trends in precipitation over the low latitude highlands of Yunnan, China	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						change trend; Trend-Free Pre-Whitening Mann-Kendall; daily precipitation; spatial pattern; low-latitude highlands	RAINY-SEASON; FREQUENCY; INTENSITY; EXTREMES; MONSOON	The precipitation regime of the low latitude highlands of Yunnan in Southwest China is subject to the interactions between the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon, and the influence of surface orography. An understanding of changes in its spatial and temporal patterns is urgently needed for climate change projection, hydrological impact modelling, and regional and downstream water resources management. Using daily precipitation records of the low latitude highlands over the last several decades (1950s-2007), a time series of precipitation indices, including annual precipitation, number of rainy days, mean annual precipitation intensity, the dates of the onset of the rainy season, degree and period of precipitation seasonal concentration, the highest 1-day, 3-day and 7-day precipitation, and precipitation amount and number of rainy days for precipitation above different intensities.(such as >= 10 mm, >= 25 mm and >= 50 mm of daily precipitation), was constructed. The Trend-Free Pre-Whitening Mann-Kendall trend test was then used to detect trends of the time series data. The results show that there is no significant trend in annual precipitation and strong seasonal differentiation of precipitation trends across the low latitude highlands. Springs and winters are getting wetter and summers are getting drier. Autumns are getting drier in the east and wetter in the west. As a consequence, the seasonality of precipitation is weakening slightly. The beginning of the rainy season and the period of the highest precipitation tend to be earlier. In the meantime, the low latitude highlands has also witnessed less rainy days, more intense precipitation, slightly longer. moderate and heavy precipitation events, and more frequent extreme precipitation events. Additionally, regional differentiation of precipitation trends is remarkable. These variations may be associated with weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and strengthening of the South Asian summer monsoon, as well as the "corridor-barrier" effects of special mountainous terrain. However, the physical mechanisms involved still need to be uncovered in the future.

We propose four empirical likelihood (EL)-based estimators for the regression parameters and the response mean. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under some general assumptions. To construct the confidence regions for the regression parameters as well as the response mean, we develop four EL ratio statistics, which are proven to have the (2) distribution asymptotically. Simulation studies and an artificial data set are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies. Empirical results show that the EL method behaves better than the normal approximation method and that the coverage probabilities and average lengths depend on the selection probability function.

J	Chen, JQ; Yin, XJ				Chen, Jinquan; Yin, Xijie			Stratified Communities of Methanogens in the Jiulong River Estuarine Sediments, Southern China	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Methanogen; Methanogenesis; Anaerobic methane oxidation; T-RFLP	SP NOV.; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; DIVERSITY; OXIDATION; SOILS	Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and produced mainly by methanogens. Few studies have specifically dealt so far with methanogens in estuarine environments. In this study, diversity and distribution of methanogens were investigated by clone library and T-RFLP analysis in a Jiulong River estuarine sediment core which contained clear sulfate-methane-transition zone. The majority of obtained sequences in clone libraries and T-RF peaks from T-RFLP analysis were assigned mainly to Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales/ANME. The fragments of Methanosarcinales/ANME were most dominant group (mean 51 %) and composed largely of ANME-2a. In addition, Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobiales accounted for 21 and 28 % of all fragments. Therefore, the presence of Methanomicrobiales, Methanosaeta and ANME-2a was indicative of acetoclastic methanogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and anaerobic methane oxidation in Jiulong River estuarine sediments. This study provided the important knowledge towards understanding methane cycling association of representative of methanogens involved in estuarine environments.

J.X. Zhou and Y.Q. Feng [Cubic one-regular graphs of order twice a square-free integer, Sci. China Ser.

In vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and resistance profile studies have suggested that DB-02 has very low cytotoxicity (CC50>1mM) to cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). It displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity against laboratory adapted strains and primary isolated strains including different subtypes and tropism strains (EC(50)s range from 2.40 to 41.8 nM). Studies on site-directed mutagenesis, genotypic resistance profiles revealed that V106A was the major resistance contributor for the compound. Molecular docking analysis showed that DB-02 located in the hydrophobic pocket with interactions of Lys101, Val106, Leu234, His235. DB-02 also showed non-antagonistic effects to four approved antiretroviral drugs. All studies indicated that DB-02 would be a potential NNRTI with low cytotoxicity and improved activity.

Their mesophase behavior was studied by polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and XRD. Depending on alkyl chain length and core length, a transition from hexagonal columnar to Pm (3) over barn-type cubic phases was observed. In the cubic phases, the molecules are organized as spherical objects. Remarkably, compounds with a longer core unit have a higher tendency to form these cubic phases, and their stability is strongly enhanced over those of the compounds with a shorter core, despite longer cores having a smaller cone angle and therefore being expected to disfavor the formation of spherical objects. There is a large difference in the number of molecules involved in the spherical aggregates formed by compounds with long and short cores. Whereas the aggregates in the cubic phases of the compounds with short rod units are small and could be regarded as micellar, the long-core compounds form much larger aggregates which are regarded as a kind of monolayer vesicular aggregate.

Phylogenetic analysis identified five major lineages, of which lineages MK-A and MK-B constrained to the Mekong River System, lineages RL and LX to the Red River System, and lineage SW to the Salween River System. The genetic distance and network analysis detected significant divergences among these lineages. Mismatch distribution analysis implied that the population of P. huangchuchieni underwent demographic stability and the lineage MK-B, sublineages MK-A1 and LX-1 underwent a recent population expansion. The divergence of the 5 major lineages was dated back to 0.73-1.57 MYA. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that P. opisthoptera was a paraphyletic group of P. huangchuchieni. The phylogenetic pattern of P. huangchuchieni was mostly associated with the drainage's structures and the geomorphological history of the Southwest Yunnan Plateau. Also the differentiation of the major lineages among the three drainages systems coincides with the Kunlun-Yellow River Movement (1.10-0.60 MYA). The genetic differentiation within river basins and recent demographical expansions that occurred in some lineages and sublineages are consistent with the palaeoclimatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Additionally, our results also suggest that the populations of P. huangchuchieni had keep long term large effective population sizes and demographic stability in the recent evolutionary history, which may be responsible for the high genetic diversity and incomplete lineages sorting of Poropuntius huangchuchieni.

We combined morphological and molecular analyses to explore phylogenetic relationships among all described species in the group. The phylogeny required the description of two new species, Cyrtodactylus phuocbinhensis sp. nov. and Cyrtodactylus taynguyenensis sp. nov. Further, the tree resolved two additional undescribed clades that may also be new species. The species C. bugiamapensis and C. ziegleri were found to require redefinition. Cyrtodactylus phuocbinhensis sp. nov. is characterized by a series of enlarged femoral scales separated from preanal scales while Cyrtodactylus taynguyenensis sp. nov. does not possess enlarged femoral scales. Both new species are distinguished from other congeners by a combination of the following characters: small subcaudal scales, not transversely enlarged; presence (C. phuocbinhensis sp. nov.) or absence (C. taynguyenensis sp. nov.) of enlarged femoral scales; number of preanal pores; and dorsal pattern. Genetic distances between described species and new species were 16.5% and 2.0% in COI and RPL35, respectively, for C. phuocbinhensis sp. nov., and these distances were 18.8% and 2.2% for C. taynguyenensis sp. nov., respectively.

Topography of the magnetic layer basement is studied through Curie isothermal surface using the power spectrum method. It is found that south Tarim Basin, Junggar Basin, and Turpan-Hami Basin have strong positive magnetic anomaly, whereas west Kunlun Mountain, Altun Mountain, Tianshan Mountain, and Altai Mountain have weak or negative anomaly. The magnetic anomaly well reflects the regional tectonic structure, i.e., three alternating mountains intervened by two basins. The magnetic anomaly on the ground surface in Tarim Basin is well corresponding to the mafic dykes. The decay of the magnetic anomaly with altitude indicates that Xinjiang is a large massif composed of several magnetic blocks with different sizes in different directions. The Curie surface presents a feature of being shallow under mountains whereas being deep under basins, roughly having an anti-mirror correspondence with the Moho depth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanocomposites of SnO2 NPs and CGR was synthesized and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Chitosan (CS) was used to immobilize AChE on SnO2 NPs-CGR-NF/GCE and to improve electronic transmission between AChE and SnO2 NPs-CGR-NF/GCE. NF was used as the protective membrane for the AChE biosensor. The SnO2 NPs-CGR-NF nanocomposites with excellent conductivity, catalysis and biocompatibility offered an extremely hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 131 mu M. The biosensor detected methyl parathion in the linear range from 10(-13) to 10(-10) M and from 10(-10) to 10(-8) M. The biosensor detected carbofuran in the linear range from 10(-12) to 10(-10) M and from 10(-10) to 10(-8) M. The detection limits of methyl parathion and carbofuran were 5 x 10(-14) M and 5 x 10(-13) M, respectively. The biosensor exhibited low applied potential, high sensitivity and acceptable stability, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of pesticides. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The computational prediction of the reactivity of two series of synthons was applied in the process of optimizing the reaction conditions, which relied on density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with concepts of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. and quantitative structure reactivity relationship (QSRR) presumptions. The combined results enabled the proposal of a pre-synthetic prediction of global reactivity. The fully consistent results of the synthetic experiments with the in silico evaluation confirmed the rationality, effectiveness, and practicability of the new strategy. Notably, the joint method is not limited to the laboratory, but has applications ranging from routine to industry. This approach is likely to yield numerous insights to accelerate HKA-related synthetic chemistry that can be extended to numerous heterocycles. It thus opens up a novel entry towards rapidly investigating the reactivity of novel synthons with unique properties, a further step towards exploiting cascade reactions by avoiding the futile waste of time and resources.

There are three myb genes in animals with three Myb-motif repeats, namely c-myb, A-myb, and B-myb. By contrast, plants possess an abundance of myb genes, the majority of which are of the type R2R3 (with two Myb-motifs). Few plant myb genes are of the type R1R2R3. Five new myb members in Euplotes were recently identified through degenerate polymerase chain reaction, which suggests that the myb gene is also a multi-member family in the unicellular protist kingdom as in other multi-cellular eukaryotes. The entire gene family further shows the presence of both R1R2R3- and R2R3-type myb. The phylogenic analysis provides concrete new evidence for the evolution of myb genes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fan, H				Fan, Hui			Land-cover mapping in the Nujiang Grand Canyon: integrating spectral, textural, and topographic data in a random forest classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY; COOCCURRENCE MATRIX; FEATURE-SELECTION; TM DATA; VEGETATION; TERRAIN; SEMIVARIOGRAM; EXTRACTION; VARIOGRAM	The integration of spectral, textural, and topographic information using a random forest classifier for land-cover mapping in the rugged Nujiang Grand Canyon was investigated in this study. Only a few land-cover categories were accurately discriminated using spectral information exclusively, with an overall accuracy of 0.56 and a kappa coefficient of 0.51. The inclusion of topographic information as additional bands provided higher overall accuracy (0.69) and kappa coefficient (0.65) than topographic correction (overall accuracy, 0.57-0.58; kappa coefficient range, 0.52-0.53), which failed to markedly improve classification accuracy. In contrast with the exclusive use of spectral bands, most of the included land-cover categories were correctly classified using textural features exclusively (overall accuracy, 0.67-0.88; kappa coefficient, 0.63-0.87). In particular, classification based on geostatistical features led to slightly more accurate results than did grey-level co-occurrence matrix parameters. The window size selected for texture calculation markedly affected the texture-based classification accuracy: larger window size yielded higher classification accuracy. However, no optimal window size exists. The inclusion of the topographic bands in the texture images led to an increase in the overall accuracy of 1.1-9.0%, and to an increase in the kappa coefficient of 0.0-10.9%. Thus, for the Nujiang Grand Canyon, topographic information was more important for the discrimination of some land-cover types than spectral and textural information. Among the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral bands, bands 6 and 4 were of greatest importance. The relative importance of textural features generally increased with window size, and a few textural features were of consistently high importance. Although a random forest classifier does not overfit, undertaking feature selection analysis prior to classification may still be valuable.

Variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, may contribute to climate adaptation by regulating thermogenesis and the use of bioenergy. However, studies looking for a relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and climate have obtained mixed results, leaving unresolved the role of mtDNA in climate adaptation. Since mtDNA content can regulate human bioenergy processes and is known to influence many physiological traits and diseases, it is possible that mtDNA content contributes to climate adaptation in human populations. Here, we analyze the distribution of mtDNA content among 27 Chinese ethnic populations residing across China and find a significant association between mtDNA content and climate, with northern populations having significantly higher mtDNA content than southern populations. Functional studies have shown that high mtDNA content correlates with an increase in the expression of energy metabolism enzymes, which may accelerate thermogenesis. This suggests that the significantly higher mtDNA content observed in northern populations may confer a selective advantage in adapting to colder northern climates	[Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia; Yang, Li-Qin; Kong, Qing-Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia; Yang, Li-Qin; Kong, Qing-Peng] KIZ CUHK Joint Lab Bioresources & Mol Res Common, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chang] Yunnan Univ, Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chang] Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Microbial Divers Southwest China, Minist Educ, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yao-Ting; Liu, Jia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China	Kong, QP (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.	kongqp@mail.kiz.ac.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81272309, 31123005]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCXZ-EW-J-23]	This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81272309, 31123005) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCXZ-EW-J-23).

This article investigates a homogeneity test of differences between two correlated proportions in stratified matched-pair studies. We propose three test procedures, including an asymptotic test, bootstrap test, and multiple comparison procedures, and determine sample size requirements for such tests in a stratified matched-pair study. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the three test procedures and the accuracy of our derived sample size formulas. Empirical results show that (1) the likelihood ratio statistic is robust, while the score statistic and the modified score statistic are conservative in some cases of our considered settings; (2) the likelihood ratio statistic and the score statistic with the bootstrap method and the MaxT procedure behave satisfactorily in the sense that their type I error rates are close to the pre-given significance level; and (3) the derived sample size formulas are rather accurate. A real example from a clinical laboratory study is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

However, information regarding the role of L-type Ca2+ channel under acidosis remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the role of L-type Ca2+ channel in acidosis induced neuronal death and subsequent pathogenesis events responsible for neuron degeneration. Here we report that preincubation of cells with nifedipine (5 mu M, 10 mu M), an inhibitor of L-type Ca2+ channel markedly reduced neuronal death induced by moderate extracellular acidosis (pH 6.5) on cultured hippocampus neurons. Furthermore, nifedipine decreased the hippocampus neuronal swelling, as well as the accumulation of Ca2+ and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by acidosis. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel would attenuate neuronal degeneration caused by toxic low pH exposure in rat hippocampus neuron.

J	Xu, J; Wang, Q				Xu, Jin; Wang, Qiao			Trade-off between adult body size and juvenile survival: an experimental test of parental effects in the Mediterranean flour moth	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						body size; Ephestia kuehniella; juvenile survival; parental effect	EPHESTIA-KUEHNIELLA ZELLER; LEPIDOPTERA-PYRALIDAE; SEXUAL SELECTION; HISTORY; FEMALE; FITNESS; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; MATE; FECUNDITY	The conflict between sexual and natural selections on phenotypic traits is a central concern of evolutionary biology. Body size is a key determinant of an animal's ecological and physiological properties, and one of the most important traits involved in mate choice. Selection for higher reproductive fitness may favour larger individuals, but that for survival may limit the increase of body size depending on the species and sex. Here, we used the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniellaZeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), as a model animal to investigate the possible trade-off between body size and survival. We show that heavier parents produced significantly heavier offspring than lighter ones, suggesting that body size may be a heritable trait in this species. The offspring produced by heavy parents had significantly lower survival rate than those by average and light parents. With the increase of body weight, males lost significantly and disproportionally more weight than females upon eclosion. However, the allometric sex-specific weight loss cannot explain the lower survival rate of heavier offspring because there was no significant difference in the survival rate between sexes across body weight spectrum. We suggest that the lower survival rate of heavier individuals may be attributed to conflicting selection forces that favour smaller size for higher survival because larger offspring usually need longer time to grow and undertake greater intraspecific competition for food and living space, resulting in higher cumulative mortality. The present study demonstrates a clear trade-off between body size and survival in E.kuehniella, suggesting that such counterbalancing selection stabilises body size increase.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Temperature; fibre; flax; Linum usitatissimum	NIGHT TEMPERATURE; ARABIDOPSIS; MORPHOLOGY; INTERNODE; RESPONSES; GROWTH	Three cultivars of fibre flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), Viking, Argos and Ariane, were used to study the effect on various agronomic traits of diurnal temperature ranges (DIF) and seasonal temperature patterns (STP) applied throughout the crop growth period. Diurnal temperature ranges were set at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C with the same daily mean temperature and accumulated growing degree days (GDDa), under a parabolic STP. Seasonal temperature patterns were set following parabolic, anti-parabolic and quasi-horizontal configurations with DIF set at 10 degrees C. The results showed that DIF or cultivar had a significant influence on the biomass, plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), length of technical stem (LTS), weight of technical stem (WTS), fibre weight (FW), fibre content (FC) and seed weight per pot (SWp). Seasonal temperature pattern also had a significant influence on these traits except for WTS and FW. Significant interactions were observed between DIF and cultivar, affecting all traits with the exception of FW, and between STP and cultivar, affecting biomass, PH, SD and WTS. Diurnal temperature range set at 10 degrees C was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS, WTS, and FW, while DIF set at 5 degrees C benefited FC and SWp. Among the different SIP configurations, anti-parabolic pattern was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS and FC, and the quasi-horizontal pattern best fit SWp. In conclusion, the combination of DIF set at 10 degrees C and anti-parabollic STP provided the most favorable temperature conditions for fibre flax growth, which is the situation with winter flax production in Yunnan, China.

Benth. Cells of this aerobic, cream yellow-coloured strain occurred singly, in pairs or in tetrads, were Gram-stain-positive and ovoid- to spherical-shaped. Strain YIM 67072(T) grew at 4-45 C, pH 5.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-7% (w/v) NaCI. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 67072(T) belonged to the genus Rothia. The isolate contained MK-7 as the major component of the quinone system. The peptidoglycan type was A3a. The polar lipid profile consisted predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0. The DNA G+C content was 53.2 mol%. However, strain YIM 67072(T) differed from its closest relatives Rothia nasimurium CCUG 35957(T) (98.5% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Rothia amarae JCM 11375T (97.6%) and Rothia terrae L-143(T) (97.3%) in many phenotypic characteristics. Moreover, the levels of DNA DNA relatedness between the novel isolate and the three above-mentioned type strains were 28.7 +/- 1.3%, 36.5 +/- 1.2%, 46.8 +/- 1.5 %, respectively. Based on comparative analysis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain YIM 67072(T) represents a novel species of the genus Rothia, for which the name Rothia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 67072(T) (=DSM 26247(T)=JCM 18541(T)).

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; ROSEOBACTER CLADE; IDENTIFICATION	A facultatively anaerobic, Gram-staining-negative, pale red-pigmented, non-motile, rod-shaped, moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain YIM J14(T), was isolated from a sediment sample from a salt mine in Yunnan, south-western China. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations of between 2% and 15% (w/v) and optimally with 5-9% NaCl. The optimum temperature and pH for growth of the strain were 28 degrees C and pH 7.5. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:1 omega 9c/10-methyl-C-16:0. The polar lipid profile was composed predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and one unknown phospholipid. Minor amounts of other lipids were also detectable. The genomic DNA G+C content was 47.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain YIM J14(T) was related to Gracilimonas tropica in the phylum Bacteroidetes. The level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain YIM J14(T) and Gracilimonas tropica CL-CB462(T) was 96.9%. A DNA-DNA hybridization experiment between strain YIM J14(T) and Gracilimonas tropica indicated levels of relatedness of 28%. Chemotaxonomic data supported the placement of strain YIM J14(T) in the genus Gracilimonas. DNA-DNA hybridization and biochemical and physiological characterization allowed strain YIM J14(T) to be differentiated from Gracilimonas tropica.

Cells of the strain were rod-shaped and colonies were light brown and circular. The strain grew in the presence of 0-3% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-1 %) and at pH 7.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.0) and 30-55 degrees C (optimum, 45 degrees C). The only quinone was Q-8 and the genomic DNA G + C content was 68.3 mol%. Major fatty acids (>10%) were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-11:0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unidentified aminophospholipid, three unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics as well as genotypic data, it is proposed that this strain should be classified as a representative of a novel genus and species, Rehaibacterium terrae gen. nov., sp. nov., in the family Xanthomonadaceae. The type strain is strain YIM 77974(T) (=DSM 25897(T)=CCTCC AB 2012062(T)).

Their taxonomic positions were determined by a polyphasic approach. Good growth of the two strains was observed at 28 degrees C and pH 7.0 with 0-2% NaCl on tryptic soy agar medium. Both strains formed round orange-red colonies, strain YIM M13028(T) had a rough surface, while YIM 121001(T) was smooth. Cellular fatty acids, whole-cell protein profiles and TLC analysis of their mycolic acids show significant differences from reference stains. Phenotypic characteristics and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of 16S rRNA gene, hsp65, rpoB and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences indicated that both strains YIM M13028(T) and YIM 121001(T) belong to the genus Mycobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization values revealed a low relatedness (<70%) of the two isolates with the type strains Mycobacterium neoaurum DSM 44074(T) and Mycobacterium hodleri DSM 44183(T). The low DNA DNA hybridization values (40.4 +/- 3.5 %) between strains YIM M13028(T) and YIM 121001(T) and phenotypic distinctiveness indicated that the two strains were representatives of different novel species of the genus Mycobacterium. The names proposed for these novel species are Mycobacterium sediminis sp. nov. and Mycobacterium arabiense sp. nov., and the type strains are YIM M13028(T) (=DSM 45643(T)=KCTC 19999(T)) and YIM 121001(T) (=DSM 45768(T)=JCM 18538(T)), respectively.

Both aerial and substrate mycelia were white and non-pigmented. Growth was observed at 4-40 C (optimum 28 C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum 7.0) and in 0-4% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0%). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain YIM 1205211 belongs to the genus Allokutzneria with the highest sequence similarity to Allokutzneria albata DSM 44149(T) (98.4%). However, the mean DNA DNA relatedness value between the two strains was below 70%. Chemotaxonomic characteristics supported the inclusion of strain YIM 1205211 in the genus Allokutzneria, with rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose and mannose as the whole-cell sugars, meso-thaminopimelic acid as the cell-wall diamino acid and MK-9(H-4) as the predominant menaquinone. On the basis of physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain YIM 1205211 is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Allokutzneria, for which the name Allokutzneria multivorans sp. nov. is proposed.

One hundred and thirty-six endophytes were isolated and screened for their biotransformational abilities. The results showed that five of the tested endophytes were able to transform these saponins. These five strains were identified based on their ITS or 16S rDNA sequences, which revealed that they belonged to the genera Fusarium, Nodulisporium, Brevundimonas, and Bacillus genera. Ten transformed products were isolated and identified, including a new compound 6-O-[-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)--D-glucopyranosyl]-20-O--D-glucopyranosyldammarane-3,6,12,20,24,25-hexaol (3), and nine known compounds, compound K (1), ginsenoside F2 (2), vinaginsenoside R13 (4), vinaginsenoside R22 (5), pseudo-ginsenoside RT4 (6), (20S)-protopanaxatriol (7), ginsenoside Rg1 (8), vinaginsenoside R15 (9), and (20S)-3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-6-O--D-glucopyranosylprotopanaxatriol (10).

(Aristolochiaceae), a unique edible aromatic plant consumed by the Nakhi (Naxi) people in Yunnan, China, was investigated using GC/MS analysis. In total, 95 components, representing more than 95% of the oil composition, were identified, and the main constituents found were (E)-dec-2-enal (52.0%), (E)-dodec-2-enal (6.8%), dodecanal (3.35%), heptanal (2.88%), and decanal (2.63%). The essential oil showed strong inhibitory activity (96% reduction) of the production of bacterial volatile sulfide compounds (VSC) by Klebsiella pneumoniae, an effect that was comparable with that of the reference compound citral (91% reduction). Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and the isolated major compound against eight bacterial and six fungal strains were evaluated. The essential oil showed significant antibacterial activity against Providencia stuartii and Escherichia coli, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 3.9 to 62.5g/ml. The oil also showed strong inhibitory activity against the fungal strains Trichophyton ajelloi, Trichophyton terrestre, Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, and Cryptococcus neoformans, with MIC values ranging from 3.9 to 31.25g/ml, while (E)-dec-2-enal presented a lower antifungal activity than the essential oil.

The two-dimensional wavelet transform method was employed to decompose ground magnetic anomalies and analyze combination of wavelet details and anomalies of approximation signal. The relationship between magnetic anomaly and geological structure was discussed. The results show that the distribution of crustal magnetic anomalies over the study area is considerably non-uniform. Relatively strong negative magnetic anomalies were distributed over Himalaya-Eastern syntaxis-Longmen mountains-Daba mountains, whereas positive magnetic anomaly is present over Sichuan Basin, with weaker magnetic anomalies over other regions. The eastern syntaxis had important impact on magnetic anomalies around. All crustal magnetic anomalies over eastern syntaxis and the surrounding regions were medium- and short-wavelength positive/negative ones superposed onto a negative or weak magnetic anomaly setting. These meso- and micro-scale magnetic anomalies were generated from magnetic materials in the upper and middle crust, with strikes basically consistent with geological structures. Along Jinshajiang-Honghe Fault Belt, there is a sharp weak magnetic anomaly belt. Longmenshan Fault Belt, Lijiang-Xiaojinhe Fault Belt and Honghe Fault Belt are transitional zones between strong and weak magnetic anomalies. The east-west magnetic anomalies in the central Tibetan Plateau exhibited arc shape in the dome of Eastern Syntaxis. The banded lumpy magnetic anomalies over the central Tibetan Plateau and Central Yunnan massif had the same decay rule.

The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscope (TEM), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis) and photo-luminescence emission spectrum (PL). The photocatalytic activity was investigated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under irradiation of fluorescent lamp. The results indicate that Ag and N co-doping can restrain the increase of grain size, broaden the absorption spectrum to visible light region, and inhibit the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of Ag-N-TiO2 in MB degradation is remarkable improved. The degradation rate of the sample with Ag:TiO2 = 0.05 at%, N:TiO2 = 18.50 wt% in 5 h is 93.44%, which is much higher than that of Degussa P25 (39.40%). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, little is known about the drivers of their evolution, including the possible association of uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) with the early divergence of the subfamily. We use complete sequence data of the mitochondrial DNA gene encoding the protein cytochrome b (Cytb) to hypothesize the phylogeny of 85 species belonging to 47 genera in the Cyprininae plus 6 species from the Leuciscinae. We employ 6 other species from Cypriniformes as outgroup taxa and estimate divergence times. Our results indicate that European Barbus sensu stricto lineage including Aulopyge shares a common ancestor with specialized and highly specialized schizothoracins and the genera Cyprinion and Scaphiodonichtys. The common ancestor appears to have originated in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) region about 19.4-17.8 Ma. Barbus sensu stricto lineage appears to have originated about 16.6-15.5 Ma. Small to medium sized African Barbus sensu lato appear to have had an Oriental origin about 19.1-15.3 Ma and are closely related to Asian Puntius. West Asian Carasobarbus lineage including large African Barbus sensu lato might have originated about 9.94 Ma, also in Oriental Realm and has a close relationship to Asian Neolissochilus and Tor. The large-sized Barbus sensu lato appear to have diverged from Carasobarbus about 7.7 Ma. Finally, the Cyprininae appear to have radiated rapidly into nine lineages and many sublineages from about 27.8 to 17.8 Ma, close to the time of the second-stage tectonic movements of the QTP. Our analyses provide evidence that the uplifting of the QTP drove early diversification of the Cyprininae. Our extensive sampling of species involving all of the important areas results in clear evolutionary scenario for the Cyprininae.

They mostly comprise large samples of isolated teeth, but there are also several partial or complete adult crania from Shihuiba and a single juvenile cranium from Yuanmou. Here we describe a new, relatively complete and largely undistorted juvenile cranium from the terminal Miocene locality of Shuitangba, also in Yunnan. It is only the second ape juvenile cranium recovered from the Miocene of Eurasia and it is provisionally assigned to the species present at Shihuiba, Lufengpithecus lufengensis. Lufengpithecus has most often been linked to the extant orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, but recent studies of the crania from Shihuiba and Yuanmou have demonstrated that this is unlikely. The new cranium reinforces the view that Lufengpithecus represents a distinct, late surviving lineage of large apes in the late Miocene of East Asia that does not appear to be closely affiliated with any extant ape lineage. It substantially increases knowledge of cranial morphology in Lufengpithecus and demonstrates that species of this genus represent a morphologically diverse radiation of apes, which is consistent with the dynamic tectonic and biotic milieu of southwestern China in the late Miocene.

In this paper, according to the cost b of each Steiner point and the different costs of some specific materials with the different lengths, we study two variants of the Steiner tree problem in the Euclidean plane as follows: (1) If a specific material to construct all edges in such a Steiner tree has its infinite length and the cost of per unit length of such a specific material used is c (1), the objective is to minimize the total cost of the Steiner points and such a specific material used to construct all edges in T, i.e., , where T is a Steiner tree constructed, k (1) is the number of Steiner points and w(e) is the length of part cut from such a specific material to construct edge e in T, and we call this version as the minimum-cost Steiner points and edges problem (MCSPE, for short). (2) If a specific material to construct all edges in such a Steiner tree has its finite length L (l a parts per thousand currency sign L) and the cost of per piece of such a specific material used is c (2), the objective is to minimize the total cost of the Steiner points and the pieces of such a specific material used to construct all edges in T, i.e., , where T is a Steiner tree constructed, k (2) is the number of Steiner points in T and k (3) is the number of pieces of such a specific material used, and we call this version as the minimum-cost Steiner points and pieces of specific material problem (MCSPPSM, for short). These two variants of the Steiner tree problem are NP-hard with some applications in VLSI design, WDM optical networks and wireless communications. In this paper, we first design an approximation algorithm with performance ratio 3 for the MCSPE problem, and then present two approximation algorithms with performance ratios 4 and 3.236 for the MCSPPSM problem, respectively.

A miniature hybrid microwave integrated circuit technique is used to reduce the size and parasitics of PDC. Only two zero bias GaAs beam lead detector diodes and capacitors are used in the PDC. The diodes can be biased at <3 mA due to zero bias characteristic so that power consumption is reduced. No broadband matching network is required because of high series resistance of the zero bias diodes. The linearization performance is evaluated using an RoF system without and with the PDC. It is shown that the PDC improves the input 1-dB compression power by 0.4-2.2 dB from 7 to 18 GHz; and spurious free dynamic ranges are improved by similar to 10 dB from 7 to 14 GHz and similar to 6 dB from 15 to 18 GHz, limited by fifth order nonlinear distortion.

J	Cao, J; Lu, RY; Hu, JM; Wang, H				Cao Jie; Lu Riyu; Hu Jinming; Wang Hai			Spring Indian Ocean-western Pacific SST contrast and the East Asian summer rainfall anomaly	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						sea surface temperature contrast; tropical Indian Ocean; tropical western Pacific; East Asian summer rainfall anomaly; predictor	EL-NINO; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MONSOON; TELECONNECTION; PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION; CLIMATE; IMPACT; CHINA	After studying the relationship between SST in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), tropical western Pacific (TWP), and tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) and East Asian summer rainfall (EASR), using data provided by NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD and the National Climate Center of China for the period 1979-2008, an index, SSTDI, was defined to describe the SST difference between the TIO and TWP. In comparison with the winter ENSO, the spring SST contrast between the TIO and TWP was found to be more significantly associated with summer rainfall in East Asia, especially along the EASR band and in Northeast China. This spring SST contrast can persist into summer, resulting in a more significant meridional teleconnection pattern of lower-tropospheric circulation anomalies over the western North Pacific and East Asia. These circulation anomalies are dynamically consistent with the summer rainfall anomaly along the EASR band. When the SSTDI is higher (lower) than normal, the EASR over the Yangtze River valley, Korea, and central and southern Japan is heavier (less) than normal. The present results suggest that this spring SST contrast can be used as a new and better predictor of EASR anomalies.

The results indicate that: (1) in representing drought/flood information for the Yangtze River valley, the MHCI can reflect composite features of precipitation and hydrological observations; (2) comprehensive analysis of the interannual phase difference of the precipitation and hydrological indices is important to recognize and predict annual drought/flood events along the valley; the hydrological index contributes more strongly to nonlinear and continuity features that indicate transition from long-term drought to flood conditions; (3) time series of the MHCI from 1960-2009 are very effective and sensitive in reflecting annual drought/flood characteristics, i.e. there is more rainfall or typical flooding in the valley when the MHCI is positive, and vice versa; and (4) verification of the MHCI indicates that there is significant correlation between precipitation and hydrologic responses in the valley during summer; the correlation coefficient was found to reach 0.82, exceeding the 0.001 significance level.

The isolate grew at 10-30 A degrees C, pH 6.0-9.0 and 0-8 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed highest similarity to Saccharopolyspora gloriosae YIM 60513(T) (96.8 %), and lower 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities (95.1-96.7 %) with the other species of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP), arabinose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, two unknown glycolipids, two unknown phospholipids and one polar lipid. MK-9(H-4) was the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. Mycolic acids were not detected. The genomic DNA G+C content was 69.1 mol%. These chemotaxonomic data, together with its morphological properties, were consistent with the assignment of strain YIM C01235(T) to the genus Saccharopolyspora. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed strain YIM C01235(T) to be differentiated phenotypically from all the recognized Saccharopolyspora species. On the basis of evidence from this polyphasic study, the novel species Saccharopolyspora cavernae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM C01235(T) (=DSM 45825(T) = CCTCC AA 2012022(T)).

All of the newly prepared compounds were screened for antimicrobial activities against four strains of bacteria (Gram-positive bacterial: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus; Gram-negative bacterial: Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one strain of fungi (Candida albicans). Among the synthesized compounds, 5-(dimethylamino)-8-(2,4,5-trichloro-isophthalonitrile) quinazolin-4(3H)-one (7k) exhibited significant activity towards Gram-positive bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial, and the fungi strains. The MIC (0.8-3.3 mu g/mL) and MBC (2.6-7.8 mu g/mL) for this compound were close to those of nofloxacin, chlorothalonil, and fluconazole, making it the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series.

Nickel hydroxide and nickel oxide compounds stimulated a large interest in industrial and technical applications, for example as the active materials in electrochemical cycling and as a photocatalyst to remove organic dyes. In this paper, the mainly research is focused on the preparation process and removal properties of azo dye pollutants from aqueous solutions using Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets or NiO nanosheets. The proposed research investigates the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets or NiO nanosheets that are important in understanding the structure, morphology and the photocatalytic performances. Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were synthesised by a simple chemical precipitation method using nickel chloride as precursors and ammonia as precipitating agent. The obtained Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets can be successfully converted to NiO nanosheets via calcination under appropriate conditions. Analytical methods, such as X-ray diffraction spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transformed infrared spectra, were employed to characterise the morphology and microstructure of the final products. The results reveal that Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were shape preserved transformed to NiO nanosheets at 250 degrees C for 24 h. The removal performances for azo dyes Congo red, methyl orange, methylene blue, rhodaming B using the as prepared and commercial samples from aqueous solutions were investigated respectively. The as synthesised Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is found to have high efficiency for the removal of Congo red pollutant as a result of their unique structures, make them to be promising candidates for wastewater treatment.

The experimentally observed products can be rationalized by the mechanism as: Cu++D-alanine -> eta(2) (NH2, C=O) complex -> C-alpha-COOH bond insertion -> O=C-OH bond insertion -> H migration from -NH2 to -OH -> [CH3CHNH-(H2O)Cu(CO)](+). Dissociations of the final intermediate in different forms produce the products corresponding to loss of H2O, CO and H2O + CO, respectively. Another product channel leading to elimination of HCOOH was also identified but it is energetically less favourable than the first one. By comparing the Cu+ + alanine reaction with previously studied Cu+ + phenylalanine reaction, it was concluded that different alpha-amino acids may share common reaction mechanisms for the same product channels. Different side chains change the reactivity but do not change the mechanisms significantly.

The urea anion H2NCONH- produced by the reaction of urea with OH-can react with two forms of formaldehyde, CH2O and CH2(OH)(2), via nucleophilic addition and S-N(2) mechanisms, respectively. The addition mechanism is energetically more favourable. The calculated potential energy barriers for the formations of mono-methylolureas (MMU), di-methylolureas (DMU) and tri-methylolureas (TMU) are close, suggesting that the -NH2 and -HN- groups have close reactivity toward formaldehyde or substitutions of methylol groups on urea do not significantly decrease the reactivity of the left reactive positions. Statistical factor may explain the observed lower reactivity of methylolureas than free urea. The steric hindrance is the main factor that rationalizes the absence of tetra-methylolurea in experiment.

The preserved frustules of diatom (Cocconeis placentula) cells, as biophotonic crystals, were thus employed as both hard templates and silicon resources to synthesize TiO2 photocatalyst. Characterizations by a combination of physicochemical techniques proved that the bio-inspired sample is TiO2-coated SiO2 with biogenic C self-doped in. It was found that the synthesized composites exhibited similar morphologies to the original diatom templates. In comparison with commercial Degussa P25 TiO2, the C-doped TiO2/SiO2 catalyst exhibited more light absorption in the visible region and higher photocatalytic efficiency for photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible light due to the biomorphic hierarchical structures, TiO2 coating and C-doping.

The middle reach of the Lancang-Mekong River, a typical region for cascading hydropower dam construction, was selected as a study area to explore the composition, biomass and biological integrity of phytoplankton assemblages before and after such construction. Sampling sites along the longitudinal gradient of this river were chosen to measure phytoplankton assemblages in 1988 (pristine state), 1997 (completion of the first dam), and 2011 (cascading dams). The results indicated that composition and abundance were greatly altered by the construction and operation of cascading dams. The phytoplankton assemblages were found to be sensitive indicators in the assessment of aquatic ecosystem health degradation associated with cascading dams. The phytoplankton index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) was developed as a comprehensive and quantitative index to assess the variation in biological integrity and aquatic ecosystem degradation before and after the construction of cascading dams. The effects of the cascading dams on the aquatic ecosystem were serious and more complex than the effects of a single dam. The ecological and longitudinal connectivity of the aquatic ecosystem and the natural diversity of aquatic habitats transitioned in several impoundment areas due to the influence of the cascading dams. Increasing abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in reservoir areas can lead to degradation of the aquatic ecosystem compared with natural riverine ecosystems. Cascading hydropower dams can cause cascades and accumulation effects on the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fish assemblages are sensitive indicators of environmental degradation and can be used to assess aquatic ecosystem health. This research compared the fish fauna at the Xiaowan hydropower dam located on the middle reaches of the Lancang-Mekong River at three time periods: in 2008 (before impoundment), 2010 (water storage) and 2011 (full operation). A modified fish index of biological integrity (modified F-IBI) was developed and it synthesized information on the taxonomic composition, trophic guilds, and tolerance levels of the fish and habitat diversity to quantitatively assess the condition of fish populations before and after damming. This index also was used to assess the longitudinal diversity of the fish fauna along the river channel and could assess the barrier effect associated with the dam. Jaccard's index of similarity was used as a feasible tool to assess fish diversity loss and biotic homogenization. The analysis clearly showed a homogenization of the fish communities after damming, and the reservoir impoundment region showed much more serious homogenization than the downstream region. The Xiaowan dam had an immediate and profound effect on the fish fauna in this region of the Lancang-Mekong River. A total of eight cascading dams are planned for development in this region, and, unless conservation mitigation efforts are considered, the results could be devastating on the native fish populations of middle reaches of the Lancang-Mekong River basin.

For the acidophiles, although the impacts of the carbon sources on the total microbial growth and nitrogen conversion in the medium were slight, the sulfite oxidation rate was obviously improved. The highest sulfite ion oxidation ratio in 48 h was up to 47.2 % as 258.08 mmol L-1 sodium acetate was added in the medium. For the neutrophiles, the two carbons promoted the total microbial growth, but only sodium acetate could enhance the nitrite consumption significantly. The best nitrite consumption rate in 48 h could reach to 86.7 % with 258.08 mmol L-1 sodium acetate. It provides valuable information for the development of biological SO2 and NO (x) simultaneous purification process.

R. CHINA; SP-NOV.; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; GEN. NOV.; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; ARCHAEAL ISOLATE; HALOCOCCUS-SALIFODINAE; HALOPHILIC BACTERIA; SALINITY GRADIENT; GENETIC DIVERSITY	While much is known about the microbial diversity in some hypersaline environments, little is known about those of salt mine tunnel soils. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic comparison of the archaeal and bacterial communities present in Yipinglang salt mine (YPL) and Qiaohou salt mine (QH) tunnels differing in salinity and salt composition using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Two hundred twenty-eight sequences for QH and 182 sequences for YPL were analyzed by amplified ribosomal DNA-restriction analysis. Libraries revealed 44 bacterial and 57 archaeal different operational taxonomic units belonging to at least 8 bacterial and 3 archaeal divisions, but not all divisions were observed in both salt mines. The bacterial community affiliated with the Bacteroidetes was the most abundant (60% of clones) in QH, while the community in YPL was dominated by -Proteobacteria (45% of clones). All archaeal clones from QH were affiliated with Halobacteriaceae. In contrast, in the YPL library, 49% of clones belonged to Halobacteriaceae, 31% of clones related to unclassified archaea, and 21% of clones belonged to Crenarchaeota. Bioinformatic analysis and comparisons showed that the clone libraries were significantly different between two salt mines.

All the compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480) using MTT assays. Most of these triazole derivatives have good anticancer activity. Among them, compound 35 showed the highest potency against all five cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 0.59 to 2.90 mu M, which is significantly more active than the drug etoposide currently in clinical use. Structure-activity relationship analysis reveals that the acyl substitution on the glucose residue, the length of oligoethylene glycol linker, and the 4'-demethylation of podophyllotoxin scaffold can significantly affect the potency of the anticancer activity. Most notably, derivatives with a perbutyrylated glucose residue show much higher activity than their counterparts with either a free glucose or a peracetylated glucose residue.

So far, genetic studies of Sjogren's syndrome have relied mostly on candidate gene approaches. To identify new genetic susceptibility loci for primary Sjogren's syndrome, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese. In the discovery stage, we analyzed 556,134 autosomal SNPs in 542 cases and 1,050 controls. We then validated promising associations in 2 replication stages comprising 1,303 cases and 2,727 controls. The combined analysis identified GTF2I at 7q11.23 (rs117026326: P-combined = 1.31 x 10(-53), combined odds ratio (ORcombined) = 2.20) as a new susceptibility locus for primary Sjogren's syndrome. Our analysis also confirmed previously reported associations in Europeans in the regions of STAT4, TNFAIP3 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Fine mapping of the region around GTF2I showed that rs117026326 in GTF2I had the most significant association, with associated SNPs extending from GTF2I to GTF2IRD1-GTF2I.

Comparing small and large hydropower projects regarding their environmental implications and socio-economic consequences	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Hydropower development; Large dams; Small hydropower hubs; Power transmission; Yunnan/China	IMPACTS; HYDROPOLITICS; PROVINCE; RIVER	The PR China has been very fast developing its energy sector in order to sustain its impressive economic growth. China's installed hydropower capacity is not only the highest in the world; it also shows a globally unique dimension in growth and dynamic. The southwestern province of Yunnan has one of the highest hydropower potentials within China. Its development makes the province one of the key suppliers of electric energy in China, supplying the economic and energy hungry load centers of coastal China but also Southeast Asia. In a decade Yunnan will have an installed hydropower capacity that exceeds that of Canada or the United States. The province is therefore often referred to as China's forthcoming (hydro-) powerhouse or as Asia's battery. Yunnan's rapid development is mainly based on large and prestigious hydropower projects along major rivers, often forming large reservoirs. Secondly it rests on centers of small hydropower development. They are based on small (sub-)catchments where SHP stations mostly form cascades of diversion type projects affecting entire watersheds. Both developments are creating hydroscapes. While Yunnan's large scale hydropower development is relatively well studied, there is an obvious research gap on Yunnan's small hydropower sector. But the latter has not only a huge relevance it also causes serious tangible cumulative implications. This rapid expansion of Yunnan's hydropower sector takes place in one of the most biologically, geographically and ethnically diverse regions in China. This creates a large need for careful management in order, to avoid potentially significant environmental and social conflicts. Therefore the article shows the current status of Yunnan's ambitious hydropower development program including its political frame. It critically analyses the environmental and socio-economic consequences of both large and small hydropower projects. It further describes the transboundary implications and the relevance of the power grid. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

[Appl. Phys. Lett. 101, 151901 ( 2012)]. But it is rather difficult to implement in practice, for the required material parameters vary with radius and even have singular values. To accelerate its practical realization but still keep good performance of invisibility, a simplified innovative cloak with only spatially varying axial parameter is developed via choosing appropriate transformation function. The advantage of such a cloak is that both radial and azimuthal parameters are constants, and all three components are nonsingular and finite. Full-wave simulation confirms the perfect cloaking effect of the cloak. Besides, the influences of metamaterials loss and parameter deviation on the performance of cloak are also investigated. This work provides a simple and feasible solution to push metamaterial-assisted innovative cloak more closely to the practice.

We studied 26 hot springs inYunnan, China, in order to determine whether temperature or other factors control the distribution of GDGTs in these environments. The hot springs ranged in temperature from 39.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and in pH from 2.35 to 9.11. Water chemistry including nitrogen-, sulfur-, and iron species was also determined. Lipids from the samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Distributions of GDGTs in these hot springs were examined using cluster analysis, which resulted in two major groups. Group 1 was characterized by the lack of dominance of any individual GDGTs, while Group 2 was defined by the dominance of GDGT-0 or thaumarchaeol. Temperature was the main control on GDGT distribution in Group 1, whereas pH played an important role in the distribution of GDGTs in Group 2. However, no correlations were found between the distribution of GDGTs and any of the nitrogen-, sulfur-, or iron species. Results of this study indicate the dominance of temperature or pH control on archaeal lipid distribution, which can be better evaluated in the context of lipid classification.

Phosphorus removal by ferrous salt is one of the common methods for phosphorus removal from wastewater. The effects of Fe(II)/P ratio and pH were investigated and new concepts of "balance reaction" and "unbalance reaction" were proposed to reveal their mechanisms. The results showed that the Fe(II)/P ratio had a significant influence on phosphorus removal by ferrous salt with optimal ratio of 2.25. A relationship between residual phosphorus concentration and total Fe(II)/P ratio was established to predict the dose of ferrous salt. pH also had a significant influence on phosphorus removal by ferrous salt with optimal range of 7.0-8.0, and it was found to be the key factor to regulate the competition between Fe-3(PO4)(2) precipitation and Fe(OH)(2) precipitation. The process of phosphorus removal by ferrous salt was an unbalance reaction. And it was ascribed partly to the requirement for a higher residual Fe(II) concentration to get a lower concentration of residual phosphorus in the solution, and partly to the competition between Fe-3(PO4)(2) precipitation and Fe(OH)(2) precipitation.

In 8 dogs, oocysts, 9-14 pm in size, were found. Their morphology was similar to those of Hammondia heydorni and Neospora caninum. Sporulated HammondialNeospora-like oocysts were fed to 2 dogs, 2 gerbils, 2 guinea pigs, and 2 KM mice; tissues from these inoculated animals were then fed to coccidia-free dogs to determine species susceptibility to these oocysts. Oocysts were not excreted in the feces of dogs or rodents inoculated with oocysts. However, the dogs fed the tissues of gerbils or guinea pigs that were inoculated orally with oocysts excreted fresh oocysts. Dogs fed tissues from guinea pigs inoculated with brain and muscular homogenate from guinea pigs that were fed sporulated HammondialNeospora-like oocysts did not excrete oocysts. These findings indicated that the oocysts from naturally infected dogs had an obligatory 2-host life cycle, with gerbils and guinea pigs as intermediate hosts. DNA isolated from these oocysts could not be amplified using N. caninum- and Toxoplasma gondii-specific primers. However, positive amplification with the H. heydorni-specific primers confirmed the presence of H. heydorni DNA in the samples. A comparison of the intron 1 sequence of the alpha tubulin gene with those from H. heydorni from dogs and H. triffittae from foxes showed that dog-derived oocysts possessed a different alpha tubulin gene. Both our dog-derived sequence and 2 previous alpha tubulin gene sequences from H. triffittae from foxes contained a 9-bp insertion relative to 3 sequences of H. heydorni from dogs. However, when the 9-bp insertion from H. triffittae sequences were compared, the 9-bp insertion in our dog-derived sequence had a nucleotide substitution. The present study, therefore, provides new evidence of genetic diversity among isolates from dogs. This is the first survey for H. heydorni in dogs from China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Chelicerate neural ground pattern in a Cambrian great appendage arthropod	NATURE			English	Article							BURGESS SHALE; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; VISUAL-SYSTEMS; LEANCHOILIA; BRAIN; EYES; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; SPIDER	Preservation of neural tissue in early Cambrian arthropods has recently been demonstrated(1), to a degree that segmental structures of the head can be associated with individual brain neuromeres. This association provides novel data for addressing long-standing controversies about the segmental identities of specialized head appendages in fossil taxa(2,3). Here we document neuroanatomy in the head and trunk of a 'great appendage' arthropod, Alalcomenaeus sp., from the Chengjiang biota, southwest China, providing the most complete neuroanatomical profile known from a Cambrian animal. Micro-computed tomography reveals a configuration of one optic neuropil separate from a protocerebrum contiguous with four head ganglia, succeeded by eight contiguous ganglia in an eleven-segment trunk. Arrangements of optic neuropils, the brain and ganglia correspond most closely to the nervous system of Chelicerata of all extant arthropods, supporting the assignment of 'great appendage' arthropods to the chelicerate total group(4,5). The position of the deutocerebral neuromere aligns with the insertion of the great appendage, indicating its deutocerebral innervation and corroborating a homology between the 'great appendage' and chelicera indicated by morphological similarities(4,6,7). Alalcomenaeus and Fuxianhuia protensa(1) demonstrate that the two main configurations of the brain observed in modern arthropods, those of Chelicerata and Mandibulata, respectively(8), had evolved by the early Cambrian.

The stem has vascular bundles that are encircled by a bi-layered sheath and has a ground tissue consisting of thicker-walled and thinner-walled parenchymatous cells and dispersed nests of sclerenchymatous cells. Two sclerenchymatous strands occur between neighboring stelar cycles, with this species lacking a peripheral sclerenchyma sheath and possessing a "chrysanthemum"-shaped sclerenchyma strands in the adaxial bay of the peripheral vascular bundles. Although distinct from other species, comparisons demonstrate a consistent organisation amongst contemporaneous species from South Cathaysia that have sclerenchymatous strands in the adaxial bay of the peripheral vascular bundles, vascular bundles and leaf traces surrounded by a vascular bundle sheath, and the middle part of the leaf trace is depressed inward after departing from the peripheral vascular bundle. These features are used to define the Panxianensis Group named after the most comprehensively known species, P. panxianensis. Species within the Panxianensis Group differ from other species from the Carboniferous and Permian floras of Euramerica, Gondwana and North Cathaysia that we place in the Blicklei Group that lack sclerenchymatous strands in the adaxial bay of the peripheral vascular bundles, lack vascular bundle sheaths, and the middle part of the leaf trace is arched outwards when they depart from the peripheral vascular bundles. Members of the Panxianensis Group appear to represent a relatively derived group that appears to be endemic to South Cathaysia, with these presumably evolving from members of the Blicklei Group in the Cisuralian or Guadalupian.

Animal Detection in Natural Images: Effects of Color and Image Database	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; RAPID VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING SPEED; TIME-COURSE; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; CONTEXT; CORTEX	The visual system has a remarkable ability to extract categorical information from complex natural scenes. In order to elucidate the role of low-level image features for the recognition of objects in natural scenes, we recorded saccadic eye movements and event-related potentials (ERPs) in two experiments, in which human subjects had to detect animals in previously unseen natural images. We used a new natural image database (ANID) that is free of some of the potential artifacts that have plagued the widely used COREL images. Color and grayscale images picked from the ANID and COREL databases were used. In all experiments, color images induced a greater N1 EEG component at earlier time points than grayscale images. We suggest that this influence of color in animal detection may be masked by later processes when measuring reation times. The ERP results of go/nogo and forced choice tasks were similar to those reported earlier. The non-animal stimuli induced bigger N1 than animal stimuli both in the COREL and ANID databases. This result indicates ultra-fast processing of animal images is possible irrespective of the particular database. With the ANID images, the difference between color and grayscale images is more pronounced than with the COREL images. The earlier use of the COREL images might have led to an underestimation of the contribution of color. Therefore, we conclude that the ANID image database is better suited for the investigation of the processing of natural scenes than other databases commonly used.

Different from the traditional design method, of which the transformation function must be known in advance, this method allows us to directly obtain material parameters of device without any knowledge of the corresponding transformation function. Moreover, to further remove the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of material parameters, layered device composed of only homogeneous and isotropic materials is presented based on effective medium theory. The validity of such a method and shrinking effect of designed device are confirmed by full-wave simulations.

Very lower concentration of iodide can induce an appreciable color change of silver TNPs solution from blue to yellow by fusing of silver TNPs to nanoparticles, as confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The principle of this colorimetric assay is not an ordinary colorimetry, but anew colorimetric strategy by finding the critical color in a color change process. With this strategy, 0.1 mu M of iodide can be recognized within 30 min by naked-eyes observation, and lower concentration of iodide down to 8.8 nM can be detected using a spectrophotometer. Furthermore, this high sensitive colorimetric assay has good accuracy, stability and reproducibility comparing with other ordinary colorimetry. We believe this new colorimetric method will open up a fresh insight of simple, rapid and reliable detection of iodide and can find its future application in the biochemical analysis or clinical diagnosis.

The ComP-ComA system, a conserved quorum sensing system in the genus Bacillus, functions in many physiological processes including competence development, lipopeptide antibiotic surfactin production, degradative enzyme production and even some unknown functions. Here we investigated the requirement of ComP-ComA system in B. nematocida B16 for its pathogenicity against nematodes. The Delta comP mutant displayed deficiencies in attracting and killing nematodes, due to the absence of attractive signal molecules and the decreased expressions of virulence factors, respectively. Contrarily, a complemented comP mutant at least partially resumed its pathogenicity. Our data from transcriptional analysis further confirmed that this signaling system directly or indirectly regulated the expressions of two major virulence proteases in the infection of B. nematocida B16. Bioinformatics analyses from comparative genomics also suggested that the potential target genes of transcription factor ComA were involved in the processes such as the synthesis of attractants, production of extracellular degradative enzymes and sortase, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, regulation of transcription factors, mobility, as well as transporters, most of which were different from a saprophytic relative B. subtilis 168. Therefore, our investigation firstly revealed that the participation and necessity of ComP-ComA signaling system in bacterial pathogenesis.

Majorana fermions in a periodically driven semiconductor-superconductor Heterostructure	EPL			English	Article							NON-ABELIAN STATISTICS; QUANTUM; STATES; SUPERCURRENT; REVERSAL	We propose a new approach to create Majorana fermions at the edge of a periodically driven semiconductor-superconductor Heterostructure. We calculate the quasi-energy spectrum of the periodically driven Heterostructure by using Floquet's theory. When the interaction between different Brillouin zones of quasi-energy is neglected, one Majorana fermion with zero quasi-energy can be created at each edge of the Heterostructure when the ratio of driven amplitude and driven frequency is larger than a minimum. Furthermore, Majorana fermions with nonzero quasi-energy emerge when the driven frequency is low and the interaction between different Brillouin zones of quasi-energy needs to be considered. We also discuss the experimental protocol of creating Majorana fermions in the periodically driven Heterostructure. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2013	[Wu, C. C.; Sun, J.; Huang, F. J.; Liu, W.

A special focus is put on three species, of which two have remained unresolved for their relationships to other Colocasiomyia species, and the other is a newly discovered species. The analysis results in a single, most parsimonious cladogram, in which a clade comprising the three focal species is recognized along with other clades recovered for the known species groups of Colocasiomyia. Based on this, a new species groupthe gigantea groupis established, including Colocasiomyia gigantea (Okada), C. rhaphidophoraeGao & Toda, n.sp. and C. scindapsaeFartyal & Toda, n.sp. These species of the gigantea group breed on inflorescences/infructescences of the subfamily Monsteroideae (Araceae) exceptionally among Colocasiomyia species, most of which use plants of the subfamily Aroideae as their hosts. Colocasiomyia gigantea uses Epipremnum pinnatum (L.) Engler, C. rhaphidophorae uses Rhaphidophora hookeriSchott and C. scindapsae uses Scindapsus coriaceusEngler as their hosts. The host plants of the gigantea group are epiphytes and differ in the structure of spadix and the fruiting process from those of the Aroideae. To understand how the species of the gigantea group adapt to properties of their host plants, their reproductive ecologymost intensively that of C. giganteais investigated. The lifecycle of C. gigantea is characterized by its relatively slow embryonic development (taking approximately 6 days), the very long duration of the full-grown first instar within the egg capsule (approximately three months) until dehiscence of host infructescence, and its relatively fast larval and pupal development (taking approximately 11 or 12 days). Some morphological adaptations and the reproductive strategy in terms of egg size vs. number' trade-off are discussed in relation to their reproductive habits and peculiar lifecycles.

The wavelet transform is applied to these time series in order to analyze the quasi-periodic characteristics. The results show that the time series of global seismic energy release contain three quasi-periodic components of 9-year, 19-year and 45-year. It is worth noting that the 45-year quasi-periodic component is most obvious. Combined with the physical background of the tidal force period, the correlations between long-periodic astronomical tidal forces and quasi cycles of seismic energy release are discussed. Quasi-periodic component related to the short-periodic astronomical tide is not found in the global seismic energy release.

Concentrations of 84 disinfectant and temperature have a strong acceleration effect. Both the anodic dissolution and cathodic reduction can be speeded up by 84 disinfectant. The corrosion rate increases with increasing temperature, but does not increase with increasing the concentration all the way; the maximum corrosion rate appears at 20 mL/L 84 disinfectant. The result of chemical experiments shows that Fe3+ ions are the dominant corrosion products dissolved in 84 disinfectant solutions due to the strong oxidation of 84 disinfectant. Atomic force microscopy indicates that protective film forms when concentration of 84 disinfectant is equal to 20 mL/L.

J	Wu, J; Guo, J; Zhao, DM				Wu, Jian; Guo, Jun; Zhao, Deming			Characteristics of aerosol transport and distribution in East Asia	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Aerosol; AOD; Transport; East Asia; GOCART model	OPTICAL DEPTH; GOCART MODEL; INTERCONTINENTAL TRANSPORT; AERONET MEASUREMENTS; DUST AEROSOLS; CHINA; EMISSIONS; RETRIEVAL; PARTICLES; POLLUTION	We used daily aerosol simulations for the period from 2001 to 2003 that were generated by the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model to characterize aerosol transport and distributions in East Asia. In comparison with the AERONET, MODIS, and visibility observations, the model can capture the main distribution features of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its temporal changes with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and 0.85, respectively. It was found that high AODs occur in Central China, the Sichuan basin, the Indo-China peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and the Bay of Bengal because of black carbon, organic matter, and sulfate, whereas in the Taklimakan desert and its adjacent regions, high AODs occur because of dust. The potential effects of the hygroscopicity of aerosol particles on the AOD were mainly observed in the Sichuan basin, the Bay of Bengal, the Indo-China peninsula, and Central and Southern China. The East Asian aerosol transport was distinctly affected by the flux divergence induced by aerosol advection (AFD) and by the flux divergence induced by wind divergence/convergence (WFD). For black carbon, organic matter, and sulfate, the effect of AFD was a factor of 2 or 3 larger than that of WFD in the divergence region, whereas AFD dropped to 70% of WFD in the convergence region. The high AOD of black carbon, organic matter, and sulfate over the Sichuan basin related to the circulation characteristics of convergence in low altitudes and divergence in high altitudes, which can collect aerosol from adjacent regions at altitudes below 300 hPa and cause them to diverge easterly at higher altitudes.

In the model, a part of the SNR shell transporting into ambient dense molecular clouds (MCs), and a shock with a relatively low Alfven Mach number can be produced. Relativistic protons are accelerated in the shock via the diffusive acceleration process; moreover, a break in the particle distribution is induced since the damping of Alfven waves when the shock transporting into partly ionized plasma. A spectrum of the accelerated protons in the shock can be obtained in the test-particle case, taking into account the effect of the ambient partly ionized plasma on the acceleration process. Furthermore, hadronic gamma-rays with a peak around several GeVs are reproduced as the protons inelastically colliding with the ambient matter of the crushed gas. The observed gamma-ray spectral distributions of the SNR IC 443 and W44 can be successfully reproduced using the static model in the test-particle scenario. It can be concluded that the observed gamma-rays can be explained in the diffusive shock case as the shock waves transporting into the dense MCs for the two remnants.

J	Pan, HL; Huang, JC; Wang, R; Ou, GQ				Pan, Huali; Huang, Jiangcheng; Wang, Ren; Ou, Guoqiang			Rainfall Threshold Calculation Method for Debris Flow Pre-Warning in Data-Poor Areas	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						rainfall threshold; debris flow; pre-warning; calculation method; data lack area		Debris flows are the one type of natural disaster that is most closely associated with human activities. Debris flows are characterized as being widely distributed and frequently activated. Rainfall is an important component of debris flows and is the most active factor when debris flows occur. Rainfall also determines the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the hazards. A reasonable rainfall threshold target is essential to ensuring the accuracy of debris flow pre-warning. Such a threshold is important for the study of the mechanisms of debris flow formation, predicting the characteristics of future activities and the design of prevention and engineering control measures. Most mountainous areas have little data regarding rainfall and hazards, especially in debris flow forming regions. Therefore, both the traditional demonstration method and frequency calculated method cannot satisfy the debris flow pre-warning requirements. This study presents the characteristics of pre-warning regions, included the rainfall, hydrologic and topographic conditions. An analogous area with abundant data and the same conditions as the pre-warning region was selected, and the rainfall threshold was calculated by proxy. This method resolved the problem of debris flow pre-warning in areas lacking data and provided a new approach for debris flow pre-warning in mountainous areas.

The combined molecular phylogeny of 20 lac insect populations was generated using elongation factor 1 alpha, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene loci. The 20 populations of lac insects clustered into four distinct clades supported by high bootstrap values in maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. Clade A at the base of the dendrogram comprises Kerria ruralis and two populations of Kerria lacca and is the branch with most primitive species. Clade B includes K. lacca, Kerria sindica and the three populations P, V and Z from India. They clustered with high bootstrap support and have evolved later than those in Clade A. The three unidentified populations P, V and Z exhibited a close relationship with K. lacca and are the same species. In Clade C, three populations of Kerria yunnanensis (Ym, Yj and Yl), population Ys from Thailand and population H from India clustered as a group, in which population H clustered with Ym with 100 % bootstrap in all three analysis methods. In Clade D, Kerria chinensis, Kerria pusana and three populations of K. yunnanensis clustered together with strong support, and are located in the upper branches of the dendrogram and are recently evolved taxa. The majority of populations from the Indian subcontinent clade are more closely related to outgroup taxa from the primitive family Pseudococcidae, as compared to the Eurasian populations. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the Indian subcontinent is the centre of original of lac insects which have translocated to the Eurasian Continent. Based on the theory of continental drift and existing fossil records, it is suggested that lac insect evolved from ancient scale insects during the late Cretaceous period when the Indian subcontinent drifted towards the Eurasian Continent. Changes in the global environment have impacted on the distribution and evolution of lac insects during the mid-Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. With increasing temperatures lac insects are likely to translocate to subtropical areas.

The aim is to understand more about the interaction between new technology practices (as mass customization enablers) and organization structure, and how culture affects them. We distributed a questionnaire and received 548 usable responses from MBA and Executive MBA alumni in China. This study found that the introduction of new technological practices can lead to decentralization, less specialization, less formalization and lower span of chief managers at the early stages of implementation. Following a U-shaped curve, the impact of new technological practices would reverse course. The Idealist perspective is supported at the prophase and the Marxist perspective is supported at the anaphase of implementation.

Iridium(IV) was extracted quantitatively with petroleum sulfoxide in xylene. Sodium hydroxide solution could be used as stripping agent. Extraction parameters of Ir(IV), including petroleum sulfoxide concentration, contact time of aqueous and organic phases, organic/aqueous (O/A) phase ratio, hydrochloric acid concentration and sodium hydroxide concentration of aqueous phase, were studied in detail. In order to find an optimum condition to separate iridium and rhodium, solvent extraction experiments were performed from chloride solution by using petroleum sulfoxide as an extractant. A new process for the extraction of iridium by petroleum sulfoxide was developed. Based on this process, Ir(IV) can be extracted from a mixed chloride solution containing a large amount of Rh(III) and less amount of Ir(IV).

Chain transfer constant of VBSC was determined to be around 0.3 by fitting the H-1-NMR monitored experimental results with a mathematic model. According to the theoretical analysis, the obtained poly(VBSC) and its copolymers were substantiated to have a grafting-like main chain with residual pendent sulfonyl chloride groups after consuming most of the vinyl groups. The copolymerization results of VBSC with styrene at varied feed ratios demonstrated that conversion of sulfonyl chloride groups was lower than that of the monomer, which was in agreement with the theoretical results. The glass transition temperature, number average molecular weight and distribution of those obtained polymers were primarily investigated. Comparing with other chain transfer monomers, VBSC has a chain transfer constant much closer to unity therefore a more branched polymer is expected. Additionally, the branched polystyrene with residual sulfonyl chloride groups is hopefully to be further used as ATRP macroinitiators or reactive intermediates to synthesize functional polymers with complex structure.

The rigid body limit equilibrium method has been widely used to analyze wedge stability. However, equilibrium equations are not completely satisfied in. this method because of unreasonable assumptions, which may result in false results. This paper presents plastic limit analysis method for rock wedge stability analysis without making extra assumptions based on the lower and upper bound limit theorem. In lower bound analysis, the statically admissible stress fields are constructed by using Mohr-Coulomb yield conditions, and the lower bound nonlinear programming models are established to calculate strength safety coefficient of wedge slopes. And in upper bound analysis, the kinematically admissible velocity fields are obtained by employing association flow rule and deformation compatibility conditions, the upper bound nonlinear programming models are established to calculate strength safety coefficient. Then, the optimization strategies of nonlinear mathematical programming problem are provided. The stabilities of two wedge slopes are analyzed by the presented methods. The comparisons among the analytical results of conventional method are carried out, and the validity of the methods is indicated.

These taxa were composed of 2 frequent genera (Botryosphaeria and Fusarium) and 14 infrequent groups such as Xylaria, Diaporthe, Rhizopus, Epicoccum, and Preussia, demonstrating that fungal endophytes in C. acuminata were highly abundant and diverse. Antimicrobial activity screening using filter-paper diffusion method showed that 47.6 % of the tested isolates had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. Screening of fungal endophyte-derived camptothecin analogues by TLC and LC-MS/MS3 demonstrated that a strain Botryosphaeria dothidea, X-4 could produce 9-methoxycamptothecin (9-MCPT) when cultured in Sabouraud's dextrose broth for 12 days under shake flask and bench-scale fermention conditions. This work showed that the fungal endophytes from C. acuminata could be an alternative source for the production of 9-MCPT and other natural antimicrobial compounds.

Microbes are thought to have key roles in the development of the special properties of post-fermented pu-erh tea (pu-erh shucha), a well-known traditional Chinese tea; however, little is known about the bacteria during the fermentation. In this work, the structure and dynamics of the bacterial community involved in the production of pu-erh shucha were investigated using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries constructed from samples collected on days zero (LD-0), 5 (LD-5), 10 (LD-10), 15 (LD-15) and 20 (LD-20) of the fermentation. A total of 747 sequences with individual clone library containing 115-174 sequences and 4-20 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. These OTUs were grouped into four phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) and further identified as members of 10 families, such as Alcaligenaceae, Bacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, etc. The dominant bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae in the raw material (LD-0) and in the initial stages of fermentation (LD-5 and LD-10), which changed to Bacillaceae at the last stages of fermentation (LD-15 and LD-20) at a temperature of 40-60 A degrees C. It is interesting that the dominant OTUs in libraries LD-15 and LD-20 were very closely related to Bacillus coagulans, which is a safe thermoduric probiotic. Together the bacterial diversity and dynamics during a fermentation of pu-erh shucha were demonstrated, and a worthy clue for artificial inoculation of B. coagulans to improve the health benefits of pu-erh shucha or produce probiotic pu-erh tea were provided.

The results show that HP and MP are both good inhibitors of corrosion of CRS in 1.0 mol.L-1 HCl solution. The adsorption of these inhibitors onto the CRS surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Inhibition efficiency increases with inhibitor concentration, and decreases with hydrochloric acid concentration. The thermodynamic parameters of adsorption (adsorption equilibrium constant (K) and adsorption free energy (Delta G(0))) and kinetic parameters of corrosion (apparent activation energy (E-a), pre-exponential factor (A), corrosion rate constant (k), and kinetic reaction constant (B)) are also calculated. Based on these parameters, the mechanism of inhibition is discussed. Potentiodynamic polarization curves show that HP and MP act as mixed-type inhibitors. EIS exhibit one capacitive loop, and the charge transfer resistance increases with inhibitor concentration. The results of quantum chemical calculations indicate that MP exhibits higher adsorptive ability than HP, which is in good agreement with the experimental data.

The fungus uses three-dimensional adhesive networks to capture nematodes and then penetrates into the worms through their cuticle. Here we examine the effects of fungal cell wall related proteins on morphogenesis and virulence of the fungi. We focused on the changes in its proteomic and transcriptional profiles during its transition from saprophytic to predatory phase. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics using the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method revealed an extended set of virulence related proteins, such as adhesins and serine proteases, on the cell wall of A. oligospora. Transcription analyses of their coding genes revealed an important set of candidate virulence factors. Our analyses also show that glycosyl hydrolases likely play important roles in trap formation of A. oligospora. The adhesins on the three-dimensional adhesive networks may have two functions: to enable the mycelia to stick to nematodes and to serve as important constituents of the extracellular matrix that harbors many secreted virulence related proteins. This study is the first to systematically identify cell wall related proteins that are important in the trap formation and infection of the fungus against nematode hosts.

However, the impact of tea plantations on the regional environment, including ecosystem services and disservices are unclear. In this study, we developed an assessment framework for determining the private economic benefits and environmental externalities (the algebraic sum of the regulating services and disservices) of tea plantations in China. Our results showed that tea plantations provided private economic benefits of 5,652 yuan ha(-1) year(-1) (7.6 yuan = 1 USD in 2007) for tea farmers, plus positive environmental externalities of 6,054 yuan ha(-1) year(-1) for the society. The environmental externalities were calculated as the sum of the value of four regulating services, including carbon sequestration (392 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)); soil retention (72 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)); soil fertility protection (3,189 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)) and water conservation (2,685 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)), and three disservices, including CO2 emission (-39 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)), N2O emission (-137 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)) and nonpoint source pollution (-108 yuan ha(-1) year(-1)). Before the private optimal level, the positive environmental externalities can be maintained by private economic benefits; if a social optimal level is required, subsidies from government are necessary.

By performing linear transformation along the orthogonal direction, two-dimensional and three-dimensional electromagnetic shrinking devices with anisotropic homogeneous material parameters are designed in this paper. Moreover, to further remove the limitation of material anisotropy, layered device composed of only homogenous and isotropic materials are presented based on effective medium theory. The effects of incident angle of the electromagnetic wave on the performance of the layered device are also investigated. The full-wave simulation confirms the good performance of proposed shrinking devices. This work expands the application of transformation electromagnetics, and represents an important progress towards the practical realization of shrinking device.

The degrees of visibility on sunny days were divided into four grades: poor grade (PG), normal grade (NG), good grade (GG), and excellent grade (EG), with probabilities of 10, 40, 40, and 10 %, respectively. The variations in the probabilities of the four grades were analyzed. The seasonal variation of the probabilities of the four grades indicated that the best air quality on sunny days was most likely to occur in the summer, followed by winter, and was least likely to occur in the spring. From 1960 to 1999, the overall patterns of the linear-trend coefficients for NG and GG were similar, while after 2000, there were large-scale decreases in the probabilities of PG and EG. The reduction in the probability of PG after 2000 may be attributed to air pollution control measures; however, the decreasing probability of EG after 2000 suggested that rapid development in China since 2000 made it difficult to attain excellent air quality.

In the present study, we explored how the elevation of the alpine treeline varies with slope exposure and the distinct influence of the summer monsoon in the Three Parallel Rivers region of SW China (Yunnan). We hypothesized that the treeline elevation will not vary distinctly with slope exposure, because tree canopies are coupled to atmospheric conditions rather than ground temperature. We extracted treeline positions from Landsat TM images, DEM (digital elevation model) data and climatic data from Worldclim to analyze the relationship between treeline position and climate. The results revealed no significant exposure effect. Treeline elevations were almost the same at different slope exposure in each of these north-south stretching mountain ranges. Counter to expectation, south-facing slopes showed a slightly lower position than the others, which may be caused either by greater monsoon exposure (cloud cover) or human disturbance. The mean growing season temperature at treeline showed the same pattern as was obtained globally in earlier assessments (6.7 A degrees C). However, the treeline elevation (as well as the isotherm position) increased from west (wet) to east (drier) along the summer monsoon route. Our results confirmed the theory that the treeline is strongly associated with atmospheric circulation and does not benefit from greater radiative warming on south-facing slopes during the growing season. The common treeline isotherm hypothesis matches with treeline position in this monsoon-driven climate regime.

We hypothesize that cultural practices and traditional sustainable forest resource uses provide niches for the species' regeneration that will complement infrequent natural disturbances, while the species' survival on remote mountain slopes where there are no humans depends on natural disturbances alone. Methods: We examined and analyzed various landscape contexts, community associations, age distributions, and regeneration patterns of Liriodendron chinense. Key results: Forest communities containing Liriodendron chinense were of three types: (1) village fengshui forests-mature forests dominated by Tertiary relict taxa Liriodendron, Toona, and Emmenopterys, protected for their supposed spiritual value; (2) young secondary forests near villages, dominated solely by Liriodendron; and (3) old secondary forest remnants on mountain slopes far from villages, dominated by Liriodendron with other Tertiary relicts of the genera Davidia and Sassafras. The age structure of Liriodendron indicated ample recruitment in the first two forest types, where the activities of local people have provided regeneration niches for the survival of this shade-intolerant pioneer species. On the remote mountain slopes that have never been converted to agriculture, Liriodendron has survived through regeneration made possible by natural disturbances. Conclusions: The traditional human land use, infl uenced by cultural values, has supplemented infrequent natural disturbances, providing regeneration niches for this and other Tertiary remnant species near villages in mountain valleys, while on uninhabited mountain slopes the species depends on natural disturbances to survive.

To test whether there are differences in patterns of genetic variability between wild and domestic pigs at immunity-related genes and to detect outlier loci putatively under selection that may underlie differences in immune responses, here we analyzed 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 19 immunity-related candidate genes on 11 autosomes in three pairs of wild boar and domestic pig populations from China, Iberian Peninsula, and Hungary. Our results showed no statistically significant differences in allele frequency and heterozygosity across SNPs between three pairs of wild and domestic populations. This observation was more likely due to the widespread and long-lasting gene flow between wild boars and domestic pigs across Eurasia. In addition, we detected eight coding SNPs from six genes as outliers being under selection consistently by three outlier tests (BayeScan2.1, FDIST2, and Arlequin3.5). Among four non-synonymous outlier SNPs, one from TLR4 gene was identified as being subject to positive (diversifying) selection and three each from CD36, IFNW1, and IL1B genes were suggested as under balancing selection. All of these four non-synonymous variants were predicted as being benign by PolyPhen-2. Our results were supported by other independent lines of evidence for positive selection or balancing selection acting on these four immune genes (CD36, IFNW1, IL1B, and TLR4). Our study showed an example applying a candidate gene approach to identify functionally important mutations (i.e., outlier loci) in wild and domestic pigs for subsequent functional experiments.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Medium scale anisotropy in the TeV cosmic ray flux observed by ARGO-YBJ	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GAMMA-RAYS; INTERSTELLAR; CALIBRATION; EMISSION; ORIGIN; REGION; RPCS	Measuring the anisotropy of the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays provides important information on the propagation mechanisms and the identification of their sources. In fact, the flux of cosmic rays is thought to be dependent on the arrival direction only due to the presence of nearby cosmic ray sources or particular magnetic-field structures. Recently, the observation of unexpected excesses at TeV energy down to an angular scale as narrow as similar to 10 degrees raised the possibility that the problem of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be addressed by studying the anisotropy. The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full-coverage extensive air showers array, sensitive to cosmic rays with the energy threshold of a few hundred GeV. Searching for small-size deviations from the isotropy, the ARGO-YBJ Collaboration explored the declination region delta similar to -20 degrees-80 degrees, making use of about 3.7 x 10(11) events collected from November 2007 to May 2012. In this paper, the detection of different significant (up to 13 standard deviations) medium-scale anisotropy regions in the arrival directions of cosmic rays is reported. The observation was performed with unprecedented detail. The relative excess intensity with respect to the isotropic flux extends up to 10(-3). The maximum excess occurs for proton energies of 10- 20 TeV, suggesting the presence of unknown features of the magnetic fields the charged cosmic rays propagate through, or some contribution of nearby sources never considered so far. The observation of new weaker few- degree excesses throughout the sky region 195 degrees <= R.A. <= 290 degrees is reported for the first time.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

ELEGANS; FOXO; INSULIN	The Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-16 transcription factor is critical for diverse biological processes, particularly longevity and stress resistance. Disruption of the DAF-2 signaling cascade promotes DAF-16 activation, and confers resistance to killing by pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. However, daf-16 mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to these bacteria as wild-type animals, suggesting that DAF-16 is not normally activated by these bacterial pathogens. In this report, we demonstrate that DAF-16 can be directly activated by fungal infection and wounding in wild-type animals, which is independent of the DAF-2 pathway. Fungal infection and wounding initiate the Gaq signaling cascade, leading to Ca2+ release. Ca2+ mediates the activation of BLI-3, a dual-oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS then activate DAF-16 through a Ste20-like kinase-1/CST-1. Our results indicate that DAF-16 in the epidermis is required for survival after fungal infection and wounding. Thus, the EGL-30-Ca2+-BLI-3-CST-1-DAF-16 signaling represents a previously unknown pathway to regulate epidermal damage response.

Alishewanella solinquinati sp nov., Isolated from Soil Contaminated with Textile Dyes	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							EMENDED DESCRIPTION; DNA HYBRIDIZATION	A novel Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacterial strain, KMK6(T), was isolated from soil contaminated with textile dyes from an industrial estate located at Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra, India, and its taxonomical position was established by using a polyphasic approach. The major cellular fatty acids included C-17:1 omega 8c, summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or iso-C-15:0 2-OH), C-17:0, C-16:0,C- and C-18:1 omega 7c. The DNA G+C content of strain KMK6(T) was 48.8 mol %. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed its placement in the genus Alishewanella, and exhibited sequence similarity levels of below 97 % to the type strains of validly published Alishewanella species. On the basis of genotypic and phenotypic evidence, strains KMK6(T) is considered to be a novel species of the genus Alishewanella, for which we propose that strain KMK6(T) (=NCIM 5295(T) =BCRC 17848(T)) is assigned to a novel species, Alishewanella solinquinati sp. nov.

We focus on communities affected by the Nuozhadu hydropower project, the largest existing hydropower project on the mainstream of the Upper Mekong River. Soil and meteorological data were collected from the Soil Spatial Database and the China Terrestrial Ecological Information Spatial Meteorology Database, while social and economic data were collected via field surveys. We have three major conclusions: (1) Communities will be relocated to a new climate and new elevation, moving from a north tropical climate zone under 700 m to a subtropical climate zone above 700 m. (2) Physiographic element changes due to relocation will reduce household economic income. After relocation, the annual family income of the Shidaimao group decreased by 62%; the annual family income of the other 5 study groups (Lasa, Hani, Nochangchangyi, Mengsa, and Dawazi) dropped by 65%. (3) Communities relocated across the study township are 61.1% less connected with their former relatives after relocation while family-to-family free labor exchange, a previous community norm, decreased by 91%. China's dam resettlement compensation system focuses on the loss of economic resources after relocation. However, this study finds that the physiographic elements of the relocation sites are an important driver of ensuring economic growth and stability after relocation. As a result, we recommend more attention be paid to physiographic continuity when designing relocation models.

The results indicate that: (1) the colored noise can induce coherence hi-resonance phenomenon. (2) there exist three peaks in the R-tau(0) (R is the reciprocal coefficient of variance, and tau(0) is the self-correlation time of the colored noise) curves. For the same noise intensity Q = 1, the Gaussian colored noise can induce calcium spikes but the white noise cannot do this. (3) the delay time can improve noise induced spikes regularity as to is small, and R has a significant minimum with increasing tau as tau(0) is large. (4) large values of zeta reduce noise induced spikes regularity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By virtue of the perturbation theory for small delay, analytical expressions for the mean velocity and effective diffusion coefficient are derived. There exists a critical absolute value of the bias, below and above which the delay, respectively, enhances and weakens the diffusion, for a fixed noise intensity. The effects of delay observed above are more pronounced for weaker noise. These results are further verified via direct numerical simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nonignorably missing mechanism is specified by an exponential tilting model. Several maximum EL estimators (MELEs) for the response mean functional are proposed under different scenarios. We systematically investigate asymptotic properties of the proposed MELEs for the response mean functional. With the use of auxiliary information, MELEs are statistically more efficient. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the response mean are constructed on the basis of the EL method and the normal approximation (NA) method. Simulation studies are presented to evaluate the finite sample performance of our proposed MELEs and CIs. A real earnings data from the New York Social Indicators Survey is used to illustrate our proposed EL method. Empirical results show that our proposed EL method is robust. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Decursin is a novel therapeutic that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) with putative anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activities. Thereby we utilized human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under conditions of excess glucose to explore dose-dependent responses of decursin on markers of migration, angiogenesis, and proliferation. Decursin dose-dependently inhibited tube formation, VEGFR-2 expression, along with relative metabolic activity and 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) activity in both cell lines. We then correlated our findings to the streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes. Following three months of decursin treatment VEGFR-2 expression was significantly inhibited. Our data would suggest that decursin may be a potent anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative agent targeting the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway, which significantly inhibits diabetic retinal neovascularization.

In this paper, we conducted phylogenetic analyses using two mitochondrial genes (12S and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear gene (c-mos) from thirteen specimens representing two species of Pseudoxenodon, together with 84 sequences of caenophidians and an outgroup sequence of Boa constrictor. Our study suggests that the Southeast Asian genus, Pseudoxenodon forms a robust genetic subclade within South American xenodontines, indicating that at least one lineage within this genus entered or returned to the Old World (OW) from the New World (NW) across the Beringian Land Bridge during the early Tertiary and the warm mid-Miocene. It also reveals the high intraspecific genomic variation within the populations of Pseudoxenodon macrops, indicating that species diversity of Pseudoxenodon in China is likely underestimated.

Fr. are among the most popular wild edible mushrooms in Yunnan province, southwestern China. However, almost nothing is known about their biology. This study investigated the diversity and population genetics of a R. virescens ally from Yunnan. A total of 210 samples were collected from 13 geographical locations throughout the main distribution range in Yunnan. The patterns of genetic variation within and among these geographic populations were analyzed using sequences from three nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA fragments. Analysis of the ITS sequences revealed that samples from Yunnan showed 3-6% sequence difference from R. virescens samples from North America and Europe and formed a distinct clade. Our multilocus population genetic analyses suggested frequent gene flow among geographic populations of the R. virescens ally in Yunnan. Interestingly, the nuclear and mitochondrial genes exhibited different levels of gene flow and recombination. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding speciation, reproduction and conservation of this important biological resource.

We showed that the kernel cake strongly inhibited plant seed germination and root growth and was highly toxic to carp fingerlings, even though phorbol esters were undetectable by HPLC. Therefore it must be detoxified before disposal to the environment. A mathematic model was established to estimate the general toxicity of the kernel cake by determining the survival time of carp fingerling. A new strain (Streptomyces fimicarius YUCM 310038) capable of degrading the total toxicity by more than 97% in a 9-day solid state fermentation was screened out from 578 strains including 198 known strains and 380 strains isolated from air and soil. The kernel cake fermented by YUCM 310038 was nontoxic to plants and carp fingerlings and significantly promoted tobacco plant growth, indicating its potential to transform the toxic kernel cake to bio-safe animal feed or organic fertilizer to remove the environmental concern and to reduce the cost of the Jatropha biodiesel industry. Microbial strain profile essential for the kernel cake detoxification was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NiO NPs-CGR-NF nanocomposites with excellent conductivity, catalysis and biocompatibility offered an extremely hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCI) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCI with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 135 mu M. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos in the linear range from 1.0 x 10(-13) to 1 x 10(-1) M and from 1.0 x 10(-1) to I x 10(-8) M with the detection limits 5 x 10(-14) M. The biosensor detected carbofuran in the linear range from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-1) M and from 1.0 x 10(-1) to 1 x 10(-8) M with the detection limit of 5 x 10(-13) M. The developed biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, stability and reproducibility, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A common conversion point stacking technique is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to get the time delays of the Ps, PpPs, PsPs + PpSs phases within grids of 10 km x 10 km. Finally, the crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio are calculated. The results show that the crustal thickness ranges from 28 to 40 km and the Poisson's ratio ranges from 0.28 to 0.36. There exist two mantle-uplifting sites each with a horizontal scale of about 30 km x 30 km, one in Mazhan-Tengchong-Maanshan and the other in Wuhe-Longjiang-Tuantian. The high Poisson's ratio is consistently located within these two sites. Recorded shocks with Ms > 2.0 reveal that most of the shocks are distributed around the two sites and few are located at the centers. The shocks, the geothermal distribution, and the crustal structure suggest that the magma is still active, and the two mantle-uplifting sites detected may be the positions of two magma chambers in the crust.

Discovering and representing inherent semantic associations between Web services has attracted much attention due to the wide applications of automatic service discovery and composition. In this paper, we look upon the operations in a WSDL document as service components. An analogy is made between service components and electrons, between Web service and charged body of electrons. First, we are to measure the semantic associations between service components based on the Coulomb force formula in the electrostatic force theory. For this purpose, by statistical computations on the historical logs of service invocations, we give a PageRank-based method for measuring the importance of a service component and define a distance measure between them. Then, by adopting the basic idea of evidence superposition, we give the method for measuring the semantic association between WSDL-described Web services based on those of concerned service components.

Cells of this strain occurred singly, in pairs or in tetrads. It grew at 10-45 degrees C, at pH 5.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-3% (w/v) NaCl. The DNA G+C content was 71.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 68236(T) belongs to the genus Blastococcus. However, it differed from its closest relatives, Blastococcus aggregatus DSM 4725(T), Blastococcus saxobsidens DSM 44509(T) and Blastococcus jejuensis DSM 19597(T) in many phenotypic characteristics. Moreover, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between the novel isolate and the three above-mentioned type strains were 49.0 +/- 1.6%, 46.1 +/- 3.2% and 39.8 +/- 1.5 %, respectively. Based on comparative analysis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain YIM 68236(T) represents a novel species of the genus Blastococcus, for which the name Blastococcus endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 68236(T) (=CCTCC AA 209045(T)=DSM 45413(T)=KCTC 19998(T)).

The prepared global AgNiCu15-5 powder was characterized by SEM and XRD. The results show that both the spray length (L) and the arc current (I) have great effects, while both the arc voltage (U) and the pressure of atomization gases (P) have less effects on the powder size in the range of 25 similar to 38 mu m. The optimal process parameters of the fine AgNiCu15-5 alloy powder preparation are given as follows: the spray length is 250 mm, the arc current is 100 A, the arc voltage is 32 V, and the pressure of atomization gases is 0.8 MPa. Under the optimized conditions the prepared AgNiCu15-5 powder possesses global particles with uniform size, more than 94% of which is less than 38 mu m.

Mean NO3--N removal efficiencies of 15.5 and 18.5% with mass removal rates of 1.01 g.m(-2).d(-1) and 1.16 g.m(-2).d(-1) for IVCW 1 (planted with Canna indica and Pontederia cordata) and 2 (planted with Typha orientalis and Arundo donax var. versicolor), respectively, were achieved. The removal rate constants as fitted by the first-order area-based model averaged 0.046 and 0.055 m.d(-1), respectively. Since NO3--N was the dominant nitrogen form in the effluent, denitrification was the limiting step in nitrogen removal despite of favorable pH and anaerobic conditions in the wetland beds. Low availability of carbon source, high HLR, and low temperature could be the probable influencing factors for the observed low NO3--N removal efficiencies. However, IVCW could be used to treat tail water for nitrate removal at a comparable high loading rate.

When symbolic sequences of maps are expressed as knots, it is easy to see that the knot of a renormalizable sequence is composed of a bunch of periodic flows. In this setting, the generation of renormalizable knots can be simply operated in geometry and explicitly calculated in algebra. In this paper we provide a universal form of renormalizable knots, which can be decomposed into a sequence of elementary templates; especially, it is independent of the traditional *-products of symbolic dynamics. We present some examples and list the elementary templates of period not bigger than 6.

Furthermore, by employing a singular manifold method based on Painleve truncation, variable separation solutions are obtained explicitly in terms of two arbitrary functions. The two arbitrary functions provide us a way to study some interesting localized structures. The choice of rational functions leads to the rogue wave structure of Boiti-Leon-Pempinelli equation. In addition, for the other choices, it is observed that two solitons may evolve into breather after interaction. Also, the interaction between two kink compactons is investigated.

In order to model decision makings in such interactive situations, this paper incorporates game theory into influence diagrams and presents a new approach, called game theory-based influence diagrams (GIDs). GIDs consider an extra factor, that of the choice of strategies made by other decision makers, to the list of determinants that influence the decision-making process of each decision maker, so that decision makers can make more rational decisions. As a result of integrating influence diagrams and game theory, GIDs benefit from the simplicity and efficiency of influence diagrams for modelling complex decision problems as well as the rationality and suitability of applying game theory for making decisions in dynamic interactive scenarios. This paper also introduces genetic algorithm-based methods to evaluate GIDs. Experimental studies have been performed for validation and evaluation.

Morphological study of specimens and living plants reveals that venation and glands/glandular hairs on laminae are the most important diagnostic characters for species identification. Twenty-two species are recognized, including seven species endemic to China. Fifty species names are newly reduced to synonyms. A key to species from China, description, and distribution map of each species are provided. Three species are treated as dubious species, and 22 species are treated as putative hybrids.

Since the first RGS protein was identified from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 30 RGS and RGS-like proteins have been characterized from several model fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans, Beauveria bassiana, Candida albicans, Fusarium verticillioides, Magnaporthe oryzae, and Metarhizium anisopliae. In this review, the partial biochemical properties and functional domains of RGS and RGS-like proteins were predicted and compared, and the roles of RGS and RGS-like proteins in different fungi were summarized. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationship among RGS and RGS-like proteins from various fungi was analyzed and discussed.

T. sinense occurred in unstable habitats by stream banks, on steep slopes, on scree slopes, or on roadsides near streams in narrow valleys, all places subject to frequent natural disturbances, whereas none were found on stable gentle slopes free of major disturbances at similar altitudes. Further, no established saplings of T. sinense were found in forests having high bamboo (Yushania crassicollis Yi) coverage in their understory. The size and age structure of T. sinense were multimodal. The reproduction of the tree was either by means of abundant minute wind-dispersed seeds or by resprouts in unstable habitats. These populations depended on disturbance or gap regeneration to survive. T. sinense, along with other tree life-forms including evergreen broad-leaved species and conifers, dominated in the forest canopy layer, even reaching the emergent layer in places. Results of the study provide insight into the ecological characteristics and survival mechanisms of this East Asian paleoendemic tree species. The study will provide a scientific basis for recommendations for the conservation of this species and for other Tertiary relict plants having similar regeneration dynamics.

Seasonal variation of the treatment performance and the critical environmental influencing factors was analyzed. Over a study period of 14 months, the system was able to achieve moderate nitrogen removals with mean removal efficiencies of 56.2% and 55.1%, mass removal rates of 762.1 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 819.7 mg m(-2) d(-1) for nitrate and TN, respectively, under a relatively low influent COD:N ratio of 1.67. Water temperature and DO concentration were the primary factors affecting nitrogen removal. The seasonal order of nitrogen removal efficiency was: summer > autumn > spring > winter. Predictive models with statistical confidence were developed for nitrogen removals employing on-line parameters as indicators. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little new information has come to light regarding the occurrence of archaeal accA genes in high-temperature ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the abundance and diversity of archaeal accA gene in hot springs in Yunnan Province, China, using DNA- and RNA-based phylogenetic analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that archaeal accA genes were present and expressed in the investigated Yunnan hot springs with a wide range of temperatures (66-96 A degrees C) and pH (4.3-9.0). The majority of the amplified archaeal accA gene sequences were affiliated with the ThAOA/HWCG III [thermophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)/hot water crenarchaeotic group III]. The archaeal accA gene abundance was very close to that of AOA amoA gene, encoding the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase. These data suggest that AOA in terrestrial hot springs might acquire energy from ammonia oxidation coupled with CO2 fixation using the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway.

Omega < 0). To obtain diffuse neutrinos and gamma-rays at TeV that originate in our Galaxy, we use the Monte Carlo method to generate a sample of young pulsars with ages less than 10(6) yr in our galaxy; the neutrinos and high-energy gamma-rays can be produced through a photomeson process with the interaction of energetic protons and soft X-ray photons (p + gamma -> Delta(+) -> n + pi(+)/p + pi(0)) for a single pulsar, and these X-ray photons come from the surface of the neutron star. The results suggest that the flux of diffuse neutrinos at TeV energies is lower than the background flux, indicating they are difficult to detect using current neutrino telescopes.

In order to elucidate its rate of spread, extensive field surveys were conducted during 2003-2011. Through 2011, B. correcta was found in areas below 1,500 m in altitude within the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region of southwestern China (21-28A degrees N latitude, 97-107A degrees E longitude). The northernmost site where B. correcta was found was in Miyi County (26.48A degrees N Latitude, 102.00A degrees E longitude, Alt. 1,060 m) in Sichuan province. Within the currently infested area of mainland China, B. correcta mainly occurred in low-altitude valleys and basins, and displayed a patchy distribution. The mountain chains tend to run south to north, forming a natural barrier to insect flight eastward and westward. Human-assisted transport of infested fruits was the likely factor by which B. correcta moved across mountain chains. The analysis indicated that high-altitude portions of the northern Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region may block B. correcta spread northward.

Cells of the strain were found to be rod-shaped and colonies were light beige and circular. The strain was found to grow in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) total salts (optimum, 0 %), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and 25-55 A degrees C (optimum, 45 A degrees C). The only quinone detected was Q-8 and the genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 66.9 mol%. The major fatty acids (> 10 %) were identified as iso-C-16:0 and iso-C-15:0. The phospholipids were found to consist of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, five unknown phospholipids and three aminophospholipids. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain YIM 77520(T) was found to form a cluster with Lysobacter thermophilus YIM 77875(T) and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to L. thermophilus YIM 77875(T) (96.0 %). These two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family 'Xanthomonadaceae'. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, as well as genotypic data, a new genus, Vulcaniibacterium gen. nov. is proposed with Vulcaniibacterium tengchongense sp. nov. as the type species. The type strain of V. tengchongense sp. nov. is strain YIM 77520(T) (=DSM 25623(T) = CCTCC AB 2011152(T)). Furthermore we propose that L. thermophilus Wei et al. 2012 is reclassified in the new genus as Vulcaniibacterium thermophilum comb. nov. (type strain YIM 77875(T) = CCTCC AB 2012064(T) = KCTC 32020(T)) based on polyphasic data.

The proposed approach was based on the generalized Hough transform (GHT) technique to match the projected contours of the standard 3D primitive with vertebral edges detected in biplanar radiographs. A deformation tolerant matching strategy was proposed to extend the GHT for an inexact contour matching. The system was implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Seventeen dry vertebral specimens were used to evaluate accuracy. Precision was tested by three operators on 181 vertebrae from radiographs of 15 patients. With GPU computing, the average estimation time was 10 s for a vertebra. Results showed that the 3D estimation error was less than 2.5 degrees with the mean value of 1.6 degrees. The intraoperator variability was within 1.6 degrees and the interoperator variability was within 2.2 degrees. These promising results indicate that the proposed system can help orthopedic surgeons measure the 3D vertebral rotation angles from two-dimensional radiographs for better assessment of scoliosis.

The chymase (CMA1) gene is important for Ang II generation. Therefore, the two genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH). Materials and Methods: Eleven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRCP gene and four tag SNPs and G-1903A (rs1800875) polymorphism in the CMA1 gene were genotyped in the Chinese Han population (n=1020) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results: In the PRCP gene, single site analyses indicated that the rs7104980 G allele was a susceptible factor for EH (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.43, p=0.3x10(-10)). The protective effect of Hap3 GAGCACTAACA was observed without carrying the susceptible rs7104908 G allele (OR=0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.81, p=0.3x10(-4)) by haplotype analyses. In the case of the CMA1 gene, no associations with EH were found through single site analyses. However, haplotype analyses showed that Hap16 TTTA significantly increased the risk of EH with OR=3.15 (p=0.0002) which may be driven by interaction with a nearby SNP combination. Conclusions: The present results indicated PRCP rs7104980 can be considered as a marker for EH and Hap3 GAGCACTAACA (PRCP) and Hap16 TTTA (CMA1) might be associated with EH in Chinese Han population.

The morphology and the microstructure of the as-prepared undoped and Ni-doped ZnO samples have been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectra, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis spectroscopy. The results revealed that the samples were one-dimensional nanorods. Ni-doped ZnO nanorods were crystalline hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal structure, and the Ni ion was in a 2 + charge state in the crystal lattice of ZnO. The absorption spectra presented the existence of special two-absorption-region (strong UV-light and weak visible-light at 550-800 nm). The performance of Ni-doped ZnO powders as efficient photocatalyst was further demonstrated in the degradation of Rhodamine B (RB) under UV-light irradiation. The Ni-doped ZnO powders show high photocatalytic activity during the degradation of RB under UV-light. It was found that an appropriate amount of Ni dopant can greatly increase photocatalytic activity and the sample with 10% Ni doping exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency.

Simple and augmented inverse probability-weighted estimating equations are used to obtain the estimators of the regression coefficients and baseline mean residual life function. The unknown non-missingness probability and some unknown conditional expectations are estimated by the kernel smoothing technique. We show that the simple inverse probability-weighted estimator with estimated non-missingness probability is more efficient than that with the true non-missingness probability, while the augmented inverse probability-weighted estimator with estimated non-missingness probability and that with the true non-missingness probability have the same efficiency. The asymptotic properties of all the proposed estimators are established. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator. At last, the proposed method is applied to the mouse leukaemia data.

Analytical methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the final products. The experimental results revealed that Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were shape-preserved transformed to NiO nanosheets at 250 degrees C for 24 h. Ni(OH)(2) and NiO nanosheets were directly functionalized as supercapacitor electrodes for potential energy storage applications, whose charge-discharge properties, electrochemical impedance spectra, cyclic voltammetry, and cycle performance were examined. The experimental results show that the single-crystalline NiO nanosheets are a promising candidate for the supercapacitor electrode. They exhibit a high specific capacitance, prompt charge/discharge rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their low diversity and disparity have been interpreted as indicative of a decline leading to their Cenomanian extinction. We describe the first post-Triassic ichthyosaur from the Middle East, Malawania anachronus gen. et sp. nov. from the Early Cretaceous of Iraq, and re-evaluate the evolutionary history of parvipelvian ichthyosaurs via phylogenetic and cladogenesis rate analyses. Malawania represents a basal grade in thunnosaurian evolution that arose during a major Late Triassic radiation event and was previously thought to have gone extinct during the Early Jurassic. Its pectoral morphology appears surprisingly archaic, retaining a forefin architecture similar to that of its Early Jurassic relatives. After the initial latest Triassic radiation of early thunnosaurians, two subsequent large radiations produced lineages with Cretaceous representatives, but the radiation events themselves are pre-Cretaceous. Cretaceous ichthyosaurs therefore include distantly related lineages, with contrasting evolutionary histories, and appear more diverse and disparate than previously supposed.

When the plate is coated on a metallic subwavelength disk array, it can result in new confined modes, hereby named 'disks scattering slab modes' (DSSMs). By use of a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system, we experimentally verify the existence of two types of DSSMs in terahertz range: one we refer to as highly confined disks scattering Fabry-Perot-like modes (DSFPMs) and the other as, weakly confined disks scattering radiation-like modes (DSRMs). Spectral characteristics of these confined modes are measured and numerically simulated. Particularly, based on the experimental results and a dipole-scattering model developed here, we show that the features of the DSFPMs can be tuned by changing the filling fraction of the disk array. We believe these results can make important contributions to the designs of new terahertz devices, including tunable absorbers and filters.

Highly efficient blue fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes with a high emitter/host ratio	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TRIPLET-TRIPLET ANNIHILATION; ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICES; OLED MATERIALS; THIN-FILMS; DISPLAYS; LAYER	Blue organic light emitting diodes are made based on 4,4'-bis(9-ethyl-3-carbazovinylene)-1,1'-biphenyl (BCzVBi) as a fluorescent emitter mixed with two charge transport hosts, 4,4'bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl and Bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium. It is found that the device efficiency increases as BCzVBi concentration increases. An extremely high 6.1% external quantum efficiency (EQE) with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate of (0.18, 0.31) is obtained when the BCzVBi concentration reaches 50wt.%, which is exceedingly high above a typical 1-2 wt.% concentration for typical fluorescent emitters. The 6.1% EQE is also much higher than the expected 3% value calculated using the prevailing theorem. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.	[He, S. J.; Wang, D. K.; Jiang, N.; Lu, Z.

Field trials in highly heavy-metal-contaminated soils were conducted to investigate the extraction efficiency of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn by S. androgynus. The yield of S. androgynus could reach 10.01 t ha(1), and the amount of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn extracted by the plant was 57.36, 218.57, 2078.11, and 19.64g ha(1), respectively. S. androgynus removed 0.35%, 0.01%, 0.03%, and 1.37% of the total soil Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in one growing season, respectively. By comparing the extracting capability and yield with some hyperaccumulators reported in the literature, S. androgynus was considered to be a highly effective plant to extract heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn). The plant should be useful for phytoextraction of soils contaminated by the heavy metals.

The impact of sublethal doses was measured at room temperature using different densities of the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. The results reveal that the field dose of paraquat caused 100% mortality in D. rapae. The percentage emergence of D. rapae decreased from 80.5% in the control group to 71.5% when treated with the lowest concentration of paraquat. Similarly, the life span of parasitoids that emerged from the mummy treated with paraquat also decreased significantly. Oviposition capability and ovipositor thrusting frequency of D. rapae also treated with sublethal dose paraquat decreased significantly along with a shortened patch residence time in the foraging area.

These strains, designated YIM D15(T) and YIM J21(T), were Gram-negative and moderately halophilic. The two strains required 6-10% NaCl (w/v; optimal) for growth. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM D15(T) and YIM 121(T) were 49.0 mol% and 48.4 mol%, respectively. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The polar lipid profiles of strains YIM D15(T) and YIM J21(T) were composed predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, three unknown polar lipids and one glycolipid. Minor amounts of other lipids were also detectable. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-17:1 omega 9C/10 methyl-C-16:0 and C-16:1 omega 7C/C-16:1 omega 6c. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that the two isolates formed a distinct clade with the genus Fodinibius (in the phylum Bacteroidetes) and were related to the species Fodinibius salinus, with sequence similarities of 91.9-92.4%. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains YIM D15(T) and YIM J21(T) were related to each other (97.3 % sequence similarity). The DNA DNA hybridization relatedness between the two isolates was 34%. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis, DNA DNA hybridization relatedness, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strains YIM D15(T) and YIM J21(T) should be classified as members of a novel genus and as two novel species, for which the names Aliifodinibius roseus gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain YIM D15(T)=ACCC 10715(T)=KCIC 23442(T)) and Aliifodinibius sediminis sp. nov. (type strain YIM.121(T)=ACCC 10714(T)=DSM 21194(T)) are proposed.

A spoof surface WGM sensor based on a textured PEC cylinder	EPL			English	Article							WHISPERING-GALLERY-MODE; RESONATOR	Based on the negative permittivity properties of a two-dimensional (2D) textured perfect electric conductor (PEC) cylinder, we design a spoof surface whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensor at microwave band. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor is much higher than that of the traditional dielectric sensor in the same geometry size. Importantly, we show that the physical origin for the improvement of sensitivity is the evanescent-wave amplification and local field enhancement effects. This may open up an avenue for designing metamaterial sensors with superior sensitivity. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2013	[Yang, J.

YIM 90494 was purified to homogeneity from a fermentation broth by ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The purified xylanase appeared as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. The xylanase had maximum activity at pH 7.5 and 55 A degrees C. The enzyme was stable over a broad pH range (pH 4.0-10.0) and showed good thermal stability when being incubated at 60 A degrees C for 2 h. Kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme had K (m) and V (max) values of 19.24 mg/mL and 6.1 mu mol/min/mg, respectively, using birch wood xylan as substrate. The inhibitory effects of various metal ions and chemical agents on the xylanase activity were investigated. It is greatly interesting to note that Ag+ ion and SDS, which strongly inhibited most xylanases reported previously increases the xylanase activity in this study. These characteristics suggest that the enzyme with new properties has considerable potential in industrial applications.

The techniques for phosphorus removal from wastewater and waterbodies have become a hot topic in the world. In this study, used brick was chosen as an experimental adsorbent for removing phosphorus from phosphate solution, and the effects of brick dosage, pH, temperature and vibration time on phosphorus adsorption characteristics were evaluated. Results showed that phosphorus could be effectively removed using brick powders, and the optimum brick dosages were 4, 9 and 35g/L in the presence of 5, 10 and 50mg/L of phosphorus concentrations, respectively. A significant linear correlation (R-2=0.9904) between phosphorus concentration and optimum brick dosage was observed. The optimum condition was determined to be: brick dosage 20g/L, phosphorus concentration 25mg/L, pH 5, temperature 25 degrees C and vibration time 2h.

The results indicate that the drain-source saturation current of SGOI p-MOSFET is almost more than twice that of conventional SOT p-MOSFET. The sub-threshold current of SGOI p-MOSFET is 1 similar to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of SOT p-MOSFET. Because Ge alloy mole fraction is an important parameter for the strained SiGe channel MOSFET, its effect on the electrical characteristics of the SGOI pMOSFET was studied in detail. With the increasing of Ge alloy mole fraction, the overall electrical properties of SGOI p-MOSFET were improved.

We measured the changes in the number, habitats, and roosting sites of wintering BNCs in Huize Nature Reserve, northeast Yunnan, China, based on remote sensing images from 1992 and 2006 and field data from 1991 to 2009. The wintering BNCs foraged collectively in muddy bottomlands and cultivated fields. The number of BNCs increased from 320 in 1991 to 738 in 2009, but their roosting sites decreased from 12 between 1990 and 1995 to 6 in 2009. Most BNCs, similar to what is described in other studies, spent nights in the wetlands; but some were forced to roost on dry hill slopes, an unusual roosting site for BNCs. From 1992 to 2006, cultivated fields increased from 17.35 to 34.45%, woodlands decreased from 40.89 to 35.80%, and shrublands decreased from 36.72 to 20.74%. Of the total usable food in BNC habitats, 65.8% was seeds and tubers-potato, turnips, and wild radish-found especially on the soils of muddy bottomlands and cultivated fields. We conclude that abundant food (especially potato residues) available near the surface of soils of traditionally cultivated fields benefits the survival of wintering BNCs and that the wintering BNCs are forced to choose new habitats for the nights when wetland habitats are degraded and human disturbance increases.

The results suggest that the existence of benzimidazole ring, and the substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-methoxyphenacyl group, were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. In particular, hybrid compound 60 was found to be the most potent derivatives against all of human tumor cell lines investigated, while compound 49 was found to be more selective against breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and myeloid liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721). Compound 60 can induce the G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Protected area zoning is an approach that can reduce conflict by partitioning the landscape into various land use units that are managed for different levels of human activity. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology that integrates a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Meili Snow Mountain National Park (MSMNP), Yunnan. A participatory process involving multiple stakeholders and technical experts was used to establish park management objectives: nature conservation; tourism and recreation; and, community development. To meet these three objectives, criteria and impact factors for each objective were identified and weighted through a participatory process, and a GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion. Three suitability maps of conservation, eco-tourism, and community development were generated. The three suitability maps were overlaid to generate a final combined suitability map, and five management zones (strict protected zone, ecosystem conservation zone, eco-tourism zone or buffer zone, park service zone, and traditional land use zone) were identified and mapped that corresponded to different protection and management strategies. Conservation targets (endangered species, alpine and forest ecosystems) and development zones were spatially segregated across the landscape, and the final zoning scheme was found to be acceptable by the various stakeholders.

However, relatively little is known about its patterns of genetic variation through its broad geographic and ecological contexts. In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation of 2 virulence-associated genes (PLS and PLC) and 4 housekeeping gene fragments (ITS, RPB1, RPB2, and beta-tubulin) among 80 P. lilacinus specimens collected from 7 locations in China. Various degrees of polymorphism and haplotype diversity were observed among the six gene fragments. However, no genetic differentiation was observed among the geographic populations, consistent with extensive gene flow among these geographic populations of P. lilacinus in China. Our analysis also suggested that clonal reproduction was the predominant mode of reproduction in natural populations of P. lilacinus.

We found that a strong surface dipole layer induced by the halogen, rather than a change in the electrochemical potential (that is, Fermi level) of the ITO, led to a dramatic increase in the work function. However, the work function for F-coated ITO was lower than that of Cl-coated ITO. This result contradicts the well-known fact that F is much more electronegative than Cl. Detailed computations reveal that both electronegativity and atomic size collectively contribute to the extraordinarily high work function of Cl-ITO. Additionally, the work function increases linearly with increasing surface halogen coverage for both systems, which was consistent with experimental data.

Separate interval estimations for parameters of the Pareto distribution have been well established in the literature. For a type-II right censored sample, Chen (Metrika 44:191-197, 1996) proposed a joint confidence region for the parameters. Wu (Comput Stat Data Anal 52:3779-3788, 2008) derived a joint confidence region for any type-II censored sample, but its computation is difficult. Both Wu's and Chen's results are simplified in this paper, and some errors are corrected. The methodology used in this article can be applied to other distributions, as long as the underlying distribution can be transformed to the standard exponential distribution in a simple way.

The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of its shape parameter is well known to be considerably biased, so that it has some modified versions. A new modified MLE of the shape for the gamma distribution is proposed in this paper, which is consistent, asymptotically normal and efficient. For finite-sample behavior, the new estimator improves the traditional MLE not only for reducing bias but also for gaining estimation efficiency significantly. In terms of estimation efficiency, it dominates other existing modified estimators.

J	Fu, YX				Fu, Yun-Xin			Statistical Methods for Analyzing Drosophila Germline Mutation Rates	GENETICS			English	Article							MOUSE	Most studies of mutation rates implicitly assume that they remain constant throughout development of the germline. However, researchers recently used a novel statistical framework to reveal that mutation rates differ dramatically during sperm development in Drosophila melanogaster. Here a general framework is described for the inference of germline mutation patterns, generated from either mutation screening experiments or DNA sequence polymorphism data, that enables analysis of more than two mutations per family. The inference is made more rigorous and flexible by providing a better approximation of the probabilities of patterns of mutations and an improved coalescent algorithm within a single host with realistic assumptions. The properties of the inference framework, both the estimation and the hypothesis testing, were investigated by simulation. The refined inference framework is shown to provide (1) nearly unbiased maximum-likelihood estimates of mutation rates and (2) robust hypothesis testing using the standard asymptotic distribution of the likelihood-ratio tests. It is readily applicable to data sets in which multiple mutations in the same family are common.

The genetic basis of such unique behaviors in dogs remains poorly understood. We found that genes within regions highly differentiated between outbred Chinese native dogs (CNs) and wolves show high bias for expression localized to brain tissues, particularly the prefrontal cortex, a specific region responsible for complex cognitive behaviors. In contrast, candidate genes showing high population differentiation between CNs and German Shepherd dogs (GSs) did not demonstrate significant expression bias. These observations indicate that these candidate genes highly expressed in the brain have rapidly evolved. This rapid evolution was probably driven by artificial selection during the primary transition from wolves to ancient dogs and was consistent with the evolution of dog-specific characteristics, such as behavior transformation, for thousands of years.

In addition, the remnant field at the surface is hemi-spherically asymmetric. Our earlier simulation results suggest that the Martian dynamo could be sub-critical near its end (the energy required to sustain a subcritical dynamo is less than that to excite the dynamo) and the generated field morphology is non-dipolar. We further the study to examine the characteristics of the magnetic field via Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the subcritical dynamo solutions with the Rayleigh number R (th) = 2480 (below the critical point for the onset of the Martian dynamo). Our results show that the magnetic field is dominantly equatorial dipolar. Reversals and excursions occur frequently, and the magnetic dipole moment does not vary monotonically in time.

The frontier orbital densities can explain the asynchronous character of the concerted transition structures. The first transition states and intermediates of the stepwise reactions were identified and the conformational rotations of the intermediates were investigated for their stability and possibility to form monocyclic adducts. All the stepwise activation energies were about 15-40 kJ/mol higher than the concerted pathways and the meta-adduct (sylvestene) of the endo concerted reaction with cis-dienophile had the lowest activation energy, similar to 47 kJ/mol, in all reaction systems. A novel synchronous transition state was also predicted which suggests an Interesting intramolecular rearrangement of the monoterpenoids. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of possible amplified magnetic field around the shock in SNRs, the Alfvenic effect on the particle distribution accelerated at shock will become important. Based on available evolution models of the amplified magnetic field, the source spectral slope (q(tp)(t)) in the test particle approximation of shock acceleration evolves with SNR's age and q(tp) approximate to 4.2-4.4 depending on assumed values of the maximum energy of the accelerated particles and types of SNRs.

When encountering nematodes, these fungi become carnivorous' and develop specialized trapping devices to attack their hosts for extracting nutrients, especially nitrogen source. Thus, nematode-trapping fungi are model organisms for understanding the molecular mechanism of the switch between saprobic and parasitic phases of pathogen life cycles. Arthrobotrys oligospora, one of the best-studied nematode-trapping fungi, mainly lives as a saprobe. In the presence of nematodes, A.oligospora enters the parasitic stage by forming adhesive reticulate traps to capture nematodes. In filamentous fungi, autophagy has been shown to be involved in morphogenesis and morphology. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is induced by nematodes during the early stage of trap formation in A.oligospora. Disruption of atg8 gene not only abolishes the nematode-induced autophagy, but also suppresses trap formation and reduces pathogenicity for nematodes. During the early stage of trap formation, the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis is upregulated and the transcriptional activity of GCN4 is induced in A.oligospora, suggesting that nematodes induce autophagy probably by triggering intracellular amino acid starvation. Autophagy is thus crucial for trap formation in A.oligospora during infection of nematodes.

However, there exist some stateful MKD protocols whose personal key assignments are based on two static group access structures called Dual Hash Chain (DHC) and Binary Hash Tree (BHT). We introduce two new types of group access structures called Dual Homomorphic One-way Function Chain (D-HOFC) and Top-Down Homomorphic One-way Function Tree (TD-HOFT). Both can be regarded as dynamic counterparts of DHC and BHT, respectively. Our research motivation is to investigate what benefits these two new dynamic structures will bring for MKD protocols compared with their static counterparts. Using D-HOFC, we propose a time-based MKD protocol that counters the rejoining member attack on a DHC-based protocol, and a stateful user-based MKD protocol that has a lower computational overhead for Group Controller (GC) than the DHC-based protocol. Using TD-HOFT, we design a stateful user-based MKD protocol that outperforms the original EKT protocol. Performance comparisons and experiment results show that our protocols based on dynamic structures have their own advantages compared with those based on the corresponding static counterparts.

Vegetation change can be quantified by landscape pattern indices (LPI). Landscape indices are routinely calculated using planar land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps, obtained by the projection of a non-flat landscape surface into a two-dimensional Cartesian space. Especially in mountainous areas, quantification on planar maps can lead to underestimation of vegetation and land cover changes. Hoechstetter et al. (2008) developed a method to compute LPIs in a surface structure by calculating landscape patch surface area and surface perimeter from digital elevation models (DEM). As yet there have been no applications of these surface landscape indices on land use/land cover and vegetation change quantification. The objectives of this study are to (1) choose a LPI method (surface metrics pattern analysis or common planimetric metrics pattern analysis) for vegetation change quantification; and (2) employ the selected surface LPI method to assess vegetation pattern change in two mountainous areas of the Lancang watershed, Yunnan Province, China. The results show that the surface approach to estimate changes of class area (CA), mean patch area (MPA), and mean Euclidean Near-Neighbor distance (MENN) may obtain more accurate results for quantifying vegetation change in steep mountain areas. Forest fragmentation increased significantly over time in the two different mountainous study areas. The patches of two land cover classes, (i) agricultural land and (ii) low density forest and tall shrubs, became more aggregated in the northern (temperate) study area. In the southern (tropical) study area, rubber plantations increased considerably in size and became more aggregated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But ungauged or poorly gauged conditions limit the study and understanding of hydrological regimes of these wetland types. This study selects an ungauged subalpine wetland - Napahai in Northwest Yunnan, China - as a case for developing a practical approach to revealing its storage-area relationship of open water. A Trimble R8 GNSS (Global Navigation Satellites Systems) RTK (Real-time Kinematic system) and sonar fathometer were used to survey fine-resolution elevation data and generate a digital elevation model of the Napahai Wetland. Forty-four Landsat images from 1987 to 2011 were collected, and the Normalized Difference Water Index was used to classify open water features in the area. The area of open water in Napahai was calculated for each phase. With these data and a developed conceptual model, the storage of open water for each phase was estimated using ArcGIS tools. Both storage and area of open water showed significant intra-annual and inter-annual variations. In the rainy season, the monthly change of average storage of open water in Napahai showed about 1-2 months lag behind mean monthly rainfall. The storage-area relationship of open water was well fit by a power function equation (R (2)a parts per thousand 0.91, n=44). This study indicates that if detailed elevations are available for similarly ungauged subalpine wetlands in Southwest China, researchers can use this practical approach to estimate multi-temporal areas and storages and reveal the storage-area relationship of open water in the wetlands. The study provided valuable information of this case wetland for optimizing its hydro-ecological managements and a new method to wetland researchers and managers for the hydrological study of similarly ungauged wetland complex.

The taxonomy of this group is unclear with some entities treated infraspecifically or as synonyms. Furthermore, the existence of diploids and tetraploids in this species complex is suggestive of reticulate evolution. In order to formulate a natural classification and to investigate the relationships in this complex, phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear sequence data and inference of ploidy level were used to assess the distinctiveness of putative taxonomic units and their relationships. The Asplenium normale complex was recovered as a monophyletic group comprising six principal chloroplast lineages. The results support the hypothesis that A. normale s.l. contains several species. Based on our inferences, we outline an improved species classification recognizing three diploid and four tetraploid entities. Incongruence of chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies was interpreted to be a result of recurrent reticulation events in the A. normale complex.

Eutrophication of these systems, however, has often resulted in a decline of submerged vegetation and a dominance of cyanobacteria, producing and releasing allelopathically active substances. Whether and how these allelochemicals affect submerged macrophytes is, however, largely unknown. We tested the effect of exudates and extracts of one of the most common cyanobacteria species, Micro cystis aeruginosa, on seed germination and seedling growth and photosynthesis of the submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus, a common species in Chinese shallow lakes. We found that: (1) low and high exudate concentrations significantly promoted or inhibited P. malaianus seed germination, respectively, while extracts had no effect; (2) low exudate and medium extract concentrations significantly increased, whereas high concentrations decreased the biomass of P. malaianus seedlings; (3) chlorophyll content and maximum quantum yield of PS II (F-v/F-m) of the seedlings were decreased by all levels of exudates; (4) of the various responses tested, seedling leaf F-v/F-m showed the greatest sensitivity to M. aeruginosa allelochemicals; (5) the allelopathic effects of M. aeruginosa exudates were stronger than those of extracts. Our results indicate that cyanobacteria exudates can allelopathically inhibit submerged macrophytes. The early growth of seedlings rather than seed germination seems to be a sensitive phase for the impact of cyanobacterial allelochemicals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Feng, Y; He, DM; Li, YG				Feng Yan; He Daming; Li Yungang			The key indicators of transboundary water apportionment based on international laws and cases	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						key indicator; transboundary water apportionment; international laws	ALLOCATION	Transboundary water, more competitive utilization and uncertain availability under the globalization trend, the issue of its apportionment which directly impacts national benefits of each riparian state is becoming one of the important topics in the world. Water is scarce in China, the most important upstream state in Asia, and this task has to be thought over in the coming future. Based on "International Freshwater Treaties Database" (1820-2007) by Oregon State University, and publications and reports on transboundary water utilization and management since 1999, 28 indicators of water apportionment adopted in 49 international treaties and cases in 1864-2002 are divided into 6 types, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the adopted indicators are analyzed in order to find the key indicator(s) of transboundary water apportionment. The major results include: the major adopted indicators, have significant differences among 5 regions/continents, the indicators at rank first and second place in the developed region (North America and Europe) according to the adopted times are "keeping minimum water flow" and "mean annual runoff", but in the developing region (Asia, Africa and South America), the ranking order of the above two indicators is reversed; the major adopted indicators in the watersheds with insufficient water are "mean annual runoff" and "keeping minimum water flow", the ones in the watersheds with sufficient water are "keeping minimum water flow" and "maximum water intake"; the international treaties signed from the first phase to the fourth phase, the developing process shows a progress of "fewer-increasing a lot-decreasing rapidly-equation basically", the regional distribution of the treaties shifts mainly from the developed region to the developing one, especially to Asia and Africa; the major adopted indicators shifts from "keeping minimum water flow" and "mean annual runoff" in 1864-1945, to "keeping minimum water flow" and "maximum water intake" in 1946-1971, then to "hydraulic facility operation" and "mean annual runoff" in 1972-1991, and finally to "keeping minimum water flow" and "mean annual runoff" in 1992-2002, the process shows similar a loop. Finally, the key indicator on transboundary water apportionment can be determined as "keeping minimum water flow".

In this letter, the gas-sensing property of a nitrogen doped ZnO powder was studied in detail in comparison with a nitrogen-free two-dimensional porous ZnO flake, which has been reported to possess a unique morphology favoring the gas-sensing performance. The nitrogen doped ZnO powders, which are several hundred nanometers in size, were fabricated in a flash by a solution combustion approach. The N/Zn atomic ratio was determined to be 0.04 by an elemental analysis. When compared with the nitrogen-free porous ZnO flakes, the nitrogen doped ZnO particles possessed more oxygen deficient species within the matrix of ZnO, and in turn exhibited a significantly improved gas-sensing property for detecting ethanol and acetone. The crystal defects arising from the nitrogen doping are thus argued to be more effective to improve the gas-sensing property of ZnO when compared with other efforts to control the particle size, surface area and the particulate morphology.

Hemichannels are hexameric proteins formed by connexins, pannexins, innexins and vinnexins. Innexin-hemichannels (innexons) exist in the lepidopteran cell surface, but their component innexins and functions have not been reported. Recent studies by others have demonstrated that hemichannels, connexons and pannexons from vertebrates serve as regulators of apoptosis via inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, the apoptogenic properties of innexons are demonstrated using two innexin cDNAs, Spli-inx2 and Spli-inx3, which were isolated from hemocytes of lepidopteran Spodoptera litura. Alignment analysis revealed that these two genes belong to a conserved innexin family, as they contain the insect signature YYQWV motif at the beginning of the second transmembrane domain. Immunofluorescence showed that two fusion proteins, Inx2-V5 and Inx3-V5, were localized predominantly in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and also nuclei. Ectopic expression in Sf9 cells and over-expression of Inx2 and Inx3 in Spli221 cells promoted apoptosis. In the Spli221 cells, apoptotic cells presented remarkable membrane blebbing. This study also showed that Sf9 and Spli221 cells undergo low level apoptosis under normal culture conditions, but not Hi5 cells. In Hi5 stable cell lines, biotinylation was used to isolate surface proteins and confirm Inx2 and Inx3 localization in the cell membrane and also further data showed that Hi5 cells may activate the PI3K signaling pathway via phosphorylating molecular Akt downstream. This result suggests that innexon-promoted apoptosis may be involving the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings will facilitate further examinations of the apoptotic regulation by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and comparative studies of innexons, connexons, pannexons, and vinnexons.

J	Xu, W; Cui, QH; Li, F; Liu, AZ				Xu, Wei; Cui, Qinghua; Li, Fei; Liu, Aizhong			Transcriptome-Wide Identification and Characterization of MicroRNAs from Castor Bean (Ricinus communis L.)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PLANT MICRORNAS; JATROPHA-CURCAS; EXPRESSION; TARGETS; MIRNAS; BIOGENESIS; PREDICTION; DIVERSITY; GENOMICS; MIRBASE	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and play essential roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes. Currently, little information on the transcriptome and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs is available in the model non-edible oilseed crop castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), one of the most important non-edible oilseed crops cultivated worldwide. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of conserved and novel miRNAs in many plant species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technologies to identify and characterize the miRNAs in castor bean. Results: Five small RNA libraries were constructed for deep sequencing from root tips, leaves, developing seeds (at the initial stage, seed1; and at the fast oil accumulation stage, seed2) and endosperms in castor bean. High-throughput sequencing generated a large number of sequence reads of small RNAs in this study. In total, 86 conserved miRNAs were identified, including 63 known and 23 newly identified. Sixteen miRNA isoform variants in length were found from the conserved miRNAs of castor bean. MiRNAs displayed diverse organ-specific expression levels among five libraries. Combined with criteria for miRNA annotation and a RT-PCR approach, 72 novel miRNAs and their potential precursors were annotated and 20 miRNAs newly identified were validated. In addition, new target candidates for miRNAs newly identified in this study were proposed. Conclusions: The current study presents the first high-throughput small RNA sequencing study performed in castor bean to identify its miRNA population. It characterizes and increases the number of miRNAs and their isoforms identified in castor bean. The miRNA expression analysis provides a foundation for understanding castor bean miRNA organ-specific expression patterns. The present study offers an expanded picture of miRNAs for castor bean and other members in the family Euphorbiaceae.

A structurally identical PTB7:PC70BM-based OSC having an indium tin oxide (ITO) front cathode was also made for comparison studies. The surface of AZO and ITO was modified with a 10nm thick solution-processed ZnO interlayer to facilitate the efficient electron extraction. This work yielded AZO-based OSCs with a promising power conversion efficiency of 6.15%, slightly lower than 6.57% of a control ITO-based OSC, however, a significant enhancement in the stability of AZO-based OSCs was observed under an ultraviolet (UV)-assisted acceleration aging test. The distinctive enhancement in the lifetime of AZO-based OSCs arises from the tailored absorption of AZO electrode in wavelength <380 nm, serving as a UV filter to inhibit an inevitable degradation in ITO-based OSCs caused by the UV exposure.

J	Li, Q; Pu, XY				Li, Qiang; Pu, Xiaoyun			Measurement of the refractive index of microquantity liquid filled in a capillary and a capillary wall without destruction	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							INTERFEROMETRY	A method for measuring the refractive index (RI) of a small volume of liquid and a capillary wall is presented in this paper. A transparent capillary filled with liquid is used as a cylindrical positive lens; subsequently, the focal length of the lens is derived through the base of paraxial approximation, which is recorded as a function of the RIs of the liquid and capillary wall. With the RI of a capillary wall known, the RI of the liquid can be obtained by measuring the focal length of the lens, which is characterized by a microquantity liquid, spatial resolution, and easy operation. The RI of the capillary wall can be calculated without ruining the capillary if the capillary is filled with a standard liquid (RI is known), the deviation of which is less than 0.003 RIU. The factors affecting accuracy of the measurement, for instance, the depth of a field (DOF) in a reading microscope system and the outer and inner diameters of a capillary are analyzed, while illustrating that the effective DOF plays an essential role in accurate measurement.

The extrinsic and intrinsic periodic information are introduced into the stochastic differential equations of the Heston model for stock price by focusing on the signal power amplification (SPA). We find that for both cases of extrinsic and intrinsic periodic information a phenomenon of reverse resonance emerges in the behaviors of SPA as a function of the system and external driving parameters. Moreover, in both cases, a phenomenon of double reverse resonance is observed in the behavior of SPA versus the amplitude of volatility fluctuations, by increasing the cross correlation between the noise sources in the Heston model.

Daily growth coefficient (DGC) steadily increased when the supplemental cholesterol was increased by up to 1.2%, but declined upon further addition. The total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in plasma generally increased when the supplemental cholesterol was increased by up to 1.2%. Thereafter, the TC level reached a plateau, the LDL-C level showed a marked decline, whereas the HDL-C level continued to increase. Dietary cholesterol supplementation generally increased the total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver; the total lipid and TAG levels in muscle; the TC, free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester and total bile acid levels in intestinal contents; and the triiodothyronine and Ca levels in plasma. However, significant differences were mainly observed with high levels of supplemental cholesterol (0.9-1.5 %). Low levels of supplemental cholesterol (0.3-0.9 %) decreased hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities, but high levels of supplemental cholesterol (1.5 %) increased hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities. These results suggest that rainbow trout fed SBM-based diets have a certain 'cholesterol-buffering capacity', which in turn suggests the possibility of the inhibition of exogenous cholesterol absorption and/or inadequate endogenous production of cholesterol in trout fed SBM-based diets. DGC increased steadily with increasing supplemental cholesterol level up to 1.2%, and the growth-promoting effects might be related to the alleviation of the negative effects caused by a soyabean diet and/or make up for the deficiency of endogenous cholesterol in rainbow trout.

The short-beam shear and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. Both raw and TiO2-coated CFs were utilized for their fabrication. The tensile strength of the composites, both with raw and TiO2-coated fibers, grew with increasing filler content. The tensile strength of the CF/BMI composites with treated fibers, at all mixing ratios, was found to be by 18% higher than that of the composites with untreated ones. The surface morphologies of fracture surfaces of the composites were recorded using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to gain information about the interfacial fiber-matrix adhesion in the composites.

The approach was based on vertebral contour matching for estimating vertebral orientations and locations. Vertebral primitives were initially positioned under constraint of the 3-D spine midline, which was estimated from manually identified control points. Vertebral orientations and locations were automatically adjusted by matching projections of 3-D primitives with vertebral edges on biplanar radiographs based on the generalized Hough transform technique with a deformation tolerant matching strategy. We used graphics processing unit to accelerate reconstruction. Accuracy and precision were evaluated using radiographs from 15 scoliotic patients and a spine model in 24 poses. On in vivo radiographs, accuracy was within 2.8 degrees for orientation and 2.4 mm for location; precision was within 2.3 degrees for orientation and 2.1 mm for location. Results were slightly better on model radiographs than on in vivo radiographs but without significance (p > 0.05). The duration for user intervention was less than 2 min, and the computation time was within 3 min. Results indicated the method's reliability. It is a promising tool to determine 3-D spinal geometry with acceptable user interaction.

However, little is known about the structure and function of chitinases in these fungi. In this study, 16 ORFs encoding putative chitinases, which all belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18, were identified from the Arthrobotrys oligospora genome. Bioinformatics analyses showed that these 16 putative chitinases differ in their functional domains, molecular weights and pI. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these A. oligospora chitinases into four clades: clades I, II, III and IV, respectively, including an A. oligospora-specific subclade (Clade IV-B) that contained high-molecular weight chitinases (a parts per thousand yen100 kDa). Transcriptional analysis of A. oligospora chitinases suggested that the expression of most chitinases was repressed by carbon starvation, and all chitinases were up-regulated under nitrogen starvation. However, chitinase AO-190 was up-regulated under carbon and/or nitrogen starvation. Moreover, several chitinases (such as AO-59, AO-190 and AO-801) were up-regulated in the presence of chitinous substrates or a plant pathogenic fungus, indicating that they could play a role in biocontrol applications of A. oligospora. Our results provided a basis for further understanding the functions, diversities and evolutionary relationships between chitinase genes in nematode-trapping fungi.

The whole genomic DNA relatedness as shown by the DNA-DNA hybridization study between YIM C01117(T) and M. soli DSM 21800(T) had a low value (47 +/- A 2 %). Strain YIM C01117(T) was determined to contain LL-diaminopimelic acid with Gly, Glu and Ala amino acids (A3 gamma' type) in the cell wall. Whole-cell hydrolysates were found to contain glucose, galactose, mannose and ribose. The major polar lipids were determined to be phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant menaquinone system present is MK-9(H-4), while the major fatty acids were identified to be anteiso-C-15:0 (24.1 %), iso-C-16:0 (22.3 %) and iso-C-15:0 (11.4 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 65.9 mol%. The chemotaxonomic and genotypic data support the affiliation of the strain YIM C01117(T) to the genus Microlunatus. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allow strain YIM C01117(T) to be differentiated phenotypically from recognized Microlunatus species. Strain YIM C01117(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microlunatus, for which the name Microlunatus cavernae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM C01117(T) (= DSM 26248(T) = JCM 18536(T)).

The cells stained Gram-negative, were aerobic, pale-yellow, and non-motile short rods. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the closest relative of this organism was Paracoccus aminophilus KACC 12262(T) = JCM 7686(T) (97.4 % sequence similarity). Strain J6(T) grew at 10-37 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and with 0-5 % NaCl (optimum 3 %, w/v). The predominant cellular fatty acid found was summed feature 8(C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c; 82.8 %). The major respiratory quinone-detected was Q-10 and the DNA G+C content was 61.9 mol %. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and several unknown polar lipids. Strain J6(T) showed low DNA-DNA relatedness values with P. aminophilus KACC 12262(T) (28 +/- A 3 %). The phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, whole-cell fatty acid composition as well as biochemical characteristics allowed clear differentiation of the isolate from the other type strains of already described Paracoccus species. It is evident from the genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses that strain J6(T) should be classified as a novel species of the genus Paracoccus, for which the name P. zhejiangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is J6(T) (KACC 16703(T) = CCTCC AB 2012031(T)).

To get to know the composition and ecological roles of the archaeal communities within the sediments of the Pearl River Estuary, Southern China, the diversity and vertical distribution of active archaea in a sediment core were characterized by 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis of clone libraries derived from RNA. In this study, the archaeal diversity above, within, and beneath the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) in the Pearl River Estuary sediment core was described. The majority of the clones obtained from the metabolically active fraction of the archaeal community were most closely related to miscellaneous crenarchaeotal group and terrestrial miscellaneous euryarchaeotal group. Notably, although the Pearl River Estuary sediment belong to high methane and high organic carbon environment, sequences affiliated with methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea were detected as minor group in 16S rRNA clone libraries. No obvious evidence suggested that these unknown archaeal phylotypes related directly to anaerobic oxidation of methane in SMTZ. This is the first phylogenetic analysis of the metabolically active fraction of the archaeal community in the coastal sediment environments.

The colonization characteristics and diversity of dark septate endophytes (DSE) associated with plants growing in a lead and zinc slag heap with a more than 250-year history in southwestern China were assessed. A total of 117 plant samples belonging to 29 species and 19 families were examined, and 97% (28/29) were colonized by dark septate fungal hyphae or microsclerotia. DSE colonization intensity varied greatly across plant species and also across individuals of the same species, showing a hyphal colonization range of 0.035.7%. In total, 38 melanized root-associated fungi with various morphological characteristics were isolated and 82% (31/38) of fungi were closely related to well-known DSE fungi, such as Exophiala spp., Phialophora (= Cadophora) spp., Phialocephala spp., and Leptodontidium spp. Among these, Phialophora and Exophiala were the dominant genera. Our results showed that DSE dominantly colonized the roots of the pioneer plants growing in such an ancient Pb-Zn slag heap. By contributing to metal tolerance and nutrient acquisition, DSE may be integral to the function of metal mine ecosystems.

This paper considers the scour pit system as a black box, neglecting the energy consumed by inter-particle collision of debris flow and the collision between debris flow and the valley bed. A formula was developed for the ultimate depth of a scour pit using the energy method to establish debris flow energy changes in and out of scour pit, combined with the energy needed by sediment incipient. When the results of the formula are compared with a series of indoor flume experiments, the error ranged from 3.1% to 17.6%. The calculated and experimental values agreed well, indicating that the method based on the energy method is reasonable and feasible. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reaction mechanism is attributed to the replacement of the protons of the O-H groups by zinc ion at the binding site and production of fluorescence which is blocked in the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. Remarkable enhancement of up to 13-fold in fluorescence intensity with a 38 nm red-shift was achieved in the detection of zinc ion. Compound 1 was successfully applied to the fluorescence imaging of zinc ion, with a fluorescence emission color produced in the cell nucleus different from that produced in the cytoplasm, in A549, BEAS-2B, CHO, Hela, and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was carried out in CHO cells using 1 and zinc ion as the imaging agents, showing that the 1-Zn2+ agent is a nucleic acid selective stain, which could be applied in MN assays in different kinds of cell lines.

Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight in the sky, while cetaceans have returned to the aquatic environment and are specialized for swimming. Associated with these novel adaptations to their environment, various development changes have occurred to their body plans and associated structures. Given the importance of Hox genes in many aspects of embryonic development, we conducted an analysis of the coding regions of all Hox gene family members from bats (represented by Pteropus vampyrus, Pteropus alecto, Myotis lucifugus and Myotis davidii) and cetaceans (represented by Tursiops truncatus) for adaptive evolution using the available draft genome sequences. Differences in the selective pressures acting on many Hox genes in bats and cetaceans were found compared to other mammals. Positive selection, however, was not found to act on any of the Hox genes in the common ancestor of bats and only upon Hoxb9 in cetaceans. PCR amplification data from additional bat and cetacean species, and application of the branch-site test 2, showed that the Hoxb2 gene within bats had significant evidence of positive selection. Thus, our study, with genomic and newly sequenced Hox genes, identifies two candidate Hox genes that may be closely linked with developmental changes in bats and cetaceans, such as those associated with the pancreatic, neuronal, thymus shape and forelimb. In addition, the difference in our results from the genome-wide scan and newly sequenced data reveals that great care must be taken in interpreting results from draft genome data from a limited number of species, and deep genetic sampling of a particular clade is a powerful tool for generating complementary data to address this limitation.

The Pt NPs-CGR-NF nanocomposites with excellent conductivity, catalysis, and biocompatibility offered an extremely hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. Chitosan (CS) was used as cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on Pt-CGR-NF-modified GCE. NF was used as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensors. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 148 mu M. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion in the linear range from 1.0 x 10(-13) to 1 x 10(-10) M and from 1.0 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-8) M with a detection limit of 5 x 10(-14) M and detected carbofuran in the linear range from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-10) M and from 1.0 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-8) M with a detection limit of 5 x 10-13 M. The biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, acceptable stability, and reproducibility, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A bi-functional structure with tunable electrical and optical properties for organic photovoltaic cells	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							EXCITON-BLOCKING LAYERS; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; POLYMER SOLAR-CELLS; BUFFER LAYER; HETEROJUNCTION; EFFICIENCY; CATHODE; BATHOCUPROINE; C-60/LIF	We have successfully developed a C60:LiF/BCP (bathocuproine) bilayer-buffer structure to optimize both the light absorption enhancement and the exciton-blocking at the cathode interface of a small molecular photovoltaic cell based on the archetypical CuPc/C60 structure. The function of the C60:LiF layer is to serve as an optical spacer and is found to yield a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a 50 wt.% LiF at a thickness of 30 nm. A BCP layer is added between the optimized C60:LiF layer and the Al metal electrode to function as a barrier for excitons. This combined bilayer-buffer structure yields an optimal performance in short circuit current (Jsc) and PCE. A detailed study using a single carrier electron-only structure and a numerical simulation of optical electric-field distribution suggests that C60:LiF layer enhances light absorption at long wavelengths.

There have been limited reports about the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in equids around the world and little is known about the seroprevalence of T. gondii in equids in southwestern China, in particular in Yunnan Province. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in equids in this area. Methods: A total of 399 serum samples (266 from horses and 133 from donkeys) were collected in 2012, and assayed for T. gondii antibodies by Indirect Haemagglutination (IHA) test using a commercially available kit. Results: A total of 108 (27.1%) equids, including 81 (30.5%) horses and 27 (20.3%) donkeys were positive for T. gondii antibodies, and the seroprevalence ranged from 18.8% to 37.5% among different sampling areas. The seroprevalence was 27.4% and 26.8% for male and female equids, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The seroprevalence ranged from 21% to 32.9% among different age groups, and the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The results of the present survey indicated the existence of high T. gondii seroprevalence in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, which has significant public health concern. Therefore, it is imperative that improved integrated measures be carried out to prevent and control T. gondii infection in equids in the studied region.

Cerenkov emission of terahertz acoustic-phonons from graphene	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON GASES; AMPLIFICATION; GENERATION; TRANSISTORS	We present a theoretical study of the electrical generation of acoustic-phonon emission from graphene at room temperature. The drift velocity (v(x)) and temperature of electrons driven by dc electric field (F-x) are determined by solving self-consistently the momentum-and energy-balance equations derived from the Boltzmann equation. We find that in the presence of impurity, acoustic-and optic-phonon scattering, v(x) can be much larger than the longitudinal (v(l)) and transverse (v(t)) sound velocities in graphene even within the linear response regime. As a result, although the acoustic Cerenkov effect cannot be obviously seen in the analytical formulas, the enhanced acoustic-phonon emission can be observed with increasing F-x when v(x) > v(l) and v > v(t). The frequency of acoustic-phonon emission from graphene can be above 10 THz, which is much higher than that generated from conventional semiconductor systems. This study is pertinent to the application of graphene as hypersonic devices such as terahertz sound sources. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Zhao, C.

Single crystal X-ray analyses revealed that both complexes are symmetrical dimers. Cu with four deprotonated methyl-benzoate bridging ligands form a paddle-wheel core and pyridyl nitrogen of radical ligands at the apical position. Based on the Cu-Cu axis of 1 and 2, we exploited the steric constraints of the methyl groups and induced the paddle-wheel. Two magnetic exchange pathways with strong antiferromagnetic interaction between dimeric Cu-II ions and weak antiferromagnetic interaction between NITmPy ligands exist in the complexes. IR and powder X-ray diffraction of the complexes were also studied.

The cells of the two strains were coccoid, non-motile and Gram-stain-negative. Colonies were pink white-pigmented and aerobic. Growth occurred at 10-30% (w/v) NaCl, 20-55 degrees C and pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum: 20-25% NaCl, 37-42 degrees C, pH 6.5-7.0). Magnesium was necessary for growth in the range of 0.2-1.2 M. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains belonged to the genus Halopelagius showing 98.5% sequence similarity to the closest phylogenetic neighbour, Halopelagius inordinatus RO5-2(T). In addition, the DNA DNA hybridization values of strains YIM 941881 and YIM 94189 to Halopelagius inordinatus RO5-2(T) were 35.7% and 37.7%, respectively. Polar lipid analyses revealed that the two strains contained phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester (PGP-Me), sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether (S-DGD-1) and mannosyl glucosyl diether (DGD-1). The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 94188(T) and YIM 94189 were 66.3 mol% and 64.6 mol%, respectively. On the basis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, and phylogenetic analysis, strains YIM 94188(T) and YIM 94189 were classified as representing a novel species in the genus Halopelagius. The name Halopelagius fulvigenes sp. nov. is proposed, with YIM 94188(T) (=CCTCC AB 2010456(T)=JCM 17506(T)) as the type strain.

The taxonomic status of this organism was established using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain KLBMP 1279T was closely related to Modestobacter marinus 42H12-(T) T (99.5% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Modestobacter versicolor CP153-2(T) (98.4%) and Modestobacter multiseptatus AA-826(T) (97.5%). Chemotaxonomic characteristics were consistent with its assignment to the genus Modestobacter in that the isolate had meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall, MK-9(H-4) as major menaquinone and a polar lipid profile containing diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, two unknown aminophospholipids and an unknown phospholipid. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-15:0 and C-17:1 omega 8c. The DNA G+C content was 71.7 mol%. However, DNA DNA hybridization assays as well as physiological and biochemical analyses differentiated strain KLBMP 1279(T) from its closest phylogenetic relatives. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence, the isolate KLBMP 1279(T) represents a novel species of the genus Modestobacter, for which the name Modestobacter roseus sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is KLBMP 1279(T) (=KCTC 19887(T)=NBRC 108673(T)=DSM 45764(T)). An emended description of the genus Modestobacter is also proposed.

(Cornulitida?) from the Early Cambrian Chengjiang biota with well-preserved soft body tissues is described. This tubicolous fossil probably had a biomineralized shell, and shares some affinities with cornulitids and lophophorates. C. rarus has a straight to curved, conical tube with external transversal rings (ridges), longitudinal ribs (striae) and possibly microlamellar wall structure. The preserved soft body of C. rarus exhibits several important morphological characteristics, such as a possible lophophore and nephridial ridges. The new genus had a somewhat similar mode of life to the gregarious type of cornulitids. Some of the studied tubes of C. rarus show malformed development.

Horizontal gene transfer is a significant phenomenon for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different bacteria. Thus, the phenomenon was investigated at genome-wide level. The results indicated that a transposase gene was transferred from enterococcus to stremptococcus thermophilus, and plasmid2 was transferred from streptococcus thermophilus to sreptococcus pyro genes, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae. Furthermore, exopolysaccharide operon gene and glycopeptide antibiotics resistance protein gene (GARPG) were transferred from streptococcus thermophilus to Streptococcus salivarius. GARPG was also found to be transferred from streptococcus thermophilus to Lactococcus lactis. Cell wall thickening was also a feature of broad-range antibiotics resistance in strepotococcus thermophilus. These warned us that the safety status of the dairy bacteria should be taken an all-around consideration. Creating the dairy bacteria without the resistance for common antibiotics will be extremely demanded.

The absolute negative mobility (ANM), negative nonlinear mobility (NDM), and negative differential mobility (NNM) were simulated, separately. Results indicate that: (i) non-Gaussian noise can either enhance or diminish the phenomena of ANM, and non-Gaussian noise also can induce NDM and NNM in regions of parameter space. (ii) The average velocity-correlation time characteristics shift towards small value of correlation time. (iii) The absolute value of negative-valued minima decreases as the non-Gaussian noise parameter q increases.

The conductivity of LSGM materials was detected by four probe method, and it was 0.08 S/cm at 850 degrees C. Dense and uniform films of LSGM materials were deposited by the magnetic sputtering on substrates of Si and La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM). The experimental results showed that the deposition rates dropped and the average grain sizes of the films enlarged with increase in the substrate temperatures. In the sputtering process, the LSGM film was deposited with preferred growth direction. After annealing, the preferred growth direction disappeared and the film surface became smoother and denser. Through observing the deposition process, deposition mechanism was proposed, which was consistent with a model of island growth.

The study of leptin has been of crucial importance for public health and pharmaceutical intervention given its role in obesity. Generally, leptin is highly conserved due to its functional importance. However, episodes of rapid sequence evolution and positive selection have been observed in some mammalian species, indicating that the leptin functions in these animals may have undergone adaptive modification to their environments. In this article, we review the adaptive evolution of leptin and its potential functional consequences. This review is expected to guide future research of molecular evolution and functional assays of this gene, and also to provide a theoretical foundation for the use of leptin in therapeutic applications.

NOV; GENUS; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; WELLS	A Gram-positive, catalase- and oxidase-positive, strictly aerobic, endospore-forming rod bacterium, designated K3514(T), was isolated from the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum. The strain was able to grow at temperatures of 8-40A degrees C, pH 5.0-10.0 and NaCl concentrations of 0-7%. The predominant quinones (> 30%) of this strain were MK-7(H2) and MK-7. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain K3514(T) was affiliated to the genus Lysinibacillus, with its closest relatives being Lysinibacillus mangiferihumi (98.3% sequence similarity), Lysinibacillus sphaericus (97.9% sequence similarity), Lysinibacillus fusiformis (97.4% sequence similarity), and Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (97.3% sequence similarity). However, low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness values suggested that the isolate was distinct from the other closest Lysinibacillus species. Additionally, based on analysis of morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, the isolate could be differentiated from the closest known relatives. Therefore, based on polyphasic taxonomic data, the novel isolate likely represents a novel species, for which the name Lysinibacillus tabacifolii sp. nov. and the type strain K3514(T) (=KCTC 33042(T) =CCTCC AB 2012050(T)) are proposed.

This particular type of Lagerstatte is known from just a few places around the world but has led to significant breakthrough's in the understanding of the early diversity of animals and evolution of metazoans. The original 'orsten' from southern Sweden are limestone concretions within black shales, whereas in China this kind of preservation occurs in lime mudstone thin beds and nodules interbedded with shale. Thus there is a taphonomic bias in that this kind of preservation is localized to a deeper water carbonate facies which can be regarded as concretionary due to early cementation under shallow burial. Nonetheless, we observe that even within a laterally extensive bed of the seemingly appropriate lithofacies, preservation may be highly localized. Thus, in addition to the extreme rarity of Orsten-type preservation globally, serendipity in discovering fossiliferous localities plays a significant role. Because of their predominant occurrence in the Cambrian they are also a temporally restricted window. To extract Orsten-type material from the limestone matrix, mild acetic acid digestion has been widely applied, but certain procedures can be employed to aid recovery by limiting damage to these delicate but fragile specimens. Here, we describe our method for etching out specimens and review some of the discoveries recently made in southern China.

In clonally evolving genomes, alleles at different loci will be in significant linkage disequilibrium. In this study, the associations among alleles at nine mitochondrial loci were analyzed for 379 isolates in four natural populations of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus. The results indicated that the mitochondrial genome in the Desert California population was not significantly different from random recombination. In contrast, the three other populations all showed predominantly clonal mitochondrial population structure. While no evidence of recombination was found in the Alberta, Canada A. bisporus population, signatures of recombination were evident in the Coastal Californian and the French populations. We discuss the potential mechanisms that could have contributed to the observed mitochondrial recombination and to the differences in allelic associations among the geographic populations in this economically important mushroom.

J	Wu, J; Liu, J				Wu Jian; Liu Jia			VARIATIONS OF CLOUD FRACTION OVER EAST ASIA UNDER GLOBAL WARMING CONDITIONS IN THE PAST 20 YEARS	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY			English	Article						cloud fraction; greenhouse effect; East Asia; trend analysis	ISCCP; TRENDS; CHINA	Based on the variation of cloud fraction revealed by D2 Cloud Climatic Data of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and trend analysis methods, the trend of different types of cloud fraction over East Asia during 1984-2006 is obtained. The analysis focuses on the relationship between temperature and different cloud fraction under the background of globe warming. The result shows a fluctuating decreasing tendency in the total cloud fraction, high-level cloud and low-level cloud over East Asia with the decrement being 2.24%, 1.65% and 1.68%, respectively, while the mid-level cloud increases by 1.07%. In addition, there are great regional differences in cloud fraction. Temperature and water-vapor content variation caused by the greenhouse effects over East Asia is the primary reason for the variation of cloud fraction. Over the Tibetan Plateau, the Bay of Bengal and the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the temperature is negatively correlated with high-level cloud, but positively correlated with mid- and low-level cloud. However, over the West Pacific and the ocean east and north of Japan, the temperature is negatively correlated with low-level cloud but positively correlated with high-level cloud.

The crystal structure is noncentrosymmetric (P (4) over bar2(1)c). Each Zn-II cation has a tetrahedral co-ordination environment (C-2 symmetry), which is formed by two chloride ligands and two pyridine N atoms from two tpom ligands. The tetrahedral tetradentate tpom linker has a quaternary C atom located on the crystallographic (4) over bar axis. This linker utilizes all the peripheral pyridine N atoms to connect four Zn-II cations, thereby forming a wave-like two-dimensional sheet along the c axis. The two-dimensional layer can be topologically simplified as a typical uninodal 4-connected sql/Shubnikov net, which is represented by the Schlafli symbol {4(4),6(2)}. Adjacent layers are further packed into a three-dimensional structure by C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl hydrogen bonds.

An immunocompetent patient was presented with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperferritinemia, which conformed to a hemophagocytic syndrome diagnosis. Despite broad antibiotic treatment, the patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and he died within 8 days of admission. Blood cultures and a serology test were negative; however, based on morphological characteristics, tissue cysts Toxoplasma gondii were found in the bone marrow. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, identity of the parasite was confirmed. Although very rare, T. gondii-associated hemophagocytic syndrome should be suspected in the case of cytopenia or multiorgan failure symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first fatal toxoplasmosis case reported from China.

This study, for the first time, describes a complete tylosis formation in a fossil woody conifer and discusses its ecophysiological implications. The permineralized stem of Shenoxylon mirabile was collected from the upper Permian (Changhsingian) Sunjiagou Formation of Shitanjing coalfield, northern China. Samples from different portions of the stem were prepared by using the standard thin-sectioning technique and studied in transmitted light. The outgrowth of ray parenchyma cells protruded into adjacent tracheids through pits initially forming small pyriform or balloon-shaped structures, which became globular or slightly elongated when they reached their maximum size. The tracheid luminae were gradually occluded by densely spaced tyloses. The host tracheids are arranged in distinct concentric zones representing different growth phases of tylosis formation within a single growth ring. The extensive development of tyloses from the innermost heartwood (metaxylem) tracheids to the outermost sapwood tracheids suggests that the plant was highly vulnerable and reacted strongly to environmental stress. Based on the evidence available, the tyloses were probably not produced in response to wound reaction or pathogenic infection, since evidence of wood traumatic events or fungal invasion are not recognizable. Rather, they may represent an ecophysiological response to the constant environmental stimuli.

New features of this plant include the stem up to 60 mm wide, axes dichotomizing as many as seven times, and microphylls with entire margins. Present anatomical characters conform to those known previously. The proportion of cortex area to stem (axis) area in cross section is proposed as an index to characterize the growth habit of the protolepidodendralean and isoetalean lycopsids of the Middle Devonian to Carboniferous age. The thick stem and axes as well as high cortex proportion suggest that M. cathaysiense was probably a small tree. The Protolepidodendrales may have developed an arborescent habit in the late Middle Devonian.

RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis identified high expression levels of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 in root tissues across developmental stages in comparison with the constitutive genes OsAct1 (rice Actin1 gene), OsUbi1 (rice polyubiquitin rubi1 gene), and OsCc1 (rice cytochrome c gene). The copy numbers of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 transcripts were highly accumulated in the examined root tissues but were not detected in young embryos or leaves at the indicated days after germination or in the panicle, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of OsAct1, OsUbi1, and OsCc1. Additionally, the promoter regions of these two genes were linked to the GUSplus reporter gene and transformed into rice. GUS staining of the transgenic plants showed that the Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 promoters were active in primary and secondary roots throughout the developmental stages, except in root hairs. The GUSPlus transcript levels were also highly root-specific in the transgenic rice. Overall, the two promoters are highly active in the root tissues of rice and can be useful for the root-specific enhancement of target gene(s). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

NOV.; HIRSUTA; CLASSIFICATION; NOCARDIA; TREES; ROOT	A halotolerant actinomycete strain, designated strain KLBMP 1305(T), was isolated from a salt marsh plant Dendranthema indicum (Linn.) Des Moul collected from the coastal region of Nantong, Jiangsu Province, in east China and was studied in detail for its taxonomic position. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain KLBMP 1305(T) is a member of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicated that strain KLBMP 1305(T) was most closely related to 'Saccharopolyspora pathumthaniensis' S582(T) (99.31 %), 'Saccharopolyspora endophytica' YIM 61095(T) (99.17 %) and Saccharopolyspora tripterygii YIM 65359(T) (99.15 %); similarity to other type strains of the genus Saccharopolyspora was < 97.2 %. The organism had chemical and morphological features consistent with its classification in the genus Saccharopolyspora such as meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan and arabinose and galactose as the diagnostic sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, an unknown glycolipid and an unknown lipid. The major fatty acids were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and sum in feature 8 (18:1 omega 7c/18:1 omega 6c)(.) The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain was 68.7 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness data, together with phenotypic differences, clearly distinguished the isolate from its closest relatives. On the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, the isolate represents a novel species, for which the name Saccharopolyspora dendranthemae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KLBMP 1305(T) (=KCTC 19889(T) = NBRC 108675(T)).

The two Gram-positive, aerobic strains were observed to produce branched substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae but did not fragment, and no diffusible pigment was produced on the media tested. At maturity, spores were formed singly or in pairs on aerial hyphae and substrate mycelium, and occasionally the single ones were borne on long sporophores. The optimum growth was determined to occur at 28 A degrees C, 0-4 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 7.0-8.0. Whole-cell hydrolysates of both strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the diagnostic sugars were determined to be galactose, glucose and arabinose. Their predominant menaquinone was found to be MK-9(H-4). The polar lipids detected in the two strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine and two unknown phosphoglycolipids. The major fatty acids (> 10 %) identified were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-16:1 H, iso-C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 6c for strain YIM M11168(T), iso-C-16:0 and Summed Feature 3 for strain YIM M11177. The G + C contents of the genomic DNAs of both strains were determined to be 71.4 %. DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness values (78.4 +/- A 3.7 %) of these two isolates supported the conclusion that they belong to the same species. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the two isolates belong to a novel species of the genus Saccharomonospora of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. The name Saccharomonospora oceani sp. nov. (Type strain YIM M11168(T) = DSM 45700(T) = JCM 18128(T)) is proposed for the novel species.

J	Wen, XJ; Duan, CQ; Zhang, DC				Wen, Xiao-jun; Duan, Chang-qun; Zhang, Da-chao			Effect of simulated acid rain on soil acidification and rare earth elements leaching loss in soils of rare earth mining area in southern Jiangxi Province of China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						REEs; Soil acidification; Simulated acid rain; Leaching loss; Fraction; Mining area	HEAVY-METALS; SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION; COMPLEXATION BEHAVIOR; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FOREST SOILS; TRACE-METALS; GEOCHEMISTRY; DEPOSITION; FRACTIONATION; CHEMISTRY	Acid rain has long been a great concern because of environmental and ecological problems; however, the effect of acid rain on soil acidification, loss of rare earth elements (REEs) via the leaching process, and transformation are rarely reported in rare earth mining areas. Through a simulated acid rain leaching experience, the effect of acid rain was studied on soil acidification and REEs leaching loss. The results showed that the tested soil had certain buffering capacity against nearly neutral rainwater. However, simulated acid rain of low and very low pH (pH a parts per thousand currency sign 3.5) had a greater impact on soil acidification. After eluviating by simulated acid rain of pH 3.5 for 36 h, the pH of tailings, garden soil, paddy soil, and alluvial soil decreased by 20.41, 32.03, 13.60, 16.88, and 15.83 %, respectively, from the original values. For simulated acid rain of pH 2.5, it was 31.89, 44.76, 31.26, 29.87, and 29.15 %, respectively. After simulated acid rain eluviations of low and very low pH (pH a parts per thousand currency sign 3.5), the order of the leaching rate of REEs in the tested soil was as follows: garden soil > tailings > paddy soil > alluvial soil. For nearly neutral rainwater (pH 4.5 simulated acid rain and pH 5.6 deionized water), the order was tailings > garden soil > paddy soil > alluvial soil. For simulated acid rain of the same pH, the leaching amounts of REEs in tailings and garden soil were higher than those in paddy soil and alluvial soil. After leaching by low and very low pH-simulated acid rain (pH a parts per thousand currency sign 3.5), the peak value of the leaching amount of REEs in all tested soil appeared at 2 h, and then gradually reduced and reached a stable leaching state 20 h after leaching. On leaching by simulated acid rain of pH 2.5, the maximum REEs contents of leachate in tailings, garden soil, paddy soil, and alluvial soil were 156.35, 145.82, 99.88, and 85.97 mg/L, respectively. For pH 3.5 of simulated acid rain, it was 130.49, 110.49, 80.57, and 62.73 mg/L, respectively. On leaching by simulated acid rain of pH 4.5, the maximum contents of REEs in the leachate were 53.46 and 29.82 mg/L, respectively, which were observed after leaching for 6 h in tailings and garden soil that became stable 12 h after leaching. The contents of leached REEs in paddy soil and alluvial soil were always in a lower and stable state. After eluviations with deionized water of pH 5.6, the contents of leached REEs in other soils were lower, except for the slight fluctuations in tailings. The maximum content in the leachate of REEs was in the water-soluble and exchangeable fraction. When bound to carbonate fractions, REEs were not detected in the leachate. REEs bound to iron-manganese (Fe-Mn) oxides fraction and to organic matter fraction in the leachate possibly came from the tested soil or from the REEs transformation during the migration process. The content of residual fraction REEs in the leachate was very low.

However, studies have shown various modulations by morphine: positive, negative and even neutral. The honeybee is a potential platform for evaluating the effects of drugs, especially addictive drugs, on the nervous system. However, the involvement of morphine in learning and memory in insects or other invertebrates is poorly understood. The current work evaluated whether morphine affects memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in honeybees, using the proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm. We demonstrated that morphine treatment (5 mu g/bee) before training decreased the percentage of correct PERs and the response latency related to aversive rather than rewarding odors when tested after 1 or 24 h. Morphine treatment after training also caused a decrease in this latency when tested after 24 h. Meanwhile, morphine treatment reduced the ambulation distance when tested after 30 min. Our findings suggest that morphine impairs the acquisition of short- and long-term associative memory and slightly disrupts the consolidation of long-term memory in honeybees. These negative effects cannot be explained by reduced locomotion but by impaired memory associated with aversion.

The as-prepared Ln(OH)(3) nanorods can be successfully converted to Ln(2)O(3) nanorods via calcination under appropriate conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-Resolution TEM (HRTEM), and Raman spectroscopy were used to examine the morphologies and microstructures to find out the cause. The analyzed results indicate that the obtained nanorods are rare-earth hydroxides and oxides with 1D nanostructures. The formation mechanism of the Ln(OH)(3) and Ln(2)O(3) nanorods was investigated. Optical properties of the Ln(OH)(3) and Ln(2)O(3) nanorods were determined by photoluminescence (PL). Ln(OH)(3) and Ln(2)O(3) nanorods exhibit a strong blue emission with the strongest narrow bands at about 469 nm corresponding to the intra-4f transitions D-5(2)-> F-7(6), which have potential applications in fluorescent devices.

The results showed that mean removal efficiencies were 81.03 % for COD, 51.66 % for total nitrogen (TN), 42.50 % for NH4 (+)-N, and 68.01 % for TP. Significant positive correlations between nitrate reductase activities and TN and NH4 (+)-N removal efficiencies, along with a significant correlation between substrate enzyme activity and operation time, were observed. Redundancy analysis demonstrated gram-negative bacteria were mainly responsible for urease and phosphatase activities, and also played a major role in dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase activities. Meanwhile, anaerobic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and saturated FA groups, gram-positive bacteria exhibited good correlations with the removal of COD (p = 0.388), N (p = 0.236), and TP (p = 0.074), respectively. The IVCW system can be used to treat domestic wastewater effectively.

Starch phosphorylation increases as the pH increases from 3 to 6, but diminishes at pH 7. Increased temperatures enhance phosphorylation. Data from P-31 NMR suggests that starch phosphorylation occurs mainly at the C3-OH and C6-OH of the glucose residue. The phosphate linkage is mainly due to monostarch monophosphate. Although starch had almost no calcium phosphate-solubilising capacity, this capacity was markedly enhanced by phosphorylation. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite was not present in the calcium phosphate-PS complex.

By carefully integrating C-shaped slots, L-shaped open circuit stub, and T-shaped parasitic strip onto the primitive miniaturized antenna, four band-notches (VSWR > 2) could be achieved at 3.383.65 GHz, 4.956.05 GHz, 7.427.78 GHz, and 8.18.9 GHz to reject WiMAX, WLAN, X-band satellite communication, and ITU 8 GHz band signals. Simulated and measured results show that this antenna could operate from 3.1511.1 GHz (VSWR < 2), and maintain omnidirectional directivity patterns at H-plane. Moreover, the proposed antenna has a very compact size of 18.6 x 22 x 1.5 mm3. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For the laser gain is excited by side-pumping scheme, it is found that the polarization property of lasing emission is simply dependent on the polarized states of the pump beams. The polarization property of lasing emission depends on the propagating situation of the pump beams in an optical fiber if the laser gain is excited by evanescent-wave pumping scheme, that is, if the pump beams within the fiber are meridional beams, the lasing emission is a transverse electric (TE) wave that forms a special radial polarization emission. However, if the pump beams within the fiber are skew beams, both transverse magnetic (TM) and TE waves exist simultaneously in lasing emission that forms a special axially and radially mixed polarization emission. Pumped by skew beams, the wave-number differences between TE and TM waves are also investigated quantitatively, the results demonstrate that the wave-number difference decreases with the increase of the fiber diameter and the refractive index (RI) of the cladding solution. The observed polarization characteristics have been well explained based on lasing radiation mechanism of WGM fiber laser of gain coupled by evanescent wave.

In this study we investigated microbial diversity and community composition in 13 Tibetan hot springs with a wide range of temperatures (22.1-75 degrees C) and other geochemical conditions by using the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing approach. Bacteria (10(8)-10(11) copy/g; 42 bacterial phyla) in Tibetan hot springs were more abundant and far more diverse than Archaea (10(7)-10(10) copy/g; 5 archaeal phyla). The dominant bacterial phyla systematically varied with temperature. Moderate temperatures (75-66 degrees C) favored Aquificae, GAL35, and novel Bacteria, whereas low temperatures (60-22.1 degrees C) selected for Deinococcus-Thermus, Cyanobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The relative abundance of Aquificae was correlated positively with temperature, but the abundances of Deinococcus-Thermus, Cyanobacteria, and Chloroflexi were negatively correlated with temperature. Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi were abundant in Tibetan hot springs and their abundances were positively correlated at low temperatures (55-43 degrees C) but negatively correlated at moderate temperatures (75-55 degrees C). These correlation patterns suggest a complex physiological relationship between these two phyla. Most archaeal sequences were related to Crenarchaeota with only a few related to Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Despite the fact that microbial composition in Tibetan hot springs was strongly shaped by temperature, microbial diversity (richness, evenness and Shannon diversity) was not significantly correlated with temperature change.

On-farm assessment of soil erosion and non-point source pollution in a rain-fed vegetable production system at Dianchi lake's catchment, southwestern China	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Crop rotation systems; Soil loss; Runoff; Soil nitrogen; Soil phosphorus	PLASTIC MULCH; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; RUNOFF; FURROWS; CARBON; LOADS; FIELD; FLOW	Vegetable is important cash crop in Dianchi lake's catchment, but the non-point source (NPS) pollution from the intensive agricultural production systems is a critical hurdle on the alleviation of serious eutrophication in Dianchi lake. Our objectives were to quantify soil erosion and NPS pollution in rain-fed vegetable production systems at the area. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The narrow-plastic-mulch system has significantly (P < 0.05) increased runoff and soil loss than wide-plastic-mulch system. Results indicated that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion at vegetable seedling stages, whereas runoff and soil loss were apparently alleviated in furrow with residue mulch. The sediment transport played a predominant role in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) movement by surface runoff. The annual losses of N and P via surface runoff in the vegetable field were ranged from 2.0 to 5.1 kg/ha and 0.3 to 1.1 kg/ha respectively in the three considerably drier rain season, but their losses never exceeded 1 % of the annual fertilizer application. Removal of crop residues was the major causes of N and P export from the soil in the vegetable fields, which exceeded 20 and 8 % of the annual nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application respectively. This implicated that inappropriately discarding of the residues would pose serious consequences for water contamination of Dianchi lake. As under appropriate discarding of residues, the wide-plastic-mulch system could improve NPS pollution control and crop production in vegetable field at Dianchi lake's catchment.	[Zhang, G.

A transparency capillary is used as both diffusive pool and imaging element, spatially resolving ability of the capillary in measuring refractive index of liquid is utilized to observe and record diffusive process directly, diffusion coefficient of liquid is calculated based on Fick second law and acquired experimental data. With the new method, the diffusive process of pure glycerol in water at 25 degrees C is investigated, the obtained diffusion coefficient is 0.898 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s, which is of a relative error 4.47% compared with the literature value measured by the holographic interference. The influence of measurement accuracy of refractive index and capillary viscosity on measuring result is also analyzed. The method is characterized by micro-quantity sample required, faster measurement and better stability, which opens a new way to measure diffusion coefficient of liquid medium.

The dot density, a function of deposition rate and Ge coverage, is observed to be limited mainly by the transformation from two- dimensional precursors to three- dimensional islands, and to be associated with the adatom behaviors of attachment and detachment from the islands. An unusual increasing temperature dependence of nanodot density is also revealed when a high ion energy is employed in sputtering deposition, and is shown to be related to the breaking down of the superstrained wetting layer. This result is attributed to the interaction between energetic atoms and the growth surface, which mediates the island nucleation.

Various theoretical models showed that the amplification of the magnetic field was crucial to explain their multiband emission properties. We investigate the evolution of the magnetic field and model the multiband emissions from these two young SNRs with a time-dependent injection model. The results indicate that (1) the radio and X-ray emissions are reproduced by synchrotron radiation of the injected electrons, while the gamma-rays can be explained as inverse Compton scattering of the relativistic electrons and proton-proton interaction of the high-energy protons; and (2) the amplification of the magnetic field spontaneously happens with reasonable parameters.

The isolate grew at 20-60 degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and it could grow with up to 10 %(w/v) NaCl. The cell-wall diamino acid was found to be meso-diaminopimelic acid. Polar lipids were found to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown polar lipid. The only menaquinone was determined to be MK-7. The major fatty acids were identified as C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 6c, C-16:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, and iso-C-16:0. The DNA G+C content of strain SCSIO 15042(T) was determined to be 43.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated strain SCSIO 15042(T) to the genus Bacillus. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain SCSIO 15042(T) and Bacillus herbersteinensis D-1-5a(T), Bacillus infantis SMC 4352-1(T), Bacillus novalis LMG 21837(T) and Bacillus drentensis LMG 21831(T) were 96.2, 96.2, 96.1 and 96.1 %, respectively.

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of plastic mulch patterns and crop rotations on runoff, erosion and soil physical properties in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The wide-plastic-mulch treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced runoff and soil loss compared to the narrow-plastic-mulch treatment, due to the better developed micro-basins found on the raised beds that enhanced infiltration in wide-plastic-mulch systems. Our results also indicated that inclusion of a winter wheat crop in the vegetable rotation did not alter the extent of runoff and soil loss from the vegetable field. Furthermore, we found that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion in vegetable seedling stages. There were significant correlations between soil loss and runoff volume (P < 0.01) and rainfall intensity (P < 0.01). The losses of total C, N and P were closely associated with that of the soil loss, and 82% of TC, 57% of TN and 75% of TP is entrained with sediment. After growing season, furrows without plastic mulch displayed lower total porosity and macroporosity (>60 mu m) that impeded infiltration in surface soil (0-5 cm). Higher water stability of soil macro-aggregates >2 mm were observed in plastic mulch ridges relative to the furrows after rain season. The results obtained in this study have practical implications for soil and water conservation in vegetable culture. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We therefore investigated the relation between estrogen and Hsp70 in terms of DNA protection in in vitro. The findings showed a significant reduction in cell survival and elevation in oxidative stress while cells were exposed to amyloid beta (A beta(25-35)) peptide, but preincubation of the cells with 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) ameliorated this situation. In addition, 17 beta-E2 alleviated oxidized DNA damage induced by A beta and elevated the expression of Hsp70. However, the beneficial properties of 17 beta-E2 on reducing DNA damage were attenuated when Hsp70 gene was silenced accordingly. These results indicate that Hsp70 plays a role in DNA protection mediated by estrogen, and the DNA protection may be involved in Alzheimer's disease preventive effect from estrogen.

NOV.; SOIL; ACID	A novel bacterial strain, TRM F109(T), was isolated from hypersaline habitat in Sichuan Province, China. It was a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, halotolerant, filamentous bacterium. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed levels of similarity of 97.0-98.4 % to the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola. Chemotaxonomic data also supported the placement of strain TRM F109(T) within the genus Isoptericola. The low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between the novel strain and the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola, in combination with differential phenotypic data, demonstrate that strain TRM F109(T) represents a novel species of the genus Isoptericola, for which the name Isoptericola salitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM F109(T) (=JCM 15901(T)=KCTC 19617(T)).

Chemical study on the culture medium of A entomopaga producing adhesive knobs led to isolation of six trace amounts of metabolites, including two new metabolites, paganins A and B (1 and 2), blumenol A (3), talathermophilins A and B (4 and 5), and cyclo(glycyltryptophyl) (6). Compounds 3-6 were reported for the first time from carnivorous fungi. Compounds 1 and 2 promoted the formation of the predatory adhesive knobs with an increasing rate up to 118% at a concentration of 50 mu M but showed moderate inhibitory activity at a concentration of 5 mu M. Moreover, compounds 1 and 2 displayed strong inhibitory activities toward the formation of A. entomopaga conidiophores with inhibitory rates of 40-75%. Growth experiments suggested that compounds 1 and 2 could be involved in the regulation of the fungal predatory and reproductive abilities. Nematode chemotaxis bioassay indicated that compounds 1 and 3 displayed strong nematode-attracting abilities. These findings provided a new type of regulatory metabolite and support for the hypothesis that predators often evolve to respond to their metazoan prey.

Herein a novel facile generic strategy of combining template assisted and solvothermal alcoholysis is employed to prepare core-void-shell anatase TiO2 nanoparticle aggregates with an excellent photocatalytic activity, and enhanced lithium storage in large quantities. Amorphous carbon can be loaded on the TiO2 nanoparticles uniformly under a suitably formulated ethanol/water system in the solvothermal alcoholysis process, and the subsequent calcination results of the formation of core-shell-shell anatase TiO2 nanoparticle aggregates. The intrinsic core-void-shell nature as well as high porosity of the unique nanostructures contributes greatly to the superior photocatalytic activity and improved performance as anode materials for lithium ion batteries.

Based on this sample, we reconstruct the gamma-ray luminosity function (GLF) in the framework of the luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, and obtain the best-fitting GLF by comparing the distributions of observed redshifts, luminosities, indexes and source counts with the predicted distribution of the GLF through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which constrains the model parameters in an efficient way. Using the best-fitting GLF, we estimate the contribution of Fermi-undetected FSRQs to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background (EGRB), and find that the contribution of unresolved FSRQs to the EGRB is 10.1 +/- 4.7 per cent in the 0.1-100 GeV band. We also study the influence of different bins of redshifts, luminosities and spectral indices on the contribution to EGRB from the unresolved FSRQs, and find that the contributions of unresolved FSRQs in the redshift range of z = 0.0-2.0 and in the gamma-ray luminosity range of 10(44)-10(48) erg s(-1) are similar to 90 per cent, respectively.

In this model, electrons are accelerated to extrarelativistic energy, through stochastic particle acceleration, and evolve with time. Non-thermal photons are produced by both synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron photons. Moreover, non-thermal photons during a quiescent state are produced by relativistic electrons in the steady state, and those during an outburst are produced by electrons whose injection rate is changed at some time interval. We apply the model to two exceptionally luminous gamma-ray outbursts from 3C 273 observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in 2009 September. We obtain the multiwavelength spectra during both the quiescent and outburst states. Our results show that the time-dependent properties of outbursts can be reproduced by adopting the appropriate injection rate function of the electron population.	[Zheng, Y. G.; Huang, B.

Thus, the genetic variation in TLR4 gene may influence the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several studies have investigated the roles of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 gene in RA, but most of these studies were restricted to two cosegregating functional missense polymorphisms Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile. To determine whether non-missense genetic polymorphisms located in regulatory region of TLR4 are related to RA in a Chinese Han population, four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) situated on 3' untranslating region (UTR) and 5' UTR were genotyped in 213 RA patients and 247 unrelated ethnically matched controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing techniques. Significant genetic associations were observed with the 3' UTR SNP rs41426344 and rs7873784. The minor allele C and homozygotic variant genotype CC of rs41426344 and minor allele C of rs7873784 were identified to be risk factors for the development of RA in Chinese Han people. Furthermore, by comparing the variation allele frequencies to other populations, prevalent genetic ethnic specificity was observed in all the four SNPs. Our study suggested that the effect of non-missense polymorphisms located in regulatory region would not be neglected in disease association analysis.

Results of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of NIO TC occurrence frequency show that the EOF1 mode, which accounts for 16% of total variance, consistently represents variations of TC occurrence frequency over the whole NIO basin. However, spatial distributions of EOF1 mode are not uniform, mainly indicating variations of westward-moving TCs in the Bay of Bengal. The prevailing TC activity variation mode oscillates significantly on a quasi-5 year interannual time scale. NIO TC activity is notably influenced by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode. When the Indian Ocean is in a positive (negative) phase of the IOD, NIO SST anomalies are warm in the west (east) and cold in the east (west), which can weaken (strengthen) convection over the Bay of Bengal and eastern Arabian Sea, and cause anticyclonic (cyclonic) atmospheric circulation anomalies at low levels. This results in less (more) TC genesis and reduced (increased) opportunities for TC occurrence in the NIO. In addition, positive (negative) IOD events may strengthen (weaken) westerly steering flow over the Bay of Bengal, which further leads to fewer (more) westward-moving TCs which appear in regions west of 90A degrees E in that bay.

The results indicate that TMPA daily precipitation estimates tend to show an underestimation comparing to the rain gauge daily precipitations under any scenarios, especially for the middle stream in the dry season. The accuracy of TMPA-averaged precipitation deteriorates with the increase of elevation at both basin and grid scale, with upstream and downstream having the worst and best accuracy, respectively. A fair capability was shown when using daily TMPA accumulations to detect rain events at drizzle rain and this capability improves with the increase of elevation. However, the capability deteriorates when it is used to detect moderate rain and heavy rain events. The accuracy of TMPA precipitation estimate products is better in the rain season than in the dry season at all scenarios. Time difference and elevation are the main factors that have impact on the accuracy of TMPA daily-accumulated precipitation products.

A decrease of global mean tropopause height induced by sulfate, carbonaceous aerosol, and total combined aerosols is found, and a tropopause height increase is induced by dust aerosol. Sulfate aerosol decreases the tropospheric temperature and increases the stratospheric temperature. These effects cause a decrease in the height of the tropopause. In contrast, carbonaceous and total combined aerosols increase both the tropospheric and the stratospheric temperatures, and they also cause a decrease in the height of the tropopause. The changes in the tropopause height show highly statistically significant correlations with the changes in the tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures. The changes in the tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures are related to the changes in the radiative heat rate, cloud cover, and latent heat, but none of these factors absolutely dominate the temperature change.

Further studies indicated that 1 induced this effect by down-regulating host heat-stress cognate 70 (Hsc70) expression. In addition, 20 derivatives were designed and synthesised to investigate the basic structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the title compound. Several of these derivatives exhibit a good inhibition of HCV, such as compound 3 (EC50 = 0.68 nmol/mL, SI = 33.86), compound 2d (EC50 = 15 nmol/mL, SI = 12) and compound 5 (EC50 = 33 nmol/mL, SI > 10.91). Meanwhile, the experimental data suggest that the modification of certain groups of (+)-lycoricidine can reduce the cytotoxicity of the compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A replication study provided supporting evidence that STK39 functional polymorphism rs35929607 was associated with hypertension. Recently, another study also showed rs6749447 within the STK39 was associated with blood pressure responses. However, these studies were all conducted in Caucasians. Thus, we carried out a case-control study to test whether STK39 is a common candidate gene for hypertension, and to examine the interaction of genetic factors and non-genetic risk factors in the Chinese population. Thousand twenty four hypertensive cases and 1024 controls were genotyped for five polymorphisms. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located within STK39, and rs4977950, the SNP that showed the strongest signal is located in a gene desert. Results indicated that none of these SNPs was associated with hypertension in the Chinese population. Logistic regression analysis found body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride level were higher in the hypertension group when compared with the control group. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis indicated that the interaction between BMI and rs4977950 may have an impact on hypertension. Taken together, the present study found no evidence that STK39 was associated with hypertension in the Chinese population. Instead, non-genetic risk factors such as BMI have an important role in Chinese hypertensive subjects, and the 'missing inheritability' requires further investigation.

Transition metal ions Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ doped hydroxyapatite (HAP)/collagen composites were synthesized successfully in the presence of collagen traces at mild acidic pH for the first time. However, the amount of doped Hg2+ and Cd2+ was relatively low. Meanwhile, through soaking the collagen sponge as a template in simulated body fluid (SBF) which contains different transition metal ions (Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Hg2+), bone-like HAP/collagen composites were synthesized. Hg2+ had a certain inhibitory effect on the formation of HAP crystals on the surface of the collagen sponge while Co2+ can promote the formation of HAP on the collagen sponge. For both HAP/collagen composites and HAP/collagen sponge, it was found that transition metal ions Mn2+ had a significant effect on the morphology of HAP particles and could induce to form floc-like HAP particle aggregates.

The cells of the two strains were observed to be cocci, non-motile and Gram-negative. The organisms were determined to be aerobic and required at least 6 % NaCl for growth (optimum 20-25 % and maximum 35 %). Growth was found to occur in the ranges of 16-50 degrees C (optimum 37 degrees C) and pH 6.0-8.5 (optimum 6.5-7.5). Cells did not lyse in distilled water. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains belongs to the genus Halalkalicoccus and possessed 99.3 and 99.5 % similarities with their closest phylogenetic relative Halalkalicoccus tibetensis JCM 11890(T). Major polar lipids of the two strains were determined to be phosphatidylglycerol(PG), phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester (PGP-Me), phosphatidylglycerol sulfate (PGS) and three unidentified glycolipids. The DNA G+C contents were determined to be 60.0-60.4 mol%. The DNA hybridization between the two strains was 92.0 %. In addition, the hybridizations of both strains to H. tibetensis were 49 and 52 %, respectively, and to Halalkalicoccus jeotali were 38 and 33 %, respectively. On the basis of physiological, biochemical tests and phylogenetic differentiations, strains YIM 93701(T) and YIM 93664 were classified as the same species which represent a novel species in the genus Halalkalicoccus, for which the name Halalkalicoccus paucihalophilus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 93701(T) (=JCM 17505(T) = CCT CC 2012803(T)).

The recognition mechanism was attributed to the remove Cu(II) from the 1,8-naphthalimide-Cu(II) ensemble by thiols and the release of flurescence of ligand 1. Remarkable fluorescence enhancements were therefore observed in the sensing process of thiols by the 1,8-naphthalimide-Cu(II) ensemble. Furthermore, the 1,8-naphthalimide-Cu(II) ensemble was successfully applied to the fluorescence imaging of thiols in CHO cells with high sensitivity and selectivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the 1970s, there were only a few known operators, for example, the derivative operator, the difference operator, the average operator, and the Rota-Baxter operator. A few more appeared after Rota posed his problem. However, little progress was made to solve this problem in general. In part, this is because the precise meaning of the problem is not so well understood. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the problem using the framework of operated algebras and viewing an associative algebra with a linear operator as one that satisfies a certain operated polynomial identity. This framework also allows us to apply theories of rewriting systems and Grobner-Shirshov bases. To narrow our focus more on the operators that Rota was interested in, we further consider two particular classes of operators, namely, those that generalize differential or Rota-Baxter operators. These two classes of operators correspond to those that possess Grobner-Shirshov bases under two different monomial orderings. Using this framework and computer algebra, we are able to come up with a list of these two classes of operators, and provide some evidence that these lists may be complete. Our search has revealed quite a few new operators of these types whose properties are expected to be similar to the differential operator and Rota-Baxter operator respectively. Recently, a more unified approach has emerged in related areas, such as difference algebra and differential algebra, and Rota-Baxter algebra and Nijenhuis algebra. The similarities in these theories can be more efficiently explored by advances on Rota's problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of multiple grey wolves, Chinese indigenous dogs and dogs of diverse breeds. Demographic analysis show that the split between wolves and Chinese indigenous dogs occurred 32,000 years ago and that the subsequent bottlenecks were mild. Therefore, dogs may have been under human selection over a much longer time than previously concluded, based on molecular data, perhaps by initially scavenging with humans. Population genetic analysis identifies a list of genes under positive selection during domestication, which overlaps extensively with the corresponding list of positively selected genes in humans. Parallel evolution is most apparent in genes for digestion and metabolism, neurological process and cancer. Our study, for the first time, draws together humans and dogs in their recent genomic evolution.

Single crystal X-ray analyses reveal that complexes 1, 2, and 3 are isomorphous, and the center Ln(III) ions are eight-coordinated. Alternate (mu(2)-eta(2):eta(1))(2) and (mu(2)-eta(1):eta(1))(2) type bridging modes by carboxylate ligands result in the formation of chain skeletons with two different Ln...Ln distances. However, in complex 4, Yb ions are seven-coordinated and bridged by a sole (mu(2)-eta(1):eta(1))(3) mode pnba. In the four complexes, radicals that are paramagnetic spin carriers are doped in as guest molecules and are located between the columns composed of Ln(III) ions through weak intermolecular interactions. In addition, short contact between O-Radical atoms with Ln(III) ions was observed. Careful inspection of the structures reveals that guest molecules have a significant function in determining the structure. Magnetic measurements were performed for complexes 1, 2, and 4. The magnetic studies show that very weak antiferromagnetic couplings exist between Cd-III-Cd-III in complex 1. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guan, L; Li, JP				Guan, Li; Li, Jianping			Coordination mechanism for selfish scheduling under a grade of service provision	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Scheduling; Selfish scheduling; Grade of service; Coordination mechanism; Makespan; Price of anarchy		In this paper, we study the problem of selfish scheduling game under a grade of service provision, where all machines and all jobs are labeled with the different grade of service (GoS) levels such that a job J can be assigned to execute on machine M only when the GoS level of machine M is not higher than the GoS level of job J. We consider two coordination mechanisms for this selfish scheduling game: the makespan policy and the LG-LPT policy. For the first mechanism, we show that the price of anarchy is exactly 3/2 for two machines and Theta(log m/log log m) for m (>= 3) machines, respectively. For the second mechanism, we point out that the price of anarchy is 5/4 for two machines and 2 - 1/m-1 for m (>= 3) machines, respectively, and we finally analyze the convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the induced game.

Its high environmental adaptability might be attributable to its genome dynamics, which can be estimated through comparative genomic analysis targeting microorganisms with close phylogenetic relationships but different phenotypes. To shed light on speciation, gene content evolution, and environmental adaptation in these unique actinobacteria, we sequenced draft genomes for 16 representative species of the genus and compared them with that of the type species N. dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111(T). The core genome of 1,993 orthologous and paralogous gene clusters was identified, and the pan-genomic reservoir was found not only to accommodate more than 22,000 genes, but also to be open. The top ten paralogous genes in terms of copy number could be referred to three functional categories: transcription regulators, transporters, and synthases related to bioactive metabolites. Based on phylogenomic reconstruction, we inferred past evolutionary events, such as gene gains and losses, and identified a list of clade-specific genes implicated in environmental adaptation. These results provided insights into the genetic causes of environmental adaptability in this cosmopolitan actinobacterial group and the contributions made by its inherent features, including genome dynamics and the constituents of core and accessory proteins.

Formation of charge-transfer-complex in organic: metal oxides systems	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; GENERATION; INTERFACE; LAYER; BULK; HOLE	It is found that composite systems consisting of 4,4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) form an IR absorption band around 847 nm. It is also found that the vibrational modes of the CBP, as measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, are quenched upon the formation of charge-transfer-complex (CTC) between CBP and MoO3. By examining several sets of organic: metal oxides systems, we discovered that the IR absorption band of the CTCs follow two distinct mechanisms depending on the nature and location of the HOMOs in the organic molecules.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	OBSERVATION OF TeV GAMMA RAYS FROM THE UNIDENTIFIED SOURCE HESS J1841-055 WITH THE ARGO-YBJ EXPERIMENT	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma rays: general	CYGNUS REGION; DETECTOR; CALIBRATION; EMISSION	We report the observation of a very high energy gamma-ray source whose position is coincident with HESS J1841-055. This source has been observed for 4.5 years by the ARGO-YBJ experiment from 2007 November to 2012 July. Its emission is detected with a statistical significance of 5.3 standard deviations. Parameterizing the source shape with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, we estimate an extension sigma = (0.40(-0.22)(+0.32))degrees, which is consistent with the HESS measurement. The observed energy spectrum is dN/dE = (9.0 +/- 1.6) x 10(-13)(E/5 TeV)(-2.32 +/- 0.23) photons cm(-2) s(-1) TeV-1, in the energy range 0.9-50 TeV. The integral gamma-ray flux above 1 TeV is 1.3 +/- 0.4 Crab, which is 3.2 +/- 1.0 times the flux derived by HESS. The differences in the flux determination between HESS and ARGO-YBJ and possible counterparts at other wavelengths are discussed.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

Based on M-matrix theory and analytic methods, some sufficient conditions are established for the existence and global exponential stability of a unique equilibrium. Moreover, the exponential convergence rate index is estimated. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. In particular, the simulation figures establish that fuzzy systems do have more advantages than non-fuzzy systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After a long period of destructive exploitation including agriculture development, overlogging for timber and cutting for fuel-wood, these forests are being allowed to reestablish themselves. A large area is now dominated by the conifer Pinus yunnanensis forest which has naturally regenerated and represents an early intermediate stage in the reestablishment of the evergreen broad-leaved forest. In 2006, a mega-fire burned approximately 18.49 km(2) of this forest. The Pious is growing back. To examine the process of regeneration dynamics and recovery of the Pinus community after the mega-fire, we investigated plant communities in burned and unburned areas, including a P. yunnanensis shrubland regenerated after the fire, a P. yunnanensis forest without fire occurrence, a P. yunnanensis and Lithocarpus mairei mixed forest, and a Castanopsis orthacantha and Lithocarpus dealbatus evergreen broad-leaved forest, as well as a plantation of P. yunnanensis. Abundant seedlings and saplings of P. yunnanensis and some light-demanding deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved tree species were found in the Pinus shrubland five years after the fire. The frequency distribution by height-classes after the fire was of an inverse-J type, representing very good regeneration. We used space-for-time substitution to obtain an understanding of the directions and pathways of the succession. The approximate successional trend in the area was from the Pinus shrubland to the Pinus forest, then to the mixed coniferous and evergreen broad-leaved Pinus-Lithocarpus forest, then to the evergreen broad-leaved Castanopsis-Lithocaipus forest. In the early successional stage, the floristic richness and species diversity of the Pinus shrubland had lower values as compared to those in the middle and late successional stages, but much higher than those of the Pinus plantation. Our results indicate that the natural recovery of P. yunnanensis after the fire was more efficient than that of a man-made forest of the same species. Nature's process outpaced human intervention.

Moreover, if the count data are distributed as a generalized Poisson or a negative binomial distribution that accommodates extra variation not explained by a simple Poisson or a binomial model, then the dispersion occurs too. In this paper, we deal with a class of two-component zero-inflated generalized Poisson mixture regression models to fit such data and propose a local influence measure procedure for model comparison and statistical diagnostics. At first, we formally develop a general model framework that unifies zero inflation, mixture as well as overdispersion/underdispersion simultaneously, and then we mainly investigate two types of perturbation schemes, the global and individual perturbation schemes, for perturbing various model assumptions and detecting influential observations. Also, we obtain the corresponding local influence measures. Our method is novel for count data analysis and can be used to explore these essential issues such as zero inflation, mixture, and dispersion related to zero-inflated generalized Poisson mixture models. On the basis of the results of model comparison, we could further conduct the sensitivity analysis of perturbation as well as hypothesis test with more accuracy. Finally, we employ here a simulation study and a real example to illustrate the proposed local influence measures. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The functional monomer is 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-methacryloyl-5-pyrazolone (PMMP), which is a new beta-diketone compound with enol/ketol tautomerization. In this study, imprinting parameters, including the amounts of functional monomer and cross-linker, and immersion time of membrane in the imprinting solution, were optimized by equilibrium adsorption experiments. Pore structure and surface morphology of the optimal MICM (MICM2) was characterized. Finally, competitive permeability of PPT in the presence of its analog 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin (DMEP) was measured under the drive of concentration difference. The results reveal that the surface morphology and pore structure of MICM2 are structurally different from those of the control nonimprinted membrane. As a result, MICM2 could efficiently recognize PPT in a complex system due to a better structural matching and the interaction between the functional groups of MICM2 and PPT. However, the most interesting finding is its pH-controllability. The membrane could switch the preference to either PPT or DMEP with the change of pH values in the sample solution. At pH values smaller than 8.4, it led to a faster transportation of PPT, while the situation reversed to DMEP at pH values greater than 8.4. This peculiar property would lead this imprinted membrane to have potential application in the separation and enrichment of PPT, and the new functional monomer PMMP exhibited an attractive application prospect in the functional material fields.

Suppose the pumping of Ca2+ into the calcium store takes time tau(1), and the release of Ca2+ from that store into the cytosol takes time tau(2). The simulation results indicate that: (i) There is a critical value tau(c) similar or equal to 0.1 s of tau(1), i.e., as tau(1) < tau(c), increasing tau(1) can restrain ICO and convert the structure of the stationary probability distribution (SPD) of the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations from two peaks to one peak. However, in contrast, if tau(1) > tau(c), increasing tau(1) can convert the SPD to the opposite and change the Ca2+ concentrations from desynchronous oscillation to periodically synchronous oscillation; (ii) Increasing tau(2) converts the SPD from two peaks to one peak and restrains ICO; (iii) As tau(2) increases a coherence resonance with respect to tau(1) occurs in the system, but it is inhibited by increasing the external noise.

Although a number of researches have been done, the general properties of combinatorial transcriptional regulatory elements, including their patterns and distributions, are still not well understood. Specially, the understanding for laws of transcriptional regulation involving introns is challenging. Here, we performed statistical analyses on potentially interacting motif pairs in human housekeeping genes and tissue-specific genes of some tissues. We first identified transcriptional regulatory motifs in promoter sequences, including the first introns, using a sequence-based approach which incorporates several different sequence backgrounds. And then we predicted the potentially interacting motif pairs using Hypergeometric distribution and Mann-Whitney U-test. The validation of the predicted interacting motif pairs has been carried out via analyses of orthologous conservation and enrichment. The distribution characteristics of the identified motif pairs were examined using a probability model. We found that interacting motif pairs have some significant preferences in location, distance and orientation in housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. The results suggest that the features of transcriptional regulation in housekeeping genes are different from the tissue-specific genes. Besides, location preferences of the motif pairs provide clues to the way of the introns participating in transcriptional regulation in different tissue-specific genes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that compared with no incubated nucleation treatment, the solidification microstructures of Au-Sn eutectic alloy are modified greatly by incubated nucleation treatment with Au or Sn. The structure, the morphology and the size of the primary phase are also changed. The primary phase transforms into delta-AuSn phase with the shape of rod or egg of uniform distribution and small size from conventional zeta'-Au5Sn phase with coarse dendrite of non-uniform distribution. The primary delta-AuSn phase in the solidification microstructure becomes more uniform by adding trace Sn than by adding trace Au. Meanwhile the eutectic structure is also refined by the incubated nucleation treatment.

EMENDED DESCRIPTION; IDENTIFICATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; SOIL	A novel actinobacterium MBRL 251(T), isolated from a sample collected from a limestone quarry at Hundung, Manipur, India, was characterized using a polyphasic approach. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of strain MBRL 251(T) showed closest similarities with Streptomyces xanthochromogenes NRRL B-5410(T) (99.6%) and Streptomyces michiganensis NBRC 12797(T) (99.6%). The DNA relatedness between MBRL 251(T) and S. xanthochromogenes NBRC 12828(T), and S. michiganensis NBRC 12797(T)was 46.6% and 40.7%, respectively. Strain MBRL 251(T)contained LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, with glucose and xylose as the main cell wall sugars, whereas small amounts of galactose, mannose, rhamnose and ribose were also detected in the whole-cell wall hydrolysates. The major fatty acids identified were anteiso-C-15:0 (35.1%), iso-C-16:0 (21.1%) and anteiso-C-17:1 (13.2%). The predominant menaquinones detected were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8), whereas the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositolmannosides. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.3%. The phenotypic and genotypic data showed that strain MBRL 251(T) merits the recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces. It is proposed that the isolate should be classified in the genus Streptomyces as a novel species, Streptomyces hundungensis sp. nov. The type strain is MBRL 251(T)(= JCM 17577(T) = KCTC 29124(T)).

J	Zhao, ZF; Wu, WC; Mao, YJ				Zhao, Zhifang; Wu, Wenchun; Mao, Yujing			A spatially explicit assessment and analysis of water-eroded desertification and its combating in Yunnan Province, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						water-eroded desertification; remote sensing survey; comprehensive geologic cause analysis; prevention and control; Yunnan		In a study on water-eroded desertification in Yunnan Province, we used remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to determine the areas of water-eroded desertified land objectively, to analyze the spatial distribution and causes of desertification in association with the geologic background, and to propose the appropriate measures for prevention and control. We found that the area of water-eroded desertification in 2008 was 35,949.69 km(2), accounting for 9.39% of the total land area in Yunnan. The main reason of desertification is the combined impact of the development of geologic structures and specific lithology. Human factors exacerbate and sometimes induce the desertification. We recommend that the desertification prevention and control should focus on the desertification-prone areas, including the neighboring regions of active faults such as the Jinsha RiverHong River fault, YuanmouLuzhi River fault, FuyuanMile fault, WenshanMalipo fault, Nanpan River fault, Xiao River fault, and QujingZhaotong fault; the sedimentary and Quaternary regions covered by mudstone, clay stone, and carbonate rocks; and the neotectonic regions such as the fold-style uplift region in east Yunnan, the secondary uplift region in southeast Yunnan, and the large block-style uplift region in central Yunnan. The population pressure should be reduced and industrial activities such as construction and mining should be more strictly regulated to prevent human activities from exacerbating water-eroded desertification.

J	Tao, Y; Cao, J; Hu, JM; Dai, ZC				Tao, Yun; Cao, Jie; Hu, Jinming; Dai, Zhicheng			A cusp catastrophe model of mid-long-term landslide evolution over low latitude highlands of China	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Landslide; Catastrophe theory; Cusp catastrophe model; Mid-long-term evolution; Low-latitude highlands	INSTABILITY; MECHANISMS; SLOPE	Based on a model describing a certain landslide case and catastrophe theory, we derived a cusp catastrophe model and corresponding inversion method to study mid-long-term landslide evolution. According to data of landslides, precipitation, and socioeconomic development from 1976 to 2008, the cusp catastrophe model describing this landslide evolution across a low-latitude highland area in China is obtained with the least squares method. Results of the model indicate that human activity determines landslide intensity. Local precipitation also impacts yearly landslide intensity to some extent, and controls the time when a strong and abrupt change in landslides occurs. During the period 1976-2008, there was an abrupt decrease of landslide intensity during 1994-1995, and an abrupt increase during 1995-1996. Since then, there have been frequent landslides in the low-latitude highland, with greater intensity. All these factors provide a scientific basis for formulating a contingency plan regarding landslide disasters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The samples are composed of SnO2 nanorods with length of ca. 80 nm and possess high BET surface area of 163.25 m(2) g(-1). The synthesized SnO2 electrode shows a high specific capacity (ca. 620 mAh g(-1)), an excellent cycling stability and a good rate capability but low initial coulombic efficiency. The nanorods characteristics of SnO2 ensure the fast Li-ion diffusion in the electrode. The loose network structure provides the electrode with a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change, and thus avoids the electrode to pulverize in the charge-discharge process. Therefore, the obtained SnO2 electrode shows a good cyclic stability and a high rate performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although physical or chemical control of the blooms is possible in short period, these methods could cause other problems. Thus, there is still a need for research on biological factors controlling cyanobacteria blooms. We screened part of the Yunnan University actinomycete strain library and found that the extract of Streptomyces hebeiensis YIM 001(T) exhibited obvious inhibition on M. aeruginosa. The main component - nanaomycin A methyl ester (NAME) was isolated at a level of 20 mg L-1 by scale-up fermentation. Lytic mechanism experiments of NAME on M. aeruginosa demonstrated it could effectively inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa (EC50 at 72 h = 2.97 mg L-1), hinder cell division and enlarge cell size. NAME damaged M. aeruginosa cells as evidenced by decreases in algal activity, biomass, esterase activity and chlorophyll-a content. The SOD activity of the treated cells initially increased, and then decreased together with a gradual increase in both O-2(-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, consistent with inhibitory effects of NAME due to lipid peroxidation damage of the algal cell membrane. The results suggest that NAME is effective for controlling undesired cyanobacteria and the Chl-fluorescence is a potential endpoint to assay the NAME eco-toxicity on cyanobacteria.

Electrochemical study of Ni deposition on carbon microfiber	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Electrodeposition; Nucleation and growth; Carbon fiber; Nucleation model	ELECTROLESS DEPOSITION; NICKEL DEPOSITION; NANOTUBES; GRAPHITE	Electrochemical deposition of Ni on individual carbon microfiber from unbuffered NiCl2 solutions was studied for surface functionalization. Electrochemical and micro-structural analyses have been utilized to reveal ion concentration, applied potential and solution pH effects on the deposit nucleation and growth. Metal deposition efficiency on the carbon surface from these aqueous solutions increases significantly with Ni ion concentration. Polycrystalline Ni are normally formed but small amount of Ni(OH)(2) has been detected when the very low concentration solution is used. Ni electrodeposition on carbon microfiber surface changes from the progressive nucleation model at lower applied over-potentials to the instantaneous nucleation model at higher applied over-potentials before hydrogen evolution dominates. Compared to the conventionally used acidic Ni electrodeposition solutions, reproducible layered growth was observed within a wide range of deposition potentials due to formation of adsorbed intermediate layer.

Five isocaloric diets were formulated to contain graded levels of protein (29, 34, 39, 44, and 49%). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish in a recirculating rearing system maintained at 1721C. Feed intake of fish fed the 39 and 44% protein diets was significantly higher than that of fish fed the 29, 34, and 49% protein diets (P<0.05). Weight gain and protein gain significantly increased with increasing dietary protein level up to 39% (P<0.05), but no significant differences were observed among fish fed the 39, 44, and 49% protein diets (0.05). In contrast, feed conversion ratio decreased with increasing dietary protein level up to 39%. Protein retention efficiency or protein efficiency ratio generally increased with increasing dietary protein level up to 39%, and then the value gradually decreased thereafter. Broken-line regression analysis showed that the optimum dietary protein requirement for maximum weight gain of juvenile A. grahami under the experimental conditions was 38.6% (equivalent to ca. 33.0% estimated digestible protein).

It is found that the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distribution of 3C 66A can be well reproduced; in particular, the first three months of its average Fermi-LAT spectrum can be well reproduced by the synchrotron self-Compton component plus external Compton component of the broad line region (BLR). Clues to its redshift and gamma-ray emission location are obtained. The results indicate the following. (i) On the redshift: The theoretical intrinsic TeV spectra can be predicted by extrapolating the reproduced GeV spectra. Through comparing these extrapolated TeV spectra with the corrected observed TeV spectra from extragalactic background light, it is suggested that the redshift of 3C 66A could be between 0.1 and 0.3, with the most likely value being similar to 0.2. (ii) On the gamma-ray emission location: To well reproduce the GeV emission of 3C 66A under different assumptions on the BLR, the gamma-ray emission region is always required to be beyond the inner zone of the BLR. The BLR absorption effect on gamma-ray emission confirms this point.

Strain specific variation in intracellular and extracellular polysaccharide production was quantified under laboratory conditions. Among the fungi examined, Agrocybe aegirita Mo-Aa was found to produce high amount (3.77 g/L) of total polysaccharide. Furthermore, optimization of production conditions for A. aegirita Mo-Aa polysaccharide was conducted in submerged culture. Production of A. aegirita Mo-Aa polysaccharide was optimal at pH 5.0, an inoculation size of 480 mg/L, culture period of 9 days and mushroom fermentation medium.

However, antifungal drug discovery is hindered by the evolutionary similarity of mammalian and fungal cells, which results in fungal drug targets having human homologs and drug non-selectivity. The group III hybrid histidine kinases (HHKs) are an attractive drug target since they are conserved in fungi and absent in mammals. We used a Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain that conditionally expresses HHK to establish a high-throughput bioassay to screen microbial extracts natural products for antifungals. We identified macrotetrolides, a group of related ionophores thought to exhibit restricted antifungal activity. In addition to confirming the use of this bioassay for the discovery of antifungal natural products, we demonstrated broader, more potent fungistatic activity of the macrotetrolides against multiple Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Candida albicans in biofilms. Macrotetrolides were also active in an animal model of C. albicans biofilm, but were found to have inconsistent activity against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, with most isolates resistant to this natural product. The macrotetrolides do not directly target HHKs, but their selective activity against S. cerevisiae grown in galactose (regardless of Drk1 expression) revealed potential new insight into the role of ion transport in the mode of action of these promising antifungal compounds. Thus, this simple, high-throughput bioassay permitted us to screen microbial extracts, identify natural products as antifungal drugs, and expand our understanding of the activity of macrotetrolides.

The emission spectrum shows a dominant peak at 594 nm due to the D-5(0) -> F-7(1) transition of Eu3+. The excitation spectrum is coupled well with the emission of UV LED (350-410 nm). The effect of Eu3+ concentration on the luminescent properties of MgAl(PO4)O:Eu3+ and the mechanism of concentration quenching of Eu3+ are studied. The results show that MgAl(PO4)O:Eu3+ is a promising red-emitting phosphor for white LEDs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

However, a comprehensive and detailed understanding of microbial diversity in these hot springs is still lacking. In this study, bacterial and archaeal diversities were investigated in 16 hot springs (pH3.28.6; temperature 4796 degrees C) in Yunnan Province and Tibet, China by using a barcoded 16S rRNA gene-pyrosequencing approach. Aquificae, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Bacteroidetes comprised the large portion of the bacterial communities in acidic hot springs. Non-acidic hot springs harboured more and variable bacterial phyla than acidic springs. Desulfurococcales and unclassified Crenarchaeota were the dominated groups in archaeal populations from most of the non-acidic hot springs; whereas, the archaeal community structure in acidic hot springs was simpler and characterized by Sulfolobales and Thermoplasmata. The phylogenetic analyses showed that Aquificae and Crenarchaeota were predominant in the investigated springs and possessed many phylogenetic lineages that have never been detected in other hot springs in the world. Thus findings from this study significantly improve our understanding of microbial diversity in terrestrial hot springs.

The trophic state of Lake Dianchi has increased rapidly during recent decades, its macrophyte vegetation has suffered severe degradation, and fish introductions in the late 1950s and early 1980s have had a marked effect on the structure of the fish community. Our results show an increase in abundance of cladoceran species with a preference for eutrophic conditions over the last few decades, while species preferring oligotrophic conditions have decreased or disappeared. These changes correspond to the eutrophication in Lake Dianchi. The loss of the cladocerans Kurzia latissima and Disparalona rostrata is likely to be a reflection of the degradation of the macrophyte community. An increase in Daphnia body size indicated by the ephippia length since the early 1990s is associated with the decline of planktivorous species.

Due to the catalysis of BSA-AgNCs, ascorbic acid could reduce Ag+ to silver nanoparticles (NPs) at room temperature. The color of the mixture changed from colorless to yellow and a strong absorption band near 420 nm could be found in their absorption spectra owing to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of produced silver NPs. The absorbance changes at 420 nm had a good relationship with ascorbic acid concentration. Thus, we proposed a spectrophotometric and colorimetric method to determine ascorbic acid in concentration range from 2.0 to 50.0 mu M, with the corresponding limits of determination (3 sigma) of 0.16 mu M.

Discovering colocations has many useful applications. For example, colocated plant species discovered from plant distribution data sets can contribute to the analysis of plant geography, phytosociology studies, and plant protection recommendations. In this paper, we study the colocation mining problem in the context of uncertain data, as the data generated from a wide range of data sources are inherently uncertain. One straightforward method to mine the prevalent colocations in a spatially uncertain data set is to simply compute the expected participation index of a candidate and decide if it exceeds a minimum prevalence threshold. Although this definition has been widely adopted, it misses important information about the confidence which can be associated with the participation index of a colocation. We propose another definition, probabilistic prevalent colocations, trying to find all the colocations that are likely to be prevalent in a randomly generated possible world. Finding probabilistic prevalent colocations (PPCs) turn out to be difficult. First, we propose pruning strategies for candidates to reduce the amount of computation of the probabilistic participation index values. Next, we design an improved dynamic programming algorithm for identifying candidates. This algorithm is suitable for parallel computation, and approximate computation. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods proposed as well as the pruning strategies and the optimization techniques are verified by extensive experiments with "real + synthetic" spatially uncertain data sets.

Different features of consecutive extreme visibility events in large, medium and small cities were compared. According to the spatial characteristics of consecutive extreme visibility events, China can be divided into two main regions: one region extends from the north part of northern China and westwards to northwestern China and the western part of southwestern China, where consecutive good visibility events have much higher frequency than do other regions, which include the southern parts of northeastern and northern China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southern China. The degradation of visibility in consecutive extreme visibility events in the northern part of China is less than that in the southern part, and an increased visibility value during these events was found in the northern part of northern China. The frequency of consecutive good visibility events decreased in all cities especially after 1980, and their regression coefficients reached a minimum in small cities and a maximum in large cities.

Egg white protein (EWP) was selenized by dry-heating in the presence of selenite, and the physiochemical and functional properties of the selenized EWP were investigated. Selenization was accelerated with a decrease in pH from 7.0 to 3.0, an increase in heating time from 1 to 5 days, and an increase in incubation temperatures from 25 to 80 degrees C. The electrophoretic mobility of EWP increased with an increase in the level of selenization. Heat-induced polymerization of EWP was promoted by dry-heating in the presence of selenite. The selenite group was acid-stable and base-labile, which suggests that it was bound to the hydroxyl group of an amino acid and Formed an -O-SeHO2 linkage. Se-77 NMR spectral data also suggested that the selenite bond (-O-SeHO2) was bound to EWP. The digestibility of EWP was improved by selenization. The antioxidant activities of EWP, including ABTS(+) free radical scavenging capacity, hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, reducing power, and the Fe2+ chelating capacity, were remarkably enhanced by selenization. This finding is the first to describe that EWP can be selenized by dry-heating in the presence of selenite and that the antioxidant activities of EWP are markedly enhanced by selenization. This points to a potentially new method for generating antioxidant food protein and a new method for preparing organic Se.

Their structures were elucidated on the basis of the interpretation of spectral data and by comparison of the corresponding data with those reported previously. The p-terphenyl 1 showed antifungal activity against the three pathogenic fungi, including Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium graminearum, and Fusarium culmorum, that caused Fusarium head blight with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8, 16, and 128 mu g/mL, respectively. Compound 1 showed antifungal activity against Candida albicans with a MIC of 32 mu g/mL and antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis with a MIC of 64 mu g/mL. Novobiocin 4 showed antifungal activity against Pyricularia oryzae with a MIC of 16 mu g/mL and antibacterial activity against B. subtilis with a MIC of 16 mu g/mL and Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC of 64 mu g/mL. The 1,1-diplkenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl assay suggested that 1, 3, and 4 exhibited 54.9% (2 mg/mL), 14.3% (4 mg/mL), and 47.7% (2 mg/mL) free radical scavenging activity, respectively. The positively charged 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical (ABTS(+center dot)) scavenging assay indicated that 1, 3, 4, and 8 exhibited 68.6% (1 mg/mL), 28.4% (2 mg/mL), 78.2% (0.5 mg/mL), and 54.6% (2 mg/mL) ABTS(+center dot) scavenging capacity, respectively. The superoxide anion radical scavenging assay suggested that 4 exhibited 77.9% superoxide anion radical scavenging capacity at 2 mg/mL. N. gilva YIM 90087 is a new resource for novobiocin 4.

In this study, we explored the genetic risk differences among human populations in metabolism (catabolism and biosynthesis) of energy substances, including lipids, carbohydrates and amino acids. Results: Two genotype datasets (Hapmap and 1000 Genome) were used for this study. The genetic risks of protein functional changing variants (PFCVs) on genes involved in lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were calculated using two genetic risk indices: the total number of PFCVs (Num) and the total possibly harmful score of PFCVs (R). Observations in these two genotype datasets consistently showed that Africans had lower genetic risk in lipid metabolism (both catabolic and biosynthetic processes) compared to Europeans. However this relationship was not observed in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Conclusions: Our results suggested that Africans had higher efficiency of utilizing lipids as energy substances than Europeans. In other words, lipids might be more preferred as energy substances in Africans than in Europeans.

To locate the geographic origin of goldfish, we analyzed nucleotide sequences from part of the control region (CR) and the entire cytochrome b (Cytb) mitochondrial DNA genes for 234 goldfish and a large series of native specimens. Four important morphological characteristics used in goldfish taxonomy-body shape, dorsal fin, eye shape, and tailfin-were selected for hypothesis-testing to identify those that better correspond to evolutionary history. Principal Finding: Haplotypes of goldfish rooted in two sublineages (C5 and C6), which contained the haplotypes of native C. a. auratus from southern China. Values of F-ST and N-m revealed a close relationship between goldfish and native C. a. auratus from the lower Yangtze River. An extraordinary, stepwise loss of genetic diversity was detected from native fish to goldfish and from Grass-goldfish relative to other breeds. Significantly negative results for the tests of Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D* and F* were identified in goldfish, including the Grass breed. The results identified eye-shape as being the least informative character for grouping goldfish with respect to their evolutionary history. Fisher's exact test identified matrilineal constraints on domestication. Conclusions: Chinese goldfish have a matrilineal origin from native southern Chinese C. a. auratus, especially the lineages from the lower Yangtze River. Anthropogenic selection of the native Carassius eliminated aesthetically unappealing goldfish and this action appeared to be responsible for the stepwise decrease in genetic diversity of domesticated goldfish, a process similar to that reported for the domestication of pigs, rice, and maize. The three-breed taxonomy-Grass-goldfish, Egg-goldfish, and Wen-goldfish-better reflected the history of domestication.

Two new pathways for H-2 elimination were identified. The first one proceeds through a concerted mechanism which involves the loss of a alpha-hydrogen along with the hydroxyl hydrogen. The second pathway involves the step-wise loss of the two alpha-hydrogen atoms. The previously proposed mechanism initiated by nucleophilic attack proved to be not involved in the H-2 elimination pathway. Two previously proposed pathways for CO elimination from glycolate proceeds through nucleophlic attack of the carboxylic oxygen on the alpha-carbon and through hydrogen transfers were confirmed by our theoretical calculations. The pathway leading to the CH2O elimination from glycolate was found to be branched from the intermediate formed after the nucleophlic attack. The identified pathways and calculated energy barriers well rationalized the experimentally observed fragment ions and their relative peak intensities of mass spectrums. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Through analyzing the effects of delay time and initial position on the risks and returns of stock investment, the results indicate that: (i) There is an optimal delay time matching minimal risks of stock investment, maximal average stock price returns and strongest stability of stock price returns for strong elasticity of demand of stocks (EDS), but the opposite results for weak EDS; (ii) The increment of initial position recedes the risks of stock investment, strengthens the average stock price returns and enhances stability of stock price returns. Finally, the probability density function of stock price returns and the probability density function of volatility and the correlation function of stock price returns are compared with other literatures. In addition, good agreements are found between them. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article presents five simultaneous confidence intervals and two bootstrap simultaneous confidence intervals for risk differences in stratified matched-pair designs. The proposed confidence intervals are evaluated with respect to their coverage probabilities, expected widths, and ratios of the mesial noncoverage to noncoverage probability. Empirical results show that (1) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals outperform nonhybrid simultaneous confidence intervals; (2) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals based on median estimator outperform those based on maximum likelihood estimator; and (3) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals incorporated with Wilson score and Agresti coull intervals and the bootstrap t-percentile simultaneous interval based on median unbiased estimators behave satisfactorily for small to large sample sizes in the sense that their empirical coverage probabilities are close to the prespecified nominal confidence level, and their ratios of the mesial noncoverage to noncoverage probabilities lie in [0.4,0.6] and are hence recommended. Real examples from clinical studies are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

PHASE-AVERAGED SPECTRA AND LUMINOSITIES OF GAMMA-RAY EMISSIONS FROM YOUNG ISOLATED PULSARS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma rays: stars; pulsars: general; stars: neutron	RAPIDLY SPINNING PULSARS; OUTER-GAP MODEL; DEPENDENT LIGHT CURVES; HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; RESOLVED X-RAY; RADIATION; GEMINGA; VELA; DISCOVERY; PROFILES	We study the phase-averaged spectra and luminosities of gamma-ray emissions from young, isolated pulsars within a revised outer gap model. In the revised version of the outer gap, there are two possible cases for the outer gaps: the fractional size of the outer gap is estimated through the photon-photon pair process in the first case (Case I), and is limited by the critical field lines in the second case (Case II). The fractional size is described by Case I if the fractional size at the null charge surface in Case I is smaller than that in Case II, and vice versa. Such an outer gap can extend from the inner boundary, whose radial distance to the neutron star is less than that of the null charge surface to the light cylinder for a gamma-ray pulsar with a given magnetic inclination. When the shape of the outer gap is determined, assuming that high-energy emission at an averaged radius of the field line in the center of the outer gap, with a Gaussian distribution of the parallel electric field along the gap height, represents typical emission, the phase-averaged gamma-ray spectrum for a given pulsar can be estimated in the revised model with three model parameters. We apply the model to explain the phase-averaged spectra of the Vela (Case I) and Geminga (Case II) pulsars. We also use the model to fit the phase-averaged spectra of 54 young, isolated gamma-ray pulsars, and then calculate the gamma-ray luminosities and compare them with the observed data from Fermi-LAT.

After assuming two possible EEDs formed in different acceleration models: the shock-accelerated power law with exponential cut-off (PLC) EED and the stochastic-turbulence-accelerated log-parabolic (LP) EED, we fit the observed SEDs of Mrk 421 in both low and giant flare states using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which constrains the model parameters in a more efficient way. The results from our calculations indicate that (1) the PLC and LP models give comparably good fits for the SED in the low state, but the variations of model parameters from low state to flaring can be reasonably explained only in the case of the PLC in the low state; and (2) the LP model gives better fits compared to the PLC model for the SED in the flare state, and the intra-day/night variability observed at GeV-TeV bands can be accommodated only in the LP model. The giant flare may be attributed to the stochastic turbulence re-acceleration of the shock-accelerated electrons in the low state. Therefore, we may conclude that shock acceleration is dominant in the low state, while stochastic turbulence acceleration is dominant in the flare state. Moreover, our result shows that the extrapolated TeV spectra from the best-fit SEDs from optical through GeV with the two EEDs are different. It should be considered with caution when such extrapolated TeV spectra are used to constrain extragalactic background light models.

(COLEOPTERA: COCCINELLIDAE)	COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN			English	Article						seven-spotted ladybird beetle; monochromatic light; illumination intensity; light wavelengths	LIGHT	We studied the behavioral response of the seven-spotted ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., (Coleoptera, Coccinellinae) to various light wavelengths and intensities. Significant differences in the phototactic responses of beetles to 15 wavelengths of monochromatic light and white light were found. High phototactic response rates were observed to red light (649 nm) and ultraviolet (UV) light (340 nm), whereas low response rates were seen to green light, the species thus exhibiting a U-shaped response across the spectrum. The beetle also showed variation in response to 10 different illumination intensities. For a range of light intensities from 10 to 190 lux, beetles were generally more sensitive to ultraviolet light (340 nm) and red light (649 nm) than green light (510 nm) or white light. Differences in beetle response to various specific wavelengths were smallest in dim light (10 lux). The responses to ultraviolet and red light compared to those to green and white light were higher across all light intensity levels tested. The phototactic response to illumination intensity was correlated with light wavelengths, but there was no common trend across the three wavelengths of monochromatic light and white light. This experiment will help provide a scientific basis for the development of selected color traps used in insect pest management.

The isolate was found to be a natural producer of the synthesized antitumour agent deoxynyboquinone and its three new derivatives, pseudonocardians A, B and C. A BLAST search based on almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain SCSIO 01299(T) had high sequence similarities with members of the genus Pseudonocardia. The 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic tree revealed that strain SCSIO 01299(T) was a member of the genus Pseudonocardia. Phenotypic analysis, chemotaxonomy and DNA-DNA relatedness could readily distinguish the isolate from established members in this genus. It was concluded that strain SCSIO 01299(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Pseudonocardia antitumoralis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SCSIO 01299(T) (=DSM 45322(T) = CCTCC M 2011255(T)).

NOV; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SALT LAKE; CHINA; RECLASSIFICATION; SEQUENCES; PROPOSAL; MIXTURES	A marine bacterium, designated SCSIO 03483(T), was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea. The strain produced roundish colonies with diffusible yellow-coloured pigment on nutrient agar medium or marine agar 2216. Optimal growth occurred in the presence of 0-4 % (w/v) NaCI, at pH 7.0 and a temperature range of 28-37 degrees C. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolate belonged to the family Flavobacteriaceae and showed relatively high sequence similarity with Imtechella halotolerans K1(T) (92.7%). Phylogenetic analysis based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate shared a lineage with members of the genera Imtechella, Joostella and Zhouia. Phospholipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and three unknown polar lipids. The major respiratory quinone was MK-6 and the major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c/C-16:1 omega 7c). The DNA G+C content of strain SCSIO 03483(T) was 38.4 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular data, strain SCSIO 03483(T) represents a novel species in a new genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Sinomicrobium oceani gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Sinobacterium oceani is SCSIO 03483(T) (=KCTC 23994(T=)CGMCC 1.12145(T)).

Strain 14-2A(T) was found to be Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, non-flagellated and rod-shaped. The new isolate was able to grow at 4-42 degrees C, pH 6.0-9.0 and with 0-5 % NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolate belongs to the family Sphingobacteriaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 14-2A(T) showed the highest similarity with Olivibacter oleidegradans TBF2/20.2(T) (99.4%), followed by Pseudosphingobacterium domesticum DC-186(T) (93.8 %), Olivibacter ginsengisoli Gsoil 060(T) (93.6%), Olivibacter terrae Jip13(T) (93.1 %), Olivibacter soli Gsoil 034(T) (92.8%) and Olivibacter sitiensis AW-6(T) (89.6%). The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains 14-2A(T) and O. oleidegradans TBF2/20.2(T) was 34.45 +/- 2.11 %. Strain 14-2A(T) contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, aminophospholipid and phosphatidylinositol mannoside as the major polar lipids. The DNA G+C content was 41.2 mol%. MK-7 is the major isoprenoid quinone. Summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:0 3-OH are the major fatty acids. The phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data confirmed the affiliation of strain 14-2A(T) to the genus Olivibacter. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, and chemotaxonomic data, strain 14-2A(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Olivibacter, for which the name Olivibacter jilunii sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 14-2A(T) (=KCTC 23098(T)=CCTCC AB 2010105(T)).

The dopant, host, as well as molybdenum oxide (MoO3)-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) anode were investigated. It is found that the devices ITO/MoO3 (0 or 1 nm)/fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium [Ir(ppy)(3)]:1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) (30 -> 0 wt%, 105 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20%, which are comparable to multi-layered PHOLEDs. Moreover, the systematic variation of the host from TPBi to 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen), dopant from Ir(ppy)(3) to bis(2-phenylpyridine)(acetylacetonate)iridium [Ir(ppy)(2)(acac)], and anodes between ITO and ITO/MoO3 indicates that balancing the charge as well as controlling the charge recombination zone play critical roles in the design of highly efficient two component PHOLEDs.

The gamma irradiated PBO fiber composite had the highest inter-laminar shear strength value of all the combinations because its higher bond strength may have hindered a large fiber/matrix debonding. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the contents of polar groups on the surface of gamma irradiated PBO fiber increase compared to PBO fiber. The wear tests were conducted on a ring-on-block apparatus using composite block against polished metal counterparts under dry sliding conditions.

Using many more indel characters than those in previous studies, we here for the first time address the impact of indel inclusion on the phylogenetic inferences of Arctoidea (Mammalia: Carnivora). Based on 6843 indel characters from 22 nuclear intron loci of 16 species of Arctoidea, our analyses demonstrate that when the indels were not taken into consideration, the monophyly of Ursidae and Pinnipedia tree and the monophyly of Pinnipedia and Musteloidea tree were both recovered, whereas inclusion of indels by using three different indel coding schemes give identical phylogenetic tree topologies supporting the monophyly of Ursidae and Pinnipedia. Our work brings new perspectives on the previously controversial placements among Arctoidea families, and provides another example demonstrating the importance of identifying and incorporating indels in the phylogenetic analyses of introns. In addition, comparison of indel incorporation methods revealed that the three indel coding methods are all advantageous over treating indels as missing data, given that incorporating indels produces consistent results across methods. This is the first report of the impact of different indel coding schemes on phylogenetic reconstruction at the family level in Carnivora, which indicates that indels should be taken into account in the future phylogenetic analyses.

SiO2 nanosheet-Nafion nanocomposites with excellent conductivity, catalytic activity, and biocompatibility provided an extremely hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. Chitosan was used as a cross-linker to immobilize acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and Nafion was used as a protective membrane to efficiently improve the stability of the AChE biosensor. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity for acetylthiocholine chloride and catalyzed the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine chloride with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of 134 mu M to form thiocholine, which was then oxidized to produce a detectable and fast response. Based on the inhibition by pesticides of the enzymatic activity of AChE, detection of the amperometric response from thiocholine on the biosensor is a simple and effective way to biomonitor exposure to pesticides. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, and carbofuran at concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-10) M and from 1.0 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-8) M. The detection limits for methyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, and carbofuran were 5 x 10(-13) M. The biosensor developed exhibited good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and low cost, thus providing a new promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors.

HsfA1a is an important regulator for heat stress-induced gene expression and thermotolerance. However, it is not clear whether HsfA1a is directly activated by stress and the mechanisms of the stress signaling are poorly understood. We analyzed HsfA1a activation by trimerization and DNA-binding assays in vitro and in vivo in response to heat stress, low/high pH, and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Our results show that purified recombinant HsfA1a was activated by these stress treatments in vitro. The same treatments also induced the binding to HSP18.2 and HSP70 promoters as examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and the HsfA1a DNA binding paralleled the mRNA expression of its target genes induced by different stresses. Stress-induced DNA-binding could be reversed, both in vitro and in vivo, by subsequent incubation with reducing agents (DTT, NADPH). These data suggest that HsfA1a can directly sense stress and become activated, and this process is dependent on the redox state. An N-terminal deletion of the amino acid residues from 48 to 74 negatively affected pH- and hydrogen peroxide-, but not heat-stress sensing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Most studies accomplish this task by using the gene encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI; Entrez COX1). Within this barcoding framework, many taxonomic initiatives exist, such as those specializing in fishes, birds, mammals, and fungi. Other efforts center on regions, such as the Arctic, or on other topics, such as health. DNA barcoding initiatives exist for all groups of vertebrates except for amphibians and nonavian reptiles. We announce the formation of Cold Code, the international initiative to DNA barcode all species of these cold-blooded' vertebrates. The project has a Steering Committee, Coordinators, and a home page. To facilitate Cold Code, the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences will sequence COI for the first 10 specimens of a species at no cost to the steward of the tissues.

Assuming that the end surfaces of cavity are the perfect conductor, thus, the fields along the z-axis can be described by kz. Therefore, three-dimensional (3-D) problems can be simulated by the use of a two-dimensional model. Besides, to achieve a faster computation, the field components are expressed by two pairs of equationssine and cosine. To validate the utility and efficiency of proposed method, we analyzed two ridged cavities. Numerical results show that less than one-tenth memory and CPU requirements are needed by the modal FDTD as compared with conventional 3-D FDTD method. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CD133 recognition may, however, be affected by its glycosylation pattern and oxygen tension. The present study investigates the effect of oxygen deprivation on CD133 expression and glycosylation status employing a high AC133-expressing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell line, IN699. IN699 cells were cultured under normoxic (21% O-2) and hypoxic (3% O-2) conditions. CD133 expression was analysed by western blotting (WB), qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and flow cytometry using the glycosylation-specific antibody CD133/1 and ab19898 which binds the unglycosylated intracellular residues of CD133. By flow cytometry, ab19898 detected 94.1% and 96.2% CD133(+) cells under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. Hypoxia significantly increased the percentage of CD133(+) cells from 69% to 92% using CD133/1 (p<0.005). Moreover, a significantly higher geomean fluorescence intensity (GMI) was demonstrated by ab19898 (p<0.005) in CD133(+) cells. WB and qRT-PCR results were consistent with flow cytometry data. Furthermore, over a period of 72-h incubation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions after autoMACS sorting, an average of 31.8% and 42.2%, respectively, of CD133-negative IN699 cells became positive using CD13311. Our data show that a) previously reported CD133(-) cells may have been misidentified using the glycosylation-specific CD133/1 as constitutive expression of CD133 was detected by the intracellular antibody ab19898; b) hypoxia promotes glycosylation status of CD133, indicating possible involvement of glycosylated CD133 in the process of anti-hypoxia-mediated apoptosis.

However, the leaf cuticules of the genus have rarely been described. A new species, named Carpinus tengchongensis Dai et B.N. Sun, sp. nov., is identified based on 13 leaf fossils, collected from the late Pliocene Mangbang Formation, Tengchong County of Yunnan Province, China. The important characters of the fossil are its oblong-ovate leaf shape, obliquely cordate base, doubly serrulate margin, straight and moderately thick primary vein, pinnate secondary veins, percurrent tertiary veins, orthogonally reticulate areoles, absence of veinlets, anomocytic stomata with double-layered stomatal rim, well-formed T-pieces and trichome bases, which indicates an affinity within the genus Carpinus section Carpinus subsection Monbeigianae, especially with C. tsaiana. Carpinus fossils were present from the Eocene to Pliocene with disjunctive distribution in the North Temperate Zone, which broadly reflected the present distribution pattern and probably demonstrates the tolerance of Carpinus to environmental change.

J	Tang, NS; Zhao, YY				Tang, Nian-Sheng; Zhao, Yuan-Ying			Semiparametric Bayesian analysis of nonlinear reproductive dispersion mixed models for longitudinal data	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian case deletion diagnostic; Dirichlet process prior; Goodness-of-fit statistic; Model comparison; Nonlinear reproductive dispersion mixed models	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS; P-VALUES; DISTRIBUTIONS; INFERENCE	In the development of nonlinear reproductive dispersion mixed models, it is commonly assumed that distribution of random effects is normal. The normality assumption is likely violated in many practical applications. In this paper, we assume that distribution of random effects is specified by a Dirichlet process prior for relaxing this limitation. A semiparametric Bayesian approach combining the stick-breaking prior and the blocked Gibbs sampler as well as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is developed for simulating observations from the posterior distributions and producing the joint Bayesian estimates of unknown parameters and random effects. Two goodness-of-fit statistics are presented to assess the plausibility of the posited model, and the procedures for computing the Bayes factor, pseudo-Bayes factor and deviance information criterion for model comparison are given. Also, we propose two Bayesian case deletion influence measures including the phi-divergence and Cook's posterior mean distance. Four simulation studies and a real example are presented to illustrate the newly developed Bayesian methodologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Growth was found to occur from 55 to 75 A degrees C (optimum 65 A degrees C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and 0-1 % NaCl (w/v). Cells were observed to be rod-shaped and the colonies convex, circular, smooth, yellow and non-transparent. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM 77924(T) belongs to the genus Thermus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between strain YIM 77924(T) and other species of the genus Thermus were all below 97 %. The polar lipids of strain YIM 77924(T) were determined to be aminophospholipid, phospholipid and glycolipid. The predominant respiratory quinone was determined to be MK-8 and the G+C content was 66.64 mol%. The major fatty acids identified were iso-C-16:0, iso-C-15:0, iso-C-17:0 and C-16:0. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics as well as genotypic data, strain YIM 77924(T) is proposed to represent a novel species, Thermus tengchongensis sp. nov., in the genus Thermus. The type strain is YIM 77924(T) (=KCTC 32025(T) = CCTCC AB2012063(T)).

To survey its genetic diversity and trace the history of domestication, we investigated a total of 4938 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments including 2843 previously published and 2095 de novo units from 2044 domestic chickens and 51 red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To obtain the highest possible level of molecular resolution, 50 representative samples were further selected for total mtDNA genome sequencing. A fine-gained mtDNA phylogeny was investigated by defining haplogroups A-I and W-Z. Common haplogroups A-G were shared by domestic chickens and red junglefowl. Rare haplogroups H-I and W-Z were specific to domestic chickens and red junglefowl, respectively. We re-evaluated the global mtDNA profiles of chickens. The geographic distribution for each of major haplogroups was examined. Our results revealed new complexities of history in chicken domestication because in the phylogeny lineages from the red junglefowl were mingled with those of the domestic chickens. Several local domestication events in South Asia, Southwest China and Southeast Asia were identified. The assessment of chicken mtDNA data also facilitated our understanding about the Austronesian settlement in the Pacific.

However, little is known about the adverse effects of Cu2O NPs on organisms. In the current study, in vitro cytotoxicity of Cu2O NPs (ca. 60 nm in diameter) to the blood cells of freshwater fish Carassius auratus was evaluated. A concentration-dependent hemolytic activity of Cu2O NPs to red blood cells (RBCs) and the phagocytosis of Cu2O NPs by leukocytes were revealed. The results showed that dosages of Cu2O NPs greater than 40 mu g/mL were toxic to blood cells, and could cause serious membrane damage to RBCs. The EC50 value of Cu2O NPs as obtained from RBCs and whole blood exposure was 26 and 63 mu g/mL, respectively. The generation of reactive oxygen species and the direct interaction between Cu2O NPs and the cell membrane were suggested as the possible mechanism for cytotoxicity, and the intrinsic hemolytic active of Cu2O NPs was the main contributor to the toxicity rather than solubilized copper ions. The adsorption of plasma proteins on the surfaces of Cu2O NPs led to their aggregation in whole blood, and aggregate formation can significantly alleviate the hemolytic effect and subsequently mediate the phagocytosis of Cu2O NPs by leukocytes.

Despite the economic importance of this insect-disease complex, only a few studies are available on the population genetic structure of M. alternatus and the relationship between its historic dispersal pattern and various human activities. The aim of the present study was to further explore aspects of human activity on the population genetic structure of M. alternatus in mainland China. The molecular data based on the combined mitochondrial cox1 and cox2 gene fragments from 140 individuals representing 14 Chinese populations yielded 54 haplotypes. Overall, a historical (natural) expansion that originated from China's eastern coast to the western interior was revealed by the haplotype network, as well as several recent, long-distant population exchanges. Correlation analysis suggested that regional economic status and proximity to marine ports significantly influenced the population genetic structure of M. alternatus as indicated by both the ratio of shared haplotypes and the haplotype diversity, however, the PWN distribution in China was significantly correlated with only the ratio of shared haplotypes. Our results suggested that the modern logistical network (i.e., the transportation system) in China is a key medium by which humans have brought about population exchange of M. alternatus in mainland China, likely through inadvertent movement of infested wood packaging material associated with trade, and that this genetic exchange was primarily from the economically well-developed east coast of China, westward, to the less-developed interior. In addition, this study demonstrated the existence of non-local M. alternatus in new PWN-infested localities in China, but not all sites with non-local M. alternatus were infested with PWN.

J	Yang, J; Ortega-Hernandez, J; Butterfield, NJ; Zhang, XG				Yang, Jie; Ortega-Hernandez, Javier; Butterfield, Nicholas J.; Zhang, Xi-guang			Specialized appendages in fuxianhuiids and the head organization of early euarthropods	NATURE			English	Article							LIMULUS-POLYPHEMUS CHELICERATA; ARTHROPOD HEAD; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; XIPHOSURA; PHYLOGENY; CHARACTER; CRUSTACEA; REGION	The organization of the head provides critical data for resolving the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of extinct and extant euarthropods(1,2). The early Cambrian-period fuxianhuiids are regarded as basal representatives of stem-group Euarthropode(3-7), and their anterior morphology therefore offers key insights for reconstructing the ancestral condition of the euarthropod head(1-3,8-11) However, the paired post-antennal structures in Fuxianhuia protensa remain controversial(3,8,10); they have been interpreted as both 'great appendages'(1,2) and as gut diverticulae(4,12,13). Here we describe Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis sp. nov. and Fuxianhuia xiaoshibaensis sp. nov. from a new early Cambrian (Stage 3) fossil Lagerstatte in Yunnan, China. Numerous specimens of both species show a unique 'taphonomic dissection' of the anterodorsal head shield, revealing the cephalic organization in detail. We demonstrate the presence of a pair of specialized post-antennal appendages (SPAs) in the fuxianhuiid head, which attach at either side of the posteriorly directed mouth, behind the hypostome. Preserved functional articulations indicate a well-defined but restricted range of limb movement, suggestive of a simple type of sweep feeding. The organization of the SPAs in fuxianhuiids is incompatible with the (deutocerebral) anterior raptorial appendages of megacheirans(2,9,14,15), and argue against the presence of protocerebral limbs in the fuxianhuiids(1,2,9). The positions of the fuxianhuiid antennae and SPAs indicate that they are segmentally homologous to the deutocerebral and tritocerebral appendages of crown-group Euarthropoda respectively(2,11,16,17). These findings indicate that antenniform deutocerebral appendages with many podomeres are a plesiomorphic feature of the ancestral euarthropod head.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used as the structural probes in order to check the phase purity, and to examine the morphologies and microstructures of the synthesized compounds. The structural analysis reveals that the obtained compounds are rare-earth hydroxides with one-dimensional (1D) rod-like nanostructures. The formation mechanism of the Ln(OH)(3) nanorods was also proposed. The photoactivity of Ln(OH)(3) (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy) nanorods was tested by measuring the degradation of azo dye Congo red (CR). The results show an excellent removal capacity for organic pollutants CR from wastewater, making them promising candidates for the wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The traditional view on the Indian-Asian collision assumes contact of the continental plates during the Early Eocene. Many biogeographic studies rely on this assumption. However, the exact mode and timing of this geological event is still under debate. Here we address, based on an extensive phylogenetic analysis of rhacophorid tree frogs, if there was already a Paleogene biogeographic link between Southeast Asia and India; in which direction faunal exchange occurred between India and Eurasia within the Rhacophoridae; and if the timing of the faunal exchange correlates with one of the recently suggested geological models. Rhacophorid tree frogs showed an early dispersal from India to Asia between 46 and 57 Ma, as reconstructed from the fossil record. During the Middle Eocene, however, faunal exchange ceased, followed by increase of rhacophorid dispersal events between Asia and the Indian subcontinent during the Oligocene that continued until the Middle Miocene. This corroborates recent geological models that argue for a much later final collision between the continental plates. We predict that the Oligocene faunal exchange between the Indian subcontinent and Asia, as shown here for rhacophorid frogs, also applies for other nonvolant organisms with an Indian-Asian distribution, and suggest that previous studies that deal with this faunal interchange should be carefully reinvestigated.

These results indicate that: (i) There is an optimal delay time tau(0) which maximally enhances the stability of the stock price under strong demand elasticity of stock price, and maximally reduces the stability of the stock price under weak demand elasticity of stock price; (ii) The cross correlation coefficient of noises and the delay time play an opposite role on the stability for the case of the delay time <tau(0) and the same role for the case of the delay time >tau(0). Moreover, the probability density function of the escape time of stock price returns, the probability density function of the returns and the correlation function of the returns are compared with other literatures.

The method possesses high sensitivity, but lacks selectivity. Therefore, a Rh(III) ion-imprinted polymer (IIP), prepared by precipitation polymerization using 2-(allylthio)nicotinic acid (ANA) as functional monomer, was used as sorbent to construct a ion-imprint based solid-phase extraction (IIP-SPE) method for separation of rhodium from complicated matrices prior to its determination by RLS. The experimental parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and selectivity of IIP-SPE were studied carefully. Under the optimal conditions, the IIP-SPE column with the enrichment factor (EF) of 10 could be used at least 20 times without decreasing its extraction recovery (above 90%) significantly. The calibration graph for the determination of rhodium by RLS coupled with IIP-SPE procedure was linear in the range of 0.06-1.5 ng mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.024 ng mL(-1). There is no metal ions tested at the concentration below 10 ng mL(-1) interfered in the determination of 0.8 ng mL(-1) Rh(III). The proposed IIP-SPE-RLS method was successfully applied to the extraction and measurement of trace rhodium in catalyst, water and geochemical samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 4.0% (n=4).

Coat color is generated by melanocytes, which synthesize pheomelanin (a red or yellow pigment) or eumelanin (a black or brown pigment) through the pigment type-switching pathway, and is regulated by three genes in dogs: MC1R (melanocortin receptor 1), CBD103 (beta-defensin 103), and ASIP (agouti-signaling protein precursor). The genotypes of these three gene loci in dog breeds are associated with coat color pattern. Here, we resequenced these three gene loci in two Kunming dog populations and analyzed these sequences using population genetic approaches to identify evolutionary patterns that have occurred at these loci during the recent domestication and breeding of the Kunming dog. The analysis showed that MC1R undergoes balancing selection in both Kunming dog populations, and that the Fst value for MC1R indicates significant genetic differentiation across the two populations. In contrast, similar results were not observed for CBD103 or ASIP. These results suggest that high heterozygosity and allelic differences at the MC1R locus may explain both the mixed color coat, of yellow and black, and the difference in coat colors in both Kunming dog populations.

Little is documented with respect to how the geological and climatological events influenced speciation as well as spatial and genetic structuring, especially in vertebrate endotherms. Macaca mulatta is the most widely distributed non-human primate. It may be the most suitable model to test hypotheses regarding the genetic consequences of orogenesis on an endotherm. Methodology and Principal Findings: Using a large dataset of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA gene sequences and nuclear microsatellite DNA data, we discovered two maternal super-haplogroups exist, one in western China and the other in eastern China. M. mulatta formed around 2.31 Ma (1.51-3.15, 95%), and divergence of the two major matrilines was estimated at 1.15 Ma (0.78-1.55, 95%). The western super-haplogroup exhibits significant geographic structure. In contrast, the eastern super-haplogroup has far greater haplotypic variability with little structure based on analyses of six variable microsatellite loci using STRUCTURE and GENELAND. Analysis using MIGRATE detected greater gene flow from WEST to EAST than vice versa. We did not detect signals of bottlenecking in most populations. Conclusions: Analyses of the nuclear and mitochondrial datasets obtained large differences in genetic patterns for M. mulatta. The difference likely reflects inheritance mechanisms of the maternally inherited mtDNA genome versus nuclear biparentally inherited STRs and male-mediated gene flow. Dramatic environmental changes may be responsible for shaping the matrilineal history of macaques. The timing of events, the formation of M. mulatta, and the divergence of the super-haplogroups, corresponds to both the uplifting of the QTP and Quaternary climatic oscillations. Orogenesis likely drove divergence of western populations in China, and Pleistocene glaciations are likely responsible for genetic structuring in the eastern super-haplogroup via geographic isolation and secondary contact.

How PCD in bacteria is regulated to avoid population extinction due to transient, moderate stress remains a central question. Here, we report that the YihE protein kinase is a key regulator that protects Escherichia coli from antimicrobial and environmental stressors by antagonizing the MazEF toxin-antitoxin module. YihE was linked to a reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade, and a deficiency of yihE stimulated stress-induced PCD even after stress dissipated. YihE was partially regulated by the Cpx envelope stress-response system, which, along with MazF toxin and superoxide, has both protective and destructive roles that help bacteria make a live-or-die decision in response to stress. YihE probably acts early in the stress response to limit self-sustaining ROS production and PCD. Inhibition of YihE may provide a way of enhancing antimicrobial lethality and attenuating virulence.

The source exhibits strong variability in the optical and infrared bands, and long-term variations of spectral indices have been analysed. The results indicate that there is a complex relationship between the spectral index and the brightness. In the low state, a redder-when-brighter chromatism has been found, in the sense that the spectrum steepens as the brightness increases, whereas in the high state, the source shows an opposite trend. The correlations between different bands have been investigated by means of the discrete correlation function method. The results show that the variations in the various optical and infrared bands are strongly correlated, but with no significant lags. It is, however, expected that there will be time lags of minutes to hours between the bands. Therefore, any attempt to detect the time lag needs a much denser monitoring of the source. Structure function analysis suggests that the source varies with a short-term time-scale of 34-46 d. An intra-day variability with a 24.5-min time-scale has been detected in the optical V band. The optical emission diameter is estimated to be 4.33 x 10(14) cm, and the mass of the central black hole is estimated to be 2.3 x 10(8) M-circle dot	[Zhang, Bing-Kai; Wang, Sen; Zhao, Xiao-Yun] Fuyang Normal Coll, Dept Phys, Fuyang 236041, Peoples R China; [Dai, Ben-Zhong] Yunnan Univ, Dept Phys, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Zha, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China	Zhang, BK (reprint author), Fuyang Normal Coll, Dept Phys, Fuyang 236041, Peoples R China.	zhangbk@mail.ihep.ac.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11147134, 11273008, 10975145]; Foundation for Young Talents in College of Anhui Province [2012SQRL116]; Research Foundation of the Department of Education of Anhui Province [KJ2010B159, KJ2011ZD07]	We express our thanks to the people who helped with this work, and acknowledge the valuable suggestions from the peer reviewer.

This paper reports on the combined electrochemical characterization, in situ X-ray diffraction and fluorescence research, and scanning electron microscopic studies of nucleation and growth of Cu on individual carbon fibers. Compared to the flat glassy carbon substrates and Au thin film substrates, the onset potential of Cu electrodeposition on individual carbon microfiber is more negative with lower efficiencies, indicating the difficulty of Cu nucleation on carbon fiber surface. Utilizing the capability of synchrotron X-ray microbeam diffraction and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, real time Cu crystalline structure and composition evolvement information during the electrochemical reaction processes have been studied. In situ study reveals random Cu grain formation and anisotropic growth. Dynamic Cu growth and dissolution were found to occur simultaneously during deposition. Cu nuclei density and size can be effectively controlled, in addition to the grain morphology and stability, indicating the possibility of electrochemical manipulation of microstructure thus the properties of Cu coated carbon materials.

Recent overexploitation to meet the increasing demand of dragon's blood has resulted in the rapid depletion of the natural resource. D. cambodiana grows very slow, but has plenty of leaves that regenerate yearly. This work aimed to use the leaf to produce dragon's blood, by fungal elicitation, and to study the physical and chemical profiles as well as biological activities of the elicited product. Both Fusarium proliferatum YM-266 and F. proliferatum YM-71213 effectively elicited dragon's blood formation from the leaves in and around the inoculation spots. The dragon's blood produced from the leaves by the fungal elicitation was similar in physical property, chemical property (analyzed by TLC and HPLC), as well as in anticoagulant activity, but was higher in total flavonoid content and antimicrobial activity than that from the stem. These findings provide a possibility to sustainably produce dragon's blood from the regeneratable leaves without destroying the tree and environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to confirm the modification of APTES. The surface morphologies of PSE and APTES-PSE were characterized by atom force microscopy (AFM). Electrochemical property of PSE and modified electrode was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under the optimal experimental conditions, the cathode peak current intensity of APTES-PSE linearly changes with logarithm of Ag+ concentrations over the wide range from 1x10(-3) mol L-1 to 1x10(-7) mol L-1, with a detection limit of 3x10(-8) mol L-1. Meanwhile, the APTES-PSE showed a good sensitive to Ag+ in the aqueous solution and which is attributed to the preferential chelation of N atoms of APTES. These results suggest that the choice of PSE as the substrate of the voltammetric sensor might be a very promising means for integrated analytical sensing.

The results indicated that the decadal cycle of the northern annular mode index has mutated at 1960s. NAM presents significant quasi-periodic oscillation of 35-years in 1895-1955, and 15-years in 1971-2008. The decadal cycle mutation of NAM was owing to the oscillation cycle variation of the external forcing, and the external forcing factors before and after the mutation of NAM periodic oscillations were not exactly the same. Before the 1960s, the external forcing, such as PDO, ATM, North America snow cover and the Antarctic sea-ice oscillation (ASIO) contributed greatly to the NAM quasi-35-years-periodic oscillation. However, the main factors for NAM quasi-15-years-periodic oscillation after 1960s were ATM, the European snow cover, and ASIO.

Near infrared (NIR) emission located at 1260 and 1100 nm were observed when excited by 808 and 690 nm LD excitation, respectively. Significantly enhancement of NIR emission at 1260 nm has been realized by PbO introduction. Furthermore, compared with that of sample without PbO, the intensity of NIR emission located at 1110 nm form sample with 25 mol% PbO increases by a factor of 1.2, meanwhile red emission of Bi2+ decreases by a factor of 18. We propose NIR emissions located at 1260 and 1100 nm originate from Bi+ and Bi-0, respectively, and PbO incorporation induce the forming of Bi+ due to the better radius match between Pb2+ and Bi+.

Here we investigated its reproductive biology in the laboratory to provide vital information for the development of pest control measures and preparation of pest risk analysis. Both sexes required a period of maturation feeding before mating, with the mean premating period of males (5.87 +/- 1.68 d) being significantly longer than that of females (4.59 +/- 2.34 d). This was a synovigenic species with the mean preoviposition and oviposition period being 13.50 +/- 3.15 d and 49.46 +/- 16.16 d, respectively. If no food was available after emergence, adult males died before reaching sexual maturation and females vanished before oviposition. Paired couples mated an average of 15.12 +/- 7.02 times; 28- to 53-d-old beetles mated significantly more frequently than younger and older ones. The mean fecundity was 133.24 +/- 9.67 eggs. The oviposition rate significantly increased in the first 5 wk of the oviposition period, peaking when females were 40- to 54-d-old, and then significantly decreased in the following weeks. Reproductive activities occurred almost exclusively during the day, with most ovipositions taking place in the morning and matings in the afternoon with some overlaps.

The separation of the four phytosterols was realized on a C18 reversed-phase column within 6.0min. A triple quadrupole mass analyzer API 4000 MS/MS System was evaluated for its performance in the study; the identification and quantitation of analytes were performed in the positive ion multiple reactions monitoring mode (MRM). Satisfactory recovery ranged from 86.3% to 106.4% at middle quality concentration (MQC) levels in tobacco leaves. The intra-day precision and inter-day precision accuracy of the method were between 0.43% and 2.42%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 4.8-9.7ng/mL. The applicability of this newly developed method was demonstrated by analysis of free phytosterols in tobacco leaves samples.

The concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) method was used to calculate the SDS frequency from the discrete station data and to track the large-scale regional SDS weather processes in Northeast Asia. A spline trend analysis method was employed to investigate the variability of the SDS weather systems. The results show that during 1980-2011, the SDS weather processes exhibit both a historical persistence and abrupt transitions with an approximate 10-yr high-low occurrence oscillation. Through composite analysis of atmospheric circulation during high and low SDS years, it is found that the SDS occurrences are closely related to the anomalies of arctic vortex and midlatitude westerly, and the circulation patterns around the Lake Baikal. During the high frequency years, the meridianal flows in the upper and mid troposphere above the high SDS corridor in East Asia (from the Lake Balkhash along Northwest and North China, Korean Peninsula, and Japan Islands) are apparently stronger than the meridianal flows during the low SDS frequency years, favoring the development and transport of SDSs in the midlatitude regions.

This unique ability has made them ideal organisms from which to develop biological control agents against plant- and animal-parasitic nematodes. However, effective application of biocontrol agents in the field requires a comprehensive understanding about the ecology and population genetics of the nematophagous fungi in natural environments. Here, we genotyped 228 strains of the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora using 12 single nucleotide polymorphic markers located on eight random DNA fragments. The strains were from different ecological niches and geographical regions from China. Our analyses identified that ecological niche separations contributed significantly, whereas geographic separation contributed relatively little to the overall genetic variation in our samples of A. oligospora. Interestingly, populations from stressful environments seemed to be more variable and showed more evidence for recombination than those from benign environments at the same geographic areas. We discussed the implications of our results to the conservation and biocontrol application of A. oligospora in agriculture and forestry.

Their structures including relative stereochemistry were determined by comprehensive 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and in the case of 1 and 10, by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. This class of unique plant terpenoids was designated as leucosceptrane sesterterpenoids (=leucosceptroids). The potent antifeedant activity of the most abundant compound, leucosceptroid G (3), and a representative compound, leucosceptroid N (10), against the generalist plant-feeding insect Helicoverpa armigera suggested that they might also be defense compounds of L. canum against insects.

Growing evidence suggests a significant role of chronic low grade inflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Multiple immunological, genetic polymorphism and gene expression studies have established crucial roles of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immune-mediated risk of schizophrenia. Although genetic studies suggest some variants within the pro-inflammatory IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, genes conferring risk to schizophrenia, the results however have been contradictory in various populations. In the present investigation, promoter SNPs of IL-6 (-174 G > C) and TNF-alpha, (-238 G > A) genes have been studied to evaluate whether these variants contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility in Indian Bengalee population. Genotyping of the above SNPs was done in 100 well characterized and confirmed cases of paranoid schizophrenia and equal number of healthy donors belonging to the same ethnic group by using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. No significant differences in genotype as well as allele frequencies were observed for IL-6 and TNF-alpha variants between the patient and control groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used a montane stream-dwelling frog, Quasipaa boulengeri, to explore the relative roles played by these drivers on species in southern China, a region needing thorough studies. We detected four major matrilines, and no broadly distributed haplotypes occurred. The complex orogenesis of south-western China drove matrilineal divergence in Q. boulengeri into highly structured geographical units. These matrilines subsequently persisted in situ with stable populations rather than undergoing expansions during glacial cycling. The unification of the upper and middle Yangtze River in the Three Gorges mountain region mediated downstream colonization of this frog. Analyses identified geological events as playing a larger role than climatic fluctuations in driving the population history of Q. boulengeri. Nuclear allele analyses indicated gene flow; this maintained genetic cohesion of the species. South-eastern Sichuan Basin was identified as the area of secondary contact for several matrilines, and this area deserves further study and special protection.

This feature has been shown to have perceptual advantages over openness or "no-hole". in this study, we investigated when and how the human brain differentiates between "hole" and "no-hole" figures. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a passive observation paradigm. Two pairs of simple figures (Experiment 1) and two sets of Greek letters (Experiment 2) were used as stimuli. The ERPs of "hole" and "no-hole" figures differed 90 ms after stimulus onset: "hole" figures elicited smaller P1 and N1 amplitudes than "no-hole" figures. These suggest that both P1 and N1 components are sensitive to the difference between "hole" and "no-hole" figures; perception of "hole" and "no-hole" figures might be differentiated early during visual processing.

Endophytic bacteria were isolated from five different parts (root, stem, petiole, leaf and seed) of Panax notoginseng and evaluated for antagonistic activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Ralstonia sp. and Meloidogyne hapla, three major pathogens associated with root-rot disease complex of P. notoginseng. From 1000 endophytic bacterial strains evaluated in vitro, 104 strains exhibited antagonistic properties against at least one of these three pathogens. Phylogenetic analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these 104 antagonistic bacteria belong to four clusters: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. Members of the Firmicutes, in particular the Bacillus spp., were predominant in all analyzed tissues. The root was the main reservoir for antagonistic bacteria. Of the 104 antagonists, 51 strains showed antagonistic activities to one pathogen only, while 43 and 10 displayed the activities towards two and all three pathogens, respectively. The most dominant species in all tissues were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum and Bacillus methylotrophicus, which were represented by eight strains with broad antagonistic spectrum to the all three test pathogens of root-rot disease complex of P. notoginseng.

They achieved maximum species diversity during the Middle Ordovician-Silurian, and their history during the group's acme is well documented. Nevertheless, information about their origin and early evolution is sparse. Here we report three phosphatized flask-shaped vesicles recovered from the Cambrian Stage 5 (similar to 510 m.y. old) Duyun fauna of southern China as the earliest known chitinozoans, Eisenackitina? sp., extending the record of the microfossil group back by at least 20 m.y. Their exceptional occurrence within an Orsten-type Lagerstatte might imply a benthic mode of life. This discovery is significant in that it supplies critical data for evaluation of the basic morphology of Cambrian chitinozoans and assessment of their early evolution.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were used to examine the morphology and the microstructure of the obtained compound. The morphological study clearly revealed that obtained compounds appear in a flake-like nanosheet form with a typical length in the range of several hundreds of nanometers and a width in the range of several tens of nanometers. A possible formation mechanism is preliminary proposed for the formation of the nanostructure. The adsorption properties of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were tested by the adsorption of azo dye Congo red (CR). The results show an excellent removal capacity for organic pollutant CR from the wastewater, making them a promising candidate for wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the detailed dynamics in the mantle remains controversial. In this study, the structure of the mantle transition zone (MTZ) beneath eastern Tibet and Sichuan Basin is investigated using 5080 receiver functions from 51 broadband stations. The depth of the 410 km discontinuity is close to the global average, except for the Longmenshan where the 410 and 660-km discontinuities are found to be depressed by up to 10-25 km and 5-10 km, respectively. The observed simultaneous depressions of the 410 and 660-km discontinuities distributed along the LMS, together with proofs from tomography and regional tectonics, suggest that asthenospheric flow sinks into the MTZ, resulting in a high velocity zone, as well as variation in the MTZ thickness. The depressions are not from the traditional Clapeyron slopes or temperature variation. Also, the depression of the 410 km discontinuity and the dehydration of wadsleyite are syngenetic, both of which originate from the dry mantle flow traveling across the old 410 km interface.

Environmental selection pressures might not affect these two aspects of an organism equally. Assuming that an organism first allocates its limited resources to maintain its survival under environmental selection pressure, our model, based on the evolutionarily stable strategy theory, surprisingly shows that the sex ratio is greatly affected by the environmental pressure intensity and by the reproductive resource elasticity of offspring survival. Moreover, the concept of the resource elasticity of offspring survival intrinsically integrates the ecological concepts of K selection and r selection. The model shows that in a species with reproductive strategy K, increased environmental selection pressure will reduce resource allocation to the male function. By contrast, in a species with reproductive strategy r, harsher environmental selection pressure will increase allocation to the male function. The elasticity of offspring survival might vary not only across species, but also across many other factors affecting the same species (e.g., age structure, spatial heterogeneity), which explains sex ratio differences across species or age structures and spatial heterogeneity in the same species.

Though there are conflicting hypotheses regarding its origin, the most widely held view is that Bos frontalis originated from direct domestication of Bos gaurus (gaur). To study this, we analysed mtDNA control region and cytochrome b gene sequences of 41 B. frontalis from China and India, together with the available sequences in the public databases. Bayesian inference revealed clustering of B. frontalis and B. gaurus sequences into two separate clades. Application of relaxed molecular clock to these clades shows that B. frontalis and B. gaurus diverge between 0.134 and 0.207 million years ago. This time estimate lies much outside the similar to 10,000-year-old history of animal domestication. Based on this finding, we argue that B. frontalis should be treated as a separate species/sub-species and not merely a domestic form of B. gaurus. Our study also highlights the gene flow between domestic cattle and B. frontalis population.

However, results were inconsistent. We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and bladder cancer. Methods: Electronic search of PubMed was conducted to select studies. Studies containing available genotype frequencies of Arg72Pro were chosen, and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. Results: The final meta-analysis included 14 published studies with 2176 bladder cancer cases and 2798 controls. The results suggested that the variant genotype was associated with the bladder cancer risk (additive model: OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.036-1.325, P = 0.011; dominant model: OR = 1.268, 95% CI: 1.003-1.602, P = 0.047) in Asian subgroup. However, the association was not significant between this polymorphism and bladder cancer risk in Caucasian (additive model: OR = 0.773, 95% CI: 0.564-1.059, P = 0.109; dominant model: OR = 0.685, 95% CI: 0.418-1.124, P = 0.134). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer in Asians. To validate the association between this polymorphism and bladder cancer, further studies with larger participants worldwide are needed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address this issue, we extensively studied and compared the haplogroup composition of a sample of 171 Chinese LS patients with that of 1597 controls. Our results show that haplogroup Y may increase the risk of LS in Chinese by 2.867 fold (95% CI = 1.135-7.240, P = 0.020). Haplogroup B5 has also this trend (1.737 fold, 95% CI = 0.961-3.139), but with a borderline P-value (P = 0.065). Both haplogroups belong to macrohaplogroup N and share a common reverse mutation on nudeotide position 10398 (A10398G). In fact, the combined haplogroup N with 10398G is also associated with an increased risk for LS (OR = 1.882, 95% CL = 1.134-3.124, P = 0.013). (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A Comprehensive Census of Microbial Diversity in Hot Springs of Tengchong, Yunnan Province China Using 16S rRNA Gene Pyrosequencing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; ACIDIC GEOTHERMAL SPRINGS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; WEST-YUNNAN; SP NOV.; GEOCHEMISTRY; ARCHAEAL; REHAI; FIELD; BACTERIAL	The Rehai and Ruidian geothermal fields, located in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, host a variety of geochemically distinct hot springs. In this study, we report a comprehensive, cultivation-independent census of microbial communities in 37 samples collected from these geothermal fields, encompassing sites ranging in temperature from 55.1 to 93.6 degrees C, in pH from 2.5 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from silicates in Rehai to carbonates in Ruidian. Richness was low in all samples, with 21-123 species-level OTUs detected. The bacterial phylum Aquificae or archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota were dominant in Rehai samples, yet the dominant taxa within those phyla depended on temperature, pH, and geochemistry. Rehai springs with low pH (2.5-2.6), high temperature (85.1-89.1 degrees C), and high sulfur contents favored the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales, whereas those with low pH (2.6-4.8) and cooler temperature (55.1-64.5 degrees C) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobaculum. Rehai springs with neutral-alkaline pH (7.2-9.4) and high temperature (>80 degrees C) with high concentrations of silica and salt ions (Na, K, and Cl) favored the Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter and crenarchaeal orders Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales. Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales became predominant in springs with pH much higher than the optimum and even the maximum pH known for these orders. Ruidian water samples harbored a single Aquificae genus Hydrogenobacter, whereas microbial communities in Ruidian sediment samples were more diverse at the phylum level and distinctly different from those in Rehai and Ruidian water samples, with a higher abundance of uncultivated lineages, close relatives of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon "Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii'', and candidate division O1aA90 and OP1. These differences between Ruidian sediments and Rehai samples were likely caused by temperature, pH, and sediment mineralogy. The results of this study significantly expand the current understanding of the microbiology in Tengchong hot springs and provide a basis for comparison with other geothermal systems around the world.

Phototactic behavior of the Armand pine bark weevil, Pissodes punctatus	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						light intensity; monochromatic light; ultraviolet light; violet light	COMPOUND EYE; LIGHT; COLEOPTERA; BEETLE	The Armand pine bark weevil, Pissodes punctatus Langor et Zhang (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a destructive bark weevil on the Armand pine, Pinus armandii Franch (Pinales: Pinaceae), an important timbering tree in southern China. This study examined the phototactic behavior of P. punctatus through observation of behavioral characteristics, response to nine monochromatic lights (ranging from 340 nm to 689 nm with about 40-nm step), and response to five intensities (ranging from 1 lux to 200 lux) of the most attractive light. The results demonstrated that P. punctatus was most active in the day, and kept still at night (or in a dark room). P. punctatus could be attracted to eight of nine monochromatic lights, the exception being red light (649 nm), which implied broad sensitivity to the spectrum of light. P. punctatus was most sensitive to violet (415 nm), ultraviolet (340 nm), and green (504 nm) light, suggesting there might be at least three types of photoreceptors in the compound eyes of this weevil. Furthermore, low intensities elicited an increased phototactic response, and high intensities a decreased phototactic response, under both violet and UV light. Thus, P. punctatus were found to be phototactic insects, and the phototactic behavior of P. punctatus is both a color and intensity preference. The information provided here provides a basis for the improvement of trapping devices for detection and survey of P. punctatus, as well as a basis for the development of alternate control strategies for this important pest of Armand pine and other pine trees.

Chinese forest policy reforms after 1998: the case of the Natural Forest Protection Program and the Slope Land Conversion Program	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW			English	Article						Natural Forest Protection Programme (NFPP); Slope Land Conversion Programme (SLCP); Grain for Green (GfG); forest policies; China	AGE	In this article we discuss the two largest reforestation and forest conservation programmes in China, the Natural Forest Protection Programme (NFPP), and the Slope Land Conversion Programme (SLCP, also called Grain for Green), introduced in 1998. The NFPP reformed the state forest enterprises to reduce deforestation, increase the amount of forestland to be protected, and increase the sustainability of logging, while improving their financial viability. The SLCP reformed collective (i.e. private) forests in the villages, by compensating farmers for retiring marginal (mostly slope) land. Together, these two programmes are the largest reforestation programmes in the world, in term of people affected (over 125 million people), land reforested or protected (over 150 million ha), and budget (over 800 billion yuan between 1998 and 2020). We review these two programmes within the broad political and socio-economic conditions of the country during these years.	[Delang, C.

Dropping the compactness assumption, we establish some results on structure of the weak Pareto solution set, Pareto solution set, weak Pareto optimal value set, and Pareto optimal value set of (SVOP) and on connectedness of Pareto solution set and Pareto optimal value set of (SVOP). In particular, we improved and generalize, Arrow, Barankin, and Blackwell's classical results in Euclidean spaces and Zheng and Yang's results in general Banach spaces.

The results show that the addition reaction of G with U under the conditions mainly involves the reactions of U with protonated glyoxal (p-G), protonated 2,2-dihydroxyacetaldehyde (p-G1) and protonated bis-hemdiol (p-G2) to form two important carbocation reactive intermediates of C-p-UG and C-p-UG1, and two important hydroxyl compounds of UG and UG1. These compounds play important roles in the formation of UG resin. According to the result of quantum chemical calculation, UG resin was synthesized successfully under weak acid conditions. The UG resin was characterized by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((CNMR)-C-13 and (HNMR)-H-1). These instrumental analytical results agree with each other and further confirm the addition reaction pathway of glyoxal with urea proposed by quantum chemical calculation.

Firstly, we solve the Riemann problems with piecewise constant data having a single discontinuity. For the generalized Chaplygin gas pressure law, the solution consists of three different structures:R + J, S + J, and delta. Existence and uniqueness of delta shock solution are established under the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition. For the modified Chaplygin gas pressure law, the structures of solution are R + J and S + J. Secondly, we discuss the limits of Riemann solutions for the modified Chaplygin gas pressure law as the pressure law tends to the generalized Chaplygin gas one. In particular, for some cases, the solution S + J tends to a delta shock wave, and it is different from the delta shock wave for the generalized Chaplygin gas pressure law with the same initial data. Thirdly, we simulate the Riemann solutions and examine the formation process of delta shock wave by employing the Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme. The numerical results are coincident with the theoretical analysis.

Two-stage design and analysis are often adopted in GWASs. Considering the genetic model uncertainty, many robust procedures have been proposed and applied in GWASs. However, the existing approaches mostly focused on binary traits, and few work has been done on continuous (quantitative) traits, since the statistical significance of these robust tests is difficult to calculate. In this paper, we develop a powerful F-statistic-based robust joint analysis method for quantitative traits using the combined raw data from both stages in the framework of two-staged GWASs. Explicit expressions are obtained to calculate the statistical significance and power. We show using simulations that the proposed method is substantially more robust than the F-test based on the additive model when the underlying genetic model is unknown. An example for rheumatic arthritis (RA) is used for illustration.

And the sensitivities of unicellular and colonial Microcystis strains to six emergent macrophytes were compared using an exudation experiment. Based on laboratory experiments, T orientalis, A. calamus, O. javanica, S. validus, S. sagittifolia, and P. cordata had strong inhibitory effects on growth of unicellular M aeruginosa, while only A. calamus and P. cordata show obvious growth inhibition on colonial M. aeruginosa. When the biomass density was 20 g FW.L-1, the growth inhibition rate of unicellular M. aeruginosa can exceed 90% for all of the six emergent macrophytes. When macrophytes coexisted with the colonial M aeruginosa, only A. calamus, F cordata, and S. sagittifolia showed the growth inhibition of algae. Maximal inhibition of Chl a growth was 75% (p<0.05) for A. calamus, 69% (p<0.05) for cordata, and 40% for S. sagittifolia at 45 g FW.L-1 on day 15. The results of the exudation experiment indicated that there were no significant differences between control and treatment of Chl a concentrations of colonial M. aeruginosa for all of the six macrophyte exudations on days 6 and 12. While after 6 d incubation in 100% and 50% macrophyte exudations (40 g FW.L-1), the cell densities of unicellular M. aeruginosa in control were obviously higher than all those in treatment (p < 0.05). The maximal algal growth inhibition (89.62%) of unicellular M. aeruginosa was achieved in 100% exudation of A. calamus on day 6 (p < 0.05). So according to the results of exudation experiments, the unicellular M. aeruginosa was more sensitive than the colonial strain to six emergent macrophytes. And this different sensitivity between Microcystis species probably correlated positively with colony size.

ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; HORMONE-THERAPY; PROTECT NEURONS; DAMAGE; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; ESTRADIOL; RATS; STRESS	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel phytoestrogen, alpha-Zearalanol, on Alzheimer's disease-related memory impairment and neuronal oxidation in ovariectomized mice. METHODS: Female C57/BL6 mice were ovariectomized or received sham operations and treatment with equivalent doses of 17 beta-estradiol or alpha-Zearalanol for 8 weeks. Their spatial learning and memory were analyzed using the Morris water maze test. The antioxidant enzyme activities and reactive oxygen species generation, neuronal DNA oxidation, and MutT homolog 1 expression in the hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: Treatment with 17 beta-estradiol or alpha-Zearalanol significantly improved spatial learning and memory performance in ovariectomized mice. In addition, 17 beta-estradiol and alpha-Zearalanol attenuated the decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and increased reactive oxygen species production in ovariectomized mice. The findings indicated a significant elevation in hippocampi neuronal DNA oxidation and reduction in MutT homolog 1 expression in estrogen-deficient mice, but supplementation with 17 beta-estradiol or alpha-Zearalanol efficaciously ameliorated this situation. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that alpha-Zearalanol is potentially beneficial for improving memory impairments and neuronal oxidation damage in a manner similar to that of 17 beta-estradiol. Therefore, the compound may be a potential therapeutic agent that can ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders related to estrogen deficiency.

The intrinsic hollow core shell microstructure makes multiple reflections of light within the chamber, allowing more efficient use of a light source compared with solid structures. This structure can also shorten the lengths for both electronic and ionic transport, enlarge the surface areas of electrodes, and the improve accommodation of the volume change during Li insertion/extraction cycling. Furthermore, the introduction of Ag is beneficial for the enhancement of the interfacial charge transfer efficiency to adsorbed substrates and for the improvement of its high-rate discharge capacity. Therefore, Ag@TiO2 exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity under visible light and improved performance as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. This strategy is simple, cheap and amenable to mass-production, which may shed light on a new avenue for large-scale synthesis of cage-bell structural nanofunctional materials for catalysis, energy storage and other applications.

To accelerate its practical realization, a simplified shrinking device with only axial parameter varying with radius is proposed through choosing appropriate spatial transformation. The advantages of such a device are that radial and azimuthal parameters are constants, and these parameters have finite and positive values. The full-wave simulation confirms the good performance of the device. Besides, the effects of material loss and parameter deviation on the performance of the device are also investigated. This work provides a new and feasible solution to push the shrinking device more closely to the practice. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

This species was characterized by thinner stroma, smaller perithecium, thinner ascospore (multiseptate with short septation). The phylogenetic analyses based on the ITS, the 5-gene and MAT1-2-1 gene dataset showed O. lanpingensis had the closest evolution relationship with O. robertsii and O. sinensis, but still had obvious distances to them.

Furthermore, we investigate two special versions of the GCEP problem.

Polymer 1 consists of a reinforced sinusoidal-like hydroxyl-formate-carboxylate mixed-bridged chain as a rod-shaped secondary building unit (SBU), which is constructed from two types of asymmetric triangular Co-3 clusters. This compound also has open irregular channels in the framework and presents a severely distorted pcu net based on two different Co-3 clusters of SBUs as six connected nodes. The presence of a few drops of water in the DMF reaction solution is important in in situ HCOO- generation, which is beneficial for the formation of 1. Compound 1 is further characterized by IR, EA, PXRD, TGA-DSC, N-2 adsorption, and magnetic measurement.

With increasing chain length a discontinuous transition from triangular to square honeycombs takes place. At this transition a periodic honeycomb composed of a mixture of square and triangular cells in a ratio 1 : 2 was formed at low temperature, whereas at higher temperature a hexagonal columnar phase composed of triangular and randomly distributed rhombic cells, a new kind of cybotactic nematic phase, and also a cybotactic isotropic phase, both composed of square honeycomb fragments, represent the intermediate states. This provides an example of a dynamic self-assembled system where, depending on the molecular mobility, the transition between two periodic structures with different symmetry either leads to an increase of complexity, or to a chaotic regime with reduced order.

Next, we propose possible entropy decrease due to internal interactions in some isolated systems in biology, in which the neuroscience, the permeable membrane, the molecular motor, etc., are all some internal interactions. Further, a sufficient and necessary condition of entropy decrease is expressed quantitatively. Third, the moderate input negative entropy flow is discussed quantitatively. Fourth, the thermodynamics of physiology and psychology are introduced, and Qigong and various practices are often related to these order states with entropy decrease. Finally, some new research in biothermodynamics are discussed, for example, we propose entropy decrease as an index of therapeutics in biophysics, and life lies in a combination between motion and rest, etc.	Yunnan Univ, Dept Phys, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China	Chang, YF (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Dept Phys, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.	yifangch@sina.com						55	3	3	2	7	ANKA PUBLISHER	BORNOVA	116-11 SOK NO.10 K 2 D 2, BORNOVA, IZMIR 35050, TURKEY	1303-5150			NEUROQUANTOLOGY	NeuroQuantology		2013	11	2					189	196					8	Neurosciences	Neurosciences & Neurology	172WS	WOS:000321037500003					2019-12-05	4

YIM 69032 had been cultivated. On the basis of spectral data including of HRMS, NMR and 2D NMR, their structures were determined as (3R,5S,6R,7S,8Z)-8-en-5,7-dihydroxy-3,6-epoxy-tetradecanoic acid (1) and (R)-1-(3-ethylphenyl)-1, 2-ethanediol (2). Thus, a new microbial isolate, Pestalotia sp. was found to produce THFA. The possible pathway from tetradecanoic acid (4) to THFA (1) in the extract of potato by Pestalotia sp. was proposed. Structures 1 and 2 showed no cytotoxicity against HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480 cell lines.

Five isoenergetic diets containing graded levels of protein (29%, 34%, 39%, 44%, 49%) were fed to triplicate groups of fish (12.4 g) for 10 weeks in a recirculating rearing system maintained at 18-22 degrees C. Weight gain significantly increased as the dietary protein level increased to 44%, then slightly declined. Specific growth rate (SGR) significantly increased as the dietary protein level increased to 39%, then reached a plateau. In contrast, the feed conversion ratio decreased as the dietary protein level increased to 39%. The highest feed intake and protein efficiency ratio were obtained in fish fed the 34% diet. Broken-line regression analysis shows that the optimum dietary protein level for the maximum SGR is 39.3 +/- 1.7%, while second-order polynomial regression analysis shows that the maximum SGR occurs at 43.6% and that the minimum protein requirement is 34.7-37.3%. Together, these results indicate that the optimum range of protein for juvenile C. pellegrini is 37.3-43.6%.

J	Cheng, HJ				Cheng, Hongjun			Delta Shock Waves for a Linearly Degenerate Hyperbolic System of Conservation Laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type	ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL RIEMANN PROBLEM; CHAPLYGIN EULER EQUATIONS; VANISHING PRESSURE LIMIT; VACUUM STATES; FLUIDS; FLOW	This paper is devoted to the study of delta shockwaves for a hyperbolic system of conservation laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with two linearly degenerate characteristics. The Riemann problem is solved constructively. The Riemann solutions include exactly two kinds. One consists of two (or just one) contact discontinuities, while the other contains a delta shock wave. Under suitable generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition, the existence and uniqueness of delta shock solution are established. These analytical results match well the numerical ones. Finally, two kinds of interactions of elementary waves are discussed.

First, the original suspension system with ECU-actuator delay and sensor-ECU delay is modeled. By using delta operators, the original system is transformed into an associated sampled-data system with time delays in delta domain. After model transformation, the sampled-data system equation is reduced to one without actuator delays and convenient to calculate the states with nonintegral time delay. Therefore, the sampled-data optimal vibration control law can be easily obtained deriving from a Riccati equation and a Stein equation of delta domain. The feedforward control term and the control memory terms designed in the control law ensure the compensation for the effects produced by disturbance and actuator delay, respectively. Moreover, an observer is constructed to implement the physical realizability of the feedforward term and solve the immeasurability problem of some state variables. A half-car suspension model with delays is applied to simulate the responses through the designed controller. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the simplicity of the designing approach.

J	Li, TH; Xie, XG; Du, GB				Li, Tao-Hong; Xie, Xiao-Guang; Du, Guan-Ben			A theoretical study on the water-mediated asynchronous addition between urea and formaldehyde	CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS			English	Article						Urea; Formaldehyde; Water-mediated; Asynchronous; Addition	1ST-ROW ELEMENTS; AB-INITIO; BASIS-SET; HYDRATION; ENERGY; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS; INSIGHT; DENSITY; MODEL	The reaction between urea and formaldehyde in water solution was theoretically investigated by using B3LYP and MP2 methods. It was found that the addition of the nitrogen atom in urea to the carbonyl group in formaldehyde precedes the proton transfer and the proton migration from water to the carbonyl group occurs before the proton abstraction from the nitrogen. With one or two water molecules involved in the TS, the activation energy barrier is lowered compared to the TS of the mechanism with no water participation. The energy change along the reaction coordinate clearly shows that a zwitterionic-like intermediate does not exist on the PES. The reaction between urea and formaldehyde occurs in a concerted mechanism but with asynchronous characters. This is different from the stepwise mechanism recently found for the amination reactions of formaldehyde. (C) 2012 Guan-Ben Du. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society.

The calculated results show that the octahedral dipole moment of anatase TiO2 increases after N and Co codoping, which is favorable for effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Some new impurity energy levels of codoped TiO2 appear between the conduction band and the valence band, which results in the red shift of the absorption wavelength toward visible-light region and an apparent increase in performance of light absorption. These impurity energy levels can promote the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which facilitates the improvement of the photocatalytic efficiency of codoped TiO2. The band edge redox potential of codoped TiO2 is only slightly changed compared with that of pure TiO2, which means that the strong redox capacity of codoping photocatalyst is still excellent.

Then based on the basic equations of synergetics, we derive quantitatively the Lorenz equations and Lorenz mode of brain, whose two wings correspond to two hemispheres of brain, and two hemispheres jump about, which describes thinking. It shows that life lies in cooperation in chaos. The neural synergetics possesses three levels: structure, activity and thinking on brain. Next, based on the quantum and nonlinear neurobiology, we discuss the soliton-chaos double solutions of the nonlinear equation, and their possible meaning. Finally, combining some known theories in neurobiology and the elastic hypothesis of memory, etc., the physical neurobiology is proposed.

Also, through the reaction of polyhalo isophthalonitriles 1a-1c with hydrazines to give novel polyhalo 3-aminoindazoles 5 and 7 with moderate yield (70-87%). The anticancer activities of compounds 3, 5 and 7 were evaluated in vitro against human cell lines SKOV-3, HeLa, U2-OS, A549, and MCF-7. Some compounds showed excellent growth inhibitory activities and 3a was found to be the most potent derivative, with an IC50 value lower than 3.86 mu g mL(-1) against the five tumor cell lines. The mechanism of action of representative compound 5b was investigated in the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line. It was shown that 5b reduced cell viability of cancer cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. Cells treated with 5b accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and finally go into apoptosis.

Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain MBRL 353(T) and other members of the genus Rhodococcus showed sequence similarities ranging from 95.5 to 98.2%, with strain MBRL 353(T) showing closest sequence similarity to Rhodococcus triatomae IMMIB RIV-085(T) (98.2%) and Rhodococcus equi DSM 20307(T) (97.2%). DNA-DNA hybridization results, however, revealed that DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain MBRL 353(T) and R. triatomae DSM 44892(T) (43.4 %) and R. equi DSM 20307(T) (33.4 %) were well below the 70% limit for species identification. Strain MBRL 353(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and galactose and arabinose in the cell wall. Mycolic acids were present. The major fatty acids Were C-16:0 (45.7 %), C-18:1 omega 9c (18.2 %) and 10-methyl C-18:0 (11.3%). The only menaquinone detected was MK-8(H-2), while the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and one unknown phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 69.2 mol%. The phenotypic and genotypic data showed that strain MBRL 353(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Rhodococcus for which the name Rhodococcus canchipurensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MBRL 353(T) (=KCTC 19851(T)=JCM 17578(T)).

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; SOIL; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; PHYLOGENIES; EVOLUTION; WELLS	Three filamentous actinomycetes, strains YIM 65594(T), YIM 65638 and YIM 65642, were isolated from the surface-sterilized roots of Artemisia annua L. collected from Yunnan province, southwest China. These strains were found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of the genus Streptomyces. The organisms formed an extensively branched substrate mycelium, with abundant aerial hyphae that differentiated into spores. The cell wall of the isolates contained LL-diaminopimelic acid and the menaquinones were MK-9(H-8) and MK-9(H-6). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of these strains revealed that the strains clustered together and were most closely related to Streptomyces kunmingensis NBRC 14463(T), with 98.5-98.6 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The results of DNA DNA hybridization and physiological tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strains YIM 65594(T), YIM 65638 and YIM 65642 from related species. However, the high level of DNA DNA relatedness between them showed that these three strains belong to the same species. Strain YIM 65594(T) (=DSM 41984(T)=CCTCC AA 209036(T)) was selected as the type strain to represent this novel species, for which the name Streptomyces endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed.

(Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), were investigated. Upon encounter, a male approached a female, mounted her, grasped her terminal abdomen with his hind tarsi, and attempted to mate. Successful mating lasted about 3.5 h. Although all traits measured in females and half of traits in males were significantly correlated with mating success, the primary selection on virgin females was the genital trait, the bursa copulatrix length, and that on males was the body length and hind tarsal length. Longer bursa copulatrix accommodated a larger ejaculate, suggesting that this female trait benefits the male that first mates with the female in terms of increasing ejaculate size to beat subsequent males in sperm competition. Under a female-biased sex ratio, more than 20% of matings failed within 20s after the male genitalia had been inserted into hers, suggesting that males assess genital features of the female before insemination and undertake cryptic male mate choice. Larger males were more capable of grasping females and achieving mating. During the premating struggle the male almost always used his hind tarsi to lift the female terminal abdomen to the position for his genitalia to insert, and as a result, males with longer hind tarsi achieved higher mating success [Current Zoology 59 (2): 257-264, 2013].

Numerous morphological and physiological characters of cetaceans have been acquired in response to this drastic habitat transition, such as thickened blubber, echolocation, and ability to hold their breath for a long period of time. However, knowledge about the molecular basis underlying these adaptations is still limited. The sequence of the genome of Tursiops truncates provides an opportunity for a comparative genomic analyses to examine the molecular adaptation of this species. Here, we constructed 11,838 high-quality orthologous gene alignments culled from the dolphin and four other terrestrial mammalian genomes and screened for positive selection occurring in the dolphin lineage. In total, 368 (3.1%) of the genes were identified as having undergone positive selection by the branch-site model. Functional characterization of these genes showed that they are significantly enriched in the categories of lipid transport and localization, ATPase activity, sense perception of sound, and muscle contraction, areas that are potentially related to cetacean adaptations. In contrast, we did not find a similar pattern in the cow, a closely related species. We resequenced some of the positively selected sites (PSSs), within the positively selected genes, and showed that most of our identified PSSs (50/52) could be replicated. The results from this study should have important implications for our understanding of cetacean evolution and their adaptations to the aquatic environment.

It is found that the reciprocal coefficient of variance R has a maximum (R-max) with increasing noise intensity Q. The non-Gaussian noise parameter q has an important effect on the system. For some values of q (e.g., q = 0.9, q = 1.0), R has a maximum with increasing correlation time tau. Non-Gaussian noise induced spikes are more regular than Gaussian noise induced spikes when q is small and Q has large values. The R has a maximum with increasing q. Therefore, non-Gaussian noise could play more effective roles in the calcium oscillation system.

Fish were fed diets supplemented with graded cholesterol levels (0 [control], 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,1.2, and 1.5%) for nine weeks. The fish were then challenged by A. hydrophila and their survival rate recorded for the next week. Dietary cholesterol supplementation generally increased the serum and hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) activities, but decreased the serum and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. Further, the hepatic CAT and serum SOD, CAT, and TAC activities were significantly higher in fish fed diets supplemented with 0.9 or 1.2% cholesterol compared to those fed the control diet, whereas the serum and hepatic MDA contents were significantly lower. The respiratory burst activity, alternative complement activity, and hepatic lysozyme activity increased steadily when the supplemental cholesterol was increased by up to 1.2% and then declined with further addition. The serum lysozyme activity and phagocytic activity increased steadily with increasing dietary supplemental cholesterol level up to 0.9% and then declined with further addition. Dietary cholesterol supplementation generally enhanced the protection against A. hydrophila infection, and fish fed diets supplemented with 0.9 or 12% cholesterol exhibited the highest post-challenge survival rate. The results indicated that cholesterol may be under-supplied in rainbow trout fed soybean meal-based diets, and dietary cholesterol supplementation (0.9-1.2%) contributed to improved immune response and disease resistance of rainbow trout against A. hydrophila.

A detrended correspondence analysis of an exhaustive set of data collected from 105 and 223 plots for Yunnan and Taiwan, respectively, was applied to classify natural mature forest types. Additional data from 72 and 68 plots for Yunnan and Taiwan, respectively, were used for analyses of secondary succession. The floristic richness and diversity index were calculated for each type of forest. In Yunnan, the monsoon forests in mesic-humid sites had more taxa and tended to show higher species diversity than the other two forest types. In Taiwan, species diversity values were significantly higher in the Machilus-Castanopsis zone in the middle altitudes (500-1500 m) than for the other three forest zones. For both Yunnan and Taiwan, the forests at the middle successional stage showed significantly higher species diversity than those at the early successional stage. Differences in diversity between the middle and late stages were not significant. These findings highlight the high species diversity of the natural mature evergreen broad-leaved forests of both Yunnan and Taiwan. In the secondary forests, as succession proceeds, species diversity comes to resemble that of the natural mature forests. In both ecosystems, the drivers of species diversity patterns are moisture, altitude, and succession/disturbance.

The in vitro antitumor activity of the target compounds has been evaluated against HCT-116, MCF-7, K562, and SGC-7901 cell lines. The pharmacological results showed that most of the prepared compounds display excellent selective cytotoxicity toward HCT-116, MCF-7, and K562 cell lines. Particularly, compounds 10c, 10f and 10g show high inhibitory activity on these human cancer cell lines (IC50: 2.39-9.34 mu M). Conversely, all compounds are generally inactive against SGC-7901, with only 10b having IC50 below 50 mu M. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Experimental results show that as compared to the OTFTs with ZrO2/Al2O3 stacked and Al2O3/ZrO2/Al2O3 sandwiched gate dielectric, the device fabricated with the Al2O3/ZrO2 stacked gate dielectric manifests better electrical properties such as larger on/off ratio, smaller subthreshold slope, and higher carrier mobility. This could be explained by the fact that Al2O3 has good interface properties with CuPc and can act as a barrier layer, which prevents intermixing of materials at the organic/insulator interface and can slow oxygen diffusion through Al-O matrix, thus suppressing interfacial trap density. The gate-bias stress effect on the performance of OTFTs is also investigated. It is found that the threshold voltage shifts toward positive direction with stress time under a negative gate bias voltage. Longer stress times cause more degradation of the subthreshold and on/off ratio, probably due to more defect-state creation in the channel and an increase of interfacial traps and oxide charges in the dielectric during stress. Results also indicate that OTFTs with Al2O3 interlayer between the high-k dielectric and the gate electrode have less degradation in subthreshold and on/off ratio after a 3600-s stress. The involved mechanism lies in that the Al2O3 interlayer at the high-k dielectric/gate electrode interface can effectively block the injection of electrons from the gate electrode into the high-k material during electrical stress and thus less stress-induced interfacial traps and negative oxide charges in the devices. The electrical characteristics of the OTFTs after the removal of gate bias for a period of time are also studied. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

Previous studies reported a higher GD prevalence in Asian populations compared to Caucasian populations. The etiology of GD involves complex interactions between predisposing genes and environmental triggers. Genetic studies have shown that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is an important candidate genetic region associated with GD in Asian populations. However, the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of the HLA-B*46 allele in GD in Asian populations. A total of 14 case-controlled studies on the association of the HLA-B*46 allele in 1743 GD patients and 5689 controls were included. Our results showed a trend toward an increased risk of GD in HLA-B*46-positive subjects compared to those HLA-B*46-negative (OR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.96-3.13, P < 0.01). However, there were some limitations to the current meta-analysis, such as heterogeneity (P-heterogeneity < 0.01 and I-2 = 68.0%) or the different typing methods (serological and genotyping methods). The meta-analysis indicated that the HLA-B*46 allele is a risk factor for GD in Asian populations. Future studies on the role of the HLA-B*46 allele in GD should consider complications such as periodic paralysis, ophthalmopathy and recurrence.

In this paper, an improved wavelet-based compression method is proposed. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is firstly applied to the mean removed ECG signal. DWT coefficients in a hierarchical tree order are taken as the component of a vector named tree vector (TV). Then, the TV is quantized with a vector-scalar quantizer (VSQ), which is composed of a dynamic learning vector quantizer and a uniform scalar dead-zone quantizer. The context modeling arithmetic coding is finally employed to encode those quantized coefficients from the VSQ. All tested records are selected from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database. Statistical results show that the compression performance of the proposed method outperforms several published compression algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the segregation of simple sequence repeat markers linked to the Ppd-1 homoeologs, Winter-Abukumawase carried insensitive alleles Ppd-B1a and Ppd-D1a and Chihokukomugi carried a single insensitive allele (Ppd-A1a) that was first found in common wheat. The genomic sequence of Ppd-1 homoeologs including the 5' upstream region was determined and compared between the two genotypes. Ppd-D1a of Winter-Abukumawase had a deletion of 2,089 bp that was already reported for Ciano 67. Critical sequence polymorphism causing photoperiod insensitivity was not detected from the translation start codon to the 3' untranslated region of Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1. However, novel mutations were found in the 5' upstream region. Ppd-A1a of Chihokukomugi had a deletion of 1,085 bp and Ppd-B1a of Winter-Abukumawase had an insertion of 308 bp. A total of 80 DH lines were classified into eight genotypes by PCR-based genotyping using specific primer sets to detect the In/Dels in the 5' upstream region of three Ppd-1 genes. The heading dates of the DH lines differed significantly between the eight genotypes, showing that each of the three insensitive alleles accelerates heading by 7-9 days compared with the photoperiod-sensitive genotype. Interaction between the three genes was also significant.

Optoelectronic properties of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene	PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS			English	Article						ABC stacking; density of states; optical conductance; optoelectronic properties; trilayer graphene	BAND-GAP; FIELD	We present a theoretical study on the optoelectronic properties of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). The optical conductance and light transmittance are evaluated through using the energy-balance equation derived from the Boltzmann equation for an air/graphene/dielectric-wafer system in the presence of linearly polarized radiation field. The results obtained from two band structure models are examined and compared. For short wavelength radiation, the universal optical conductance sigma(0) = 3e(2)/(4h) can be obtained. Importantly, there exists an optical absorption window in the radiation wavelength range 10-200 mu m, which is induced by different transition energies required for inter- and intra-band optical absorption channels. As a result, we find that the position and width of this window depend sensitively on temperature and carrier density of the system, especially the lower frequency edge. There is a small characteristic absorption peak at about 82 mu m where the largest interband transition states exist in the ABC-stacked TLG model, in contrast to the relatively smooth curves in a simplified model. These theoretical results indicate that TLG has some interesting and important physical properties which can be utilized to realize infrared or THz optoelectronic devices.	[Xiao, Y.

Strain YIM 94025(T) was observed to grow at 25-45 A degrees C (optimum 37 A degrees C), 0-22 % NaCl (optimum 2-10 %) and pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 8.0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism belongs to the genus Tenuibacillus and exhibited sequence similarity of 98.0 % to the closest type strain, Tenuibacillus multivorans AS 1.3442(T). The predominant menaquinone was found to be MK-7; the cell-wall peptidoglycan diamino acid was meso-diaminopimelic acid; the polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unknown lipid; and the major fatty acids were found to contain iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain YIM 94025(T) are consistent with those of the genus Tenuibacillus. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness value between YIM 94025(T) and T. multivorans AS 1.3442(T) was 36.6 +/- A 4.5 %. The G+C content of the strain YIM 94025(T) was determined to be 38.5 %. Based on the comparative analysis of physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic data, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization results, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Tenuibacillus, for which the name Tenuibacillus halotolerans sp. nov., is proposed, with the type strain of YIM 94025(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012860(T) = KCTC 33046(T)).

By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation, the local stability of a positive equilibrium is considered. Moreover, we show that Hopf bifurcations occur when time delay crosses some critical values. By deriving the equation describing the flow on the center manifold, we give the formula for determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. In addition, we also try on the global existence of periodic solutions by using the global Hopf bifurcation result of Wu [J. Wu, Symmetric functional differential equations and neural networks with memory, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998) 4799-4838.] for functional differential equations. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results and they show that the time delays in the system under consideration can destroy the stability of the system.

NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MEMBER	A halotolerant actinomycete strain, designated XHU 5031(T), was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang Province, northwest China. Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans xiligouense DSM 15700(T) (98.4 %), Myceligenerans halotolerans XJEEM 11063(T) (98.0 %) and Myceligenerans crystallogenes DSM 17134(T) (97.5 %). However, it had relatively low values for DNA-DNA relatedness with the above strains (46.2, 39.4 and 36.5 %, respectively). The peptidoglycan type was A4 alpha. This organism contained glucose, mannose and galactose as the major whole cell sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0,C- anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), one unknown phospholipid (PL) and two unknown glycolipids (GL). The G+C content of genomic DNA was 71.2 mol %. Phenotypic data clearly distinguished the isolate from its closest relatives. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data indicated that the isolate XHU 5031(T) represented a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans. The proposed name for this organism is Myceligenerans salitolerans sp. nov., with type strain XHU 5031(T) (=KCTC 29128(T) = CCTCC AB 2012908(T)).

Typically, species distributed on the plateau have been hypothesized to re-treat to south-eastern refugia, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We evaluated sequence variation in the mitochondrial DNA gene Cytb and the nuclear DNA gene RAG-1 in Rana kukunoris, a species endemic to the QTP. Two major lineages, N and S, were identified, and lineage N was further subdivided into N1 and N2. The geographical distribution and genealogical divergences supported the hypothesis of multiple refugia. However, major lineages and sublineages diverged prior to the LGM. Demographical expansion was detected only in lineage S and sublineage N2. Sublineage N1 might have survived several glacial cycles in situ and did not expand after the LGM because of the absence of suitable habitat; it survived in river islands. Genetic analysis and environment modelling suggested that the north-eastern edge of QTP contained a major refugium for R.similar to kukunoris. From here, lineage S dispersed southwards after the LGM. Two microrefugia in northern Qilian Mountains greatly contributed to current level of intraspecific genetic diversity. These results were found to have important implications for the habitat conservation in Northwest China.

The results lent support to the current generic/subgeneric taxonomic classification in the genus group with the exceptions of the paraphyly of the genus Parastegana and the subgenus Oxyphortica in the genus Stegana. The ancestral areas and divergence times in the genus group were reconstructed/estimated, and accordingly, the biogeographical history of this important clade was discussed. It was proposed that, the evolution of the plant family Fagaceae, especially Quercus, may have played a certain role in facilitating the diversification of the Stegana genus group.

The objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividends minus the penalized discounted capital injections until the time of bankruptcy. We show that the optimal combinational reinsurance strategy must be pure excess-of-loss reinsurance. The control problem is solved by constructing some suboptimal model which allows no bankruptcy by capital injection. Then we obtain the analytical expressions for the value function and the optimal strategies and it is concluded that they are the same as those in the case of no bankruptcy.

Non-fluorescent oligomeric Au(I)-glutathione complex could aggregate to form Au(0)@Au(I)-thiolate nanoclusters with ultra-bright fluorescence in the presence of high concentrations of metal ions. However, if two metal ions (e. g. Zn2+ and Pb2+) were both used for aggregating Au(I)-glutathione, there is a synergistic aggregation effect on the complex. A very low concentration of Pb2+ could induce apparent fluorescence enhancement. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the relationship between fluorescence changes (Delta F) of the aggregation system and the addition of Pb2+ (c, mu M) in the range from 0.50 to 40.0 mu M was measured as Delta F 2.8 + 5.2 c, with the correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.996. Moreover, we carried out a visual fluorescence detection of Pb2+ under violet-light irradiation. The increasing fluorescence can be easily distinguished by color pictures using the naked eye.

Amorphous carbon can be loaded on the SnO2 nanoparticles uniformly in the solvothermal alcoholysis process, and the subsequent calcination results in the formation of hollow core-shell SnO2/C nanoparticle aggregates. They exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) at a constant current density of 50 mA g(-1), and the capacity retention is maintained over 90.9% after 100 cycles. The intrinsic hollow core-shell nature as well as high porosity of the unique nanostructures ensures the electrode has a high capacity and a good electronic conductivity. The hollow loose structure offers sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Herein, the SnO2/C electrode presents excellent electrochemical performance. This method is simple, low cost, mass-productive, and can also be used to prepare other advanced functional materials.

The synthetic parameters are regulated to control the size of the as-prepared CeO2 mesospheres. The activities of Pd@CeO2 catalysts are higher than that of Pd supported on Al2O3, and the activity of 1 wt% Pd@CeO2 can be further improved and its T-90 is 2 degrees C. The intrinsic cage-bell nature as well as high porosity of the unique nanostructures of the CeO2 support contributes greatly to the formation of large numbers of surface oxygen vacancies on Pd@CeO2 catalysts, and thus it exhibits superior catalytic activity. This method is simple, low cost, mass-productive, and can also be used to prepare other advanced functional materials.

The halloysite nanotubes can adsorb the TiO2 precursor and induce the growth of TiO2 nanocrystals on the support in situ. By simply adjusting the acidity of the TiO2 sol, crystalline TiO2 composite halloysite nanotubes with tunable crystalline phases of anatase or anatase/rutile mixed phases were achieved. The traditional thermal treatment for crystallite transformation was not required, thus an intact halloysite structure could be guaranteed. The as-obtained products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalysis test results revealed that the obtained heterogeneous TiO2-halloysite showed enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B and gentian violet compared with the pure halloysite nanotubes and Degussa-P25 owing to the heterogeneous TiO2 structure.

Compounds with several different linear terminal alkyl chains can form liquid crystals with columnar phases, and most of these are room temperature columnar phases. A model is proposed for the organization of the molecules in the columns, which is based on the nanosegregation of the aromatic cores and alkyl chains and a staggered organization of the star-shaped molecules in columns. Branching of the peripheral alkyl chains leads to an amorphous material.

We demonstrate that when the waveguide is coated with a negative permittivity layer, a surface WGM can be generated. It exposes a strong evanescent field to the ambient substance, rendering the negative permittivity material assisted microring sensor much more sensitive to a slight change in surrounding medium. This opens up an avenue towards designing optical WGM sensors with superior performance.

We cloned a partial cDNA of PAL gene, DcPAL1, from Dracaena cambodiana seedlings using RT-PCR with degenerate primers that were designed based on a multiple sequence alignment of known PAL genes from other plant species. DcPAL1 shows highly homologous to other known PAL genes registered in GenBank, being closest to that of Musa acuminata. DcPAL1 has a relatively high GC content and most of the GC is in the third codon position. It has 768 bp in size with a maximum open reading frame (ORF) of 765 bp, encoding a 255 amino acid-polypeptide. The deduced PAL protein is a stable protein, having classical PAL domains and consisting of three major hydrophobic domains. Analysis of effective number of codons (ENC) shows that DcPAL1 codons are used at equal frequency. Relatively higher usage frequency appears randomly in codons ended with any of the four bases; six codons have no usage bias. There are 45 codons showing distinct usage preference between DcPAL1 and E. coli, 20 between DcPAL1 and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of DcPAL1. Upon the elicitation of Fusarium proliferatum, a potent elicitor of dragon's blood, the PAL enzyme activity in the leaves and stems of D. cambodiana and other two Dracaena spp. significantly increased, accompanying with the formation of dragon's blood, indicating the involvement of PAL in the biosynthesis of dragon's blood, a precious traditional medicine.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential interactions between p53 functional mutations, polymorphisms, allelic loss and telomere erosion in 126 breast tumor patients and 68 esophageal cancer patients. Telomere length (TL) was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Somatic mutations, polymorphisms and allelic loss in the TP53 gene were detected by direct sequencing of both tumor and normal tissue samples. Our results showed that telomeres were significantly shorter in tumors with somatic p53 mutations compared with tumors with wild-type p53 in both breast tumors (P=0.007) and esophageal cancer (P=0.001). Telomeres of patients with minor genotype CC of rs12951053 and GG of rs1042522 were significantly shorter compared to patients with other genotypes of this single nucleotide polymorphism in esophageal cancer tissue. Furthermore, TP53 allelic loss was detected and significantly associated with somatic mutations in both types of tumor tissues. These findings suggest that somatic p53 mutations, rs12951053 genotype CC and rs1042522 genotype GG contribute to erosion of telomeres, and TP53 allelic loss may be one of the representations of chromosomal instability caused by telomere erosion combined with somatic p53 mutations. These results support that the TP53 gene has a strong interaction with TL erosion in tumorigenesis.

However, to date, the low quantum yield for solar hydrogen production over photocatalysts has hindered advances in the practical applications of photocatalysis. Here, we show that a carbon nitride intercalation compound (CNIC) synthesized by a simple molten salt route is an efficient polymer photocatalyst with a high quantum yield. We found that coordinating the alkali metals into the C-N plane of carbon nitride will induce the un-uniform spatial charge distribution. The electrons are confined in the intercalated region while the holes are in the far intercalated region, which promoted efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. The donor-type alkali metal ions coordinating into the nitrogen pots of carbon nitrides increase the free carrier concentration and lead to the formation of novel nonradiative paths. This should favor improved transport of the photogenerated electron and hole and decrease the electron-hole recombination rate. As a result, the CNIC exhibits a quantum yield as high as 21.2% under 420 nm light irradiation for solar hydrogen production. Such high quantum yield opens up new opportunities for using cheap semiconducting polymers as energy transducers.

According to the rootzone development we distinguished between the upper (0-10 cm from the soil surface) and lower layers (20-30 cm). Over 36 days, the initial measured concentration of HCB was reduced to 61%, 51%, 42% and 40% in the lower layer without roots of Phragmites, in the lower layer with roots of Typha, in the upper layer with roots of Typha, and in the upper layer with roots of Phragmites respectively. The 90% degradation time (DT90) of the initial measured HCB can be calculated as 192, 121, 110 and 92 days (d) respectively. PeCB, 1, 2, 3, 4-, 1, 2, 3, 5- and 1, 2, 4, 5-TeCB, and 1, 2, 3-, 1, 2, 4- and 1, 3, 5-TCB were the main dechlorination products detected in MC sediment samples. The dechlorination rates of HCB were higher in sediment layers with well-developed root zones.

J	Chen, XL; Wang, QH				Chen, Xiaolin; Wang, Qihua			Variable selection in the additive rate model for recurrent event data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Adaptive LASSO; Additive rate model; SCAD; Recurrent event data; Variable selection	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; ORACLE PROPERTIES; ADAPTIVE LASSO; RISK MODEL; REGRESSION; ASYMPTOTICS	In this paper, we investigate the variable selection problem for recurrent event data under the additive rate model. According to the explicit estimator of the regression coefficients of the additive rate model, a loss function is constructed. It has a form similar to the ordinary least squares of a linear regression model up to a constant. We develop variable selection procedures by penalizing the loss function with the adaptive L-1 penalty and smoothly clipped absolute derivation penalty, respectively. Under some mild regularity conditions, the oracle properties of both procedures are established. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of our proposed procedures in finite samples. Finally, these methods are applied to the well-known chronic granulomatous disease study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fang, J; Zhang, L				Fang, Jun; Zhang, Li			Hadronic gamma-ray emission from molecular clouds overtaken by supernova remnants	NEW ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Gamma rays: ISM-ISM: supernova remnants	MULTIBAND NONTHERMAL EMISSION; DIFFUSIVE SHOCK ACCELERATION; COSMIC-RAYS; IC 443; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; ENERGY; SHELL; DISCOVERY; TEV; RX-J0852.0-4622	A model is proposed to describe the high-energy gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant (SNR) interacting with a dense molecular cloud (MC). In this model, a shock with a low Alfven Mach number can be produced when a part of a SNR shell drives into a dense MC, and then the proton spectrum in the test-particle case with the Alfven drift is much softer than that for strong shocks; the gamma-rays produced via inelastic proton-proton (pp) interaction from the SNR can be greatly enhanced. The model is applied to the five GeV-bright SNRs IC443, W51C, W44, W498, and W28 which are known to be interacting with MCs. The gamma-ray spectra of these SNRs can be reproduced as the pp interaction from the MCs overtaken by the SNR shocks within the test-particle diffusive shock acceleration regime. For the five SNRs, the spectral breaks around several GeV detected with the Fermi LAT are due to the softness of the energy distributions of the protons accelerated in the SNR shells with low Alfven Mach numbers.

Based on the improved method, an efficient and stereoselective synthesis of (Z,E)-9,11-hexadecadienal, the main pheromone component of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, was achieved in 38% overall yield, which more desirable then previously reported methods. The stereochemistry relied on cross-coupling between Grignard reagent and protected 7-bromo-(Z, E)-4,6-heptadienal. The concise and facile synthetic strategy described herein provided a generally synthetic approach to other (Z, E)-dienic compounds.

J	Li, CH; Song, SJ; Wang, DJ				Li, Cai Heng; Song, Shu Jiao; Wang, Dian Jun			A characterization of metacirculants	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL THEORY SERIES A			English	Article						Metacirculant; Edge-transitive; Cubic	ARC-TRANSITIVE CIRCULANTS; GRAPHS; CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMORPHISMS; DIHEDRANTS	Metacirculants were introduced by Alspach and Parsons in 1982 and have been a rich source of various topics since then, including the Hamiltonian path problem in metacirculants. A metacirculant has a vertex-transitive metacyclic subgroup of automorphisms, and a long-standing interesting question in the area is if the converse statement is true, namely, whether a graph with a vertex-transitive metacyclic automorphism group is a metacirculant. We shall answer this question in the negative, and then present a classification of cubic metacirculants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
