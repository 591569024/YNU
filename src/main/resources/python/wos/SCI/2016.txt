J	Wang, YQ; Wang, RW; Li, YT; Ma, ZS				Wang, Yaqiang; Wang, Ruiwu; Li, Yaotang; Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)			Sex Ratio Elasticity Influences the Selection of Sex Ratio Strategy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STRUCTURED POPULATIONS; ADJUSTMENT	There are three sex ratio strategies (SRS) in nature-male-biased sex ratio, female-biased sex ratio and, equal sex ratio. It was R. A. Fisher who first explained why most species in nature display a sex ratio of 1/2. Consequent SRS theories such as Hamilton's local mate competition (LMC) and Clark's local resource competition (LRC) separately explained the observed deviations from the seemingly universal 1:1 ratio. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not yet a unified theory that accounts for the mechanisms of the three SRS. Here, we introduce the price elasticity theory in economics to define sex ratio elasticity (SRE), and present an analytical model that derives three SRSs based on the following assumption: simultaneously existing competitions for both resources A and resources B influence the level of SRE in both sexes differently. Consequently, it is the difference (between two sexes) in the level of their sex ratio elasticity that leads to three different SRS. Our analytical results demonstrate that the elasticity-based model not only reveals a highly plausible mechanism that explains the evolution of SRS in nature, but also offers a novel framework for unifying two major classical theories (i.e., LMC & LRC) in the field of SRS research.

The structural and morphological features of g-C3N4/TiO2 were investigated through the X-ray diffraction, Fourier transformed infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. It is found the TiO2 nanoparticles with a size of 7.3 +/- 1.6 nm are uniformly anchored on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets in isolation. The photocatalytic properties of as-prepared g-C3N4/TiO2 were tested by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light, and an enhanced activity is observed. The mechanism of the enhanced activity was further investigated through N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, UV-vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, photoelectrochemical measurements, radical trapping experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performances of obtained g-C3N4/TiO2 under sunlight were also evaluated in aspects of degradation efficiency and stability. The results indicate that the obtained g-C3N4/TiO2 is one promising photocatalyst for practical applications. The study of as-prepared g-C3N4/TiO2 also implies that the present method could be a general route of g-C3N4-coupling photocatalysts.

The whole genome sequences of six strawberry species (Fragaria spp.) have been released, which provide one of the richest genomic resources of any plant genus. In this study, we first generated seven transcriptome sequences of Fragaria species de novo, with a total of 48,557-82,537 unigenes per species. Combined with 13 other species genomes in Rosales, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree at the genomic level. The phylogenic tree shows that Fragaria closed grouped with Rubus and the Fragaria Glade is divided into three subclades. East Asian species appeared in every subclade, suggesting that the genus originated in this area at 7.99 Mya. Four species found in mountains of Southwest China originated at 3.98 Mya, suggesting that rapid speciation occurred to adapt to changing environments following the uplift of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Moreover, we identified 510 very significantly positively selected genes in the cultivated species F. x ananassa genome. This set of genes was enriched in functions related to specific agronomic traits, such as carbon metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction processes, which are directly related to fruit quality and flavor. These findings illustrate comprehensive evolutionary patterns in Fragaria and the genetic basis of fruit domestication of cultivated strawberry at the genomic/transcriptomic level.

The model was used to simulate the biological process of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) treating high COD and nitrogen piggery wastewater without any pretreatment. In the model, the AGS utilizes readily biodegradable substrates for simultaneous storage, growth and metabolism during the feast phase. It further utilizes storage products for secondary growth and metabolism during the famine phase. Finally, it produces inert organic carbon through the decay. For nitrogen removal, nitrification process is mainly heterotrophic nitrification. Denitrification is completed by a combined process of anoxic and aerobic denitrification. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data shows that the modified model satisfactorily simulated the organic substrates degradation, nitrification and denitrification processes of treatment of high-concentration piggery wastewater by AGS.

Cu-MCM-41 (Cu:Si = 1:100) catalyst exhibited good selectivity (73.0%) of 2,5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid and conversion (21.7%) of p-xylene using acetic acid and acetonitrile (V: V = 3:7) as the solvents at 80 degrees C for 5 h. The possible mechanism of the oxidation of p-xylene to 2,5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid was proposed and would guide us to design high performance catalyst for sp(2) and sp(3) C-H oxidation. This procedure is also expected to be an alternative method to Kolbe-Schmitt Process for the synthesis of o-hydrobenzoic acids and their derivatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The absorption spectra, near-infrared (NIR) luminescence properties and decay time spectra are investigated. The results show that the NIR emission peak around 1030 nm of Yb3+ ions and two NIR emission bands around 1180 and 1300 nm of Bi ions are observed, under 690 nm LD excitation. Two NIR emission bands of Bi-related are ascribing in different Bi-related NIR emission centers, Bi-0 for 1180 nm and Bi+ ion for 1300 nm, respectively. NIR luminescence intensity of Yb3+ ions, Bi-0 and Bi+ ion is decreased. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is broadening with the increasing in Yb2O3 concentration, and over 361 nm. The energy transfer (ET) among Yb3+, Bi-0, and Bi+ NIR emission center is also investigated, under 690 nm LD excitation. It shows that Bi-0 ion transfer energy to Bi+ and Yb3+ ions. The Yb3+ ion addition is benefit to Bi+ ions NIR luminescence. This could be the reason for broadening the FWHM. YbeBi codoped germanate glass is a promising material for broadband optical amplification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Broadband and high linearity radio over fiber (RoF) transmission systems are considered a promising solution for the front-haul. Digital linearization is one possible solution for RoF front-haul. In this paper, we investigate RF domain digital predistortion (DPD) linearization for broadband RoF front-haul. The implemented DPD is first investigated in 2.4 GHz WiFi over fiber transmission systems at 36 Mb/s, and more than 8-dB and 5.6-dB improvements of error vector magnitude (EVM) are achieved in back to back (BTB) and after 10 km single mode fiber (SMF) transmission. Further, both WiFi and ultra wide band (UWB) wireless signals are transmitted together, in which the DPD has linearization bandwidth of 2.4 GHz. It is shown that the implemented DPD leads to EVM improvements of 4.5-dB (BTB) and 3.1-dB (10 km SMF) for the WiFi signal, and 4.6-dB (BTB) and 4-dB (10 km SMF) for the broadband UWB signal.

Starting from the analysis of moving targets' acoustic signatures, a pitch-based harmonics representation model of acoustic signal is put forward. According to the proposed harmonics model, a modified greatest common divisor (MGCD) method is developed to obtain an initial multipitch set (IMS). Subsequently, the harmonic number vector (HNV) associated with the IMS is determined by maximizing the objective function formulated as a multi-impulse-train weighted symmetric average magnitude sum function (SAMSF) of the observed signal. The frequencies of SAMSF are determined by the target acoustic signal, the periods of the multi-impulse-train are governed by the estimated IMS harmonics and the maximization of the objective function is figured out through a time-domain matching of periodicities of the multi-impulse-train with that of the SAMSF. Finally, by using the obtained IMS and its HNV, a precise fundamental frequency set is achieved.

Competition of superconductivity with the structural transition in Mo3Sb7	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ANDREEV REFLECTION; LOW-TEMPERATURE; GAP	Prior to the superconducting transition at T-c approximate to 2.3 K, Mo3Sb7 undergoes a symmetry-lowering, cubic-totetragonal structural transition at T-s = 53 K. We have monitored the pressure dependence of these two transitions by measuring the resistivity of Mo3Sb7 single crystals under various hydrostatic pressures up to 15 GPa. The application of external pressure enhances T-c but suppresses T-s until P-c approximate to 10 GPa, above which a pressureinduced first-order structural transition takes place and is manifested by the phase coexistence in the pressure range 8 <= P <= 12 GPa. The cubic phase above 12 GPa is also found to be superconducting with a higher T-c approximate to 6 K that decreases slightly with further increasing pressure. The variations with pressure of T-c and T-s satisfy the Bilbro-McMillan equation, i. e. (TcTs1-n)-T-n = constant, thus suggesting the competition of superconductivity with the structural transition that has been proposed to be accompanied with a spin-gap formation at T-s. Our first-principles calculations suggest the importance of magnetism that competes with the superconductivity in Mo3Sb7.	[Ye, G. Z.; Cheng, J-G; Sun, J.

In this work, the adsorption behaviors and dissociation reaction path of water on the different surfaces of Au, Cu, and AuCu binary alloy were studied by using DFT calculations. Based on the calculations, the corresponding catalytic performance of each model was further analyzed. The calculated results showed that the catalytic activity of the considered four surface models is on the following order: Au(111) < AuCu(111)-Cu < AuCu(111)-Au < Cu(111), if using the active energy as comparison standard. The underlying reason of this phenomenon is closely related with the adsorption behavior: the molecular adsorptions of water on Cu(111) and AuCu(111)-Au surfaces have relatively small adsorption energies; while at the same time, the dissociation adsorptions of water on these two surfaces have relatively large adsorption energies. Based on the electron transfer and bonding electronic structure, it could be found that the more electrons transfer between surface and water or H+OH groups, the more strong interaction between catalyst and adsorbate. Furthermore, the overlapping or hybridization between the d states of metal atoms on the surface and the lb(1) states of water or lb(1)-like states of H+OH groups also determines this interaction. Therefore, using Au Cu binary alloy to replace Au as catalyst or co-catalyst reduces cost, and enhances the catalytic activity.

This study aimed to comprehensively elucidate the association of common genetic variants in FOXO3 with human longevity in a Chinese population. Eighteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FOXO3 were successfully genotyped in 616 unrelated long-lived individuals and 846 younger controls. No nominally significant effects were found. However, when stratifying by gender, four SNPs (rs10499051, rs7762395, rs4946933 and rs3800230) previously reported to be associated with longevity and one novel SNP (rs4945815) showed significant association with male longevity (P-values: 0.007-0.032), but all SNPs were not associated with female longevity. Correspondingly, males carrying the G-G-T-G haplotype of rs10499051, rs7762395, rs4945815 and rs3800230 tended to have longer lifespan than those carrying the most common haplotype A-G-C-T (odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-4.63, P = 0.013). However, none of the associated SNPs and haplotype remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, our findings revealed that the FOXO3 variants we tested in our population of Chinese men and women were associated with longevity in men only. None of these associations passed Bonferroni correction. Bonferroni correction is very stringent for association studies. We therefore believe the effects of these nominally significant variants on human longevity will be confirmed by future studies.

Large declines of population size have been widely observed and currently 22,176 species are threatened by extinction. The time at which a threatened species began rapid population decline (RPD) and the rate of RPD provide important clues about the driving forces of population decline and anticipated extinction time. However, these parameters remain unknown for the vast majority of threatened species. Here we analyzed the genetic diversity data of nuclear and mitochondrial loci of 2,764 vertebrate species and found that the mean genetic diversity is lower in threatened species than in related nonthreatened species. Our coalescence-based modeling suggests that in many threatened species the RPD began similar to 123 y ago (a 95% confidence interval of 20-260 y). This estimated date coincides with widespread industrialization and a profound change in global living ecosystems over the past two centuries. On average the population size declined by similar to 25% every 10 y in a threatened species, and the population size was reduced to similar to 5% of its ancestral size. Moreover, the ancestral size of threatened species was, on average, similar to 22% smaller than that of nonthreatened species. Because the time period of RPD is short, the cumulative effect of RPD on genetic diversity is still not strong, so that the smaller ancestral size of threatened species may be the major cause of their reduced genetic diversity; RPD explains 24.1-37.5% of the difference in genetic diversity between threatened and nonthreatened species.

Frequency-domain methods are computationally expensive, especially for large-scale broadband problems. A numerical technique is proposed to enable the efficient use of finite-difference time-domain method for broadband simulations. By incorporating a total-field/scattered-field boundary, the simulation domain is restricted inside a tightly bounded region. The incident field is further synthesized by the Fourier transform for both subcritical and supercritical incidences. Finally, the scattered far field is computed using a half-space Green's function. Numerical examples are further provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

This method based on the building blocks of piperazine ketone enamine ester 1, which reacted with quinones 2 through alpha-C selective alkylation of the enamine ester and via dehydrogenation oxidation reaction in acetonitrile at room temperature and acetic acid as catalyst. As a result, a series of novel ketopiperzine-substituted quinone derivatives 3a similar to 31 have been synthesized efficiently with 70%similar to 88% yield. This method possesses some advantages such as simple synthetic route, readily available starting materials, high yields and simple work-up procedures.

NOV.; BACTERIUM; SOIL; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION	Two gamma- and UV-radiation-resistant, pink-coloured bacterial strains, designated YIM F302(T) and YIM F235, were isolated from the desert of Yanbu' al Bahr located in west of Saudi Arabia. Taxonomic positions of the two isolates were investigated by polyphasic taxonomic approaches. Cells of the two strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped. They were able to grow at 15-45 degrees C and pH 6.0-8.0 and had a NaCl tolerance limit of 1% (w/v). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains YIM F302(T) and YIM F235 represent members of the genus Deinococcus, sharing highest sequence similarities of 98.3 and 98.4%, respectively, with Deinococcus grandis DSM 3963(T). The strains were found to contain MK-8 as the respiratory menaquinone. Major fatty acids (>10%) of the two strains were C-15:1 omega 6C, C-16:0 and C-16:1 omega 7C. DNA DNA hybridization values of the two isolates against the closely related type strains were significantly below the 70% limit for species delineation. Genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM F302(T) and YIM F235 were 69.3 and 69.0 mol%, respectively. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics recorded, it is determined that the two isolates represent a novel species of the genus Deinococcus, for which the name Deinococcus saudiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM F302(T) (=CGMCC 1.15089(T)=DSM 29933(T)).

The strain was aerobic, Gram-stain-positive and the optimum NaCL concentration for growth was 1-3% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain XHU 50891 showed that the organism was related most closely to Glycomyces albus TRM 49136(T) (97.7% similarity). However, it had a relatively low mean DNA DNA relatedness value with G. albus TRM 49136(T) (18.9 +/- 5.8%). The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of glucose and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H-4) and MK-9 (H-4). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 iSO-C-16:1 and anteiso-C-17:0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.6 mol%. A novel species, Glycomyces lacisalsi sp. nov., is proposed, with XHU 50891 (=CCTCC AA 2015034(T)=KCTC 39688(T)) as the type strain.

NOV; BACTERIUM; GROUNDWATER; CHINA; SOIL	A novel arsenic-resistant bacterium, designated 42-50(T), was isolated from the high-arsenic sediment of Jianghan Plain, Hubei Province, China. Phylogenetic and biochemical analysis indicated that this bacterium represents the first species of a novel genus belonging to the family Hyphomicrobiaceae. The 16S rRNA gene of strain 42-50(T) shares 96.3-94.2, 96.3, 96.2 and 94.9-93.8% sequence identities to those of species from the genera Devosia, Youhaiella, Paradevosia and Pelagibacterium, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids are C-16:0, C-18:0, C-18:1 omega 7C 11-methyl and summed feature 8 (comprising C-18:1 omega 7c and C-18:1 omega 6c). The predominant polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified glycolipids. The predominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The DNA G+C content of strain 42-50(T) is 73.7 mol%. The distinct phylogenetic lineage and unique cellular fatty acids suggest that strain 42-50(T) represents a novel species of a new genus affiliated with the family Hyphomicrobiaceae, for which the name Arsenicitalea aurantiaca gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 42-50(T) (=CCTCC AB 2014325(T)=KCTC 42825(T)).

We use Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to fit 12 day-scale SEDs of Mrk 421 with one-zone SSC models. Three types of electron energy distribution (EED), a log-parabola (LP) EED, a power-law log-parabola (PLLP) EED and a broken power-law (BPL) EED, are assumed in fits. We find that the one-zone SSC model with the PLLP EED provides successful fits to all the 12 SEDs. However, the one-zone SSC model with the LP and BPL EEDs fail to provide acceptable fits to the highest energy X-ray data or GeV data in several states. We therefore conclude that the one-zone SSC model works well in explaining the SEDs of Mrk 421, and the PLLP EED is preferred over the LP and BPL EEDs for Mrk 421 during the flare in 2010 March. We derive magnetic field B' similar to 0.01 G, Doppler factor delta(D) similar to 30-50 and the curvature parameter of EED r similar to 1-10 in the model with the PLLP EED. The evolutions of model parameters are explored. The physical implications of our results are discussed.

These functions depend heavily on the accuracy of human activity recognition, and thus real applications that use mobile devices-based human activity recognition systems (MARSs) need to seamlessly incorporate the information carried by newly labeled training samples. Motivated by the success of the weightlessness feature, we propose a new two-directional feature for bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) for incremental learning in human activity recognition. To further improve the performance, we also present a new ensemble classifier termed multicolumn BLSTM (MBLSTM), which effectively combines different acceleration signal features to further improve activity recognition accuracy. Experiments on the naturalistic mobile devices-based human activity dataset suggest that MBLSTM is superior to other state-of-the-art MARS methods.

Several hundreds of loci have been reported to be associated with growth trait and body weight in chickens. The loci are mapped to large genomic regions due to the low density and limited number of genetic markers in previous studies. Herein, we employed comparative population genomics to identify genetic basis underlying the small body size of Yuanbao chicken (a famous ornamental chicken) based on 89 whole genomes. The most significant signal was mapped to the BMP10 gene, whose expression was upregulated in the Yuanbao chicken. Overexpression of BMP10 induced a significant decrease in body length by inhibiting angiogenic vessel development in zebrafish. In addition, three other loci on chromosomes 1, 2, and 24 were also identified to be potentially involved in the development of body size. Our results provide a paradigm shift in identification of novel loci controlling body size variation, availing a fast and efficient strategy. These loci, particularly BMP10, add insights into ongoing research of the evolution of body size under artificial selection and have important implications for future chicken breeding.

However, the given materials for the structures may not be optimal or suitable, since the boundary condition and applied loads vary in practical applications; hence the macro-structure and its material micro-structure should be considered simultaneously. Although abundant studies have been reported on the structural and material optimization at each level, very few of them considered the mutual coordination on both scales. In this paper, two FE models are built for the macro-structure and the micro-structure, respectively; and the effective elastic properties of the periodic micro-structure are blended into the analysis of macro-structure by the homogenization theory. Here, a topological optimum is obtained by gradually re-distributing the constituents within the micro-structure and updating the topological shape at the macro-structure until converges are achieved on both scales. The mutual coordination between the roles of micro-scale and macro-scale is considered. Some numerical examples are presented, which illustrate that the proposed optimization algorithm is effective and highly efficient for the micro-structure design and macro-structure optimization. For the composite design, one can see reasonable effects of the stiffness of base materials on the resultant topologies.

Herein, we study the magnetic properties and electronic structures of transition-metal-doped arsenene by using first-principles calculations. Three doping concentrations are considered in our investigation. The results show that not all 3d transition metal (TM) atoms can induce the magnetic state in arsenene. Moreover, the doping concentration hardly affects the magnetic moment except for Fe- and Ni-doped systems. We believe, in particular, that the magnetism is dominantly controlled by the doping TM atoms, and no significant contributions are induced, even by their nearest arsenic atoms. In addition, the multi plicate electronic structures of TM-doped arsenene, such as semiconductor, metal and half metal, have also been revealed and discussed in this work, which may provide a new attention for the doped arsenene nanosheets.

The calculated results are as follows. (i) The (110) surface is the main exposing surface of SiGe, in which O impurity prefers to occupy the surface vacancy sites. (ii) For O interstitial doping on SiGe (110) surface, the existences of energy states caused by O doping in the band gap not only enhance the infrared light absorption, but also improve the behaviors of photo-generated carriers. (iii) The finding about decreased surface work function of O-doped SiGe (110) surface can confirm previous experimental observations. (iv) In all cases, O doing mainly induces the electronic structures near the band gap to vary, but is not directly involved in these variations. Therefore, these findings in the present work not only can provide further explanation and analysis for the corresponding underlying mechanism for some of the experimental findings reported in the literature, but also conduce to the development of mu c-SiGe-based solar cells in the future.

Both the crystal structures of NiPc powders and nanowires are studied by x-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The lattice constants of NiPc nanowires from the fitting of XRD patterns are a = 13.04 angstrom, b = 3.75 angstrom, c = 24.32 angstrom, beta = 94.10 degrees, belonging to the space group of monoclinic (P2(1)/c). X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests main peaks at 284.82 eV and 286.18 eV for C-C and C-N bonds and two peaks at 397.8 eV and 398.8 eV for N-C and the N-Ni bonds, respectively, in NiPc nanowires. FTIR spectra show a structural transition from powder to nanowire. The optical properties of NiPc nanowires have been investigated via a comparison between theoretical and experimental approaches. The most significant absorption peaks of NiPc nanowires in the visible region are located at 626 nm and 672 nm, showing a blue shift comparing with the beta-NiPc. We have also theoretically revealed the excitation energies in NiPc single molecule and dimer in the form of alpha and beta phases using time-dependent density-functional theory. These theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with the measurements of optical properties. Moreover, no noticeable change in crystalline form is shown when tuning the heating temperature from 420 degrees C to 450 degrees C, suggesting a wide synthesis temperature window. The reduced Ni-Ni distance indicated a clear advantage over powder in terms of potential applications in organic electronics.

Finite mixtures of gamma distributions are their natural extensions, and they are particularly useful when the population is suspected of heterogeneity. These distributions are successfully employed in various applications, but many researchers falsely believe that the maximum likelihood estimator of the mixing distribution is consistent. Similarly to finite mixtures of normal distributions, the likelihood function under finite gamma mixtures is unbounded. Because of this, each observed value leads to a global maximum that is irrelevant to the true distribution. We apply a seemingly negligible penalty to the likelihood according to the shape parameters in the fitted model. We show that this penalty restores the consistency of the likelihoodbased estimator of the mixing distribution under finite gamma mixture models. We present simulation results to validate the consistency conclusion, and we give an example to illustrate the key points.

The morphology, structure and catalytic properties of the as-synthesized macro-/nanoporous products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption-desorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Pure and Al-doped ZnO have coral-like shape with the pores size ranging from several manometers to ten micrometers. The walls of the macropores contain smaller nanopores, exhibiting the hierarchically porous morphology. The catalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples were tested by measuring the degradation efficiency of azo dye Congo red (CR) under visible light, UV light and dark light, respectively. The results show excellent removal capacity for organic pollutants CR in wastewater. Macro-/nanoporous Al-ZnO with different contents of Al have better catalytic degradation efficiency than pure ZnO. The experimental results indicate the potential use of macro-/nanoporous Al-ZnO for catalytic degradation of Congo red dye in different environments, which provides a potentially low-cost alternative for the remediation of azo-dye effluents.

J	Luo, LJ; Tang, W; Barrow, CJ; Yang, WR; Wang, HB; Jiang, FZ				Luo, Lijun; Tang, Wei; Barrow, Colin J.; Yang, Wenrong; Wang, Hongbin; Jiang, Fengzhi			Photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A by HMS/g-C3N4 composite	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Photocatalysis; g<bold>-</bold>C3N4; Mesoporous silica; Bisphenol A	GRAPHITIC CARBON NITRIDE; VISIBLE-LIGHT IRRADIATION; MESOPOROUS SILICA; PERFORMANCE; ADSORPTION; EFFICIENT; TEMPLATE; G-C3N4; PHOTODEGRADATION; POLYMERIZATION	In this work, hexagonal mesoporous silica/g-C3N4 (HMS/C3N4) was synthesized by heating a mixture of self-prepared HMS and dicyandiamide. The as-prepared materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis (BET). The prepared photocatalysts were applied to decompose bisphenol A (BPA) under UV light illumination. The mass ratios of HMS to melamine were optimized. The results showed that optimal mass ratios HMS to dicyandiamide was 1:1. Even though with the same catalyst dosage (1.0g/L), the degradation kinetic rate constant of BPA over HMS/C3N4 (0.00526min(-1)) was 1.76 times and 1.4 times than those on P25 (0.00298min(-1)) and pure C3N4 (0.00383min(-1)), while the rate constant of photolysis was only 0.00021min(-1). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the HMS/C3N4 composite was ascribed to higher specific surface area and less aggregation compared to the pure C3N4. It is feasible and efficient to degrade BPA by HMS/C3N4 composite, which is easier to be separated than pure C3N4 after the pollutant has been removed completely.

In this study, a low-cost biological waste-stiff silkworm was first used as precursor for the synthesis of well-developed microporous carbon (SSMC) material by simple steps of carbonization and further activation. The SSMC was endowed with ultra-high SSA (2523 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (1.37 m(3) g(-1)), and high content of heteroatom functionalities (similar to 3.5 at% N and similar to 5.1 at% 0). EDLCs employed SSMC as active material showed high specific capacitance of 304 F g(-1) and 256 F g(-1) at current densities of 1 A g(-1) and 20 A g(-1), respectively, suggesting the good rate capability. Symmetric-two-electrode test in aqueous electrolyte also delivered the specific capacitance of 235 F g(-1) with the energy density of similar to 7.9 W h kg(-1). The findings confirmed the feasible way that using the eco-friendly biomass raw material to construct high performance capacitive energy storage device. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The isolate grew at 15-45 A degrees C, pH 6-12 and with 0-15 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain AFM 10238(T) contains meso-diaminopimelic acid as cell wall diamino acid, and galactose and arabinose as the whole cell sugars. The major polar lipids are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol. Major fatty acids are iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and C-17:1 omega 8c. MK-9(H-4) is the predominant menaquinone and the DNA G + C content is 72.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AFM10238(T) belongs to the genus Saccharopolyspora. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain AFM 10238(T) and its close neighbours, Saccharopolyspora halophila YIM 90500(T) , Saccharopolyspora spinosa DSM 44228(T), Saccharopolyspora dendranthemae KLBMP 1305(T) and Saccharopolyspora cebuensis DSM 45019(T) were 98.2, 97.2, 97.1 and 97.0 %, respectively. Sequence similarities to other type strains of this genus were below 97 %. DNA-DNA relatedness data, together with phenotypic and chemotaxonomic differences, clearly distinguished the isolate from its close neighbours. On the basis of the data from this polyphasic analysis, a novel species Saccharopolyspora griseoalba sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AFM 10238(T) (= DSM 46,663 = CGMCC 4.7124).

The prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nitrogen adsorption/desorption and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The results indicated that the TiO2/Ph-MS photocatalyst was composed of the TiO2 particle core (around 20-30 nm) and a shell layer of phenol group functionalized mesoporous silica with a thickness of about 2.5 nm, which contained as much as 63.0 wt% TiO2. The TiO2/Ph-MS composite was applied to remove BPA by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The results indicated that the introduced phenyl group was hydrophobic and has strong adsorption ability for BPA. The adsorption removal ratio of BPA over the TiO2/Ph-MS (8.4 %) was much higher than that over TiO2/MS (0.4 %), and the photocatalytic degradation removal ratios of BPA on TiO2/Ph-MS (20.24 %) was higher than that over TiO2/MS (14.36 %). The enhanced photocatalytic degradation removal rate of BPA over TiO2/Ph-MS could be attributed to increasing adsorption ability for BPA on the surface of TiO2/Ph-MS.

Growth of strain NCCP-1258(T) was observed at pH range 6.5-9.5 (optimum 7.5-8.5) and temperature range 20-45 A degrees C (optimum 40 A degrees C), and it tolerated 0-2 % NaCl (optimum 0.5 %, w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed that strain NCCP-1258(T) belongs to genus Microvirga and is most closely related to Microvirga lotononidis (98.0 %), Microvirga vignae (97.4 %), Microvirga lupini (97.2 %), Microvirga zambiensis (97.2 %) and Microvirga flocculans (97.1 %). Analysis of the concatenated sequences of four housekeeping gene loci (dnaK, gyrB, recA and rpoB) also confirmed the placement of strain NCCP-1258(T) within the genus Microvirga. DNA-DNA relatedness values of NCCP-1258(T) with above-mentioned type strains were less than 42 %. The DNA G+C content of strain NCCP-1258(T) was 64.3 mol%. Chemotaxonomic data (predominant menaquinone system was Q-10; major fatty acids were C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 7c and C-19:0 cyclo omega 8c; the polar lipid profile contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl dimethyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl ethanolamine) also supported the affiliation of strain NCCP-1258(T) to the genus Microvirga. On the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics, phylogenetic analyses and DNA-DNA relatedness, strain NCCP-1258(T) can be distinguished from the closely related taxa and thus represents a novel species of the genus Microvirga, for which the name Microvirga pakistanensis sp. nov. is proposed with the type strain NCCP-1258(T) (=CGMCC 1.15074(T) = KCTC 42496(T)).

The results showed that the growth of A. flos-aquae was significantly inhibited by S. sagittifolia extract. The exopolysaccharide (EPS), total soluble protein, intracellular phosphorus (o-PO4-P) contents and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in A. flos-aquae cells increased significantly. These results suggested that A. flos-aquae can adapt to stress by increasing its normal metabolic activity. The algal cellular antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), were triggered to different degrees when exposed to S. sagittifolia extract. The MDA contents and activities of SOD, CAT and POD in algal cells suggested that oxidative damage induced by S. sagittifolia extract via the oxidation of ROS (O-2 center dot(-)) might be an important factor responsible for the inhibition of the growth of A. flos-aquae.

The strain exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coil and Staphylococcus aureus. The taxonomic position of strain Z1027(T) was determined using a polyphasic approach. The organism had chemotaxonomic and morphological properties consistent with its classification in the genus Streptomyces and formed a distinct phyletic line in the 16S rRNA gene tree, together with Streptomyces turgidiscabies ATCC 700248(T) (99.19% similarity), Streptomyces graminilatus JL-6(T) (98.84%) and Streptomyces reticuliscabiei CFBP 4531(T) (98.36%). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Z1027(T) was 74 +/- 1 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain Z1027(T) and Streptomyces turgidiscabies ATCC 700248(T) and Streptomyces reticuliscabiei CFBP 4531(T) were 38.5 +/- 0.4 and 26.2 +/- 1.2 %, respectively, both of them significantly lower than 70%. Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain Z1027(T) possessed MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8) as the major menaquinones, LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and galactose as a whole-cell sugar. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatydilinositol and seven other unknown polar lipids were detected; iso-C-16:0, summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) and C-16:0 were the major fatty acids. On the basis of these genotypic and phenotypic data, it is proposed that isolate Z1027(T) (=CGMCC 4.7272(T)=JCM 31054(T)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, Streptomyces lacrimifluminis sp. nov.

For this, we introduce the concept of matrix measure on time scales and obtain some of its properties. Then, sufficient conditions are established which ensure the existence and exponential stability of positive almost periodic solutions of the proposed biological model. Our results are new even when the time scale is almost periodic, in particular, for periodic time scales on T=R or T=Z. An example is given to illustrate the theory. Finally, we present some phenomena which are triggered by almost periodic time scales. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The structural and morphological characterizations of the samples were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Indirect-heating sensor using ZnO hollow spheres as sensing materials was fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and Pt wires. The gas sensing properties of the as-synthesized ZnO hollow spheres for n-butanol were investigated. . It is shown that the sensor exhibited good sensing performances, characterized by high response, response, very short response time, and stability to n-butanol gas at operating temperature of 385 degrees C. These results indicate that the ZnO hollow spheres are highly promising candidates for practical detectors for for n-butanol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In that state both electrons and holes are spin polarized and share the same spin channel. At the level of hybrid density functional theory, our results show in particular that VS2 monolayers are half semiconductors with a direct band gap. Moreover, we find that the conduction electron spin orientation of VS2 switches under moderate strain. Our analysis of trigonal-prismatic group-V MX2 (M = V, Nb, Ta; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers reveals a broad diversity of electronic states that can be understood qualitatively in terms of localization of d electrons.

The corresponding rigid poly(vinyl chloride)/grafted ground tire rubber (RPVC/GGTR) composites with different contents of GGTR were then prepared in a Haake torque rheometer. Similar composites with raw ground tire rubber (without grafting polymerization) have also been prepared for comparison. Thermal stability, processability, mechanical properties, and surface morphology of the composites were extensively investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), rheological measurement, tensile and impact tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that GGTR improved the processability of the RPVC/GGTR composites. The Izod impact strength of the composites could be significantly enhanced by the GGTR, while the tensile strength of the composites was almost unchanged, thus showing a large potential application in the fields of building materials such as poly(vinyl chloride) profiles.

The tungsten source was fresh peroxiotungstic acid by dissolving tungsten powder into hydrogen peroxide. To promote the combustion reaction, a combined fuel of both glycine and hydrazine hydrate was used. The microstructure was well-connected pores comprised of subunit nanoparticles. Upon exposing towards acetone gas, the porous WO3 based sensor exhibits high gas response, rapid response and recovery, and good selectivity in the range of 5-1000 ppm under working temperature of 300 degrees C. This excellent sensing performance was plausibly attributed to the porous morphology, which hence provides more active sites for the gas molecules' reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Variational structure for these problems are established in a proper fractional derivative space, which can be regarded as a novelty item. Some sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to this boundary value problem for nonlinear impulsive fractional differential equations are established by applying critical point theorems and some skills of inequalities.

The objective of this study is to explore the symbiotic N-2-fixation by a legume shrub (Caragana microphylla) and its N transfer to coexisting non-legumes with the N-15 dilution technique. A paired experimental design (legume vs. non-legume quadrats) was used. A small amount (0.03 gN m(-2)) of N-15-labeled KNO3 (99.5% N-15 enrichment) was evenly distributed in these paired labeled quadrats, with only water additions as the control. One month after the N-15 addition, aboveground parts of C. microphylla and four non-legumes of reference plants (i.e. Cleistogenes squarrosa, Artemisia frigida, Artemisia capillaris and Leymus chinensis) in both labeled and controlled quadrats were harvested. Symbiotic N-2-fixation and transfer to non-legumes were estimated based on the aboveground biomass and its N-15 in these plant species. The N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) of C microphylla was estimated to range from 84 to 95%. According to the aboveground biomass of C. microphylla, symbiotic N-2-fixation was estimated to be 4.3 gm(-2) yr(-1) in the mixed C. microphylla community in the temperate grassland of northern China. The amount of N transfer from C microphylla to their coexisting plants varied with plant species. About half of above N in C. squarrosa derived from C microphylla, while L. chinensis showed almost no N derived from C microphylla. Both A. frigida and A. capillaris showed about 36% and 37% of N derived from C microphylla, respectively. Totally, about 17% of N fixed in the aboveground part of C microphylla was transferred to its associated species. Considering the amount of N fixed and transferred by C microphylla, we conclude that C microphylla plays an important role in the N cycling of temperate grasslands in northern China.

Much research effort has been devoted to improving these mixing models. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a new method using discriminant function analysis (DFA) to fingerprint sediment source contributions. It was hypothesized that the outcome of DFA, commonly used as a component of standard fingerprinting procedures, can potentially be used directly to quantify source contributions, avoiding mixing models altogether. This hypothesis was tested in the Bull Creek Watershed in Oklahoma State, USA. DFA results were compared with outcomes from the Collins mixing model and previous research. When conservative geochemical tracers were used, DFA results did not differ significantly from the mixing model results, indicating that DFA alone has the potential to accurately quantify sediment source contributions, while being simple to use. When using non-conservative tracers, however, the results from the two methods were significantly different. On the basis of a comparison with previous research, we suggest that DFA offers an intuitive method for characterizing sediment source contributions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In many applications, however, the formulation of the structural equation is unknown, and its misspecification may lead to unreliable statistical inference. This paper develops a general SEM in which latent variables are linearly regressed on themselves, thereby avoiding the need to specify outcome/explanatory latent variables. A penalized likelihood method with a proper penalty function is proposed to simultaneously select latent variables and estimate the coefficient matrix in formulating the structural equation. Under some regularity conditions, we show the consistency and the oracle property of the proposed estimators. We also develop an expectation/conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm involving a minorization-maximization algorithm that facilitates the second M-step. Simulation studies are performed and a real data set is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The relationships among multiple items are captured by several common latent factors. The linear coregionalization method is adopted to model the temporal processes of latent variables. The merit of this modeling strategy lies in the fact that the processes among latent variables are nonseparate and codependent from each other. To account for possible heterogeneity and interrelationship among the longitudinal data, a hidden Markov model is introduced to model the transition probabilities across different latent states over time. The Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization (MCECM) algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters in the proposed model. The Wald- and score-type statistics are proposed to test the related dependence of processes. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology. An example from a longitudinal study of cocaine use is taken to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Characterization by TEM, SEM and BET techniques demonstrates that the Al-doping ZnO powders have a coral-like morphology with a hierarchically porous structure from macro pores, with the wall containing smaller mesopores. The gas-sensing characteristics of the ZnO samples with different Al-doping concentrations are investigated and the results indicate that the gas sensor prepared from 2.5 at% Al-doping ZnO powders shows the highest gas sensitivity and selectivity towards n-butanol. A maximum gas response of 751.95 towards 100 ppm n-butanol is achieved at the operating temperature of 300 degrees C.

The phase composition and the unique structure of as-prepared SnO2-Pd-Pt-ln(2)O(3) composite were comprehensively characterized using the techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results of gas sensing properties indicate that the sensor based on the as-prepared SnO2-Pd-Pt-ln(2)O(3) composite shows the ultra-high response to methanol at an optimal operating temperature of 160 degrees C when the mass ratio of SnO2, Pd, Pt and In2O3 is 100:0.8:2:30. The gas response toward 100 ppm of methanol reaches as high as 320.73. The detection limit of the sensor is estimated to be 0.1 ppm. The sensor also exhibited good response-recovery properties, selectivity, remarkable repeatability and stability, suggesting its greatly promising application in gas sensing. This work could stimulate an effective means to fabricate methanol sensor with superior performance. At the same time, a possible sensing mechanism of the SnO2-Pd-Pt-ln(2)O(3) composite is discussed.

Some issues in the synthesis theory that were not well understood previously have been addressed and clarified. The identified reaction mechanisms and calculated energy barriers suggest that the competitive formations of methylene and methylene ether linkages are kinetically affected by both reaction energy barriers and steric hindrance effect. The thermodynamic properties determine that the methylene linkages are dominant at the late condensation stage. The theoretical results well rationalized the observed different changing processes of resin structures with different F/U molar ratios. The previously proposed mechanism for transformation of methylene ether linkage to methylene linkage cannot explain the structural changes during condensation, and thus, other mechanisms were proposed. The calculated results for uron explained the fact that the formation of such structure is much slower than other structures under weak acidic condition. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the ore bearing Suozuodi granite yields a crystallization age of 91.6 +/- 1.0 Ma (MSWD = 0.56). An isochron age of 91.6 +/- 13 Ma (MSWD = 0.24) was obtained by Re-Os dationg of five molybdenite samples separated from sulfide-bearing ores. Scheelite at the Guanfang deposit is characterized by broad rangs of Pb isotopic ratios (Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.568 to 15.735, Pb-206/Pb-204 = 17.912 to 18.390, Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.491 to 38.730) and high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (Isr = 0.7118 to 0.7140), which consistent with the isotopic characteristics of the Suozuodi granite. Pb and Sr isotopic results indicate that the ore-forming materials were derived from a crustal source, without addition of mantle materials. The Guanfang tungsten deposit was formed in a syn-collision tectonic setting during the late stage of the Yanshanian tectonism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The invariance under permutation transformations is studied for some important structure tensors such as symmetric tensors, positive definite (positive semidefinite) tensors, Z-tensors, M-tensors, Hankel tensors, P-tensors, B-tensors and H-tensors. Finally, as an application of permutation transformations of tensors, the canonical form theorem of tensors is given. The theorem shows that some problems of higher dimension tensors can be translated into the corresponding problems of lower dimension weakly irreducible tensors so as to handle easily.

The structure and micrograph of the as-prepared SWCNTs-MIPs samples were characterized by XRD and TEM. The gas-sensing properties were tested through indirect-heating sensors based on SWCNT-MIP composites fabricating on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and Pt wires. The results showed that the structure of SWCNTs-MIPs is of orthogonal perovskite and the average particle size of the SWCNTs-MIPs was in the range of 10-30 nm. SWCNTs-MIPs exhibit good methanol gas-sensitive properties. At 90 degrees C, the response to 1 ppm methanol is 19.7, and the response to the interferent is lower than 5 to the other interferent gases (ethanol, formaldehyde, toluene, acetone, ammonia, and gasoline). The response time and recovery time are 50 and 58 s, respectively.

This approach, which is complementary to previous alkynylation and alkylation strategies, involves a C(sp(2))-C(sp(3)) bond formation, and is based on the first asymmetric Friedel-Crafts-type arylation reaction of C-alkynyl imines. Asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reactions with electron-deficient phenols, a longstanding unsolved challenge, have thus been realized for the first time, enabled by the combination of our recently introduced C-alkynyl N-Boc-protected N,O-acetals as electrophiles and chiral phosphoric acids as catalysts. The synthetic utility of the resulting structurally diverse and polyfunctional chiral propargylamines was demonstrated by a series of selective transformations, including controlled reduction of the alkynyl group and iterative cross-couplings.

However, the distribution of grey wolves in southern China is still highly controversial. Several well-known western literatures stated that there were no grey wolves in southern China, while the presence of grey wolves across China has been indicated in A Guide to the Mammals of China, published by Princeton University Press. It is essential to solve this discrepancy since dogs may have originated from grey wolves in southern China. Therefore, we systematically investigated Chinese literatures about wild animal surveys and identified more than 100 articles and books that included information of the distribution of grey wolves in China. We also surveyed the collections of three Chinese natural museums and found 26 grey wolf skins specimens collected across China. Moreover, we investigated the fossil records in China and identified 25 archaeological sites with wolf remains including south China. In conclusion, with the comprehensive summary of Chinese literatures, museum specimens and fossil records, we demonstrate that grey wolves do distribute across all parts of the Chinese mainland, including the most southern parts.

We used missingness rates to investigate the quality of a recently published dataset containing 424 mitochondrial, 211 Y chromosomal, and 160 432 autosomal SNPs generated by a semicustom Illumina SNP array from 5 392 dogs and 14 grey wolves. Overall, the individual missingness rate for mitochondrial SNPs was similar to 43.8%, with 980 (18.1%) individuals completely missing mitochondrial SNP genotyping (missingness rate=1). In males, the genotype missingness rate was similar to 28.8% for Y chromosomal SNPs, with 374 males recording rates above 0.96. These 374 males also exhibited completely failed mitochondrial SNPs genotyping, indicative of a batch effect. Individual missingness rates for autosomal markers were greater than zero, but less than 0.5. Neither mitochondrial nor Y chromosomal SNPs achieved complete genotyping (locus missingness rate=0), whereas 5.9% of autosomal SNPs had a locus missingness rate=1. The high missingness rates and possible batch effect show that caution and rigorous measures are vital when genotyping and analyzing SNP array data for domestic animals. Further improvements of these arrays will be helpful to future studies.

In aqueous media (CH3CN-HEPES), complex 1 had been proven to be an effective and selective colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for recognition of pyrophosphate over other structurally similar nucleotides and anions. Among all the tested targets, only addition of pyrophosphate resulted in a color change from brown to light yellow with a fluorescence enhancement of about 27-fold. The terpyridine-Zn2+ complex (1) formed a 2:1 binding mode with pyrophosphate by multi-hydrogen bonds. This complex was successfully applied to fluorescence imaging for pyrophosphate in Hi-5 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating its utility as a fluorescent sensor for detecting pyrophosphate in in vivo imaging.

A monolithic dual Schottky diode is used in the PDC to reduce the footprint and improve the bandwidth. The measured S-parameters show that the circuit is able to work for up to 40 GHz. The theory of third order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) generation by the PDC is established, and calculated IMD3 agrees well with the measured. Two measures are used to verify the PDC: spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) forWiFi signal at 2.4 GHz. For a directly modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the SFDR is improved by similar to 12 dB. For an externally Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the SFDR is improved by higher than 5 dB from 2 to 30 GHz, and in particular higher than 12 dB from 2 to 5 GHz. For 2.4-GHz WiFi signal over the externally modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the EVM for WiFi signal is improved by up to 5.1 dB for back-to-back and 3.5 dB for 20-km SMF transmission.

Plots of MRTPR against the amplitude or mean reversion of volatility demonstrate a phenomenon of herd behavior for a positive cross correlation between noise sources of the Heston model.

The Si buffer layer exhibits mixed-phase micro crystallinity for samples grown with 1 mm spacing and crystallinity for those with 2 mm spacing. Ge islands are larger and less dense than those grown on the crystalline buffer because of the selective growth mechanism on the microcrystalline buffer. Moreover, the nucleation site of Ge islands formed on the crystalline Si buffer is random. Ge islands grown at different grid-to-grid gaps are characterized by two key factors, namely, divergence half angle of ion beam and crystallinity of buffer layer. High grid-to-grid spacing results in small divergence half angle, thereby enhancing the sputtering energy and redistribution of sputtered atoms. The crystalline volume fraction of the microcrystalline Si buffer was obtained based on the integrated intensity ratio of Raman peaks. The islands show decreased density with decreasing crystalline volume fraction and are difficult to observe at crystalline volume fractions lower than 72%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

New approaches utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. We tested whether eDNA from residual saliva on partially-consumed Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable DNA quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (Ursus arctos). We compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal DNA and salivary eDNA collected from partially-consumed salmon carcasses in Southeast Alaska. We swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (O. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (O. keta) salmon in 2014. We also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. Saliva swabs collected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. Saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. Salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool in the study of the ecology and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species.

The visual fluorescence quenching "Test Paper" was highly selective and sensitive recognizing Cu2+ at mu mol/L level. Within the concentration range of 5 x 10(-7) -50 x 10(-7) mol/L, the linear regression equation of I-PL = 1226.3-13.6[C-Cu (2+)] (R = 0.99) was established for Cu2+ quantitative detection. And finally, Cu2+ fluorescence quenching mechanism of NPSi prober was proposed by studying the surface chemistry change of NPSi and metal ions immersed-NPSi using XPS characterization. The results indicate that SiHx species obviously contribute to the PL emission of NPSi, and the introduce of oxidization state and the nonradiative recombination center are responsible for the PL quenching. These results demonstrate how virgin NPSi wafer can serve as Cu2+ sensor. This work is of great significant to promote the development of simple instruments that could realize rapid, visible and real-time detection of various toxic metal ions.

Magnetotransport properties of the type-II Weyl semimetal candidate Ta3S2	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ULTRAHIGH MOBILITY; DIRAC SEMIMETAL; MAGNETORESISTANCE; DISCOVERY	We have investigated the magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall resistivity properties of the single crystals of tantalum sulfide, Ta3S2, which was recently predicted to be a new type-II Weyl semimetal. Large MR (up to similar to 8000% at 2 K and 16 T), field-induced metal-insulator-like transition, and nonlinear Hall resistivity are observed at low temperatures. The large MR shows a strong dependence on the field orientation, leading to a giant anisotropic magnetoresistance effect. For the field applied along the b axis (B parallel to b), MR exhibits quadratic field dependence at low fields and tends towards saturation at high fields; while for B parallel to a, MR presents quadratic field dependence at low fields and becomes linear at high fields without any trend towards saturation. The analysis of the Hall resistivity data indicates the coexistence of a large number of electrons with low mobility and a small number of holes with high mobility. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation analysis reveals three fundamental frequencies originated from the three-dimensional Fermi surface pockets. We find that the semiclassical multiband model is sufficient to account for the experimentally observed MR in Ta3S2.	[Chen, D.; Wang, S.

A previous study described a Trojan Horse-like strategy of pathogenesis whereby the bacterium Bacillus nematocida B16 emits the volatile organic compound 2-heptanone to trap C. elegans for successful infection. Here, we further explored the receptor for 2-heptanone as well as the pathway involved in signal transduction in C. elegans. Our experiments showed that 2-heptanone sensing depended on the function of AWC neurons and a GPCR encoded by str-2. Consistent with the above observation, the HEK293 cells expressing STR-2 on their surfaces showed a transient elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels after 2-heptanone applications. After combining the assays of RNA interference and gene mutants, we also identified the G subunits and their downstream components in the olfactory signal cascade that are necessary for responding to 2-heptanone, including G subunits of egl-30 and gpa-3, phospholipase C of plc-1and egl-8, and the calcium channel of cmk-1 and cal-1. Our work demonstrates for the first time that an integrated signaling pathway for 2-heptanone response in C. elegans involves recognition by GPCR STR-2, activation by G subunits of egl-30/gpa-3 and transfer to the PLC pathway, indicating that a potentially novel olfactory pathway exists in AWC neurons. Meanwhile, since 2-heptanone, a metabolite from the pathogenic bacterium B. nematocida B16, can be sensed by C. elegans and thus strongly attract its host, our current work also suggested coevolution between the pathogenic microorganism and the chemosensory system in C. elegans.

To this end, nine belt transects from nine freshwater sand dunes, classified into low (<23.7 m), medium (25.4-26.0 m), and high-elevation groups (>28.1 m) based on their elevations in 1972, were sampled to investigate differences in sedimentation rate and soil and vegetation characteristics in Southern Dongting Lake, China. Sedimentation rate, soil sand content, and soil pH increased, whereas soil clay, fine silt, moisture (MC), organic matter (OM), total N, and total K content, in addition to the growth and biodiversity of sand dune plants generally decreased with decreasing belt transect elevation. Regression analyses revealed that the negative effects of sedimentation on the ecosystem functions of sand dunes could be attributed to higher fine sand content in deposited sediments and stronger inhibition of plant growth. These results are consistent with previous studies performed in coastal sand dunes, which highlights the importance of sedimentation in determining ecological processes.

Propagation expression for the cross-spectral density and the average intensity of the partially coherent MGSMv beam propagating in uniaxial crystals are derived. Some analyses are illustrated by numerical examples related to the propagation properties and coherence vortices of the partially coherent MGSMv beam in uniaxial crystals. Numerical results show that, upon propagating in uniaxial crystals, the partially coherent MGSMv beam loses its initial dark center distribution. After propagating for sufficient distances, the partially coherent MGSMv beam will also evolve into a flat-topped beam. The evolution behavior of average intensity and coherent vortices depends on the crystal including the ratio of extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices, and beam parameters including the spatial correlation length and topological charge of the beams, as well as the propagation distance.

To study the dark matter production and evolution inside the bounce universe, called big bounce genesis for short, we propose a model independent approach. We shall present the motivation for proposing big bounce, as well as the model independent predictions, which can be tested by dark matter direct searches.

Cells were Gram-stain-positive, short rod-shaped, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-motile. The strain could grow at 7-37 degrees C, at pH 6-10 and in the presence of 0-13%(w/v) NaCl. The strain had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness value with Microbacterium gubbeenense NCIMB 30129(T) of 97.8 % and 41.5 +/- 8.7 %, respectively. Ornithine was detected as the diagnostic amino acid in the hydrolysate of the cell wall. Whole-cell sugars were found to be galactose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and ribose. Major fatty acids (>10 %) were iso-C-16 : 0, anteiso-C-15 : 0 and anteiso-C-17 : 0. Major menaquinones were identified as MK-10, MK-11 and MK-12. The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, glycolipids and four unidentified lipids. The phylogenetic analyses as well as the chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics indicate that strain YIM 101168(T) represents a novel species of the genus Microbacterium; the name Microbacterium faecale sp. nov. is proposed for the novel species and the type strain is YIM 101168T (=DSM 27232(T) =KCTC 39554(T) =CGMCC 1.15152(T)).

NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; PHYLOGENIES; RHIZOBIUM; SEQUENCES; SYSTEM; TREES	A novel Gram-staining-negative, short rod, non-motile, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium, designated strain YIM M12096(T), was isolated from deep-sea sediment collected from the Indian Ocean. Optimal growth conditions of the strain were observed at 25-30 degrees C, pH 6.0 and in the presence of 3-5% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM M12096(T) was closely related to Nitratireductor indicus C115(T) (97.4% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Mesorhizobium thiogangeticum SJT(T) (97.3 %). The strain, however, formed a robust clade with members of the genus Mesorhizobium in phylogenetic dendrograms generated with neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony trees. Analysis based on the sequence of housekeeping gene recA also gave a similar phylogenetic relationship, indicating that strain YIM M12096(T) is a member of the genus Mesorhizobium. DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain YIM M12096(T) and related type strains N. indicus CCTCC AB209298(T) and M. thiogangeticum DSM 17097(T) were 40.5% and 36.7 %, respectively. Chemotaxonomic features of the isolate included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, an unidentified aminophospholipid and an unidentified phospholipid as its characteristic polar lipids and Q-10 as respiratory ubiquinone. Major fatty acids (> 10 %) detected were C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c, 11-methyl-C-18:1 omega 7c and cyclo-C-19:0 omega 8c. Based on the chemotaxonomic properties and phylogenetic analyses, strain YIM M12096(T) is determined to be a member of the genus Mesorhizobium. The strain could be differentiated from the closely related species by the differences in physiological and biochemical properties supported by low DNA-DNA relatedness values. It is therefore concluded that strain YIM M12096(T) represents a novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, for which the name Mesorhizobium sediminum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M12096(T) (= CCTCC AB 2014219(T) = KCTC 42205(T)).

The results indicate that combination of methyl violet and bromide ion performs excellent as inhibitor for mild steel corrosion in 1.0 mol/dm(3) H3PO4 and a stronger synergistic effect exists between methyl violet and bromide ion. The electrochemical results indicate that single methyl violet or combination of bromide ion and methyl violet behaves as mixed type inhibitor with predominated of cathodic effect, and the corrosion reaction is controlled by charge transfer process. It is found that the adsorption process obeys Temkin adsorption isotherm in the absence of bromide ion and Langmuir adsorption isotherm in the presence of bromide ion, respectively. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (Delta G(ads)degrees, Delta H-ads degrees,Delta S-ads degrees, K-ads and E-a) were calculated and discussed. The adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the steel surface is a spontaneous process containing physisorption and chemisorption.

The proposed method is named as multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) because the intelligent searchers, which are called as atoms, not only are divided into multiple subgroups but also are variant in responsibility. That is, global atoms explore the whole solution space in the hope of finding potential areas where local atoms start the local exploitation. The proposed method is characterized by two important features. On one hand, global atoms do the global exploration in each loop to jump out from local traps. On the other hand, global and local atoms conduct the global exploration and the local exploitation according to their own responsibility, respectively. These features contribute to increasing the chance of converging to the global best. To study the convergence property of MOA, we carried out the convergence analysis, numerical optimization experiments and the shortest path planning experiments. And the results demonstrate that MOA is globally convergent and superior to the compared methods in the global convergence accuracy and probability in solving complex challenging problems which have one or more features such as deceptiveness, randomly located optimum, asymmetry or multiple traps.

OCCURRENCE AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF GRA6 AND SAG2 FROM TOXOPLASMA GONDII OOCYSTS IN CAT FECES, KUNMING, CHINA	SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Toxoplasma gondii; cat; fecal oocyst; genetic characterization	HAMMONDIA-HAMMONDI; DNA FRAGMENT; GENOTYPE; STRAINS; IDENTIFICATION; TISSUES; DISEASE; PCR	Toxoplasma gondii like oocysts were detected in 4% of cat feces using light microscopy in Kunming, China. Amplicon was generated from these oocysts using a T. gondii-but not Hammondia hammondi-specific primer set. Cat and KM mouse were susceptible to infection by these T. gondii-like oocysts. Tissue cysts were found in the brain of the experimentally infected animals and were infective to mouse, indicating that the T. gondii-like oocysts isolated from naturally infected cats had a facultative secondary host life cycle. Comparison of GRA6 and SAG2 sequences with those of reference strains indicated that the cat-derived T. gondii (KM isolate) were typical of T. gondii genotype II. This is the first report of isolation, identification, and genotyping of T. gondii from feline feces in China. The occurrence of oocyst shedding in the cat population studied was higher than that found in most cat populations world-wide, which strongly implies the need for further studies of population genetic structure of T. gondii, as well as for prevention and control of T. gondii infection in cats in China.

The Riemann problem of the modified Chaplygin gas equations is first solved. Then it is shown that, as the pressure vanishes, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the transport equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted delta-measure which forms a delta shock wave; any two-rarefaction-wave Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. It is also shown that, as the pressure approaches the generalized Chaplygin gas pressure, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the generalized Chaplygin gas equations. Some numerical results are presented to show the formation process of delta shock waves and vacuum states. Published by AIP Publishing.

Glycerol, a highly osmotic solvent, is considered to play an important role in turgor generation. The nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora mainly lives as a saprophyte. In the presence of nematodes, A. oligospora enters the parasitic stage by forming three-dimensional networks (traps) to capture nematodes. In A. oligospora, we found that glycerol accumulated during nematode-induced trap formation. We demonstrated that deleting gph1, which encodes glycogen phosphorylase, decreased the glycerol content, compared with that of a wild-type strain. Although the number of traps induced by nematodes was not affected in the Delta gph1 mutant, the capture rate was lower. Meanwhile, deleting gph1 also affected the growth rate and conidiation capacity of the fungus. These results indicate that glycerol derived from GPH1 is essential for the full virulence of A. oligospora against nematodes.

The morphological and crystallographic impact of varying flux of MAI is characterized using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffractometry. It was found that increasing organic flux results in large, angular, yet hollow nonuniformities growing within the film. Diffraction patterns show good perovskite crystallinity across all samples, but show texture development with the (220) diffraction peak growing in intensity relative to the (004) peak as organic content increases. A possible mechanism for the growth of these features is discussed. These results highlight some potential critical pitfalls for perovskite thin film deposition by coevaporation and emphasize the importance of microscopy-based characterization.

We have ascertained the presence of Stenotrophomonas and Rhizobium genera associated with A. oligospora GJ-1. After A. oligospora GJ-1 without associated bacteria (cured Arthrobotrys) was co-cultivated with Stenotrophomonas and its supernatant extract, microscopic study of hyphae from co-cultivation indicated that bacterial biofilm formation on hyphae was related to trap formation in fungi and Stenotrophomonas supernatant extract. Four diketopiperazines (DKPs) were purified from Stenotrophomonas supernatant extract that could not induce traps in the cured Arthrobotrys. When cured Arthrobotrys was cultured with Stenotrophomonas and one of DKPs, polar attachment, bacterial biofilms on hyphae and trap formation in fungi were observed. After cured Arthrobotrys with bacterial biofilms was consecutively transferred several times on nutrient poor medium, trap formation disappeared with the disappearance of bacterial biofilms on hyphae. DKPs could facilitate chemotaxis of Stenotrophomonas towards fungal extract which was suggested to contribute to bacterial biofilms on hyphae. Furthermore, when cured Arthrobotrys was cultured with Stenotrophomonas and DKPs in soil, trap formation in fungi and bacterial biofilms on hyphae were also observed, and the fungal activity against nematode was enhanced.

As linear combinations of divconforming Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson basis functions in three-dimensional, loop basis functions are inherently divergence-free and originally constructed to represent solenoidal electric current density in the electric field integral equation. Sharing the same physical property with the solenoidal electric current density, the magnetic flux density can also be represented by the loop basis functions and thus, Gauss' law for magnetism is naturally satisfied; which is out of the capability of general Whitney elements. The relationship between the loop basis functions and Whitney elements, as well as the comparison between the proposed method and traditional method pertinent to magnetic vector potential are investigated.

They play important roles in the health of plants, animals, and humans, and in broad ecosystem functions. Thus, having an efficient species-level identification system could significantly enhance our ability to treat fungal diseases and to monitor the spatial and temporal patterns of fungal distributions and migrations. DNA barcoding is a potent approach for rapid identification of fungal specimens, generating novel species hypothesis, and guiding biodiversity and ecological studies. In this mini-review, I briefly summarize (i) the history of DNA sequence-based fungal identification; (ii) the emergence of the ITS region as the consensus primary fungal barcode; (iii) the use of the ITS barcodes to address a variety of issues on fungal diversity from local to global scales, including generating a large number of species hypothesis; and (iv) the problems with the ITS barcode region and the approaches to overcome these problems. Similar to DNA barcoding research on plants and animals, significant progress has been achieved over the last few years in terms of both the questions being addressed and the foundations being laid for future research endeavors. However, significant challenges remain. I suggest three broad areas of research to enhance the usefulness of fungal DNA barcoding to meet the current and future challenges: (i) develop a common set of primers and technologies that allow the amplification and sequencing of all fungi at both the primary and secondary barcode loci; (ii) compile a centralized reference database that includes all recognized fungal species as well as species hypothesis, and allows regular updates from the research community; and (iii) establish a consensus set of new species recognition criteria based on barcode DNA sequences that can be applied across the fungal kingdom.

J	Li, GQ; Goldscheider, N; Field, MS				Li, Guangquan; Goldscheider, Nico; Field, Malcolm S.			Modeling karst spring hydrograph recession based on head drop at sinkholes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Spring discharge; Sinkhole; Exponential recession; Square law; Turbulent flow	FLORIDAN AQUIFER; CONDUIT-FLOW; GROUNDWATER; RESOURCES; TRANSPORT; MATRIX; SYSTEM; WATER; CAVE	Spring discharge often responds to rainfall with a rapid increase followed by a slower recession, and the mode of recession is often exponential-like. We propose a new model of the response of spring discharge to rainfall based on the square law for turbulent conduit flow. The new non-exponential model is compared against the exponential model under specific constraints. A hydrograph of St. Marks River in Florida is used to illustrate that when the change in "sinkhole head" (defined as the hydraulic head at the upstream end of the karst conduit connected to the spring) is relatively small, the solution of the new model is close to that of the exponential model, which extends the validity and application of the exponential solution. When the change in sinkhole head is very large, the solutions from the two models clearly differ from each other. Limitations of the non-exponential model are analyzed by simulation of a hydrograph observed downstream of Wakulla Springs. It is concluded that both solutions are applicable when spring response is smaller than or comparable to the base flow, but are nonphysical when the response is much larger than the base discharge.

The free anthraquinones including physcion, chrysophanol, emodin, rhein, and aloe-emodin are the main bioactive components in Radix et Rhizoma Rhei. In the present study, a fast quantitative H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (q-HNMR) method for the determination and quantitation of five free anthraquinones in Radix et Rhizoma Rhei was developed. Validation of the quantitative method was performed in terms of specificity, accuracy, precision, and stability. The results showed that the solvent acetone-d(6) enabled satisfactory separation of the signals to be integrated. Five anthraquinones in Radix et Rhizoma Rhei could be quantified accurately using featured signals from H-1 NMR. This work implied that q-HNMR represents a feasible alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based methods for quantitation of anthraquinones in Radix et Rhizoma Rhei and is suitable for the quality control of Radix et Rhizoma Rhei.

Complexes 1-3 have 3D structures with various topologies. In complex 1, the L connects Zn(II) atoms to form 2D layers, which are linked by two kinds of 1D [Zn(BDC)](n) chains to generate a 4-connected three-dimensional structure with (6.8(5)) (6(4).8(2))(8(6)) topology. In complex 2, Cd(II) atoms are coordinated by L to furnish a 2D layer, and the adjacent layers are linked by BDC ligands as bridging ligands to general a new (4,5)-connected three-dimensional network with a point symbol of (4(4).6(2))(4(4).6(6)). In Complex 3, the L ligands act as 4-connected linkers connecting Co(II) ions to display a 4-connected three-dimensional structure with 4.6(5) topological net directly. In addition, the solid-state fluorescence, infrared spectra, magnetic property and thermal stability of these complexes have also been investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Au-nanoparticles (AuNPs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified glassy carbon electrode (AuNPs/MWNTs/PEI/GCE) was prepared and used as the working electrode which could also amplify the electrochemical signal dramatically due to the excellent electronic property of the electrode and the Au-nanoparticles induced silver deposition reaction. This strategy was applied to the high sensitive ascorbic acid (AA) determination and a detection limit as low as 15 fM was achieved, which was 6-9 orders of magnitude more sensitive than other reported methods for AA determination. The proposed method has good selectivity and anti-interference ability, which could be applied to AA detection in real complex samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Auricularia delicata is an edible wild mushroom species occurring naturally in the tropics. This work aimed at screening an A. delicata strain suitable for cultivation under the tropical temperature conditions to make use of the rubberwood waste. Chemical analysis showed that rubberwood was suitable for mushroom cultivation. Two new A. delicata strains were isolated. Optimal carbon source, inorganic and organic nitrogen sources, culture temperature and medium pH for strain A. delicata were determined for mycelial growth. Optimal temperature range for fruiting body differentiation was 20-28 degrees C. 5 tested substrate formulations with rubberwood sawdust as main composition significantly affected fruiting body differentiation time; the best formulation contained 68% rubberwood sawdust. At an industrial scale culture, the average mushroom yield was 750 +/- 60 g/kg substrate. The micronutrient contents of the cultured mushrooms were higher than those of the wild mushrooms. The spent substrate was found to be a good organic fertilizer. Results show a novel utilization of rubberwood waste in producing A. delicata mushroom and simultaneously producing organic fertilizer in tropical regions. A. delicata was proposed as a novel species for mushroom cultivation especially in the tropical and sub-tropical regions.

Protoxylem groups are associated with the forming of the petiolar trace, and a parenchyma plate appears in the process of separating petiolar traces. The cortex consists of three parts, with inner and middle parenchymatous zones and an outer sclerenchymatous zone. Stems are radially organized and bear helically arranged petioles. Petioles extend from the stems in various orientations while adventitious roots extend through the cauline cortex perpendicular or oblique to the stem. Associated rachides are D-shaped in cross section and the xylem is slightly to conspicuously adaxially curved with 1 protoxylem ridge at each lateral margin. Differences with previously known genera of Botryopteridaceae lead to creation of new genus, Diodonopteris gracilis Ma et al. gen. nov. et sp. nov. that demonstrates features that overlap to some extent with those of previously known genera within Botryopteridaceae. The habit and growth forms of D. gracilis are considered. D. gracilis represents by far the best known plant of Botryopteridaceae recognized from the Cathaysian Flora. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains largely unclear how PDV genes affect host genes. Here, the complete genome sequence of Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), which is known to be an apoptosis inducer, was determined. The MbBV genome consisted of 17 putative double-stranded DNA circles and 179 fragments with a total size of 336,336 bp and contained 116 open reading frames (ORFs). Based on conserved domains, nine gene families were identified, of which the I kappa B-like viral ankyrin (vank) family included 28 members and was one of the largest families. Among the 116 ORFs, 13 MbBV genes were expressed in hemocytes undergoing MbBV-induced apoptosis and further analyzed. Three vank genes (vank86, vank92, vank101) were expressed in hemocytes collected from Spodoptera litura larvae parasitized by M. bicoloratus, in which host NF-kappa B/I kappa Bs, including relish, dorsal, and cactus, were also persistently expressed. When Spli221 cells were infected with MbBV viral particles, mRNA levels of host and viral NF-kappa B/I kappa B genes were persistent and also varied in Spli221 cells undergoing virus-induced pre-apoptosis cell from 1 to 5 hours postinfection. Both were then expressed in a time-dependent expression in virus-induced apoptotic cells. These data show that viral I kappa B-like transcription does not inhibit host NF-kappa B/I kappa B expression, suggesting that transcription of these genes might be regulated by different mechanisms.

We address these limitations by conducting a systematic review to assess the literature on ecological studies of two major tropical and subtropical invasive plant species, Ageratina adenophora and Chromolaena odorata. Our goals were to: (1) collect the literature on the invasion biology of these species by broadly searching five databases (one international and four regional); (2) determine limitations to the international literature available in the ISI Web of Science (WOS); (3) quantitatively summarize the scope of the invasion literature on the two species; and (4) propose future studies based on what we found. Location Global. Methods Using specific search terms, we searched the literature for A. adenophora and C. odorata in the ISI WOS, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Indian Journals, Nepal Journals Online and African Journals Online (AJOL). We extracted information on journal titles, publication years, study area locations, habitats investigated and study focus. Results We found 101 papers for A. adenophora and 61 papers for C. odorata, published from 1987 to 2015. A high percentage of the studies were conducted in China, western and southern Africa, and India. Studies from WOS most frequently focused on the mechanism of invasion, while studies from CNKI and AJOL focused on the impacts of the invader. Main conclusions Web of Science is not sufficient for generalizing about the invasion biology literature, particularly if the goal is a comprehensive assessment that includes areas other than North America, Hawaii, Europe, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In future systematic reviews, other databases should be used if possible, including those in languages other than English. For future research, several research areas should be studied more thoroughly for A. adenophora and C. odorata invasions, including possible multiple factors responsible for invasion, and impacts of co-occurring invasive species.

Their taxonomic positions were investigated by a polyphasic approach. The two isolates were Gram-reaction positive, non-motile, aerobic and catalase-positive actinomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that the two isolates are closely related to the members of the genus Amycolatopsis, sharing high similarities with Amycolatopsis magusensis KCTC 29056(T) (99.1 %, CFH S0322(T)) and Amycolatopsis nigrescens DSM 44992(T) (98.1 %, CFH S01580(T)), respectively. The major whole cell sugars of strains CFH S0322(T) and CFH S01580(T) were arabinose and galactose and the predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains CFH S0322(T) and CFH S01580(T) were 70.6 and 68.6 mol%, respectively. Morphological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results suggest that strains CFH S0322(T) and CFH S01580(T) are representatives of two new species, for which the names Amycolatopsis xuchangensis sp. nov. and Amycolatopsis jiguanensis sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are CFH S0322(T) (=NBRC 110769(T) =KCTC 39516(T)) and CFH S01580(T) (=DSM 101526(T) =CCTCC AA 2015032(T)).

The CFP acts as both a supporting scaffold and a reducing agent for MnO2 growth. The obtained MnO2/CFP composite was directly used as electrodes for supercapacitors, delivering a high specific capacitance of 713.7 F/g (0.5 A/g). Cyclic stability testing of the MnO2/CFP electrode reveals 86.8% retention in specific capacitance after 1200 cycles at 5.0 A/g. The nanosheet morphology of the MnO2 on CFP brings about more efficient electroactive sites and facilitates the electrolyte penetration, allowing greater access for ions to active reaction sites. Hence, the attractive electrochemical performances exhibited by this MnO2/CFP electrode endow them potentially promising candidates for supercapacitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the bolting process at the molecular level and identifying the genes involved will provide valuable tools for genetic engineering and development of functional markers. To achieve these goals, microarray analyses using either outer leaves or core tissues of completely headed Chinese cabbage were performed at three developmental stages, and the findings were confirmed using RT-PCR. A large number of genes were specifically or preferentially expressed in each tissue: photosynthesis and abiotic signal responding genes were expressed in outer leaves, while genes involved in hormone responses, flower development, and histone modification were expressed in core tissues. Genes promoting bolting, such as BrPIF4, BrPIF5, and BrCOLs, were highly expressed in outer leaves, a signal-perceiving tissue, whereas floral repressors, such as BrFLCs, BrFRL, and BrMAF1s, were predominantly expressed in core tissues, with levels of expression decreasing in later stages. Although the B. rapa genome contains three BrFT paralogs, only BrFT1 was expressed. BrFD and BrFE, genes related to the transport of BrFTs, showed consistent expression. The late bolting phenotype of Huissen, the F-1 variety examined in this study, may result from expression of repressors of flowering, such as BrGASA5, BrTFL1, BrMAF1, BrFLCs, and BrKNAT1, in core tissues. Coordinated regulation of several floral promoters and repressors appears to be necessary for control of the bolting process or flowering time in B. rapa.	[Dong, Xiangshu; Yi, Hankuil; Swaraz, A.

The effects of calcination temperatures on the capacitive behaviors have been discussed by investigating the components, morphologies, surface conditions of the NiO/RGO composites. The specific capacitance values of NiO/RGO composites calcined at 250, 300, 400 and 500 degrees C are 950, 553, 375 and 205 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and the corresponding capacitance retention are 913%, 83.9%, 71.9% and 67.3% after 1000 cycles at the current density of 10 A/g. The results suggest the calcination temperature plays an important role in the electrochemical performances of NiO/RGO composites and the electrochemical performances were deteriorated with the increasing calcination temperatures.

Here we report a genome survey of 3,400 actinomycetes, identifying 81 strains that harbor genes encoding the enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes that could be grouped into 28 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Genome sequencing of 31 representative strains confirmed that each clade harbors a distinct enediyne biosynthetic gene cluster. A genome neighborhood network allows prediction of new structural features and biosynthetic insights that could be exploited for enediyne discovery. We confirmed one clade as new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, and discovered a new family of enediyne natural products, the tiancimycins (TNMs), that exhibit potent cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection. IMPORTANCE Recent advances in microbial genomics clearly revealed that the biosynthetic potential of soil actinomycetes to produce enediynes is underappreciated. A great challenge is to develop innovative methods to discover new enediynes and produce them in sufficient quantities for chemical, biological, and clinical investigations. This work demonstrated the feasibility of rapid discovery of new enediynes from a large strain collection. The new C-1027 producers, with a significantly higher C-1027 titer than the original producer, will impact the practical supply of this important drug lead. The TNMs, with their extremely potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cells and their rapid and complete cancer cell killing characteristics, in comparison with the payloads used in FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are poised to be exploited as payload candidates for the next generation of anticancer ADCs. Follow-up studies on the other identified hits promise the discovery of new enediynes, radically expanding the chemical space for the enediyne family.

In this study, the biotransformation of nicotine by Rhodococcus sp. Y22 was investigated, and three metabolites (NIC1, NIC4 and NIC5) were isolated by column separation, preparative TLC and solid plate's method, respectively. NIC1 was identified as 6-hydoxynicotine based on the results of NMR, MS, HPLC-UV and HRESIMS analysis; NIC4 was a novel compound and identified as 5-(3-methyl[1,3]oxazinan-2-ylidene)-5H-pyridin-2-one based on the results of NMR, MS and UV analysis; NIC5 was identified as nicotine blue based on the results of NMR and MS analysis. Meanwhile, two metabolites NIC2 and NIC3 were identified as 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine and 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine by HRESIMS analysis, respectively. According to these metabolites, the possible pathway of nicotine degradation by Rhodococcus sp. Y22 was proposed. The nicotine can be transformed to nicotine blue through two pathways (A and B), and 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine is the key compound, which can be converted to 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine (pathway A) and 5-(3-methyl-[1,3]oxazinan-2-ylidene)-5H-pyridin-2one (pathway B), respectively. Moreover, the encoding gene of nicotine dehydrogenase, ndh, was amplified from Rhodococcus sp. Y22, and its transcriptional level could be up-regulated obviously under nicotine induction. Our studies reported the key metabolites and possible biotransformation pathway of nicotine in Rhodococcus sp. Y22, and provided new insights into the microbial metabolism of nicotine.

In this paper, we introduce the novel idea of using this extensive database to test the differential volume expansion rate predicted by two specific models, the concordance Lambda cold darkmatter (Lambda CDM) and R-h = ct cosmologies. For this purpose, we use two well-studied formulations of the GLF, one based on pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and the other on a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on one-parameter cumulative distributions (in luminosity, redshift, photon index and source count), we confirm the results of earlier works showing that these data somewhat favour LDDE over PLE; we show that this is the case for both Lambda CDM and R-h = ct. Regardless of which GLF one chooses, however, we also show that model selection tools very strongly favour R-h = ct over Lambda CDM. We suggest that such population studies, though featuring a strong evolution in redshift, may none the less be used as a valuable independent check of other model comparisons based solely on geometric considerations.

In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with VA ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Several semi-supervised methods such as the kernel method, linear regression, and the pagerank algorithm have been investigated to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words from a set of semantically similar seed words. These methods suffer from two major limitations. First, they apply an equal weight to all seeds similar to an unseen word in predicting its VA ratings. Second, even similar seeds may have quite different ratings (or an inverse polarity) of valence/arousal to the unseen word, thus reducing prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a community-based weighted graph model that can select seeds which are both similar to and have similar ratings (or the same polarity) with each unseen word to form a community (subgraph) so that its VA ratings can be estimated from such high-quality seeds using a weighted propagation scheme. That is, seeds more similar to unseen words contribute more to the estimation process. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better prediction performance for both English and Chinese datasets.	[Wang, Jin; Lai, K.

In this study, we propose a coding method based on Huffman coding, where the triplet code was used as a code bit to transform DNA sequence into numerical sequence. The proposed method uses the firing characters of S-PCNN neurons in DNA sequence to extract features. Besides, the proposed method can deal with different lengths of DNA sequences. First, according to the characteristics of S-PCNN and the DNA primary sequence, the latter is encoded using Huffman coding method, and then using the former, the oscillation time sequence (OTS) of the encoded DNA sequence is extracted. Simultaneously, relevant features are obtained, and finally the similarities or dissimilarities of the DNA sequences are determined by Euclidean distance. In order to verify the accuracy of this method, different data sets were used for testing. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Empirical probability density functions of the absolute and relative TTRs for the <<^>>DB and CSI300 data evidence that (i) whenever the DWL increases, the absolute TTR increases, the relative TTR decreases otherwise; (ii) there is the monotonicity (or non-monotonicity) for the stability of the absolute (or relative) TTR; (iii) there is a peak distribution for shorter trading days and a two-peak distribution for longer trading days for the PDF of ratio; (iv) the trading days play an opposite role on the absolute (or relative) TTR and its stability between <<^>>DJI and CSI300 data.

A possible mechanism for the ZnO nucleation is discussed. The as-prepared ZnO samples were thoroughly examined by XRD, TEM, SEM, FTIR and XPS. The thermal and optical properties were further characterized by TGA/DTA, UV-vis and PL spectra, respectively. The results show that wurtzite ZnO mono-crystals with an average size of 30 +/- 1 nm were achieved, and their morphology was expressed as a polyhedron with distorted hexagonal base faces. Furthermore, the DEG molecules were incorporated into the surfaces of the ZnO crystals and could only be removed by thermal annealing; the molecules persisted after washing with ordinary solvents. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) shows that the ZnO NPs modified via DEG molecules are stable in an aqueous suspension without additives. In addition, the inclusion of DEG promotes light absorption at a longer wavelength but reduces the intensity of emissions. XPS reveals that the removal of DEG induced exposed polar surfaces and defects and thus increased the intensity of photoluminescence, especially blue emission. The findings of this work not only provide a facile and environmentally friendly ionothermal method to prepare uniform ZnO NPs protected by DEG but also improve the aqueous suspension stability. Consequently, the photocatalytic performance is enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our recent study revealed the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene AOL_s00215g283 in A. oligospora involved in the production of many secondary metabolites and the trap formation of the fungus. Here we report that the disruption of two genes in the upstream flanking region of the gene AOL_s00215g283, AOL_s00215g281 and AOL_s00215g282, which putatively encoded one amidohydrolase and one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, respectively, both resulted in significant nematicidal activity of the cultural broths of the mutants and loss of morphological regulatory arthrosporols. Chemical investigation revealed the huge accumulation of 6-methylsalicylic acid in the cultural broth of the mutant Delta AOL_s00215g281 and the high production of m-cresol in the mutant Delta AOL_s0021Sg282, respectively. Further bioassay revealed that 6-methylsalicylic acid and m-cresol displayed significant nematicidal activity toward root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita with IC90 values of 300 and 100 mu g/ ml, respectively. The mutant Delta AOL_s00215g282 displayed a more complex metabolite profile than the mutant Delta AOL_s0021Sg281, suggesting that m-cresol was a more versatile key precursor than 6-methylsalicylic acid. These findings not only demonstrated that the gene AOL_s0021Sg283 encodes the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase and the gene AOL_s0021Sg281 encodes the decarboxylase for 6-methylsalicylic acid but also provided evidence for the potential functions of the precursors in fungal complex biosynthetic pathways and had more implications for the establishment of efficient fungal biocontrol agents.

Fossils and the Evolution of the Arthropod Brain	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Review							2 VISUAL SYSTEMS; CENTRAL-COMPLEX; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SISTER GROUP; HOX GENES; ORGANIZATION; PHYLOGENOMICS; APPENDAGES; CRUSTACEAN; EDIACARAN	The discovery of fossilized brains and ventral nerve cords in lower and mid-Cambrian arthropods has led to crucial insights about the evolution of their central nervous system, the segmental identity of head appendages and the early evolution of eyes and their underlying visual systems. Fundamental ground patterns of lower Cambrian arthropod brains and nervous systems correspond to the ground patterns of brains and nervous systems belonging to three of four major extant panarthropod lineages. These findings demonstrate the evolutionary stability of early neural arrangements over an immense time span. Here, we put these fossil discoveries in the context of evidence from cladistics, as well as developmental and comparative neuroanatomy, which together suggest that despite many evolved modifications of neuropil centers within arthropod brains and ganglia, highly conserved arrangements have been retained. Recent phylogenies of the arthropods, based on fossil and molecular evidence, and estimates of divergence dates, suggest that neural ground patterns characterizing onychophorans, chelicerates and mandibulates are likely to have diverged between the terminal Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian, heralding the exuberant diversification of body forms that account for the Cambrian Explosion.

ELEGANS; GENES; EXPRESSION	Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a diverse class of transcription factors, which are involved in regulating a large number of physiological events in metazoans. However, the function of NRs is poorly understood in plant-parasitic nematodes. Here, members of the NR1J+K group of NRs in nematodes, including the free-living and plant parasites, were examined and phylogenetically analyzed. We found that the number of members of the NR1J+K group in plant-parasitic nematodes was less than that in the free-living nematodes, suggesting this reduction of NR1J+K group members in plant parasites maybe arose during the separation of the free-living and intermediately plant parasitic nematodes (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Interestingly, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR1J+K members were separated into two gene locations in the plant parasites. Knockdown of Meloidogyne incognita WBMinc13296, the ortholog of Caenorhabditis elegans nhr-48 DBD, reduced infectivity, delayed development, and decreased reproductivity. J2 of M. incognita subjected to silencing of WBMinc13295, the orthologs of B. xylophilus nhr-48 LBD, exhibited developmental lag within the host and reduced reproductivity. This study provides new insights into the function of NRs and suggests that NRs are potential targets for developing effective strategies for biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes.

Infrared to terahertz optical conductivity of n-type and p-type monolayer MoS2 in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SINGLE-LAYER MOS2; 2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-GAS; VALLEY POLARIZATION; TRANSISTORS; SEMICONDUCTORS; RELAXATION; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; MOBILITY	We investigate the effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the optoelectronic properties of n- and p-type monolayer MoS2. The optical conductivity is calculated within the Kubo formalism. We find that the spin-flip transitions enabled by the Rashba SOC result in a wide absorption window in the optical spectrum. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of the polarization direction of the radiation, temperature, carrier density, and the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit parameter on the optical conductivity. We find that the position, width, and shape of the absorption peak or absorption window can be tuned by varying these parameters. This study shows that monolayer MoS2 can be a promising tunable optical and optoelectronic material that is active in the infrared to terahertz spectral range.	[Xiao, Y.

Evaluation of entanglement measures by a single observable	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							STATES; SEPARABILITY; CONCURRENCE	We present observable lower bounds for several bipartite entanglement measures including entanglement of formation, geometric measure of entanglement, concurrence, convex-roof extended negativity, and G concurrence. The lower bounds facilitate estimates of these entanglement measures for arbitrary finite-dimensional bipartite states. Moreover, these lower bounds can be calculated analytically from the expectation value of a single observable. Based on our results, we use several real experimental measurement data to get lower bounds of entanglement measures for these experimentally realized states. In addition, we also study the relations between entanglement measures.

The rapid detection of animals in a scene is one compelling example of this phenomenon, and it suggests the automatic processing of at least some types of categories with little or no attentional requirements (Li et al., 2002, 2005). The aim of this study is to investigate whether the remarkable capability to categorize complex natural scenes exist in the absence of awareness, based on recent reports that "invisible" stimuli, which do not reach conscious awareness, can still be processed by the human visual system (Pasley et al., 2004: Williams et al., 2004; Fang and He, 2005; Jiang et al., 2006, 2007; Kaunitz et al., 2011a). In two experiments, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to animal and non-animal/vehicle stimuli in both aware and unaware conditions in a continuous flash suppression (CFS) paradigm. Our results indicate that even in the "unseen" condition, the brain responds differently to animal and non-animal/vehicle images, consistent with rapid activation of animal selective feature detectors prior to, or outside of, suppression by the CFS mask.

Numerical simulation results indicate the entropic stochastic resonance can survive even if there is no symmetry breaking in any direction. This is the essential distinction between the property of a self-propelled Janus particle and that of a passive Brownian particle, for the symmetry breaking is necessary for the entropic stochastic resonance of a passive Brownian particle. With the rotational noise intensity growing at small fixed noise intensity of translational motion, the signal power amplification increases monotonically towards saturation which also can be regarded as a kind of stochastic resonance effect. Besides, the increase in the natural frequency of the periodic driving depresses the degree of the stochastic resonance, whereas the rise in its amplitude enhances and then suppresses the behavior.

Genetic diversity and breeding history of Winter Mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) in China uncovered by genomic SSR markers	GENE			English	Article						Molecular marker; Microsatellites; Strain fingerprinting; Genetic structure; Hybridization	COMMERCIAL BUTTON MUSHROOM; SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEATS; AGARICUS-BISPORUS; EDIBLE MUSHROOM; MICROSATELLITE ISOLATION; EUKARYOTIC GENOMES; MEDICINAL MUSHROOM; FUNGAL GENOMES; PURIFICATION; CULTIVARS	Flammulina velutipes is one of the most widely cultivated mushroom species in China. However, its genetic background remains poorly understood due to the limited sampling and poor molecular markers used. In this study, 124 F. velutipes strains were employed, including 110 cultivars and 14 wild strains, and 25 new SSR markers were developed based on the genome of E velutipes. A total of 153 alleles were detected in 124 strains to investigate the improper cultivar naming, genetic diversity and breeding history of F. velutipes in China. Our fingerprinting analyses indicated that 65 strains can be differentiated from the total of 124 strains, and over 53% of the strains are labeled with improper commercial names. The genetic diversities of wild strains are higher than those of the cultivars, suggesting that wild strains may harbor a large "arsenal" gene pool in nature available for strain breeding. The white cultivars in China were originally introduced from Japan, while the yellow cultivars were directly domesticated from wild strains isolated from southeastern China or hybridized between the white cultivars and yellow strains.

However, the current genetic understanding of high-altitude adaptation emanated mainly from autosomal analyses. Only a few earlier genomic studies paid attention to the allosome. In this study, we performed an intensive scan of the X chromosome of public genomic data generated from Tibetan Mastiff (TM) and five other dog populations for indications of high-altitude adaptation. We identified five genes showing signatures of selection on the X chromosome. Notable among these genes was angiomotin (AMOT), which is related to the process of angiogenesis. We sampled additional 11 dog populations (175 individuals in total) at continuous altitudes in China from 300 to 4,000 meters to validate and test the association between the haplotype frequency of AMOT gene and altitude adaptation. The results suggest that AMOT gene may be a notable candidate gene for the adaptation of TM to high-altitude hypoxic conditions. Our study shows that X chromosome deserves consideration in future studies of adaptive evolution.

Mesoporous Co3O4 material was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause for the highly sensitive sensing behavior. SEM and TEM analyses reveal that the Co3O4 nanosheets consisting of nanoparticles prepared here are porous in nature, with average pore sizes of approximately 50 nm or smaller. The sensor based on porous Co3O4 nanaosheets was used for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethanol, methanol, acetone, isopropanol, formaldehyde and n-butanol. The results demonstrate that the sensor shows potential for detecting VOCs. The significant improvement of sensitivity is attributed to the porous structure, good contact and relatively small crystal size. The gas sensor shows high response values, fast response and recovery times towards VOCs. So, porous Co3O4 nanosheets are considered as promising sensor material for detecting VOCs.

Organic manures have been reported to alleviate soil acidification in tea (Camellia sinensis) plantations. However, little is known about the pH status at different soil depths in these plantations. Whether the downward movement of acid contributes to subsurface soil acidification and the magnitude of the movement are unknown. We took soil samples from tea plantations that were 5,10, 20, 33, and 56 years old at depths up to 120 cm in the soil profile. We examined the soil pH, Fe, Al, nitrate N (NO3-N), ammonium N (NH4-N), and organic carbon (OC) in every 20-cm soil layer, and observed the downward movement of H+, NH4-N, and OC using undisturbed soil column experiments. The results show that organic manures and plant residues increased the topsoil pH, but did not reduce soil acidification below 80 cm. At a planting density of 10,000 plants ha(-1) and with the application of organic manures at 6000 kg ha(-1) a(-1), the soil acidification rates (decrease in pH) were -0.0161 and -0.0245 per year at depths of 80-100 and 100-120 cm, respectively. The soil pH increased by 0.0158 and 0.0140 per year at depths of 0-20 and 20-40 cm, respectively. The downward movement of acid is one cause of topsoil alkalization and deeper soil acidification in cultivated tea plantations. No-till farming and increased vegetation coverage to reduce the downward movement of H+, NH4-N, and OC are effective measures to alleviate deep-soil acidification. Planting density also affects soil acidification; tea trees excrete less H+ into the rhizosphere at a lower planting density than at a higher planting density. Tea plantation soil is not acidified at a lower planting density of 5000 plants ha(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some moths, particularly their caterpillars, are major agricultural and forestry pests in many parts of the world. However, some other members of moths, such as the silkworm Bombyx mori, are famous for their economic value. Fire et al. in 1998 initially found that exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can silence the homolog endogenous mRNA in organisms, which is called RNA interference (RNAi). Soon after, the RNAi technique proved to be very promising not only in gene function determination but also in pest control. However, later studies demonstrate that performing RNAi in moths is not as straightforward as shown in other insect taxa. Nevertheless, since 2007, especially after 2010, an increasing number of reports have been published that describe successful RNAi experiments in different moth species either on gene function analysis or on pest management exploration. So far, more than 100 peer-reviewed papers have reported successful RNAi experiments in moths, covering 10 families and 25 species. By using classic and novel dsRNA delivery methods, these studies effectively silence the expression of various target genes and determine their function in larval development, reproduction, immunology, resistance against chemicals, and other biological processes. In addition, a number of laboratory and field trials have demonstrated that RNAi is also a potential strategy for moth pest management. In this review, therefore, we summarize and discuss the mechanisms and applications of the RNAi technique in moths by focusing on recent progresses.

Using the Risk-Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptability model (RESC model), the water resource vulnerability of the Huai River Basin was assessed using four scales, namely, Class II, Class III, Province-Class II, and Municipality-Class III WRR (Water Resources Region). Following this, the spatial heterogeneity of the vulnerability of the above four scales was evaluated with the Theil and the Shannon-Weaver index. The results demonstrate that, instead of moving towards convergence, water resource vulnerability presents different grades which change together with the change in scale, and in turn, tend to weaken from east to west. Of the four scales, the scale of Municipality-Class III WRR shows the most significant spatial diversity, whereas that of Class II WRR shows the least diversity. With spatial downscaling, the vulnerability demonstrates high spatial heterogeneity and diversity. Herein, an innovative cross-scales vulnerability assessment is proposed and the RESC model characteristics and uncertainties as well as the employment of cross-scale water resource vulnerability are discussed.

It already rivals the world's largest hydro-producing nations. However, five of Yunnan's six basins are international and therefore its hydropower development is of great academic and geopolitical interest. While the implementation of large projects on Yunnan's three large rivers (Jinsha, Mekong and Nu) is relatively well studied, hydropower development outside these three main streams is hardly known. Here, we identified 128 large hydropower projects (>= 50 MW) having a capacity of 16.5 GW, along with another 16.4 GW of other types of power generation, neither of which has been discussed in the academic literature yet. The paper utilizes a powershed approach to study the rapid hydropower development underway in Yunnan, both in its implication and challenges (at basin and administrative level) as well as in its trade-offs within the broader electricity context. Yunnan's power generation and consumption patterns are characterized by diverging interests of local/provincial usage and export utilization. Within the province, the largest (hydro-) power users are energy/electricity intensive industries, which themselves have strong impacts on land use changes. Yunnan is also evolving as a major power exporter, already in 2013 exporting about one-third of its generated electricity mainly to Guangdong's Pearl River Delta. We see a need for a critical revision of those existing generation and consumption paradigms, which includes a rethinking of major development modes, both in terms of future hydropower generation and utilization projects as well as export obligations.

The results of physiological measurements showed the phenotypic differences between the two varieties in response to salt stress. RNA-Seq analysis was first performed on leaves of both varieties sampled at four time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6 days) after treatment with salt (500 mM NaCl) We identified 220 co-up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two varieties, while 26 up-regulated DEGs and 24 down-regulated DEGs were identified exclusively in the single varieties after 2 days of salt stress. Among the 220 DEGs, we identified 22 transcription factors, including key transcription factors involved in salt stress, such as MYB, NAC, GATA, and HSF. We applied gene expression profile analysis and found that 'Yunma 5' and 'Bamahuoma' have variety-specific pathways for resisting salt stress. The DEGs of 'Yunma 5' were enriched in spliceosome and amino acid metabolism genes, while the DEGs of 'Bamahuoma' were enriched in fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum protein processing pathway. Although there were common DEGs, such as genes encoding cysteine protease and alpha/beta-hydrolase superfamily, the two varieties' responses to salt stress impacted different metabolic pathways. The DEGs that were co-expressed in both varieties under stress may provide useful insights into the tolerance of cultivated hemp and other bast fiber crops to saline soil conditions. These transcriptomes also represent reference sequences for industrial hemp.

GAUD; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MOLECULAR RESPONSES; SALT TOLERANCE; LEAF PROTEOME; PROTEINS; RICE; PLANTS; WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION	In this study, we conducted the first isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ))-based comparative proteomic analysis of ramie plantlets after 0 (minor drought stress), 24 (moderate drought stress), and 72 h (severe drought stress) of treatment with 15% (w/v) poly (ethylene glycol) 6000 (PEG6000) to simulate drought stress. In our study, the association analysis of proteins and transcript expression revealed 1244 and 968 associated proteins identified in leaves and roots, respectively. L1, L2, and L3 are leaf samples which were harvested at 0, 24, and 72 h after being treated with 15% PEG6000, respectively. Among those treatment groups, a total of 118, 216, and 433 unique proteins were identified as differentially expressed during L1 vs. L2, L2 vs. L3, and L1 vs. L3, respectively. R1, R2, and R3 are root samples which were harvested at 0, 24, and 72 h after being treated with 15% PEG6000, respectively. Among those treatment groups, a total of 124, 27, and 240 unique proteins were identified as differentially expressed during R1 vs. R2, R2 vs. R3, and R1 vs. R3, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was significantly upregulated in roots in response to drought stress. This enhancement may result in more glycolytically generated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in roots to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. To obtain complementary information related to iTRAQ data, the mRNA levels of 12 proteins related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in leaves and 7 in roots were further analyzed by qPCR. Most of their expression levels were higher in R3 than R1 and R2, suggesting that these compounds may promote drought tolerance by modulating the production of available energy.

Methods and Results: In this study, a total of 18 novel polymorphic microsatellite (EST-SSR) markers were developed for S. tuberculata using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. Analysis of 24 individuals of S. tuberculata from four natural populations revealed their robust polymorphic reliability. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 11, while the expected and observed heterozygosity per marker varied from 0.187 to 0.827 and 0.042 to 0.917, respectively. Of these markers, 13 showed good amplification results in the closely related species S. cantonensis. Conclusions: These newly generated SSR markers are expected to provide novel tools for genetic studies of S. tuberculata, which will contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the species' wild genetic resources.

By taking the local variation obtained by locality preserving projections into consideration, the regression algorithm LPR is employed to construct a soft sensor model and applied to industrial case. Furthermore, to deal with the time-varying behaviour of the process variables, just-in-time learning is also integrated to regularly update the soft sensor. Two case studies on a fermentation process for penicillin concentration prediction and the Tennessee Eastman process for output component prediction are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed local-based technique for soft sensor modelling are assessed and compared with the global-based soft sensors based on the mean square error and the coefficient of determination. Experimental results showed that the novel soft sensor model could estimate the output with higher accuracy and generalization ability than the general soft sensor based on the global information.

C. Wu et C. Y. Wu collected from Gejiu, Yunnan, China. The taxonomic position of strain YIM DR1091(T) was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM DR1091(T) is a member of the genus Nocardioides. Strain YIM DR1091(T) was closely related to Nocardioides pyridinolyticus OS4(T), Nocardioides caricicola YC6903(T), Nocardioides hankookensis DS-30(T) and Nocardioides aquiterrae GW-9(T), with which it shared pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.6, 97.5, 97.2 and 97.2 %, respectively. Mean DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain YIM DR1091(T) and related type strains N. pyridinolyticus JCM 10369(T), N. caricicola JCM 17686(T), N. hankookensis JCM 15302(T) and N. aquiterrae JCM 11813(T) were 44.9 +/- 1.7, 50.2 +/- 1.3, 46.8 +/- 0.9 and 43.0 +/- 0.2 %, respectively. The respiratory menaquinone for strain YIM DR1091(T) was MK-8(H-4) while the major fatty acids (>5%) were iso-C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 8c, C-17:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-14:0. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and three unidentified phospholipids. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained mannose, ribose, glucose and galactose, along with LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 74.6 mol%. Phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data indicated that strain YIM DR1091(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides intraradicalis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM DR1091(T) (= JCM 30632(T) = CGMCC4.7251(T)).

RS-LYSO-3(T) could effectively inhibit the invasion of powdery mildew on tobacco. The colonies of RS-LYSO-3(T) were pale yellow, and its cells were Gram-stain-negative and rod-shaped, with 68 mol% DNA G+C content. Gene sequence analysis for its 16S rRNA gene revealed the highest similarity (97.78 %) with that of Lysobacter spongiicolaKMM 329(T). Chemotaxonomic data showed that RS-LYSO-3(T) possesses a quinone system with Q-8, and iso-C-16:0, summed feature 9 and iso-C-15:0 as the predominant fatty acids, all of which support the affiliation of RS-LYSO-3(T) to the genus Lysobacter. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and biochemical tests clearly proved that RS-LYSO-3(T) is a representative of a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter erysipheresistens sp. nov. is proposed.

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; HYBRIDIZATION; FAMILIES; TAXON; DNA	An endophytic actinobacterial strain, designated py1292(T), was isolated from the root of Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis collected from Yunnan province, China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic characterization. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the isolate in the family Dermacoccaceae and clustered with Yimella lutea (showing the highest similarity of 99.1 %). DNA-DNA relatedness between strain py1292(T) and Y. lutea YIM 45900(T) was 45.6 +/- 3.2 % (reciprocal 47.8 +/- 3.6 %). The novel isolate was found to be a Gram-staining-positive rod, catalase-and oxidase-positive. It grew at pH 6.0-8.0, with 0-9% NaCl and at 20-45 degrees C, optimally at pH 7.0, with 0-3% NaCl and at 28 degrees C. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-4), while the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, two unknown phospholipids and two unknown polar lipids. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15 : 0, iso-C-16 (: 0), iso-C-17 : 0 and anteiso-C-17 : 0. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucose and galactose. The peptidoglycan contained alanine, glycine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and lysine. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 65.6 mol %. Phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data (especially the same peptidoglycan type) showed that strain py1292(T) should be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Yimella, for which the name Yimella radicis sp. nov. is proposed.

SP.; SEQUENCES; BOVIFELIS; SINENSIS; HIRSUTA; DEER	Cattle are intermediate hosts for 2 zoonotic species of Sarcocystis, Sarcocystis hominis and Sarcocystis heydorni. Here we report S. heydorni from cattle for the first time in China. Sarcocysts of S. heydorni were found in muscle from 173 of 1,630 (10.6%) cattle in abattoirs (9.7% in skeletal muscles, 3.4% esophagus, 2.5% diaphragm, and 0.1% tongue; heart muscle was negative). By means of light microscopy, S. heydorni sarcocysts were thin-walled (<1 mu m). Using transmission electron microscopy, the sarcocyst wall had short (0.3-0.5 x 0.5-0.9 mu m) stubby protrusions, the tips of which contained electron-dense, disk-shaped plaques, similar to the sarcocyst wall type 29b. In preliminary transmission attempts, a human volunteer did not excrete sporocysts in feces after ingesting 579 sarcocysts S. heydorni isolated from cattle. Phylogenetic analysis using the 2 molecular markers (18S rRNA gene and mitochondrial cox1 gene) indicated S. heydorni shared the closest affinity with species of Sarcocystis, which employ ruminants as intermediate hosts and canids as definitive hosts.

This approach functionalizes these compounds to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics with microsecond-scale photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes. Their thermal, electrochemical properties, emissive characteristics, and energy levels can be finely tailored through isomer engineering. The meta-and para-linking compounds (m-PXZP and p-PXZP) possess higher decomposition temperatures, deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, higher PL quantum efficiencies, smaller singlet-triplet energy splitting, and reduced DF lifetimes relative to their ortho-disposition isomer (o-PXZP). Consequently, a green fluorescence organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based on m-PXZP achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.9%, and has a slow efficiency roll-off of 28% at the luminance of 1000 cd m(-2). Notably, m-PXZP-based device exhibits a nearly 100% utilization efficiency of electro-generated singlet and triplet excitons. These results demonstrate for the first time that phenanthroline derivatives can be employed as TADF emitters for high-efficiency OLEDs. The isomer engineering for TADF emitters provides a simple method to extend structure diversity of TADF emitters, and moreover it provides a flexible method to optimize optoelectronic properties and thereby manipulate electroluminescence performance.

The obtained results indicate that the active residues for R-benzedrine (RAT) bound with D3R are Ala132, Asp133, and Tyr55, while Asn57, Asp133, Asp168, Cys172, Gly54, Trp24, and Vall136 act as the active residues for S-benzedrine (SAT). The different active pockets are observed for ART or SAT because they possess different active residues. The binding energies between RAT and SAT with D3R were determined to be -44.0kJ.mol(-1) and -71.2kJ.mol(-1), respectively. These results demonstrate that SAT within the studied pocket of D3R has a stronger capability of binding with D3R, while it is more feasible for RAT to leave from the interior positions of D3R. In addition, the results suggest that the D3R protein can recognize chiral benzedrine molecules and influence their different addictive and pharmacological effects in biochemical systems.

The straws were added into a perforated PVC pipe vertically inserted into each biofilter. Results showed that compared to the control biofilter with almost no removal capacity, the experimental systems effectively co-eliminated nitrate and sulfate from the wastewater, with a mean removal rate of 1.292.11 g NO3--N m(-3) d(-1) and 1.03-2.16 g SO42- m(-3) d(-1), and higher efficiencies achieved for carnation and lily straws than rose and violet. A significant positive correlation was detected between nitrate and sulfate removal efficiency, with the nitrate removal notably more efficient. Nitrate and sulfate removal rates both decreased gradually with the operation time due to the declining carbon supply, and could be augmented again by fresh straw addition even in winter season. The phosphorous removal capacity of the biofilter was low and just influenced limitedly by the straw addition. High contents of organic carbon and colored matter were determined in the effluent after the straw addition but sharp drops to low levels were followed, resulting in insufficient carbon source for the removals of nitrate and sulfate. Mild accumulations of nitrite and ammonium occurred, averaging 0.39-1.30 mgL(-1) and 0.46-0.93 mgL(-1) in the effluent, while the content of dissolved sulfide was low. The biofilter added with rose straw showed the lowest relative adverse effects despite of its low removal capacities, and good performance with moderate adverse effects were obtained when adding with the carnation straw. The biofilter can be potentially applied to co-alleviate nitrate and sulfate pollutions although further optimization of straw addition is still required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Trichoderma species have been widely used in suppression of soil-borne pathogens. In this study, an endophytic fungus, Trichoderma gamsii YIM PH30019, from healthy Panax notoginseng root was investigated for its biocontrol potential. Methods: In vitro detached healthy roots, and pot and field experiments were used to investigate the pathogenicity and biocontrol efficacy of T. gamsii YIM PH30019 to the host plant. The antagonistic mechanisms against test phytopathogens were analyzed using dual culture, scanning electron microscopy, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Tolerance to chemical fertilizers was also tested in a series of concentrations. Results: The results indicated that 7: gamsii YIM PH30019 was nonpathogenic to the host, presented appreciable biocontrol efficacy, and could tolerate chemical fertilizer concentrations of up to 20%. T gamsii YIM PH30019 displayed antagonistic activities against the pathogenic fungi of P. notoginseng via production of VOCs. On the basis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, VOCs were identified as dimethyl disulfide, dibenzofuran, methanethiol, ketones, etc., which are effective ingredients for antagonistic activity. T. gamsii YIM PH30019 was able to improve the seedlings' emergence and protect P. notoginseng plants from soil-borne disease in the continuous cropping field tests. Conclusion: The results suggest that the endophytic fungus T. gamsii YIM PH30019 may have a good potential as a biological control agent against notoginseng phytodiseases and can provide a clue to further illuminate the interactions between Trichoderma and phytopathogens.

To examine the population genetic structure of S. schlegelii, eight microsatellite DNA loci were used to interpret their life history characteristics and larval dispersal strategy. Two hundred and ten individuals from nine sites across the entire range of S. schlegelii in China and Japan were analyzed. The results indicated that the polymorphism information content, observed heterozygosity, and gene diversity of S. schlegelii were high. The results of analysis of molecular variance, pairwise F-ST values, and exact-P tests showed no genetic divergence among the different geographical populations and indicted the existence of high gene flow. There was no IBD pattern among populations. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis showed all the populations of S. schlegelii shared one gene pool. We concluded that larval dispersal with drifting seaweed and the environmental factors of the currents might play important roles in shaping the contemporary phylogeographical pattern and genetic homogeneity of S. schlegelii. The results of the microsatellite analysis were in accordance with the results revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequences and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SP.; SHEEP; ULTRASTRUCTURE; CATTLE; GENE; INFECTION; SEQUENCES	Despite the importance of worldwide goat production, little is known about the prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. in domestic goats (Capra hircus) in China. The aims of the present study were to determine prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. in domestic goats in Kunming, China, as well as to identify parasite species based on morphological characteristics and DNA sequence analysis. Only microscopic sarcocysts of Sarcocystis spp. were detected in 174 of 225 goats (77.3 %). By light and transmission electron microscopy, two species, i.e., Sarcocystis capracanis and Sarcocystis hircicanis, were identified. Two sarcocysts from each of the two species were randomly selected for DNA extraction; the 18S rRNA gene (18S rRNA), the 28S rRNA gene (28S rRNA), and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently sequenced. The results were compared with other previously sequenced Sarcocystis species retrieved from GenBank. There was little sequence variation between two isolates of the same species. S. capracanis was most closely related with Sarcocystis tenella; 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and mitochondrial cox1 sequences shared identities of 95.7-99.1, 95.3, and 92.3-93.2 % with those of S. tenella, respectively. Thus, mitochondrial cox1 sequences seem to perform better than 18S rRNA sequences or 28S rRNA sequences for identification of the two species. S. hircicanis was most closely related to Sarcocystis arieticanis, i.e., 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA sequences of the former species shared 97.2-97.4 and 95.6-96.1 % identities with those of latter, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from the three genetic markers yielded similar results and indicated the two species were within a group of Sarcocystis species with canines as known, or presumed, definitive hosts.

There is very strong year-to-year variability for Southern Hemispheric winter extratropical cyclone numbers and larger variations on centennial time scale, more so than for its Northern Hemispherical counterparts. However, no obvious trend can be found. The mean tracks of clusters over the Southern Indian Ocean and near New Zealand shift poleward from the eleventh to the twentieth century while the clusters in the central Southern Pacific shift equatorward. Storm track clusters with largest deepening rates are found over the Southwestern Indian Ocean. In the twentieth century, rapidly deepening cyclones appear more often while long lifespan cyclones appear less frequently. The winter storm activity in the Southern Hemisphere is closely related to the Antarctic Oscillation. The cyclone frequency over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean can be associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole and El Nino-Southern Oscillation respectively.

Motivated by the "weightlessness" feature, here we apply a bidirectional feature during the feature extraction phase of activity recognition; however, since the bidirectional feature has two components, they cannot simply be concatenated into a long vector, but can be naturally treated as a second-order tensor. Therefore, we propose a new tensor-based feature selection method termed tensor manifold discriminant projections (TMDP). TMDP simultaneously considers: 1) applying an optimization criterion that can directly process the tensor spectral analysis problem, thereby decreasing the computational cost compared to traditional tensor-based feature selection methods; 2) extracting local rank information by finding a tensor subspace that preserves the rank order information of the within-class input samples; and 3) extracting discriminant information by maximizing the sum of distances between every sample and their interclass sample mean. Experiments on the naturalistic mobile devices-based human activity 2.0 dataset are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TMDP.

This paper presents a new clustering method based on a novel heuristic optimization algorithm proposed recently and named as multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) to locate the optimal solution automatically through global and local alternating search implemented by a global exploration group and several local exploitation groups. In order to demonstrate the performance of MOA-clustering method, it is applied to group six real-life datasets to obtain their clustering results, which may be compared with those received by employing K-means algorithm, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The results show that the proposed clustering algorithm is an effective and feasible method to reach a high accurate rate and stability in clustering problems.

In this paper, we investigated the corneal cells of both larvae and adult amphibious mudskippers Boleophthalmus pectinirostris and Periophthalmus magnuspinnatus, to testify the relationship between morphology and function. The cell density values of the two species were 31,137 and 31,974 cells per mm(2) in larvae and then significantly decreased to 15,826 and 25,954 cells per mm(2) in adult (p < 0.001), respectively, which could be explained as the habitat change from aquatic to different degrees of terrestrial environment. The corneal epithelium cells were ridge type in larvae and differentiated into ridge type and reticular type in adult P. magnuspinnatus and ridge type, reticular type and ridge-reticular type in adult B. pectinirostris. Four kinds of microstructures as microridge, microvilli, microplicae and microhole appeared in both species. The difference of microridge width and its separation indicated that a dense cell connection was requested in a saltier and more terrestrial environment.

C. Wu et C. Y. Wu collected from Lijiang, Yunnan Province, China. The taxonomic position of the new isolate was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM T102(T) belongs to the genus Streptomyces. Strain YIM T102(T) was most closely related to Streptomyces eurocidicus NRRL B-1676(T) with a pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.9 %. However, DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain YIM T102(T) and S. eurocidicus NBRC 13491(T) was found to be 37.8 +/- 1.8 %. The menaquinone composition detected for strain YIM T102(T) was MK-9 (H-6) and MK-9 (H-8), while the major fatty acids were summed feature 4 (38.0 %), anteiso-C-15:0 (13.1 %), iso-C-16:0 (10.1 %), summed feature 3 (9.8 %) and C-16:0 (9.0 %) and iso-C-15:0 (5.2 %). The whole-cell hydrolysates contained galactose, glucose, ribose and mannose, along with ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 70.7 mol%. Strain YIM T102(T) also exhibited antagonistic activity against Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicae and Colletotrichum nicotianae Averna, based on the findings from the comparative analyses of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics; it is proposed that strain YIM T102 represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces zhihengii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM T102(T) (=KCTC 39115(T) = DSM 42176(T) = CGMCC 4.7248(T)).

The cells were Gram-staining negative, aerobic, forming creamy and circular colonies with diameters of 2-3 mm on R2A agar when incubated at 30 A degrees C for 3 days. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain CUG 00002(T) belonged to the genus Halomonas in the class Gammaproteobacteria, showing highest sequence similarity of 97.1 and 96.7 % to Halomonas mongoliensis Z-7009(T) (=DSM 17332=VKM B2353) and Halomonas shengliensis SL014B-85(T) (=CGMCC 1.6444(T)=LMG 23897(T)), respectively. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-9 (Q9), and the major fatty acids were C-16:0, summed feature 3 (comprising C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) and summed feature 8 (comprising C-18:1 omega 7c or C-18:1 omega 6c). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CUG 00002(T) was 61.8 mol%. The above characteristics were consistent with the placement of the organism in the genus Halomonas. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between CUG 00002(T) and its most closely related strain H. mongoliensis Z-7009(T) was 41.0 +/- 1.6 %. Based on the results of phenotypic, phylogenetic and biochemical analyses, strain CUG 00002(T) represents a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas xiaochaidanensis sp. nov. is proposed.

NOV.; SOIL; CLASSIFICATION; CHINA; IDENTIFICATION	A novel actinobacterial strain, designated LPA192(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from Lop Nur, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Northwest China. A polyphasic approach was used to investigate the taxonomic position of strain LPA192(T). The isolate showed morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of members of the genus Streptomyces. Peptidoglycan was found to contain (LL)-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-6) and MK-10(H-4). Polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. Major cellular fatty acids consist of C-16:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and C-18:1 omega 9c. The sugar in whole-cell hydrolysates was mannose. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain LPA192(T) is closely related to Streptomyces tanashiensis LMG 20274(T) (99.3 %), Streptomyces gulbargensis DAS131(T) (99.3 %), Streptomyces nashvillensis NBRC 13064(T) (99.3 %), Streptomyces roseolus NBRC 12816(T) (99.2 %) and Streptomyces filamentosus NBRC 12767(T) (99.1 %) while showing below 98.5 % sequencing similarities with other validly published Streptomyces species. However, DNA-DNA relatedness values between LPA192(T) and the closely related type strains were below 40 %, which are much lower than 70 % threshold value for species delineation. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain LPA192(T) was 69.3 mol %. Based on the differences in genotypic and phenotypic characteristics from the closely related strains, strain LPA192(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces xinjiangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LPA192(T) (=KCTC 39601(T) = CGMCC 4.7288(T)).

It is desirable to develop effective strategies for influence spread of the participants themselves instead of blocking the influence spread of their opponents. In this paper, we extend the linear threshold model to establish the diffusion-containment model, abbreviated as D-C model, by incorporating the realistic specialties and characteristics of the containment of competitive influence spread. Then, we discuss the influence spread mechanism for the D-C model, and give the algorithm for the propagation of the diffusion influence (D-influence) and containment influence (C-influence). Further, we define the sub-modular set function of the C-influence in the D-C model and consequently give a greedy algorithm for solving the problem of maximizing the competitive influence containment approximately.

J	Zhao, ZY; Tian, F				Zhao Zong-Yan; Tian Fan			Theoretical Study of the Interfacial Structure and Properties of a CdS/FeP Composite Photocatalyst	ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Photocatalysis; Cadmium sulfide; Hetero-structure; Interfacial micro-structure; Interfacial property; Density functional theory calculation	VISIBLE-LIGHT IRRADIATION; PHOSPHIDE NANOPARTICLES; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; H-2 EVOLUTION; CDS; SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; TIO2	An effective method for improving the performance of a photocatalyst is to construct a suitable hetero-/homo-structure. This strategy can also lead to improvements in the stability of the photocatalysts that suffer with photo-corrosion (such as CdS). The preparation of CdS-based composite photocatalysts has therefore been widely studied. Unfortunately, however, some of the fundamental and more significant aspects of this strategy still need to be evaluated in greater detail. In this study, we have evaluated the interfacial microstructure and properties of a CdS/FeP composite photocatalyst with a hetero-structure using a series of the first principles calculations. The results revealed that the electronic structure of the interface model exhibited different features compared with the bulk and surface models, because of the partially saturated dangling bonds. However, several obvious interfacial states were observed. At the interface of the CdS/FeP hetero-structure, the energy bands of CdS and FeP were relatively down-shifted, whereas the energy band of FeP was inserted below the conduction band of CdS. Furthermore, the direction of the built-in electric field of the hetero-structure projected out from the FeP layer towards the CdS layer under the equilibrium conditions. The photo-generated electron-hole pairs were therefore spatially separated by the CdS/FeP interface, which was favorable for improving the photocatalytic performance. The construction of a CdS/FeP hetero-structure can also lead to further improvements in the absorption properties of CdS in the visible-light region. The results of this study have provided mechanical explanations and theoretical support for the construction of highly efficient composite photocatalyst with hetero-structures.

A tight linear relationship between star formation rate and gas mass traced by dust continuum emission was found for both Galactic clumps and the high redshift (z > 1) star forming galaxies (SFGs), indicating a constant gas depletion time of similar to 100 Myr for molecular gas in both Galactic clumps and high z SFGs. However, low z galaxies do not follow this relation and seem to have a longer global gas depletion time. The correlations between total infrared luminosities (L-TIR) and molecular line luminosities (L-mol') of HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) are tight and sublinear extending down to clumps with L-TIR similar to 10(3) L-circle dot. These correlations become linear when extended to external galaxies. A bimodal behavior in the L-TIR-L-mol' correlations was found for clumps with different dust temperature, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and sigma(line)/sigma(vir). Such bimodal behavior may be due to evolutionary effects. The slopes of L-TIR-L-mol' correlations become more shallow as clumps evolve. We compared our results with lower J transition lines in Wu et al. (2010). The correlations between clump masses and line luminosities are close to linear for low effective excitation density tracers but become sublinear for high effective excitation density tracers for clumps with L-TIR larger than L-TIR similar to 10(4.5) L-circle dot. High effective excitation density tracers cannot linearly trace the total clump masses, leading to a sublinear correlations for both M-clump-L-mol' and L-TIR-L-mol' relations.

A new tetracyclic triterpene sulfate was produced by solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Fusarium sambucinum B10.2. The tetracyclic triterpene sulfate was identified as (3S, 5R, 10S, 11S, 12S, 13R, 17R, 20R)-4,4-dimethylergosta- 8,14,24-triene-3,11,12-triol-12-acetate, 3-sulfate on the basis of HRESIMS, NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra and named sambacide (1). The antibacterial and antifungal assays of sambacide (1) showed significant antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The fermentation conditions including culture media, fermentation temperature and time, were optimized. And potato was selected as the fermentation substrate, 28 degrees C was used as the fermentation temperature, and 20-days fermentation time was determined for F. sambucinum-SSF to produce sambacide (1) with a high yield of 19.04 +/- 0.82 g/kg. This paper provides an efficient approach to produce the antibacterial and antifungal agent sambacide (1) in a very high yield. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, the prevalence of ecological speciation of sister species driven by Quaternary climate changes is debated. Here, we used two parapatric sister species, Roscoea humeana and R. cautleoides, to test whether ecological speciation was associated with Quaternary climate changes in these taxa. LocationHengduan-Mountain Region (HMR), south-west of China. MethodsNuclear ribosomal (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA: psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF) were sequenced from 200 individuals. Gene genealogies were reconstructed using network, Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Interspecific divergence times were estimated with an isolation with migration model. Suitable habitats for each species were estimated with ecological niche modelling using Maxent and BIOCLIM. Niche overlap and niche divergence were tested using Schoener's D and Warren's I. Principal components analysis (PCA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) were also used to test ecological differentiation. ResultsGene genealogies indicated that the low-elevational species R. cautleoides was derived from the high-elevational species R. humeana. Divergence among species occurred during the middle to late Quaternary (0.01-1.48Ma). The species distribution and phylogeographical pattern were inconsistent with a geographical barrier. Niche models and statistical analyses showed significant ecological differentiation. Main conclusionsDivergence between R. humeana and R. cautleoides was recent and coincident with Quaternary climate cycles. Ecological niche differentiation within Quaternary refugia may have promoted speciation.

Microstructures of the alloy were characterized by optical metallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Grains grew obviously with either increasing temperature or extending holding time at temperatures above 1 050 degrees C. However, at temperatures lower than 1 050 degrees C, the GG was sluggish due to the pinning effect of carbide particles on grain boundary (GB). Threshold temperature for transition from mixed grain structure to uniform one was considered to be around 1 100 degrees C. Once the temperatures surpassed 1 200, an instant increase in the grain size occurred showing no dependence on holding time. TEM analysis showed that the dominant second phase formed heterogeneously on the GB was M-6 C, which significantly impeded grain growth. On the basis of experimental data, the mathematical model of GG was established, which can describe GG behavior of Inconel 625 alloy during solution treatment (ST) at 1 100-1 250 C. The activation energy for GG of Inconel 625 alloy was 207. 3 kJ, which suggested that the GG of Inconel 625 alloy was controlled by the process of GB diffusion.

In recent years its usage has increased dramatically because of the improvement of people's living standard and the emphasis on health. Such demands have resulted in over-harvesting of this fungus in the wild. Fortunately, scientists have demonstrated that artificially cultured and fermented mycelial products of O. sinensis have similar pharmacological activities to wild O. sinensis. The availability of laboratory cultures will likely to further expand its usage for the treatment of various illnesses. In this review, we summarize recent results on the pharmacological activities of the components of O. sinensis and their putative mechanisms of actions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Soil erosion in the YP is recognized as a major environmental problem. Rainfall is abundant in the YP but distributed unevenly on a spatiotemporal scale. However, little published work is available on rainfall erosivity (R factor) in the YP, an important basic parameter for representing the potential ability of precipitation and runoff to erode soil in the Universal Soil Loss Equation. This study integrates the trend coefficient and climate tendency rate indicators and Mann-Kendall nonparametric statistical test to identify the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the R factor in the YP. The daily rainfall records from 1960 to 2012 in the YP were collected from 115 national meteorological observatory stations. The result shows that the average annual R factor was 4382.65 MJ. mm . ha(-1). h(-1) in the YP, and >80% of the annual R was concentrated in the summer and autumn. The spatial distribution of annual, summer and autumn R was greater in the south than in the north while the northwest surpassed other regions for winter and spring R factor. There was significant variability in temporal trends from station to station, in general, the annual and autumn R showed a distribution pattern of an increase in the western YP and a reduction in the eastern YP. The temporal variance of winter R showed a pattern opposite of that of annual and autumn R, indicating an increase in the eastern YP and a reduction in the western YP over recent decades.

In this paper, we present two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) diamond-shaped transient thermal cloaks with non-singular homogeneous material parameters. The absence of singularity in the parameters results from the fact that the linear coordinate transformation is performed by expanding a line segment rather than a point into a region, while the mechanism behind the homogeneity is the homogeneous stretching and compression along orthogonal directions during the transformation. Although the derived parameters remain anisotropic, we further show that this can be circumvented by considering a layered structure composed of only four types of isotropic materials based on the effective medium theory. Numerical simulation results confirm the good performance of the proposed cloaks.

If the interest is in the dose-response relationship over a range of ED levels, the existing optimal designs is misaligned. In this paper, we propose a two-stage sequential ED-design for this purpose. We use a small number of trials to provide a tentative estimation of the parameters. The dose levels of the subsequent trials are then selected sequentially, based on the latest model information, to maximize the efficiency of the ED estimation over several ED levels. Simulations indicate that the proposed design compares favorably with existing designs under various scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we demonstrate that nonradiative recombination rate of intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) exciton at organic heterojunction increases exponentially with decreasing energy difference between the LUMO of acceptor and the HOMO of donor. In addition, the effect of orbital overlap between the acceptor LUMOs and donor HOMOs on nonradiative recombination is studied using a wide bandgap organic spacer layer. It is found that the rate for nonradiative CT exciton recombination decreases exponentially as the donor,-acceptor separation distance increases. Nonradiative CT exciton recombination is an important consideration in selecting materials for organic devices such as organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and so on.

Our model showed that the effect of the selfing rate on the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) reproductive allocation depends on three parameters: (1) the self-fertilized juvenile relative survivorship (SFJRS), (2) the self-fertilized adult relative survivorship (SFARS) and (3) the growth rate of self-fertilized adult, where the SFJRS is the survivorship of self-fertilized juveniles divided by the survivorship of outcrossed juveniles, and likewise for the SFARS. However, the ESS sex allocation decreases as the selfing rate increases. This relationship seems independent of the SFJRS, the SFARS, and the growth rate of self-fertilized adults. Additionally, our model showed that the complete outcrossing is an ESS when the fraction of juvenile inbreeding depression (FJID) is less than 1/2 - tau, where t is the self-fertilized adults mortality rate caused by ID. In contrast, the complete selfing also acts as an ESS when the FJID is greater than 1/2 - tau. These results could explain the diversity of mating strategies and related resource allocations for plants.

However, whether endophytes have a role in metabolites shaping of grape has not been fully understood. Eight endophytic fungal strains which originally isolated from grapevines were re-inoculated to field-grown grapevines in this study, and their effects on both leaves and berries of grapevines at maturity stage were assessed, with special focused on secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities. High-density inoculation of all these endophytic fungal strains modified the physio-chemical status of grapevine to different degrees. Fungal inoculations promoted the content of reducing sugar (RS), total flavonoids (TF), total phenols (TPh), trans-resveratrol (Res) and activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), in both leaves and berries of grapevine. Inoculation of endophytic fungal strains, CXB-11 (Nigrospora sp.) and CXC-13 (Fusarium sp.) conferred greater promotion effects in grape metabolic re-shaping, compared to other used fungal strains. Additionally, inoculation of different strains of fungal endophytes led to establish different metabolites patterns of wine grape. The work implies the possibility of using endophytic fungi as fine-tuning regulator to shape the quality and character of wine grape.

J	Liu, L; Tang, L; Dong, W; Yao, SW; Zhou, W				Liu, Lin; Tang, Lin; Dong, Wen; Yao, Shaowen; Zhou, Wei			An overview of topic modeling and its current applications in bioinformatics	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Review						Topic model; Bioinformatics; Probabilistic generative model; Clustering; Classification		Background: With the rapid accumulation of biological datasets, machine learning methods designed to automate data analysis are urgently needed. In recent years, socalled topic models that originated from the field of natural language processing have been receiving much attention in bioinformatics because of their interpretability. Our aim was to review the application and development of topic models for bioinformatics. Description: This paper starts with the description of a topic model, with a focus on the understanding of topic modeling. A general outline is provided on how to build an application in a topic model and how to develop a topic model. Meanwhile, the literature on application of topic models to biological data was searched and analyzed in depth. According to the types of models and the analogy between the concept of document-topic-word and a biological object (as well as the tasks of a topic model), we categorized the related studies and provided an outlook on the use of topic models for the development of bioinformatics applications. Conclusion: Topic modeling is a useful method (in contrast to the traditional means of data reduction in bioinformatics) and enhances researchers' ability to interpret biological information. Nevertheless, due to the lack of topic models optimized for specific biological data, the studies on topic modeling in biological data still have a long and challenging road ahead. We believe that topic models are a promising method for various applications in bioinformatics research.

In this study, an inexpensive 3D electrode of Ni3S2@Ni foam was obtained through a hydrothermal condition using sodium sulfide as corrodent and Ni foam as both substrate and Ni source. The formation mechanism of this Ni3S2 layer was studied through a process analysis based on physical chemistry with assistant of the results from characterizations. The obtained Ni3S2@Ni foam was used as electrode to test its hydrazine electro-oxidation properties in terms of DHFCs and electrochemical sensor. It is found Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses the ability to electro-oxidize hydrazine and Ni3S2 layer leads to increased activity including lower onset potential and higher current. In the aspect of hydrazine electrochemical sensor, the fabricated Ni3S2 layer leads to increased sensitivity and dynamic response property. The results indicate that as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses a potential for practical application in hydrazine electro-oxidation, and Ni3S2 is a very promising substitute material for noble metals in hydrazine electro-oxidation. At the same time, with the characterization of the as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam electrode on structure, morphology and surface chemical states, the mechanism of the corrosion method as well as enhanced properties were investigated.

Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that ynones can be harnessed as Michael donors for use in catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reactions by strategically introducing a CO2,t-Bu group as a multitasking directing group. Furthermore, this concept has enabled designer ynones as versatile synthetic equivalents of both alpha' anions of ynones and gamma monoanions of 1,3-diketones, which are synthetically valued but difficult to generate. The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of ynones as Michael donors has been realized in good yields with high enantioselectivities. A unified approach to regiospecifically and chemo- and enantioselectively access hitherto elusive gamma-Michael adducts of 1,3-diketones has been achieved in a divergent manner. The strategy described here by exploring new reactivity and creating new reagents holds great potential applications in other still unsolved transformations.

The results show that AT exhibits a moderate inhibitive effect, and DHP has a poor effect. However, incorporation AT with DHP significantly improves the inhibitive performance, and yields synergism. The adsorption of AT in the absence and presence of DHP obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. AT/DHP mixture acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. The combined AT and DHP molecules co-adsorb on the Fe (001) surface in the nearly flat manner, and the adsorption energy is larger than individual AT or DHP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A multi-layered Pt0.5Ti0.2Zr/Ti laminate composite was prepared by hot pressing and rolling using foils of Pt0.5Ti0.2Zr micro-alloy and Ti. The effect of the pressing and rolling temperatures on the tensile properties and microstructures of the composite was studied. The results showed that the compaction temperature of the composite stack should not be very high, because at high temperatures, metal compounds are formed at the layer interfaces, which adversely affect the mechanical properties and structure of the composite. It was also observed that the micro-alloying method effectively improves the layer continuity and the straightness and uniformity of the laminated structures. The composites manufactured by hot pressing and large deformation rolling at 500 degrees C exhibit excellent tensile properties and a good microstructure. The mechanical performance of the composites is significantly improved with respect to that of pure platinum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Upon the presence of aconitine to the performed SCX8-SWCNHs . MB complex, the MB molecules are displaced by aconitine. This results in a decreased oxidation peak current of MB and the appearance of an oxidation peak of aconitine, and the changes of these signals correlate linearly with the concentration of aconitine. A linear response range of 1.00-10.00 mu M for aconitine with a low detection limit of 0.18 mu M (S/N=3) was obtained by using the proposed method. This method could be successfully utilized to detect aconitine in serum samples. This dual-signalling sensor can provide more sensitive target recognition and will have important applications in the sensitive and selective electrochemical detection of aconitine.

Functional, cheap and easy-prepared Mg2AlNixHzOy nano-oxyhydrides materials were successfully developed from Mg2AlNixOy nano-composites exhydrotalcites. After an in situ treatment in H-2 at low temperature (450 degrees C), the Mg2AlNixHzOy nano-composites (x > 1) become hydrogen reservoirs, called oxyhydrides, with the presence of hydrogen species of hydride nature that can be stored in the anionic vacancies of the solid. Advanced techniques in presence of H-2 including TPR, in situ XRD and INS were used to study the nano-composites with different Ni contents. The Mg2AlNixHzOy nano-oxyhydrides (x > 1) are shown to be able to simultaneously provide hydride species and to totally convert ethanol and produce H-2 from a water-ethanol mixture in presence of O-2, with very low energy input. In complement to the exothermic partial oxidation reaction, the chemical energy delivered from the strong exothermic reaction between hydride species and O-2 is used. The reaction is sustainable because hydride species are replaced and provided by ethanol. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about whether biogeography affects distributional pattern of Streptomyces in salty environments. Such information is essential for understanding the ecology of Streptomyces. Here we analyzed four house-keeping genes (16S rRNA, rpoB, recA and atpD) and salty-tolerance related genes (ectA-ectD) of 38 Streptomyces strains isolated from saline environments in Yunnan and Xinjiang Provinces of western China. The obtained Streptomyces strains were classified into three operational taxonomic units, each comprising habitat-specific geno-and ecotype STs. In combination with expressional variations of salty-tolerance related genes, the statistical analyses showed that spatial distance and environmental factors substantially influenced Streptomyces distribution in saline environments: the former had stronger influence at large spatial scales (> 700 km), whereas the latter was influential at large (> 700 km) and small spatial scales (< 700 km). Plus, the quantitative analyses of salty-tolerence related genes (ectA-D) indicated that Streptomyces strains from salt lakes have higher expression of ectA-D genes and could accumulate larger quantities of ectoine and hydroxyectoine than strains from salt mines, which could help them resist to salinity in the hypersaline environments.

To address this problem, many representative works have been reported, including transductive SVM, universum SVM, co-training and graph-based methods. The prominent method is the patch alignment framework, which unifies the traditional spectral analysis methods. In this paper, we propose Hessian regression based on the patch alignment framework. In particular, we construct a Hessian using the patch alignment framework and apply it to regression problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on Hessian construction from the patch alignment viewpoint. Compared with the traditional Laplacian regularization, Hessian can better match the data and then leverage the performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct human face recognition experiments on a celebrity face dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution in human face classification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The efficiency of perovskite-based mesoscopic solar cells increases rapidly, from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.1% in 2016. N-type metal-oxide electron transport layer, as one of the important components in mesoscopic PSCs (MPSCs), acts as not only a scaffold layer for the growth of perovskite crystals, but also a layer to supply transfer pathways for electrons injected from perovskites. In this review, we discussed recent published reports of MPSCs with the focus on n-type metal-oxide electron transport layer in MPSCs. The scaffold materials, scaffold nanostructure, and scaffold/perovskite interface engineering are considered, and the effects of these modifications of scaffolds on the performance of MPSCs are summarized in this review.

By explicitly deriving and solving the equation of motion of super-horizon mode, we fully determine the evolution of thermal perturbation of dark matter in a generic bouncing background. And we also show that the evolution of super-horizon modes is stable and will not ruin the background evolution of a generic bouncing universe till the Planck scale. Given no super-horizon thermal perturbation of dark matter appears in standard inflation scenario such as WIMP(-less) miracles, such super-horizon thermal perturbation of dark matter generated during the generic bouncing universe scenario may be significant for testing and distinguishing these two scenario in near future.

Solute Migration from the Aquifer Matrix into a Solution Conduit and the Reverse	GROUNDWATER			English	Article							TRACER TESTS; TRANSPORT; MODEL; FLOW; EXCHANGE; WATER	A solution conduit has a permeable wall allowing for water exchange and solute transfer between the conduit and its surrounding aquifer matrix. In this paper, we use Laplace Transform to solve a one-dimensional equation constructed using the Euler approach to describe advective transport of solute in a conduit, a production-value problem. Both nonuniform cross-section of the conduit and nonuniform seepage at the conduit wall are considered in the solution. Physical analysis using the Lagrangian approach and a lumping method is performed to verify the solution. Two-way transfer between conduit water and matrix water is also investigated by using the solution for the production-value problem as a first-order approximation. The approximate solution agrees well with the exact solution if dimensionless travel time in the conduit is an order of magnitude smaller than unity. Our analytical solution is based on the assumption that the spatial and/or temporal heterogeneity in the wall solute flux is the dominant factor in the spreading of spring-breakthrough curves, and conduit dispersion is only a secondary mechanism. Such an approach can lead to the better understanding of water exchange and solute transfer between conduits and aquifer matrix. Highlights: 1. Euler and Lagrangian approaches are used to solve transport in conduit. 2. Two-way transfer between conduit and matrix is investigated. 3. The solution is applicable to transport in conduit of persisting solute from matrix.

Spoof surface whispering-gallery mode supported by two concentrically coupled textured ring resonators	EPL			English	Article							METAMATERIAL; PLASMONS	The Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) is very useful for sensing applications due to the exposure of an evanescent field. In a previous work we have shown that a surface WGM can be excited at the exterior of a negative-permittivity or -permeability material layer attached to a dielectric microresonator, which can amplify the evanescent field and then further advance the sensitivity. In this paper a wheel-shaped resonator which consists of two concentrically coupled textured rings is designed to generate the surface WGM and a sensor prototype is fabricated. The results show that the coupling gap between the two textured rings has provided a new freedom to manipulate the resonant characteristic and field confinement effect. Since most energies are concentrated in the vicinity of the gap, this region is quite sensitive to a slight change in the sample substance. Experimental results at the microwave frequencies are consistent with simulation and verify the performances of the sensor. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2016	[Yang, J. J.; Li, X. M.; Tang, Y. X.; Lu, Q.

Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain YIM 7505(T) was closely related to Flexivirga alba NBRC 107580(T) (98.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and formed a robust clade with F. alba NBRC 107580(T) in the neighbour-joining tree. Optimum growth of strain YIM 7505(T) was observed at 28-35 degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 0-3.0% NaCl (w/v). The chemotaxonomic profiles of the strain comprised of anteiso-C-16 : 0 as the major cellular fatty acid and MK-8(H4) as the respiratory menaquinone. The peptidoglycan of strain YIM 7505(T) contained serine, alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and lysine. The polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, six unidentified phospholipids, four unidentified glycolipids, an unidentified aminolipid and an unidentified aminophospholipid. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA of strain YIM 7505(T) was 66.7 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridizations of strain YIM 7505(T) with F. alba NBRC 107580(T) gave relatedness values of 50.6 +/- 2.2 %.

The transition from these early forebears to the modern onychophoran body plan is poorly constrained, in part owing to the absence of fossils preserving details of the soft anatomy. Here, we report muscle tissue in a new early Cambrian (Stage 3) lobopodian, Tritonychus phanerosarkus gen. et sp. nov., preserved in the Orsten fashion by three-dimensional replication in phosphate. This first report of Palaeozoic onychophoran musculature establishes peripheral musculature as a characteristic of the ancestral panarthropod, but documents an unexpected muscular configuration. Phylogenetic analysis reconstructs T. phanerosarkus as one of a few members of the main onychophoran lineage which was as rare and as cryptic in the Cambrian period as it is today.

The Ulantatal fauna was originally considered to be the representative fauna for the Chinese Land mammalian Age, Ulantatalian. However, the abundant fossils collected in the 1980s lack coordinates and/or detailed stratigraphic levels, and have been lumped together as either single, coeval fauna or grouped into three units. This lack of stratigraphic information hampers more precise biostratigraphic division and correlation of the faunas. Here we present a complete lithostratigraphic profile of the Ulantatal Formation with new fossil localities calibrated into the profile. Lithologically, the sequence shows a rather uniform pattern characterized by interbedded reddish to yellowish brown claystones and siltstones, with minor fine-grained sandstones. Preliminary biostratigraphic analysis shows that the Ulantatal Formation covers most of the Oligocene, and offers a long sequence and successive fossil records for understanding the evolution of mammal faunas after the critical Eocene/Oligocene transition.

We study the problem of functional parameter estimation in a VCPFLM. The functional parameter is approximated by a polynomial spline, and the spline coefficients are estimated by the ordinary least squares method. Under some regular conditions, we obtain asymptotic properties of functional parameter estimators, including the global convergence rates and uniform convergence rates. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodologies.

The nano columns of CuPc have been prepared on different substrates via template-free physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The growth mechanism of CuPc nano column on quartz was explored and the same condition used on other substrates including glass, sapphire (C-plane < 0001 >, M-plane < 10 (1) over bar0 >, R-plane < 1 (1) over bar 02 >), Si and SiO2/Si came to a same conclusion, which confirmed that the aligned growth of CuPc nano column is not substrate-dependent. And then the CuPc nano column with special morphology was integrated as in-situ sensor device which exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity towards Cl-2 at room temperature with a minimum detection limit as low as 0.08 ppm. The response of sensor was found to increase linearly (26 similar to 659%) with the increase for Cl-2 within concentration range (0.08 similar to 4.0ppm). These results clearly demonstrate the great potential of the nano column growth and device integration approach for sensor device. (C) 2016 Author(s).

A significant reduction of light rain, accompanied by an increase of visibility and a decrease of AOD, was observed. Thus, the observed light rain reduction in Tengchong was not associated with an increase of aerosols. The main cause of the reduction in light rain was the decrease of relative humidity in the layer between 850 to 500 hPa, which was induced mainly by the increase of temperature. This counterexample indicates that there are some evidences on the short-term scale, but the depression of light rain by aerosols on the long-term scale remains controversial.

(PE) has been widely consumed as a functional food and folk medicine in Southeast Asia due to its remarkable nutritional and pharmacological effects. Previous research showed PE delays mitotic progress and increases genomic instability (GIN) in human colorectal cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the similar effects of PE by the biomarkers related to spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitotic aberrations and GIN in human NCM460 normal colon epithelial cells. Cells were treated with PE and harvested differently according to the biomarkers observed. Frequencies of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB) and nuclear bud (NB) in cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay were used as indicators of GIN. Mitotic aberrations were assessed by the biomarkers of chromosome misalignment, multipolar division, chromosome lagging and chromatin bridge. SAC activity was determined by anaphase-to- metaphase ratio (AMR) and the expression of core SAC gene budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles related 1 (BubR1). Compared with the control, PE-treated cells showed (1) decreased incidences of MN, NPB and NB (p < 0.01); (2) decreased frequencies of all mitotic aberration biomarkers (p < 0.01); and (3) decreased AMR (p < 0.01) and increased BubR1 expression (p < 0.001). The results revealed PE has the potential to protect human normal colon epithelial cells from mitotic and genomic damages partially by enhancing the function of SAC.

This study aims to separate the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the upper catchment of the Red River Basin in China. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test methods were applied to identify the trends and change points of the hydro-meteorological variables. The hydrological sensitivity, climate elasticity and hydrological simulation methods were adopted to estimate the contributions of climate variability and human activities to runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff significantly decreased by 1.57 mm/year during the period of 1961-2012. A change point in annual runoff coefficient occurred in 2002. Accordingly, the annual runoff series were divided into the baseline period (1961-2002) and the impacted period (2003-2012). Mean annual runoff of the impacted period decreased by 29.13% compared with the baseline period. Similar estimates of the contributions of climate variability and human activities were obtained by the three different methods. Climate variability was estimated to be responsible for 69%-71% of the reduction in annual runoff, and human activities accounted for 29%-31%. Climate variability was the main driving factor for runoff decrease in the catchment.

Strain YIM 100951(T) shows high similarities with Microbacterium barkeri DSM 20145(T) (97.6 %), Microbacterium oryzae MB10(T) (97.3 %), Microbacterium lemovicicum ViU22(T) (97.1 %) and Microbacterium indicum BBH6(T) (97.0 %) based on their 16S rRNA genes. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that strain YIM 100951(T) formed a clade with Microbacterium halotolerans YIM 70130(T)a (96.7 %), Microbacterium populi 10-107-8(T) (96.7 %) and Microbacterium sediminis YLB-01(T) (96.9 %). DNA-DNA hybridization was carried out between strains YIM 100951(T) and M. barkeri DSM 20145(T), the result showed a value of 23.2 +/- 4.5 %. In addition, some of the physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain YIM 100951(T) are different from the closely related strains. Thus, we suggest that strain YIM 100951(T) represents a novel species of the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium gilvum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 100951(T) (=DSM 26235(T) = CCTCC AB 2012971(T)).

It was found that pearlite block size corresponds well to the cleavage facet size, and a single cleavage facet usually contains multiple pearlite colonies. Pearlite block size and cleavage facet size decrease with the refinement of prior austenite grain size, while pearlite colony size only changes slightly. The cleavage crack can largely deflect at block boundaries rather than at colony boundaries. Pearlite block can act as the dominant substructure on cleavage crack propagation in pearlitic steels.

In the pseudo-spectral method, the time-dependent Maxwell equations are solved, both electric and magnetic fields are expanded in terms of the vector spherical harmonic functions in spherical geometry and the divergencelessness of magnetic field is analytically enforced by a projection method. The pulsar magnetospheres in infinite (i.e., force free approximation) and finite conductivities are simulated and a family of solutions that smoothly transition from the Deutsch vacuum solution to the force-free solution are obtained. The sin(2)alpha dependence of the spin-down luminosity on the magnetic inclination angle a in which the full electric current density are taken into account is retrieved in the force-free regime.

When the data set under consideration involves asymmetric outcomes, in the last two decades, the skew normal distribution has been shown beneficial in dealing with asymmetric data in various theoretic and applied problems. In this paper, we propose and study a novel class of models: a skew-normal mixture of joint location, scale and skewness models to analyze the heteroscedastic skew-normal data coming from a heterogeneous population. The issues of maximum likelihood estimation are addressed. In particular, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the model parameters is developed. Properties of the estimators of the regression coefficients are evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments. Results from the analysis of a real data set from the Body Mass Index (BMI) data are presented.

The mass percentage of PEG reached 70 wt% without any leakage above the melting point of PEG. The prepared form-stable PCMs were investigated by scanning election microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarization optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), respectively. SEM and FTIR results show that the PEG is uniformly dispersed into the PPGD network and there are only physical interactions between PEG and PPGD. POM images and XRD patterns reveal that the crystalline structure of PEG is not affected by PPGD network and the crystal size of PEG in form-stable PCMs decreases due to the restriction of PPGD network. DSC analysis results present that the melting and freezing temperatures and the latent heats of form-stable PCM were measured as 58.62 and 37.45 degrees C and 117.41 and 115.17 J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test and TG analysis confirm that the prepared form-stable PCMs exhibit good thermal reliability and stability. The prepared form-stable PCMs have great potential application in the area of solar energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, interaction among phytopathogens-Trichoderma-plant-soil is very complex and needs further investigation. In this study, we report the high salt-tolerant and mycoparasitic properties of endophytic T. koningiopsis YIM PH30002, isolated from the root of 2-year-old healthy Sanqi (Panax notoginseng), and its allelopathic antagonistic activity against phytopathogens associated with the host plant. Trichoderma koningiopsis YIM PH30002 exhibited significant inhibition of the growth of four host root-rot phytopathogens, Phoma herbarum, Fusarium flocciferum, Scytalidium lignicola, and Epicoccum nigrum, by covering the colony of phytopathogens, coiling and twisting the mycelium in a probable mechanism of mycoparasitism, producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In potato dextrose broth (PDB) culture medium, T. koningiopsis YIM PH30002 produced at least ten kinds of volatile substances which were identified as alkanes, monoterpenes and arenes, heterocycles, and aldehydes by GC-MS. The results indicate that YIM PH30002 can exert antagonistic actions by integrated ways to help its host defend diseases, and could be used as a promising candidate for the biological control of P. notoginseng root-rot disease.

Prion protein (PrP) is critical to susceptibility and development of BSE. Moreover, a new PrP-like protein, Shadoo (Sho), has been shown to have overlapping expression patterns and shared functions with PrP. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in expression at the transcriptional level and/or the post-transcriptional level of the two genes may be associated with these specific differences between cattle and buffalo. We compared the relative mRNA expression of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and the Shadoo gene (SPRN) in 396 RNA samples using real-time PCR. We also analyzed PrP/Sho protein from 96 samples by Western blot. Our results demonstrated significantly lower PrP expression in the cerebellum, obex, mesenteric lymph node, and bronchial lymph node tissues, but higher relative expression of Sho in the cerebrum and spleen in buffalos compared with cattles. Although these results support our primary assumption, Sho and PrP expressions did not correlate with corresponding mRNA expression, suggesting that the biological modulations of both PrP and Sho proteins are at post-translational levels. Moreover, positive correlations between PRNP and SPRN were found in cattle and buffalo cerebrum as well as in buffalo obex. Conversely, negative correlations between PrP and Sho were detected in buffalo cerebellum and obex tissues. These findings suggest that additional post-transcriptional studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms behind prion diseases.

However, there are increasing concerns about this application, due mainly to the general toxicity of CuSO4 to other aquatic species and its long-term persistence in the environment. This study reported the isolation and characterization of two natural algicidal compounds, i.e., tryptamine and tryptoline, from Streptomyces eurocidicus JXJ-0089. At a concentration of 5 mu g/ml, both compounds showed higher algicidal efficiencies than CuSO4 on Microcystis sp. FACHB-905 and some other harmful cyanobacterial strains. Tryptamine and tryptoline treatments induced a degradation of chlorophyll and cell walls of cyanobacteria. These two compounds also significantly increased the intracellular oxidant content, i.e., superoxide anion radical (O-2(-)) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but reduced the activity of intracellular reductants, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), of cyanobacteria. Moreover, tryptamine and tryptoline treatments significantly altered the internal and external contents of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a common cyanotoxin. Like CuSO4, tryptamine and tryptoline led to releases of intracellular MC-LR from Microcystis, but with lower rates than CuSO4. Tryptamine and tryptoline (5 mu g/ml) in cyanobacterial cultures were completely degraded within 8 days, while CuSO4 persisted for months. Overall, our results suggest that tryptamine and tryptoline could potentially serve as more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative algicides than CuSO4 in controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) in aquatic environments have become a worldwide problem. Numerous efforts have been made to seek means to prevent, control, and mitigate CyanoHABs. Copper sulfate (CuSO4), was once a common algicide to treat and control CyanoHABs. However, its application has become limited due to concerns about its general toxicity to other aquatic species and its long-term persistence in the environment. There is a great need for algicides with higher specificity and low environmental impacts. This study reports the isolation and characterization of two natural algicidal compounds from a streptomycete strain, Streptomyces eurocidicus JXJ-0089. Our results suggest that the identified algicides could potentially serve as more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative algicides than CuSO4 in controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms.

How to improve the performance of file access becomes a great challenge. This paper first addresses the preconditions of dealing with this problem considering the requirements of applications, hardware, software, and network environments in the cloud. Then, a novel distributed layered cache system named HDCache is proposed. HDCahe is built on the top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Applications can integrate the client library of HDCache to access the multiple cache services. The cache services are built up with three access layers an in-memory cache, a snapshot of the local disk, and a network disk provided by HDFS. The files loaded from HDFS are cached in a shared memory which can be directly accessed by the client library. In order to improve robustness and alleviate workload, the cache services are organized in a peer-to-peer style using a distributed hash table and every cached file has three replicas scattered in different cache service nodes. Experimental results show that HDCache can store files with a wide range in their sizes and has the access performance in a millisecond level under highly concurrent environments. The tested hit ratio obtained from a real-world cloud serviced is higher than 95 %.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in these processes remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the active form of the small G protein Rac1, Rac1-GTP, is involved in fear memory. Firstly, we detected the time course changes of Rac1-GTP after foot shocks (a strong stressor) and exogenous corticosterone (CORT) treatment. The data showed that stress and CORT induced the downregulation of Rac1-GTP in the hippocampus. Changes in the serum CORT level were negatively correlated with the level of Rac1-GTP. Additionally, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU38486, not only recovered the expression of Rac1-GTP but also impaired fear memory. Furthermore, systemic administration of NSC23766, an inhibitor of Rac1-GTP, improved fear memory at 1.5 and 24 h. Therefore, Rac1 activity plays a critical role in stress-related cognition and may be a potential target in stress-related disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, it can be used as a photocatalyst that shows photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. The synthesis procedure and related photocatalytic performance of BiOI have been reported. However, some of its fundamental properties still need to be further investigated. In this article, density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the crystal structure, electronic properties, and optical properties of BiOI. Furthermore, the relationship between the intrinsic properties and the photocatalytic performance of BiOI was investigated. Based on the calculated results of the band structure, density of states, and projected wave function, the molecular-orbital bonding structure of BiOI is proposed. As a semiconductor photocatalyst, BiOI shows slight optical anisotropy in the visible-light region, indicating that it can efficiently absorb visible light if the morphology of BiOI is controlled. After comparing several computational methods, it was found that the generalized-gradient approximation corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA + U) is a suitable computational method for large sized BiOI models (e.g., impurity doping, the surface, and the interface) because it can significantly reduce the computational time while maintaining calculation accuracy. Thus, this article not only provides an in-depth understanding of the fundamental properties of BiOI as a potential efficient photocatalyst driven by visible light, but it also suggests a suitable computational method to investigate these properties.

A combination of physicochemical techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption/desorption measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the as-synthesized samples. The results show that the morphologies of the templates were well replicated in the obtained ceria-zirconia solid solutions. Catalytic oxidation activities of CO over the ceria-zirconia solid solutions were then investigated. The catalyst templated by tobacco stem-silk exhibited higher conversion of CO at lower temperature than that of ceria-zirconia solid solutions templated by tobacco leaves and stems or without templates due to its special morphology. The catalyst even showed similar CO conversion when compared to ceria-zirconia solid solutions doped with 1.0 wt % noble metals such as Pt, Ag and Au. The results highlighted the advantages of using tobacco as biotemplate.

Knowing of the R factor facilitates the prediction of soil erosion and of the impact of climate change on erosion. However, defining of the R factor is challenging because its spatiotemporal variation can be complex. We combined the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), North criteria, and Mann-Kendall test (M-K) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the R factor for a study area in a typical mountain plateau region of Yunnan Province (YP), China. Daily rainfall records from 1960 to 2012 were collected from 115 national meteorological observation stations in YP. Based on the daily rainfall erosivity estimating model, we determined that the average annual R factor was 4383.85 MJ.mm.ha(-1).h(-1), the seasonal R factor exhibited an order of summer > autumn > spring > winter, and the summer R was significantly higher than winter R. The spatiotemporal variation of the R factor was complex and did not reveal a uniform pattern. The spatial distribution revealed that the annual and seasonal R factors in the west were higher than those in the east and R in the south were higher than those in the north. The temporal trends of annual, summer, and autumn R factors had decreasing trends from 1960 to 2012. On the contrary, the spring and winter R factors showed an increasing trend. The EOF analysis identified two typical spatiotemporal patterns of the annual R factor in YP, and three for spring, summer, autumn, and winter R factors. These patterns represented the influence of the monsoon, circulation systems, and complex terrain conditions on the rainfall in the YP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested Darwin's hypothesis of reciprocal selection as a key driving force for the evolution of floral traits of an alpine ginger (Roscoea purpurea) and proboscis length of a tabanid fly (Philoliche longirostris). We documented the pattern of trait variation in R.purpurea and P.longirostris across five populations.At each site, we quantified pollinator-mediated selection on floral display area, inflorescence height and corolla length of R.purpurea by comparing selection gradients for flowers exposed to natural pollination and to supplemental hand pollination. Reciprocal selection between plant and fly was examined at two sites via the relationship between proboscis length and nectar consumption (fly benefit) and corolla length and pollen deposition (plant benefit). Local corolla tube length was correlated with local fly proboscis length among the five sites. We found strong linear selection imposed by pollinators on corolla tube length at all sites, but there was no consistent relationship of fitness to inflorescence height or floral display area. Selection between corolla length and proboscis length was reciprocal at the two experimental sites examined. The geographical pattern of trait variation and the evidence of selection is consistent with a mosaic of local, species-specific reciprocal selection acting as the major driving force for the evolution of corolla length of R.purpurea and proboscis length of P.longirostris.

We define the local patch and assume that there exists a linear transformation between a patch of the target face and the intrinsic embedding of the corresponding patch of the source face. Based on this assumption, we compute the intrinsic embeddings of source patches and align these embeddings to form the result. During the course of alignment, we use a set of motion data as shape regularizer to impel the result to approach the unknown target face. The intrinsic embedding can be computed through both locally linear embedding and local tangent space alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can obtain decent face driving results. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrate its superiority to existing methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we used Typha angustifolia (T. angustifolia) grown in sterile Hoagland nutrient solution to determine the rhizosphere effects on the ability of bacteria in water to reduce HCB levels. The results revealed that T. angustifolia could facilitate HCB degradation and that the initial HCB concentration was the major factor responsible for HCB degradation in nutrient solution. Furthermore, HCB biodegradation in low-HCB nutrient solution with T. angustifolia fitted the first-order kinetics, owing to the high concentration of total organic carbon, low HCB toxicity, and unique bacterial community in the T. angustifolia rhizosphere. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that the rhizosphere effects and different dosages of HCB have significant effects on the bacterial communities by repressing and favoring certain populations. The most successful bacteria to adapt to HCB contamination was Bacillus sp., while the dominant bacterial phyla in HCB-polluted water were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.

However, as a very popular smooth technique in nonparametric/semiparametric regression, polynomial spline method has received little attention in the functional data case. In this paper, we propose the polynomial spline method to estimate a partial functional linear model. Some asymptotic results are established, including asymptotic normality for the parameter vector and the global rate of convergence for the slope function. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our estimation method by some simulation studies.

It was found that substitutional Cd on Ag lattice site (Cd-Ag) contributes to the n-type conductivity of Ag3PO4. For substitutional Cd on P (or O) lattice site (Cd-P) (or Cd-O), it is not expected that Cd will incorporate into the P (or O) site due to the strong covalent interactions in the PO4 structural units. The interstitial Cd (Cd-i) acts as a shallow donor, but its formation energy is relatively high compared with that of Cd-Ag. For the (Cd-Ag-2N(O)) complex, the formation of this inactive complex generates a fully occupied impurity band just above the valence band maximum of Ag3PO4, which significantly reduces the acceptor transition energy level. But the formation energy of the (Cd-Ag-2N(O)) complex is even higher than that of the corresponding single point defect N-O. Unlike Li-P and Li-O which has relatively high formation energy, interstitial Li (Li-i or Li-i(s)) with an appreciable solubility is likely to be the n-type dopant under O-poor condition.

We implemented a 5-year N addition experiment in a Stipa krylovii steppe of Inner Mongolia, northern China. The aboveground biomass (AGB) and species richness were measured annually. Along with the N addition levels, the species richness declined significantly, and the species composition changed noticeably. However, the total AGB did not exhibit a noticeable increase. We found that compensatory effects of the AGB occurred not only between the grasses and the forbs but also among Gramineae species. The plant responses to N addition, from the community to species level, lessened in dry years compared to wet or normal years. The N addition intensified the reduction of community productivity in dry years. Our study indicated that the compensatory effects of the AGB among the species sustained the stability of grassland productivity. However, biodiversity loss resulting from increasing N deposition might lead the semi-arid grassland ecosystem to be unsustainable, especially in dry years.

However, the potential role and function of MSI1 in fleshy fruits remain unknown. In this study, SlMSI1 was cloned and transformed into tomato to explore its function. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that SlMSI1 was highly expressed in flowers and fruits and that its transcript and protein levels were significantly decreased in fruits after the breaker stage. Additionally, SlMSI1-overexpressing transgenic tomatoes displayed abnormal non-ripening fruit formation, whereas its suppression promoted fruit ripening in transgenic tomatoes. Quantitative real-time PCR assays also showed that RIN and its regulons were decreased in SlMSI1 overexpression transgenic tomato fruits. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that SlMSI1 inhibits fruit ripening by negatively regulating a large set of fruit-ripening genes in addition to RIN and its regulons. Finally, genetic manipulation of SlMSI1 and RIN successfully prolonged the fruit shelf life by regulating the fruit-ripening genes in tomato. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory function of SlMSI1 in fruit ripening and provide a new regulator that may be useful for genetic engineering and modification of fruit shelf life.

BiOCl1-xBrx, BiOBr1-xIx, and BiOCl1-xIx solid solutions have very small bowing parameters; as such, some of their properties increase almost linearly with increasing x. For BiOF1-xYx solid solutions, the bowing parameters are very large and it is extremely difficult to fit the related calculated data by a single equation. Consequently, BiOX1-xYx (X, Y = Cl, Br, and I) solid solutions are highly miscible, while BiOF1-xYx (Y = Cl, Br, and I) solid solutions are partially miscible. In other words, BiOF1-xYx solid solutions have miscibility gaps or high miscibility temperature, resulting in phase separation and F/Y inhomogeneity. Comparison and analysis of the calculated results and the related physical-chemical properties with different halogen compositions indicates that the parameters of BiOX1-xYx solid solutions are determined by the differences of the physical-chemical properties of the two halogen compositions. In this way, the large deviation of some BiOX1-xYx solid solutions from Vegard's law observed in experiments can be explained. Moreover, the composition ratio of BiOX1-xYx solid solutions can be measured or monitored using optical measurements.

The evolution behaviors of a radial phased-locked partially coherent flat-topped vortex beam array propagating through non-Kolmogorov medium are studied in detail. It is shown that the evolution behaviors of average intensity depend on beam parameters including the spatial correlation length, the radius of the beam array, as well as the propagation distance. A radial phased-locked partially coherent flat-topped vortex beam array with high coherence evolves more rapidly than that with low coherence.

From numerical simulation of the mean escape time (MET), we conclude that: (i) The increasing number (Np) of stocks in Markowitz portfolio induces a maximum in the curve of MET versus the initial position; (ii) A critical value of Np in the behavior of MET versus the long run variance or amplitude of volatility fluctuations maximumlly enhances the stability of portfolio investment. When Np takes value below the critical value, the increasing Np enhances the stability of portfolio investment, but restrains it when Np takes value above the critical value. In addition, a good agreement of both the MET and probability density functions of returns is found between real data and theoretical results.

An analytical model for the single-mode condition and cutoff frequency of high-order graphene surface plasmon (GSP) modes is presented and verified by finite element method (FEM) simulations. Single-mode operation region of CGPW is identified in the frequency radius space. By varying the separation between two graphene sheets and the Fermi level of graphene, a large tunability of the mode behavior is also demonstrated. The proposed structure may provide a new freedom to manipulate GSPs, and would lead to novel applications in optics.

This study explored the efficiency of using endangered plants and animals as surrogates for identifying PCAs at the county level in Yunnan, southwest China. We ran the Dobson algorithm under three surrogate scenarios at 75% and 100% conservation levels and identified four types of PCAs. Assessment of the protection efficiencies of the four types of PCAs showed that endangered plants had higher surrogacy values than endangered animals but that the two were not substitutable; coupled endangered plants and animals as surrogates yielded a higher surrogacy value than endangered plants or animals as surrogates; the plant-animal priority areas (PAPAs) was the optimal among the four types of PCAs for conserving both endangered plants and animals in Yunnan. PAPAs could well represent overall species diversity distribution patterns and overlap with critical biogeographical regions in Yunnan. Fourteen priority units in PAPAs should be urgently considered as optimizing Yunnan's protected area system. The spatial pattern of PAPAs at the 100% conservation level could be conceptualized into three connected conservation belts, providing a valuable reference for optimizing the layout of the in situ protected area system in Yunnan.

In this work, the high performance UV photodetectors have been realized by utilizing organic/inorganic heterojunctions based on a ZnO nanoflakes/poly (N-vinylcarbazole) hybrid. A transparent conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)-coated quartz substrate is employed as the anode in replacement of the commonly ITO-coated glass in order to harvest shorter UV light. The devices show a lower dark current density, with a high responsivity (R) of 7.27 x 10(3) A/W and a specific detectivity (D*) of 6.20 x 10(13) cm Hz(1/2) /W-1 at 2V bias voltage in ambient environment (1.30 mW/cm(2) at lambda = 365 nm), resulting in the enhancements in R and D* by 49% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The study sheds light on developing high-performance, large scale-array, flexible UV detectors using the solution processable method. Published by AIP Publishing.

Three dyes (ST, RhB, BRB) and aconitine were selected as the probe and target molecules, respectively. The formation of SCX8-RGO . ST, SCX8-RGO . RhB, and SCX8-RGO . BRB complexes greatly decreases the fluorescence emission of ST, RhB, and BRB. The aconitine/SCX8 complex possesses a higher binding constant than ST/SCX8, RhB/SCX8, and BRB/SCX8 complexes, thus the dye in the SCX8 cavity can be replaced by aconitine to revert the fluorescence emission of SCX8-RGO . dye, leading to a "switch-on" fluorescence response. The fluorescence intensity of SCX8-RGO . ST, SCX8-RGO . RhB, and SCX8-RGO . BRB complexes increased linearly with increasing concentration of aconitine ranging from 1.0 to 14.0 mu M, 2.0-16.0 mu M, and 1.0-16.0 mu M respectively. Based on the competitive host-guest interaction, the proposed detection method for aconitine showed detection limits of 0.28 mu M, 0.60 mu M, and 0.37 mu M, respectively, and was successfully applied for the determination of aconitine in human serum samples with good recoveries from 95.1% to 104.8%. The proposed method showed high selectivity for aconitine beyond competitive binding analytes.

The crystal structure, morphology and microwave absorption properties in X and Ku band of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a vector network analyzer. The results show that the three-dimensional (3D) hollow microspheres are assembled by ultra thin and narrow one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons. A rational process for the formation of hollow microspheres is proposed. The 3D MnO2 hollow microspheres possess improved dielectric and magnetic properties than the 1D nanoribbons prepared by the same procedures with the absence of SiO2 hard templates, which are closely related to their special nanostructures. The MnO2 microspheres also show much better microwave absorption properties in X (8-12 GHz) and Ku (12-18 GHz) microwave band compared with 1D MnO2 nanoribbons. The minimum reflection loss of -40 dB for hollow microsphere can be observed at 14.2 GHz and reflection loss below -10 dB is 3.5 GHz with a thickness of only 4 mm. The possible mechanism for the enhanced microwave absorption properties is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hierarchy of multipartite nonlocality in the nonsignaling scenario	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT; K-SEPARABILITY; BELLS THEOREM; STATES; COMMUNICATION; SYSTEMS	We propose a hierarchy of Bell-type inequalities for arbitrary n-partite systems that identifies the different degrees of nonlocality ranging from standard to genuine multipartite nonlocality. After introducing the definition of nonsignaling m locality, we show that the observed joint probabilities in any nonsignaling m-local realistic models should satisfy the (m - 1)th Bell-type inequality. When m = 2, the corresponding inequality reduces to the one shown earlier [Q. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 140404 (2014)] whose violation indicates genuine multipartite nonlocality, and when m = n, the corresponding inequality is just Hardy's inequality whose violation indicates standard multipartite nonlocality. Furthermore, several examples are provided to demonstrate their hierarchy of multipartite nonlocality.

Although the role of bacteria in the formation of pigment and caries in primary dentition is important, their basic features still remain a further mystery. Methods: Using targeted sequencing of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, we obtained a dataset consisting of 831,381 sequences from 111 saliva samples and 110 supragingival plaque samples from 40 patients with pigment (black extrinsic stain), 20 with caries (obvious decay), and 25 with both pigment and caries and from 26 healthy individuals. We applied a Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM)-based community typing approach to investigate oral microbial community types. Results: Our results revealed significant structural segregation of microbial communities, as indicated by the identification of two plaque community types (A and B) and three saliva community types (C-E). We found that the independent occurrence of the two plaque community types, A and B, was potentially associated with our oral diseases of interest. For type A, three co-occurring bacterial genus pairs could separately play a potential role in the formation of pigment (Leptotrichia and Fusobacterium), caries (unclassified Gemellales and Granulicatella), and mixed caries and pigment (Streptococcus and Mogibacterium). For type B, three co-occurring bacterial genera (unclassified Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium) were related to mixed pigment and caries. Three dominant bacterial genera (Selenomonas, Gemella, and Streptobacillus) were linked to the presence of caries. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that plaque-associated oral microbial communities could majorly contribute to the formation of pigment and caries in primary dentition and suggests potential clinical applications of monitoring oral microbiota as an indicator for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

It is re-activated during lung tumorigenesis and is essential for lung cancer cell proliferation. Signalling pathways/molecules that control WDR77 gene expression are unknown. Promoter mapping, gel shift assay and ChIP revealed that the WDR77 promoter contains bona fide response elements for E2F and GATA transcriptional factors as demonstrated in prostate cancer, lung cancer and erythroid cells, as well as in mouse lung tissues. The WDR77 promoter is transactivated by E2F1, E2F3, GATA1 and GATA6, but suppressed by E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 in prostate cancer PC3 cells. WDR77 expression is associated with E2F1, E2F3, GATA2 and GATA6 occupancy on the WDR77 gene, whereas, in contrast, E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 occupancy is associated with the loss of WDR77 expression during erythroid maturation and lung development. More importantly, the loss of WDR77 expression that results from E2F and GATA switches is required for cellular differentiation of erythroid and lung epithelial cells. In contrast, lung cancer cells avoid post-mitotic differentiation by sustaining WDR77 expression. Altogether, the present study provides a novel molecular mechanism by which WDR77 is regulated during erythroid and lung development and lung tumorigenesis.

This paper presents a geographic information system (GIS) add-in for automated measurement of dune migration directions and migration rates using multi-temporal, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data or other sources. Using the angle of repose (AOR) as a sensitive movement indicator of barchan (crescent-shaped) and transverse dunes, an add-in toolbar for ArcGIS was developed using the Python programming language to automatically detect, measure, and store dune migration direction and migration rate at random point locations on dune slip face centerlines. Pseudo-code and application samples from the White Sands dune field in New Mexico, USA, are also presented. The free add-in can be used by the geoscience community for studying coastal and desert sand dunes.

Multiple current reversals and giant vibrational resonance in a high-frequency modulated periodic device	EPL			English	Article							STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; THERMAL RATCHETS; OPTICAL LATTICES; COLD ATOMS; TRANSPORT	A deterministic optical rocking ratchet driven by both high- and low-frequency signals is investigated. First, the phenomenon of multiple current reversals is observed by tuning the amplitude of the high-frequency forcing. Additionally, the giant vibrational resonance arises where the amplitude of the weak low-frequency signal is amplified by several orders of magnitude.

More precisely, we study a new problem defined as follows: a weighted graph G = (V, E; w), a tree-form structure S and some pieces of specific material with length L, where a length function w : E -> Q(+), satisfying w(u, v) <= L for each edge uv in G, we are asked how to construct a required tree-form structure S as a subgraph G' of G such that each edge needed in G' is constructed by a part of a piece of such a specific material, the new objective is to minimize the number of necessary pieces of such a specific material to construct all edges in G'. For this new objective defined, we obtain three results: (1) We present a 3/2-approximation algorithm to construct a spanning tree of G; (2) We design a 3/2-approximation algorithm to construct a single-source shortest paths tree of G; (3) We provide a 4-approximation algorithms to construct a metric Steiner tree of G.

Assessing current genetic status of the Hainan gibbon using historical and demographic baselines: implications for conservation management of species of extreme rarity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						bottleneck; conservation genetics; Critically Endangered; ghost alleles; Nomascus hainanus	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; BLACK-CRESTED GIBBON; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; NONINVASIVE SAMPLES; MAURITIUS PARAKEET; NATURE-RESERVE; F-STATISTICS	Evidence-based conservation planning is crucial for informing management decisions for species of extreme rarity, but collection of robust data on genetic status or other parameters can be extremely challenging for such species. The Hainan gibbon, possibly the world's rarest mammal, consists of a single population of similar to 25 individuals restricted to one protected area on Hainan Island, China, and has persisted for over 30years at exceptionally low population size. Analysis of genotypes at 11 microsatellite loci from faecal samples for 36% of the current global population and tissue samples from 62% of existing historical museum specimens demonstrates limited current genetic diversity (Na=2.27, Ar=2.24, H-e=0.43); diversity has declined since the 19th century and even further within the last 30years, representing declines of similar to 30% from historical levels (Na=3.36, Ar=3.29, H-e=0.63). Significant differentiation is seen between current and historical samples (F-ST=0.156, P=0.0315), and the current population exhibits extremely small N-e (current N-e=2.16). There is evidence for both a recent population bottleneck and an earlier bottleneck, with population size already reasonably low by the late 19th century (historical N-e=1162.96). Individuals in the current population are related at the level of half- to full-siblings between social groups, and full-siblings or parent-offspring within a social group, suggesting that inbreeding is likely to increase in the future. The species' current reduced genetic diversity must be considered during conservation planning, particularly for expectations of likely population recovery, indicating that intensive, carefully planned management is essential.

We investigated the effects of a pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks, during which PTE was simultaneously administered in drinking water. Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis, insulin sensitivity, expression of lipogenesis- and gluconeogenesis-associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The lipid accumulation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed. PTE inhibited HFD-induced obesity and significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation, and prevented against liver injury. PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact insulin signal and significantly decreased expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Consistent with this increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PTE enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuated oleic acid-induced steatosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In contrast, PTE inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages. PTE ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance in mice with HFD-induced NASH, presumably by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling.

This process was validated by both solid- and liquid-state fermentations with aporphine alkaloids as substrates. Cytochrome P450 enzymes were confirmed to participate in the catalysis of this biotransformation. 4R-Hydroxyaporphine alkaloids exhibit the same levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and cytotoxic activities as aporphine alkaloids and are considerably more water soluble than aporphine alkaloids, indicating their potential as water-soluble AChE inhibitors and antitumor agents. This paper suggests that C. rogersoniana fermentation can facilitate a novel biotransformation of aporphine alkaloids in S. epigaea to 4R-hydroxyaporphine alkaloids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The accurate CT model on CTCFs showed that minimum temperature of coldest month (TMW) was the overwhelmingly potent factor among the six climate variables. The areas of TMW <-4.05 were suitable habitats of CTCF, and the areas of -1.35 < TMW were non-habitats, where temperate conifer and broad-leaved mixed forests (TCBLFs) were distribute in lower elevation, bordering on the CTCF. Dominant species of Abies, Picea, and Larix in the CTCFs, are more tolerant to winter coldness than Tsuga and broad-leaved trees including deciduous broad-leaved Acer and Betula, evergreen broad-leaved Cyclobalanopsis and Lithocarpus in TCBLFs. Winter coldness may actually limit the cool-side distributions of TCBLFs in the areas between -1.35A degrees C and -4.05A degrees C, and the warm-side distributions of CTCFs may be controlled by competition to the species of TCBLFs. Under future climate scenarios, the vulnerable area, where current potential (suitable + marginal) habitats (80,749 km2) shift to non-habitats, was predicted to decrease to 55.91% (45,053 km2) of the current area. Inferring from the current vegetation distribution pattern, TCBLFs will replace declining CTCFs. Vulnerable areas predicted by models are important in determining priority of ecosystem conservation.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain YIM M12140(T) forms a separate clade within the family Staphylococcaceae. Strain YIM M12140(T) shares high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Macrococcus brunensis DSM 19358(T) (92.9 %). The isolate was found to grow at 0-10 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2-3 %), pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.0) and temperature 5-40 A degrees C (optimum, 28 A degrees C). The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminophospholipid and two unidentified polar lipids. The major cellular fatty acids of the strain were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, -C-17:0, iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-19:0 and C-20:0. The respiratory menaquinones were found to be MK-6 (94 %) and MK-7 (6 %). The cell wall amino acids were found to contain Lys, Ala, Glu, Gly, Asp, Ser and Thr. Whole cell sugars were identified as mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose and xylose. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain YIM M12140(T) was determined to be 42.4 mol %. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain YIM M12140(T) represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Staphylococcaceae, for which the name Abyssicoccus albus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M12140(T) (= DSM 29158(T) = CCTCC AB 2014213(T)).

This array has been operated within the ARGO-YBJ experiment at the high altitude Cosmic Ray Observatory in Yangbajing (Tibet, 4300 m a.s.l.). Due to the tight correlation, between the air shower hadrons and thermal neutrons, this technique can be envisaged as a simple way to estimate the number of high energy hadrons in EAS. Coincident events generated by primary cosmic rays of energies greater than 100 TeV have been selected and analyzed. The EN-detectors have been used to record simultaneously thermal neutrons and the air shower electromagnetic component. The density distributions of both components and the total number of thermal neutrons have been measured. The correlation of these data with the measurements carried out by ARGO-YBJ confirms the excellent performance of the EN-detector. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cells of strain NCCP-1340(T) were observed to be aerobic, rod shaped, catalase and urease positive but H2S production and oxidase negative. Growth was observed at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 20-40 A degrees C (optimum 37 A degrees C). The strain could tolerate 0-8 % NaCl (optimum 2 %, w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain NCCP-1340(T) belongs to the genus Nocardioides and is closely related to Nocardioides iriomotensis JCM 17985(T) (96.8 %), Nocardioides daedukensis KCTC 19601(T) (96.6 %), Nocardioides jensenii KCTC 9134(T) (96.1 %) and Nocardioides daejeonensis KCTC 19772(T) (96.1 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain NCCP-1340(T) with N. iriomotensis JCM 17985(T), N. daedukensis KCTC 19601(T) and N. jensenii KCTC 9134(T) were found to be less than 53 %. The DNA G+C content of strain NCCP-1340(T) was determined to be 71.8 mol %. The affiliation of strain NCCP-1340(T) to the genus Nocardioides was further supported by chemotaxonomic data which showed the presence of MK-8(H-4) as major menaquinone system; iso-C-16:0, C-17:0, C-16:0 10-methyl, iso-C-15:0 and C (15:0) as major cellular fatty acids; and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and unidentified glycolipids and polar lipids in the polar lipids profile. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic amino acid. On the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics and the phylogenetic analyses, strain NCCP-1340(T) can be distinguished from the closely related taxa and thus represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides pakistanensis sp. nov. is proposed with the type strain NCCP-1340(T) (= DSM 29942(T) = JCM 30630(T)).

The genus is estimated to contain 700-800 species distributed on all continents except Antarctica, with highest species diversity in tropical and subtropical regions. The monophyly of Selaginella in this broad sense has rarely been doubted, whereas its intrageneric classification has been notoriously contentious. Previous molecular studies were based on very sparse sampling of Selaginella (up to 62 species) and often used DNA sequence data from one genome. In the present study, DNA sequences of one plastid (rbcL) and one nuclear (ITS) locus from 394 accessions representing approximately 200 species of Selaginella worldwide were used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony methods. The study identifies strongly supported major clades and well resolves relationships among them. Major results include: (i) six deep-level clades are discovered representing the deep splits of Selaginella; and (ii) 20 major clades representing 20 major evolutionary lineages are identified, which differ from one another in molecular, macro-morphological, ecological and spore features, and/or geographical distribution.

Few studies have focused on the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity in this region. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity using the 'soil erosion class' method. The degree of soil erosion was investigated at 44 monitoring sites in typical DHV catchments, and soil physicochemical properties, and corn yield at each site were monitored. The results showed that soil productivity was significantly affected by soil erosion in the DHV. As the degree of soil erosion progressed from 'slight' to 'moderate' to 'severe,' organic matter content decreased 15.29, 18.00, and 27.37 %, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen-0.06, 6.03, and 9.45 %, and available potassium content-7.07, 41.79, and 43.32 %, respectively. Compared with the 'no' erosion site, the decreases in the mean corn seed yields were 1.56 % for 'slight,' 29.18 % for 'moderate,' and 35.03 % for 'severe' erosion. These results indicated that once the erosion reached 'moderate' levels, significant reductions in soil productivity were present. The declining slope of corn seed yields was 0.13 Mg ha(-1) cm(-1) of topsoil loss. The estimated mean for the absolute corn loss was 0.01 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the DHV. These results increased the understanding of the mechanism of soil degradation processes in the DHV and will be instrumental in developing a strategy for ecological restoration.

Potentiodynamic polarization researches show that single bromide ion or the complex of bromide ion and PAN acts as a mixed-type inhibitor and do not change the mechanism of either hydrogen evolution reaction or metal dissolution. The charge transfer process controls the corrosion reaction. The studies reveal that the complex of bromide ion and PAN shows a quite well inhibition and their synergistic effect was observed and discussed. The adsorption of the inhibitors on the steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters such as adsorptive equilibrium constant (K-ads), adsorption free energy (Delta G degrees(ads)) adsorption heat (Delta H degrees(ads)) and adsorption entropy (Delta S degrees(ads)), kinetic data such as apparent activation energy (E-a) and pre-exponential factor (A) were calculated and discussed. The values of Delta G degrees(ads) indicate that the adsorption of the inhibitors on the mild steel surface in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution is a mixed physical and chemical adsorption mechanism and the chemical adsorption is the dominant in the presence of bromide ion and PAN together.

Rhinopithecus bieti, Rhinopithecus roxellana, and Rhinopithecus strykeri inhabit high-altitude habitats, whereas Rhinopithecus brelichi and Rhinopithecus avunculus inhabit lowland regions. We report the de novo whole-genome sequence of R. bieti and genomic sequences for the four other species. Eight shared substitutions were found in six genes related to lung function, DNA repair, and angiogenesis in the high-altitude snub-nosed monkeys. Functional assays showed that the high-altitude variant of CDT1 ( Ala537Val) renders cells more resistant to UV irradiation, and the high-altitude variants of RNASE4 ( Asn89Lys and Thr128Ile) confer enhanced ability to induce endothelial tube formation in vitro. Genomic scans in the R. bieti and R. roxellana populations identified signatures of selection between and within populations at genes involved in functions relevant to high-altitude adaptation. These results provide valuable insights into the adaptation to high altitude in the snub-nosed monkeys.

Due to the lack of stable loss-of-function Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants deficient in all three CBF genes, it is still unclear whether the CBF genes are essential for freezing tolerance and whether they may have other functions besides cold acclimation. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate cbf single, double, and triple mutants. Compared to the wild type, the cbf triple mutants are extremely sensitive to freezing after cold acclimation, demonstrating that the three CBF genes are essential for cold acclimation. Our results show that the three CBF genes also contribute to basal freezing tolerance. Unexpectedly, we found that the cbf triple mutants are defective in seedling development and salt stress tolerance. Transcript profiling revealed that the CBF genes regulate 414 cold-responsive (COR) genes, of which 346 are CBF-activated genes and 68 are CBF-repressed genes. The analysis suggested that CBF proteins are extensively involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell wall modification, and gene transcription. Interestingly, like the triple mutants, cbf2 cbf3 double mutants are more sensitive to freezing after cold acclimation compared to the wild type, but cbf1 cbf3 double mutants are more resistant, suggesting that CBF2 is more important than CBF1 and CBF3 in cold acclimation-dependent freezing tolerance. Our results not only demonstrate that the three CBF genes together are required for cold acclimation and freezing tolerance, but also reveal that they are important for salt tolerance and seedling development.

The effects of contact time, Acorga M5640 concentration, modifier concentration, total ammonia concentration, and phase ratio on the extraction and separation of both metals were determined. The addition of TRPO into Acorga M5640 organic phase exerted antagonistic effects on copper and nickel extractions. The antagonistic effect of the extractant mixture was significantly stronger on the extraction of nickel than on that of copper. More than 99.96% of copper and less than 6.6% of nickel were extracted using a mixture of 10 vol.% Acorga M5640 and 2 vol.% TRPO in kerosene from an ammoniacal solution initially containing 3.0 g/L each of copper and nickel under optimal extraction conditions.

The correlation between the most significant parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, as well as adsorption capacities was optimized, and the effects of these parameters on the removal efficiency of phosphates were investigated. Surface functionalization of magnetic hollow materials is a well-designed way to bridge the gap between high adsorption activity, excellent separation and recovery of phosphates from the water treatment system.

Direct growth of Ge quantum dots on a graphene/SiO2/Si structure using ion beam sputtering deposition	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ion beam sputtering deposition; charges transfer; Ge QDs/graphene; first-principles calculations	THIN FILM CONDENSATION; GERMANIUM PHOTODETECTOR; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; TEMPERATURE; INSULATOR; SILICON	The growth of Ge quantum dots (QDs) using the ion beam sputtering deposition technique has been successfully conducted directly on single-layer graphene supported by SiO2/ Si substrate. The results show that the morphology and size of Ge QDs on graphene can be modulated by tuning the Ge coverage. Charge transfer behavior, i.e. doping effect in graphene has been demonstrated at the interface of Ge/graphene. Compared with that of traditional Ge dots grown on Si substrate, the positions of both corresponding photoluminescence (PL) peaks of Ge QDs/graphene hybrid structure undergo a large red-shift, which can probably be attributed to the lack of atomic intermixing and the existence of surface states in this hybrid material. According to first-principles calculations, the Ge growth on the graphene should follow the so-called Volmer-Weber mode instead of the Stranski-Krastanow one which is observed generally in the traditional Ge QDs/Si system. The calculations also suggest that the interaction between Ge and graphene layer can be enhanced with the decrease of the Ge coverage. Our results may supply a prototype for fabricating novel optoelectronic devices based on a QDs/graphene hybrid nanostructure.	[Zhang, Z.; Wang, R. F.; Zhang, J.; Li, H.

Usually, traditional face recognition algorithms have considerable discriminant ability; however, when there are some samples that are easy to confuse in the face database, the discriminant ability of traditional face recognition algorithms will inevitably decrease. In this paper, based on the patch alignment framework (PAF) and Cauchy estimator theory, we proposed a novelty subspace learning algorithm for face recognition named Cauchy estimator discriminant analysis (CEDA). Under the framework of PAF, both local and global geometries of the input samples are preserved; by using the Cauchy estimator, large errors caused by samples that are easy to confuse could be overcome. We conducted the experiments on three face databases and strongly illustrated the effectiveness of CEDA for face recognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changing the substituent at pyrimidine unit in these emitters can finely tune their emissive characteristics, thermal properties, and energy gaps between the singlet and triplet states while maintaining frontier molecular orbital levels, and thereby optimizing their optoelectronic properties. Employing these TADF emitters results in a green fluorescent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) that exhibits a peak forward-viewing external quantum efficiency (EQE) close to 25% and a slow efficiency roll-off characteristic at high luminance.

For these systems, satisfying complex multi-dimensional queries means scanning the whole dataset, which is inefficient. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional index framework, based on the Skip-list and Octree, which we refer to as Skip-Octree. Using a randomized skip list makes the hierarchical Octree structure easier to implement in a cloud storage system. To support the Skip-Octree, we also propose a series of index operation algorithms including range query algorithm, index maintenance algorithms, and dynamic index scaling algorithms. Through experimental evaluation, we show that the Skip-Octree index is feasible and efficient.

The effect of contact time, initial concentration, and temperature on HAP immobilization of Pb2+ ions was studied using a batch technique. It was remarked that the maximum amount of Pb2+ immobilization by HAP was 1690.2 mg/g with a minimum contact time of 50 min. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model has been proposed to fit the data. Thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G(0), Delta H-0, and Delta S-0 were calculated to understand the nature of sorption. Original HAP and immobilization products were characterized using SEM, TEM/EDAX, XRD and BET. In the presence of Cl-, the dissolution of HAP followed by precipitation of chloropyromorphite was found to be the main operating mechanism for Pb2+ immobilization by HAP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhu, WN; Drewes, J; Melcher, D				Zhu, Weina; Drewes, Jan; Melcher, David			Time for Awareness: The Influence of Temporal Properties of the Mask on Continuous Flash Suppression Effectiveness	PLOS ONE			English	Article							THRESHOLD TACTILE STIMULI; MOTION-INDUCED BLINDNESS; INTEROCULAR SUPPRESSION; VISUAL AWARENESS; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; GLOBAL WORKSPACE; PHASE RESET; THETA-BAND; EEG ALPHA; LOW-LEVEL	Visual processing is not instantaneous, but instead our conscious perception depends on the integration of sensory input over time. In the case of Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS), masks are flashed to one eye, suppressing awareness of stimuli presented to the other eye. One potential explanation of CFS is that it depends, at least in part, on the flashing mask continually interrupting visual processing before the stimulus reaches awareness. We investigated the temporal features of masks in two ways. First, we measured the suppression effectiveness of a wide range of masking frequencies (0-32Hz), using both complex (faces/houses) and simple (closed/open geometric shapes) stimuli. Second, we varied whether the different frequencies were interleaved within blocks or separated in homogenous blocks, in order to see if suppression was stronger or weaker when the frequency remained constant across trials. We found that break-through contrast differed dramatically between masking frequencies, with mask effectiveness following a skewed-normal curve peaking around 6Hz and little or no masking for low and high temporal frequencies. Peak frequency was similar for trial-randomized and block randomized conditions. In terms of type of stimulus, we found no significant difference in peak frequency between the stimulus groups (complex/simple, face/house, closed/open). These findings suggest that temporal factors play a critical role in perceptual awareness, perhaps due to interactions between mask frequency and the time frame of visual processing.

In this study, we generated a draft genome sequence of cyanobacteria Trichormus sp. NMC-1 in the QTP and performed whole transcriptome sequencing under low temperature to investigate the genetic mechanism by which T. sp. NMC-1 adapted to the specific environment. Its genome sequence was 5.9 Mb with a G+C content of 39.2% and encompassed a total of 5362 CDS. A phylogenomic tree indicated that this strain belongs to the Trichormus and Anabaena cluster. Genome comparison between T. sp. NMC-1 and six relatives showed that functionally unknown genes occupied a much higher proportion (28.12%) of the T. sp. NMC-1 genome. In addition, functions of specific, significant positively selected, expanded orthogroups, and differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and energy production and conversion were analyzed to elucidate specific adaptation traits. Further analyses showed that the CheY-like genes, extracellular polysaccharide and mycosporine-like amino acids might play major roles in adaptation to harsh environments. Our findings indicate that sophisticated genetic mechanisms are involved in cyanobacterial adaptation to the extreme environment of the QTP.

Considering that the rapid uplift of the central Andes occurred 5-10 million years ago (Ma), an evolutionary question arises regarding how plants such as maca acquire high-altitude adaptation within a short geological period. Here, we report the high-quality genome assembly of maca, in which two closely spaced maca-specific whole-genome duplications (WGDs; similar to 6.7 Ma) were identified. Comparative genomic analysis between maca and closely related Brassicaceae species revealed expansions of maca genes and gene families involved in abiotic stress response, hormone signaling pathway, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis via WGDs. The retention and subsequent functional divergence of many duplicated genes may account for the morphological and physiological changes (i.e., small leaf shape and self-fertility) in maca in a high-altitude environment. In addition, some duplicated maca genes were identified with functions in morphological adaptation (i.e., LEAF CURLING RESPONSIVENESS) and abiotic stress response(i.e., GLYCINE-RICHRNA-BINDING PROTEINS and DNA-DAMAGE-REPAIR/TOLERATION 2) under positive selection. Collectively, the maca genome provides useful information to understand the important roles of WGDs in the high-altitude adaptation of plants in the Andes.

To search for novel loci associated with development of cervical cancer, we performed a pooled analysis of data from two GWASs by imputing over 10 million genetic variants and 424 classical HLA alleles, for 1,553 intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3), 81 cervical cancer and 4,442 controls from the Swedish population. Notable findings were validated in an independent study of 961 patients (827 with CIN3 and 123 with cervical cancer) and 1,725 controls. Our data provided increased support for previously identified loci at 6p21.3 (rs9271898, P = 1.2 x 10(-24); rs2516448, 1.1 x 10(-15); and rs3130196, 2.3 x 10(-9), respectively) and also confirmed associations with reported classical HLA alleles including HLA-B*07:02, -B*15:01, -DRB1*13:01, -DRB1*15:01, -DQA1*01:03, -DQB1*06:03 and -DQB1*06:02. In addition, we identified and subsequently replicated an independent signal at rs73730372 at 6p21.3 (odds ratio = 0.60, 95% confidence interval = 0.54-0.67, P = 3.0 x 10(-19)), which was found to be an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of both HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1. This is one of the strongest common genetic protective variants identified so far for CIN3. We also found HLA-C*07:02 to be associated with risk of CIN3. The present study provides new insights into pathogenesis of CIN3.

Pleurotus placentodes, originally described from Sikkim, rediscovered after 164 years	PHYTOTAXA			English	Article						Agaricales; edible mushroom; Himalayas; Pleurotaceae; taxonomy	MIXED MODELS; MUSHROOM; SPECIATION; OSTREATUS; TAXA	Although many species of Pleurotus are commonly known to be important edible mushrooms, the species delimitation of the genus is often controversial due to phenotypic plasticity and morphological stasis. In the present paper, Pleurotus placentodes, a conspicuous species originally described from Sikkim by M.J. Berkeley in 1852 and so far known only from the type collection, is documented based on specimens recently gathered in the eastern Himalayas and Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China. The morphological and molecular phylogenetic data indicate that this species is an independent taxon, and accordingly the previously proposed synonym of Pleurotus djamor is rejected.

AsN, AsP and SbAs alloys possess indirect band gap and BiAs is direct band gap. Although AsP, SbAs and BiAs alloyed arsenene sheets maintain the semiconducting character of pure arsenene, they have indirect-direct and semiconducting-metallic transitions by applying biaxial strain. We find that B- and N-doped arsenene render p-type semiconducting character, while C- and O-doped arsenene are metallic character. Especially, the C-doped arsenene is spin-polarization asymmetric and can be tuned into the bipolar spin-gapless semiconductor by the external electric field. Moreover, the doping concentration can effectively affect the magnetism of the C-doped system. Finally, we briefly study the chemical molecule adsorbed arsenene. Our results may be valuable for alloyed and doped arsenene sheets applications in mechanical sensors and spintronic devices in the future.

They are proved to have high statistical correlations to the later ENSO events in the autumn and winter seasons: When persistent anomaly of MJO happens in the Pacific Ocean in summer, El Nino events are often induced during the autumn and winter seasons of that year. However, during the other MJO mode when the summer persistent anomaly of MJO occurs in the Indian Ocean, La Nina events often follow instead. The analysis of the atmospheric circulation field indicates that persistent anomaly of MJO can probably affect the entire Equatorial Pacific circulation, and results in wind stress anomalies. The wind stress anomalies could excite warm or cold water masses which propagate eastwards at the subsurface ocean. The accumulation of warm or cold subsurface water in the Equatorial Eastern Pacific Ocean may eventually lead to the formation of an ENSO.

One possible pathway to produce 1 is that [(H3N)(2)Pt(mu-OH)(2)Pt(NH3)(2)](NO3)(2), a well-known complex forming on treatment of cis-Pt(NH3)(2)I-2 with AgNO3, reacts with aqueous ammonia. The other possible pathway involves deprotonation of [Pt(NH3)(4)](NO3)(2) to form monomeric Pt(NH3)(3)(NH2)NO3 followed by elimination of NH3. Crystals of 1 (from water) are monoclinic (C2/c) with a = 16.834(2) angstrom, b = 10.573(1) angstrom, c = 7.415(1) angstrom, beta = 114.846(1)degrees, and Z = 4. The cationic portion consists of two symmetrical square-planar Pt centers with the inversion center at the midpoint of the Pt(1)center dot center dot center dot Pt(1A) vector. The Pt(II) ion is coordinated by four N atoms from two ammonia molecules and two bridging amido groups affording a slightly distorted square. The molecules are stacked in such a way that the planes of coordination squares turn out to be parallel to each other with a distance of 3.501 angstrom. Intermolecular Pt-H interaction between the mu-NH2 hydrogens and the platinum(II) centers of the adjacent molecule are observed.

T. Chang is a critically endangered plant from the family Theaceae that is endemic to China. It is now present in only one remnant population in a very narrow range and with a highly isolated and fragmented distribution pattern. The species is distributed close to the local villages and faces extinction because of the high level of anthropogenic disturbance. Thus, conservation and restoration of this species is urgent. The species reproduces by seed, but its germination requirements and seedling emergence are rarely understood. In this study, the germination requirements, desiccation tolerance and seedling emergence of the species were studied under controlled laboratory conditions. The results indicated that seeds of E. excelsum were non-dormant. Optimal temperatures for germination were 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C; the germination percentage decreased and the mean germination time increased at high temperature. Seed germination was inhibited in the dark, suggesting that the seeds were positive photoblastic. Water stress also significantly inhibited germination percentage; no seeds germinated at 15% polyethylene glycol 6000. The fresh seeds had moderate moisture content of 28.6% and showed strong tolerance of dehydration. Thus, the seeds of E. excelsum tended to be orthodox. Seeds on the soil surface had the highest emergence percentage, which declined with depth of burial. Soil types significantly affected seedling emergence; seeds had higher emergence percentage in sandy soil than in mixed soil and clayed soil. Our study demonstrated that ex situ conservation and reintroduction of E. excelsum using seedling propagation from seeds is feasible.

Here we describe Lyrarapax trilobus n. sp. from the same fossil Konservat-Lagerstatte. The new species differs from L. unguispinus in the morphology and distribution of endites on the frontal appendage and the strengthening structure of the body flaps. The two species resemble each other in body shape (pattern of flap size), neck segment number, cephalic plates, and most importantly a mouth characterized by concentric wrinkled furrows. The latter confirms that a soft mouth without sclerotized plates is a real feature of Lyrarapax and supports the idea that oral structures provide valid diagnostic characters within Radiodonta.

The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and short-chain mycolic acids. Whole cell sugars were mannose, galactose and arabinose as major components. The major fatty acids (>10%) were C-18:1 omega 9C, C-16:0 and C-17:1 omega 8c and the major menaquinone was MK-9(H-2). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, glycolipid and six unidentified lipids. The new isolate shared most of the typical chemotaxonomic characteristics of members of the genus Corynebacterium. The closest related species was Corynebacterium efficiens based on 16S rRNA gene (98.1 % similarity) and partial rpoB gene (91.4% similarity) sequences. Similarities with other species of this genus were below 97% based on the 16S rRNA gene. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between YIM 101505(T) and C. efficiens DSM 44549(T) was 47.7 +/- 3.6%. Moreover, the physiological and biochemical characteristics of YIM 101505(T) and C. efficiens DSM 44549(T) were different.

Recently, we obtained accurate estimates of the mass of the black hole primary, the orbital inclination angle of the system, and the distance. Using these crucial input data and Ginga X-ray spectra, we have measured the spin of the black hole using the continuum-fitting method. For four X-ray spectra of extraordinary quality we have determined the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a(*) = 0.63(-0.19)(+0.16) (1 sigma confidence level), a result that we confirm using 11 additional spectra of lower quality. Our spin estimate challenges two published results: it is somewhat higher than the value predicted by a proposed relationship between jet power and spin; and we find that the spin of the black hole is decidedly prograde, not retrograde as has been claimed.

Castor beans (Ricinus communis) are important non-edible oilseed plants, cultivated worldwide for its seed oils and its adaptability to growth conditions. In this study, we identified and characterized a total of 48 GRAS genes based on the castor bean genome. Combined with phylogenetic analysis, the castor bean GRAS members were divided into 13 distinct groups. Functional divergence analysis revealed the presence of mostly Type-I functional divergence. The gene structures and conserved motifs, both within and outside the GRAS domain, were characterized. Gene expression analysis, performed in various tissues and under a range of abiotic stress conditions, uncovered the potential functions of GRAS members in regulating plant growth development and stress responses. The results obtained from this study provide valuable information toward understanding the potential molecular mechanisms of GRAS proteins in castor beans. These findings also serve as a resource for identifying the genes that allow castor beans to grow in stressful conditions and to enable further breeding and genetic improvements in agriculture.

Here, expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers were developed and characterized. Methods and Results: Sixteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from T. diversifolia using transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic screening. The number of alleles per locus varied from two to four alleles in 48 individuals from three populations. Most of these primers also amplified in T. rotundifolia and some even in Parthenium hysterophorus. Conclusions: These markers are useful for investigating the genetic structure and evolutionary process of T. diversifolia, which may provide important information for better management.

Removal efficiencies of nitrate and phosphate, as well as temporal variations of nitrogen and carbon during batches 10 and 19, were investigated and assessed. Nitrate removal was efficiently enhanced by the addition of flower straws, but decreased gradually as the organic substances were consumed. Phosphate removal was also improved, although this very limited. High nitrate removal rates were achieved during the initial 12 h in the two batches each lasting for 3 days, along with the depletion of influent dissolved oxygen due to aerobic degradation of the organic compounds. NO2--N of 0.01-2.83 mg/L and NH4--N of 0.02-1.69 mg/L were formed and both positively correlated to the nitrate reduced. Inorganic carbon (IC) concentrations increased during the batches and varied conversely with the nitrate contents, and could be indicative of nitrate removal due to the highly significant positive correlation between NO3--N removed and IC concentration (r(2) = 0.881, p < 0.0001). It is feasible and economical to use the denitrification biofilter to treat nitrate-contaminated wastewater, although further optimization of carbon source addition is still required.

Compounds 1-4 show various structures because of different N-C-center-N angles () of TIYM ligands and changing coordination modes of 2,6-PYDC. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 display a similar 1D ladder-like chain, whereas 4 gives a 1D quad-core lifting platform shaped belt. The structural diversities in 1-4 suggest that the multiple coordination modes or the different freely twist angles of ligands and the presence of different metal atoms play important roles in the resulting structures of the coordination polymers. Furthermore, the solid-state luminescence properties of 1 and 4, and the magnetic properties of 3 were investigated.

It is shown that a very hard electron distribution, N-e' (gamma') proportional to gamma'(-p), with spectral index p similar to 1.3 is formed below the minimum energy of injection electrons when inverse Compton scattering takes place in the Klein-Nishina regime, i.e. inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons on broadline region radiation in flat-spectrum radio quasars. This produces a very hard gamma-ray spectrum and can explain in reasonable fashion the very hard Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) spectrum of the flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 during the extreme gamma-ray flare in 2013 December.

In this paper, we present two types of algorithm for obtaining the intrinsic parameters of a camera by computing the imaged circular points. First, according to the geometric features of the two planar mirror images, the vanishing points along the normal directions of the planar mirrors are obtained, and the vanishing points along the directions of the planar mirrors are computed using the cross-ratio invariability. Subsequently, we propose two methods of solving for the imaged circular points: one uses the inference of the Laguerre theorem, and the other uses the intersection points of the conic image and the vanishing line. Finally, the camera's intrinsic parameters are obtained by applying the constraints on imaging the circular points to the image of the absolute conic. A simulation, real data, and a 3D reconstruction are presented to show the feasibility and validity of the proposed approaches.

In the present study, the chemosensitizing effects of GA-13315 in multidrug-resistant cell lines were examined and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Cytotoxicity and chemosensitizing effects of GA-13315 were determined by MTT assay. Function of ABC transporter was analyzed by measuring intracellular drug accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 and by determining the ATPase activity of ABC transporter. Expression levels of apoptosis regulators were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. GA-13315 selectively killed MCF-7/adr cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) over the parent MCF-7 cells. In combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, GA-13315 at sub-toxic concentrations reversed the multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 but exacerbated the resistance conferred by multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1). GA-13315 increased intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 in MCF-7/adr cells and in ABCB1-transfected HEK293 cells but facilitated drug flush-out from cells that overexpress ABCC1. GA-13315 inhibited the ATPase activity of ABCB1 while stimulated that of ABCC1. Moreover, the downregulated expression of Bax in MCF-7/adr cells was restored by GA-13315 markedly. These data suggest that GA-13315 sensitizes multidrug-resistant cells at least partially by impeding the efflux function of ABCB1. The upregulation of Bax by GA-13315 may also contribute to the sensitizing action. The opposite effects of GA-13315 on different ATP-binding cassette transporters and their implications in overcoming drug resistance require further investigation.

The inclusion complexation behavior, characterization and interactions of PD with CDs were investigated in both the solution and the solid state by means of UV-vis, ESI-MS, NMR, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TG and DSC. All of the characterization information demonstrated the formation of PD/CDs inclusion complex, and the PD/CDs inclusion complexes exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from PD. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the complexes was visually proven with the ESI-MS experiment and Job's method. Meanwhile, it was the phenyl group (a and b rings) of the PD molecule that were included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of PD/CDs was significantly improved from 0.161 mg/mL to 7.21 mg/mL (PD/beta-CD) and 12.02 mg/mL (PD/gamma-CD). Consequently, the bioavailability of PD/CDs inclusion complexes were effectively improved over free PD in vitro. The present study provides useful information for the potential application of complexation with PD, a naturally occurring hydrophobic polyphenolic compounds herbal medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The research focuses on the source region of Yellow River and its surrounding area, which is located on the northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau with its very complex topography. Driven by the ECMWF ERA-interim reanalysis data, RegCM3 displays reasonable ability to reproduce the spatial patterns, annual cycles, and the interannual variabilities of regional surface climate, though the model shows wet and cold bias. The model's performance is more close to observation for the source region of Yellow River than the other part of the analysis region, and the application of high resolution of 15 km demonstrates better skill with less bias for mean climate and larger correlation coefficients for interannual variability at most stations. However, the high-resolution simulation shows little advantage for reproducing the variations of precipitation and surface air temperature with altitude. The RegCM3 model also generally reproduces the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of surface climate and, consequently, the occurrence of climatic extremes and extreme indices. The simulation with high resolution again proves to be more reliable to generate climatic extremes over complex terrain of the source region of the Yellow River, related to its better representation of complex terrain and local processes.

Arthrobotrys oligospora is a typical nematode-trapping fungus which can capture and kill nematodes by means of traps formed in response to the presence of their prey. A nutrient-limited environment was previously shown to be important for trap formation, which was induced by several inferior nitrogen sources, such as sodium nitrate, in the absence of the cell wall protein AoMad1 in A. oligospora. To characterize the role of nitrate in trap formation, we knocked out four genes in the nitrate assimilation pathway and assessed possible effect of nitrate, host nematode or both on the trap formation in the mutants and the wild type. The results showed that trap induction by nitrate used a distinct pathway that differed from induction by nematodes. Moreover, the nitrate facilitated trap formation in the presence of nematodes.

However, an absence of novel approaches during the last few decades has limited the discovery of new microbial natural products useful for industries. Scientists are now focusing on the ecological aspects of diverse environments including unexplored or underexplored habitats and extreme environments in the search for new metabolites. This paper reports on the diversity of culturable actinobacteria associated with hot springs located in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. A total of 58 thermophilic actinobacterial strains were isolated from the samples collected from ten hot springs distributed over three geothermal fields (e.g., Hehua, Rehai, and Ruidian). Phylogenetic positions and their biosynthetic profiles were analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene and three biosynthetic gene clusters (KS domain of PKS-I, KS alpha domain of PKS-II and A domain of NRPS). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis, the 58 strains were affiliated with 12 actinobacterial genera: Actinomadura Micromonospora, Microbispora, Micrococcus, Nocardiopsis, Nonomuraea, Promicromonospora, Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces, Thermoactinospora, Thermocatellispora, and Verrucosispora, of which the two novel genera Thermoactinospora and Thermocatellisopora were recently described from among these strains. Considering the biosynthetic potential of these actinobacterial strains, 22 were positive for PCR amplification of at least one of the three biosynthetic gene clusters (PKS-I, PKS-II, and NRPS). These actinobacteria were further subjected to antimicrobial assay against five opportunistic human pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis). All of the 22 strains that were positive for PCR amplification of at least one of the biosynthetic gene domains exhibited antimicrobial activities against at least one of the five test organisms. Among the remaining 36 actinobacteria that are negative for PCR amplification of the domains for the biosynthetic genes, 33 strains showed antimicrobial activities against at least one of the five test pathogens. In summary, the findings presented in this study emphasized the importance of underexplored habitats such as Tengchong hot springs as potential sources for search of bioactive molecules.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain YIM Y47(T) belonged to the genus Aeromicrobium. YIM Y47(T) shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Aeromicrobium massiliense JC14(T) (96.47 %). Growth occurs at 20-45 A degrees C (optimum at 30 A degrees C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum at pH 7.0), and salinities of 0-7.0 % NaCl (optimum at 4.0 %). The strain YIM Y47(T) exhibits chemotaxonomic features with menaquinone-7 (MK-7) as the predominant quinone, C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c and 10-methyl C-18:0 (> 10 %) as major fatty acids. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain YIM Y47(T) contained ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain YIM Y47(T) was found to be 44.7 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic data, it is proposed that strain YIM Y47(T) should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Aeromicrobium, with the name Aeromicrobium halotolerans sp. nov. The type strain is YIM Y47(T) (=KCTC 39113(T)=CGMCC 1.15063(T)=DSM 29939(T)=JCM 30627(T)).

The observational analysis is based on Twentieth Century Reanalysis data (version 2) of atmospheric circulations, Extended Reconstructed SST data (version 3), and the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation. The results indicate that the IIE's zonal movement is significantly and persistently correlated with the TIO-TCWP SSTSM, from spring to summer. The results of two case studies resemble those obtained by regression analysis. Experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model (ECHAM6) substantiate the key physical processes revealed in the observational analysis. When warmer (colder) SSTs appear in the TIO and colder (warmer) SSTs occur in the TCWP, the positive (negative) SSTSM forces anomalous easterly (westerly) winds over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), South China Sea (SCS), and western North Pacific (WNP). The anomalous easterly (westerly) winds further result in a weakened (strengthened) southwest summer monsoon over the BOB and a strengthened (weakened) southeast summer monsoon over the SCS and WNP. This causes the IIE to shift farther eastward (westward) than normal.

Dome-shaped magnetic order competing with high-temperature superconductivity at high pressures in FeSe	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PHASE-DIAGRAM; CRYSTAL; DENSITY; FILMS	The coexistence and competition between superconductivity and electronic orders, such as spin or charge density waves, have been a central issue in high transition-temperature (T-c) superconductors. Unlike other iron-based superconductors, FeSe exhibits nematic ordering without magnetism whose relationship with its superconductivity remains unclear. Moreover, a pressure-induced fourfold increase of Tc has been reported, which poses a profound mystery. Here we report high-pressure magnetotransport measurements in FeSe up to similar to 15 GPa, which uncover the dome shape of magnetic phase superseding the nematic order. Above similar to 6GPa the sudden enhancement of superconductivity (T-c <= 38.3 K) accompanies a suppression of magnetic order, demonstrating their competing nature with very similar energy scales. Above the magnetic dome, we find anomalous transport properties suggesting a possible pseudogap formation, whereas linear-in-temperature resistivity is observed in the normal states of the high-T-c phase above 6 GPa. The obtained phase diagram highlights unique features of FeSe among iron-based superconductors, but bears some resemblance to that of high-T-c cuprates.	[Sun, J. P.; Ye, G.

XRD patterns along with Rietveld refinement confirm the formation of CuO with monoclinic phase. The length of the as-synthesized CuO fibers is at micrometer scale, and the average fiber diameter ranges from several nanometers up to order of micrometers. After combustion reaction, a large amount of coalescent particles left on the surface of the cotton fibers to form porous walls of CuO. By totally removing cotton body at 600 degrees C, hollow CuO fibers were obtained. A possible growth mechanism of hollow CuO fibers using cotton fibers as templates was given based on experimental data. When used as a sensing material in gas sensor, it exhibited a superior sensitivity and good selectivity toward low-ppm-level (1-100 ppm) n-propanol. Theses findings not only provide a novel approach to fabricate hollow CuO fibers via a solution combustion route, but also explore a promising gas sensor toward n-propanol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, P; Zhuo, T; Zhang, YN; Xie, L; Tao, DP				Zhang, Peng; Zhuo, Tao; Zhang, Yanning; Xie, Lei; Tao, Dapeng			Real-time tracking-by-learning with high-order regularization fusion for big video abstraction	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Video abstraction; Learning; Tracking; High-order; Regularization	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Visual tracking is a key technique used by video abstraction to achieve efficient post analysis for big video surveillance. In order to tackle the problem of constantly changing scenarios during online tracking, additional factors such as motion can be incorporated by utilizing a fusion strategy to improve the final performance. Unfortunately, straightforward output fusion is difficult to be synchronized due to the diversity in model regression. Therefore, a widely cited problem for learning based fusion is to incorporate regularizers for label assignment of unlabeled samples, which is one of the major research focuses on semi-supervised learning. In this paper, a novel tracking strategy based on semi supervised learning with high order regularization fusion has been proposed. It employs two different types of regularizers to achieve more accurate label assignment based on kernelized confidence prediction and graph-based bi-directional trace from motion. The computation of the proposed tracker takes advantage of the unique feature of circulant matrix in Fourier domain and integral patterns, and thus can be readily implemented for real-time processing, even without any code optimization.

NOV.; VIRGIBACILLUS-PICTURAE; COMB. NOV; HYBRIDIZATION; HALOTOLERANT; SOIL; DNA	A bacterial strain, py1294(T), isolated from a root of Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis collected from Yunnan province, southwest China, was characterised by using a polyphasic approach to clarify its taxonomic position. Strain py1294(T) was found to be Gram-positive, aerobic, spore-forming, peritrichous flagella and rod shaped. Growth was found to occur in the presence of 0-8 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1-3 %), at pH 6.5-9.5 (optimum 8.0) and at 10-42 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C). The major cellular fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-16:0 and iso-C-14:0. The predominant quinone was identified as MK-7 and a minor amount of MK-6 was detected. The diagnostic polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The cell wall peptidoglycan was found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain py1294(T) forms a well-supported clade with Oceanobacillus damuensis PT-20(T) (97.9 % sequence similarity) within the genus Oceanobacillus, although it also shares a high sequence similarity with Ornithinibacillus contaminans (97.5 %). Crucially, the DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain py1294(T) and O. damuensis PT-20(T) was 29.7 +/- 3.2 %. The G+C content was determined to be 42.3 mol%. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic data, a novel species Oceanobacillus endoradicis sp. nov. is proposed, with py1294(T) (=DSM 100726(T) = KCTC 33731(T)) as the type strain.

The strain was able to grow over a range of temperatures (4-30 A degrees C), pH (6.0-10.0) and NaCl concentration (0-2 %, w/v). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain YIM C01544(T) should be a member of the genus Lysobacter. The strain is closely related to Lysobacter niastensis GH41-7(T) (97.6 %), Lysobacter soli DCY21(T) (97.5 %), Lysobacter enzymogenes DSM 2043(T) (97.3 %), Lysobacter antibioticus DSM 2044(T) (97.1 %) and Lysobacter panacisoli CJ29(T) (97.1 %). The genomic DNA relatedness values (< 47 %) as indicated by DNA-DNA hybridization studies were below the threshold limit for characterization of new bacterial species. The chemotaxonomic features of the new isolate include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids as its characteristic polar lipids and Q-8 as the only quinone. The major fatty acids detected were iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:1 omega 9c. The DNA G + C content of the strain was determined to be 64.9 mol %. Based on the data from phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular studies, strain YIM C01544(T) merits recognition as novel species in the genus Lysobacter for which the name Lysobacter cavernae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Lysobacter cavernae is YIM C01544(T) (= KCTC 42875(T) = DSM 101561(T) = CPCC 100816(T)).

This paper introduces a simple ordering test approach for the two-way r x c contingency tables with incomplete counts by developing six test statistics, i.e., the likelihood ratio test statistic, score test statistic, global score test statistic, Hausman-Wald test statistic,Wald test statistic and distance-based test statistic. Bootstrap resampling methods are also presented. The performance of the proposed tests is evaluated with respect to their empirical type I error rates and empirical powers. The results show that the likelihood ratio test statistic based on the bootstrap resampling methods perform satisfactorily for small to large sample sizes. A real example from a wheeze study in six cities is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework (DeepChart) to classify charts by combining convolutional networks and deep belief networks. In general, we first extract deep hidden features of charts, which are taken from the fully-connected layer of deep convolutional networks. We then utilize deep belief networks to predict the labels of the charts based on their deep hidden features. The convolutional networks are initialized using a large number of natural images and fine-tuned using the chart images to avoid overfitting. Compared with previous methods using primitive feature extraction, the deep features achieve better scalability and stability. We collect a 5-class chart data set with more than 5000 images and demonstrate that the proposed framework greatly outperforms existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Collective Surface Plasmon Resonances in Two-Dimensional Assemblies of Au and Ag Nanocrystals: Experiments and Discrete Dipole Approximation Simulation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; SELF-ORGANIZATION; REVERSE MICELLES; DDA METHOD; SUPERLATTICES; SCATTERING; SUBSTRATE; SIZE	The UV-visible absorption spectra of two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of Ag or Au nanocrystals (NCs) are measured in transmission at variable incidence angles for different average NC diameters ranging from 7.0 to 3.9 nm. The absorption spectra dominated by the collective surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band are compared to those calculated using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. The anisotropy of the optical response is inherent to the planar geometry of the NC assembly because of the near-field coupling between nanocrystals. For Ag NCs, the absorption spectra reveal the splitting of the SPR band into two components, namely, the transverse and longitudinal modes. At variance, no SPR band splitting is observed for 2D assemblies of Au NCs with identical size and coating agent. These features were satisfactorily reproduced by DDA simulation even though the SPR mode energies deduced from our calculations slightly overestimate the measured ones. The influence of the coating dodecanethiol molecules on the electron refractive index inside the nanocrystals as well as that of the substrate could explain the mismatch between the measured and calculated spectra.

Cumulative evidence suggests that AMPA receptors are important for the treatment of depression. Here, we report that PGM treatment leads to a significant antidepressant effect in the tail suspension test and forced swim test after sixty minutes of treatment in mice. After five consecutive days of PGM treatment, this antidepressant effect remained. PGM treatment did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. PGM significantly enhanced the expression of its receptor Dectin-1, as well as p-GluA1(S845) and GluA1, but not GluA2 or GluA3 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) after five days of treatment. The Dectin-1 inhibitor Laminarin was able to block the antidepressant effect of PGM. At the synapses of PFC, PGM treatment significantly up-regulated the p-GluA1(S845), GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 levels. Moreover, PGM's antidepressant effects and the increase of p-GluA1(S845)/GluA1 lasted for 3 days after stopping treatment. The AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was able to block the antidepressant effect of PGM. This study identified PGM as a novel antidepressant with clinical potential and a new antidepressant mechanism for regulating prefrontal Dectin-1/AMPA receptor signalling.

Four groups of control experiments were performed to verify the influences of diffusing substance category, concentration and temperature on diffusion process, and the measured D values were well consistent with data measured by Holographic interferometry and Taylor dispersion methods. The drifting of the diffusion image recorded by CCD reflects the diffusion rate visually in an easily understandable way. This optical method for measuring D values based on the ALCL is characterized by visual measurement, simplified device, and easy operation, which provides a new way for measuring liquid D value visually.

Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of affective lexicons with VA ratings because such resources are fundamental and useful for building dimensional sentiment applications. Due to the limited number of VA lexicons, a cross-lingual approach has emerged that aims to estimate the VA ratings of affective words of one language from those of another language based on linear regression or other regression methods. However, one of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a locally weighted method to improve linear regression for predicting the valence arousal values of affective words. This method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are "local" to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a lower error rate and a higher correlation coefficient for predicting the VA ratings of Chinese affective words from English VA lexicons.

By examining specimens of Rosa and Cotoneaster species collected since 1920s in Hengduan Mountains, we analyzed the changes of flowering phenology and flower size in the past century when climate changes were considered to be intensified. We found that flowering phenology of Rosa showed no significant change, but flowering phenology of Cotoneaster was delayed in recent years. Flower size of Rosa species showed a marginally significant decrease over the past century. The results suggested that responses of flowering time to global changes and pollinator mediated selection on floral traits might be more complex than what were expected. Our results indicated that future researches based on investigations of herbarium specimens should be carried out on multiple plant species with different flower structures and life histories to better understand the effects of climate changes on plant traits.

First, panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) are transformed into CIELab color space to get different color components. Second, PAN and L component of MS are decomposed by the NSST to obtain corresponding the low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients. Third, the low-frequency coefficients are fused by intersecting cortical model (ICM); the high-frequency coefficients are divided into several sub-blocks to calculate the average gradient (AG), and the linking strength beta of PCNN model is determined by the AG, so that the parameters beta can be adaptively set according to the quality of the sub-block images, then the sub-blocks image are input into PCNN to get the oscillation frequency graph (OFG), the method can get the fused high-frequency coefficients according to the OFG. Finally, the fused L component is obtained by inverse NSST, and the fused RGB color image is obtained through inverse CIELab transform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provide better effect compared with other common methods.

Graphene enhanced the sensor's electron transfer and sensitivity. The electrode surface was first directly modified with graphene through the electrodeposition of graphene oxide. An ion imprinted polymer membrane was subsequently synthesized on this modified surface via in situ polymerization in acetonitrile using allylurea (NAU) as a functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross linking agent, and azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator at a molar ratio of template (PdCl2) to NAU to EGDMA of 1:4:40. Amperometric i-t curves were measured for the determination of palladium. The designed modified electrode was shown a linear response to Pd(II) ions in the range of 2.0 x 10(-8)-2.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1 of Pd(II) ion with a detection limit of 6.4 x 10(-9) mol L-1. Metal ions present at concentrations 15 times higher than that of Pd(II) did not interfere with the determination of Pd(II). The sensor was successfully applied to determine palladium in catalyst and plant samples with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.3% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 99.2-106.5%.

These energies are then used as the interaction energy parameters in the Wilson equation. Phase diagram of vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) for the Pb-based alloy systems in vacuum distillation are obtained based on the calculated parameters. The results indicate that this approach can lead to accurate VLE predictions for alloy systems in vacuum distillation based only on properties of pure components and the structure of the clusters. The comparisons show the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Crop rotation is essential in controlling black shank. Here, we confirmed that rotating black shank-infested fields with rapeseed (Brassica napus) suppressed the incidence this disease. Further study demonstrated that rapeseed roots have a strong ability to attract zoospores and subsequently stop the swimming of zoospores into cystospores. Then, rapeseed roots secrete a series of antimicrobial compounds, including 2-butenoic acid, benzothiazole, 2(methylthio)benzothiazole, 1-(4-ethylphenyl)-ethanone, and 4-methoxyindole, to inhibit the cystospore germination and mycelial growth of P. parasitica var. nicotianae. Thus, rapeseed rotated with tobacco suppresses tobacco black shank disease through the chemical weapons secreted by rapeseed roots.

Following an analysis of the recently released Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), we report the discovery of significant gamma-ray emission from M15 and NGC 6397, confirm that NGC 5904 is a gamma-ray-emitter and provide evidence of gamma-ray emission from NGC 6218 and 6139. Interestingly, in the globular clusters M15, NGC 6397 and 5904, millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been found in the radio or X-ray, which strongly support the MSP origin of the gamma-ray emission. Owing to the relatively low luminosity of the gamma-ray emission, however, we do not find any evidence for gamma-ray pulsation or flux variability in these sources.	[Zhang, P.

GEN.; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; DISPARITY; HOMOLOGY; POSITION	Bivalved euarthropods represent a conspicuous component of exceptionally-preserved fossil biotas throughout the Lower Palaeozoic. However, most of these taxa are known from isolated valves, and thus there is a limited understanding of their morphological organization and palaeoecology in the context of early animal-dominated communities. The bivalved euarthropod Clypecaris serrata sp. nov., recovered from the Cambrian (Stage 3) Hongjingshao Formation in Kunming, southern China, is characterized by having a robust first pair of raptorial appendages that bear well-developed ventralfacing spines, paired dorsal spines on the trunk, and posteriorly oriented serrations on the anteroventral margins of both valves. The raptorial limbs of C. serrata were adapted for grasping prey employing a descending stroke for transporting it close the mouth, whereas the backwards-facing marginal serrations of the bivalved carapace may have helped to secure the food items during feeding. The new taxon offers novel insights on the morphology of the enigmatic genus Clypecaris, and indicates that the possession of paired dorsal spines is a diagnostic trait of the Family Clypecarididae within upper stem-group Euarthropoda. C. serrata evinces functional adaptations for an active predatory lifestyle within the context of Cambrian bivalved euarthropods, and contributes towards the better understanding of feeding diversity in early ecosystems.

Here we report the discovery of an extremely wide-angle (similar to 180 degrees) bipolar outflow ("EWBO") in a cluster forming region AFGL 5142 from low-velocity emission of the HCN (3-2) and HCO+ (3-2) lines. This bipolar outflow is along a north-west to south-east direction with a line of sight flow velocity of about 3 km s(-1) and is spatially connected to the high-velocity jet-like outflows. It seems to be a collection of low-velocity material entrained by the high-velocity outflows due to momentum feedback. The total ejected mass and mass loss rate due to both high-velocity jet-like outflows and the "EWBO" are similar to 24.5 M-circle dot and similar to 1.7 x 10(-3)M(circle dot) yr(-1), respectively. Global collapse of the clump is revealed by the " blue profile" in the HCO+ (1-0) line. A hierarchical network of filaments was identified in NH3 (1, 1) emission. Clear velocity gradients of the order of 10 km s(-1) pc(-1) are found along filaments, indicating gas inflow along the filaments. The sum of the accretion rate along filaments and mass infall rate along the line of sight is similar to 3.1 x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1), which exceeds the total mass loss rate, indicating that the central cluster is probably still gaining mass. The central cluster is highly fragmented and 22 condensations are identified in 1.1 mm continuum emission. The fragmentation process seems to be determined by thermal pressure and turbulence. The magnetic field may not play an important role in fragmentation.

Six-white-point is a pigmentation pattern observed in varying pig breeds, which seems to have evolved through several different mechanistic pathways. Herein, we re-sequenced whole genomes of 31 Diannan small-ear pigs from China and found that the six-white-point coat color in Diannan small-ear pigs is likely regulated by polygenic loci, rather than by the MC1R locus. Strong associations were observed at three loci (EDNRB, CNTLN, and PINK1), which explain about 20 percent of the total coat color variance in the Diannan small-ear pigs. We found a mutation that is highly differentiated between six-white-point and black Diannan small-ear pigs, which is located in a conserved noncoding sequence upstream of the EDNRB gene and is a putative binding site of the CEBPB protein. This study advances our understanding of coat color evolution in Diannan small-ear pigs and expands our traditional knowledge of coat color being a monogenic trait.

To study the changing patterns of expression accompanying hybridization and polyploidization, we used RNA-seq and qRT-PCR to investigate global expression and homoeologue expression in diploid and tetraploid hybrids of Carassius auratus red var. (female) (R) and Cyprinus carpio (male) (C). By comparing the relative expression levels between the hybrids and their parents, we defined the expression level dominance (ELD) and homoeologue expression bias (HEB) in liver tissue. The results showed that polyploidization contributed to the conversion of homoeologue ELD. In addition, hybridization had more effect on the change in HEB than polyploidization, while polyploidization had more effect on the change of global gene expression than hybridization. Meanwhile, similar expression patterns were found in growth-related genes. The results suggested that hybridization and polyploidization result in differential degrees of maternal HEB in three tissues (liver, muscle and ovary) tested. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the underlying regulation mechanism of rapid growth in diploid hybrids and allotetraploids. The differential degrees of global expression and homoeologue expression contribute to growth heterosis in newly formed hybrids, ensuring the ongoing success of allotetraploid speciation.

However, flowers of Impatiens L. have never been recognized as hosts for drosophilid flies until recently: two Hirtodrosophila species, H. actinia (Okada) and H. yapingi Gao, were found feeding and breeding on Impatiens flowers. During our recent field surveys in central and southern China, a great number of drosophilid flies morphologically resembling the two species were collected, almost exclusively from flowers of Impatiens (family Balsaminaceae) and the family Gesneriaceae. In the present study, these specimens were identified on the basis of morphological characters and/or partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, used as a barcoding marker). As a result, 39 new species were recognized. We then reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among most of them, based on concatenated DNA sequences (3047 nucleotide sites) of two mitochondrial (COI and COII, i.e., cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II, respectively) and three nuclear genes (ATPsyn-alpha, alphaTub84B and Hsc70cb, i.e., ATP synthase alpha, alpha-Tubulin at 84B and Hsc70Cb isoform H, respectively). In the resulting Bayesian and ML (maximum likelihood) trees, three well-supported clades were recognized, with a few species having remained uncertain for their phylogenetic positions. We also conducted a cladistic analysis with data of adult morphological characters to investigate the phylogenetic positions of a few species of which DNA sequence data were not available, and to investigate the classification of species groups with definition of their diagnoses. In consequence, we established a new genus, Impatiophila, for the species visiting flowers of Impatiens and Gesneriaceae, described all the new species, and revised the taxonomy of some known species.

The MnO(OH) is in diameters of 4 similar to 8 nm and lengths up to several micrometers. The carbon particulates are of sphere-like morphological structures with diameters of 50 nm. With the reaction time increasing from 6 h to 9 h, the shapes of the carbon particulates turn to more regular. The cycle voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge performances of the composites were analyzed with the composites as the working electrodes and nickel foam as the counter electrodes in 1.0 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolytes. The results show that a specific capacitance of 116.3 F/g can be obtained at a current density of 0.2 A/g and a retention of 82.6% is observed when current density increases to 2.0 A/g.

The results show that the specific capacitance of NiO and RGO/NiO reach 310 F/g and 360 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The RGO/NiO composite shows slightly improved electrochemical performance in comparison with pure NiO, which is attributed to the fact that RGO increases electron transfer rate and provides the volume relaxation space for NiO volume change during the electrochemical process.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the final products. The adsorption properties of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni composite was tested by the adsorption of azo dye Congo red (CR). The as-prepared Ni(OH)(2)/Ni composite is found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of Congo red pollutant from wastewater. Furthermore, the solid/liquid separation is fairly easy, as the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni composite dispersed in water can be easily attracted using a magnet due to its paramagnetic behavior, making them a promising candidate for wastewater treatment.

Therefore, this paper explores the solvent extraction of Pt(IV) and Pt(II) using S-201 as an extractant. The results show that less than 20% of Pt(II) can be extracted under the optimum conditions, whereas Pt(IV) is hardly extracted by S-201. The Pt(II) extraction percentage decreases with an increase of hydrochloric acid concentration in aqueous phase. Elevating reaction temperature and prolonging the contact time of organic and aqueous phase have favorably influences on the Pt(II) extraction. In addition, the extraction rate can be significantly increased with the increase in either S-201 concentration or modifier TBP concentration. The paper also discusses the exaction mechanism of Pt(IV) and Pt(II). The platinum extraction efficiency decreases from 2.34% to 0.85% after oxidizing Pt(II) to Pt(IV). The results suggest that the effective method of reducing coextraction of platinum with palladium using S-201 as extractant is to maintain the valence state of platinum in four.

Potassium permanganate, manganese sulfate and graphene oxide (GO) were used as oxygenant, reductant and complex agent, respectively. The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized sample were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthetic method can avoid some complicated procedures and remarkably enhance the electrochemical behaviors of manganese dioxide compared with other methods. Without consumption of carbon source in the synthesis of the nanocomposites, it can dramatically enlarge active-sites between manganese dioxide and graphene oxide; at the same time, it can also greatly increase the utilization of manganese dioxide. Therefore, it is a promising potential method to prepare the compounds which can be used as an effective electrode material for ultracapacitor.

Several factors affecting extraction efficiency, including DDPB concentration, modifier content, equilibrium time, phase ratio (O/A), pH and palladium concentration in aqueous phase, were studied. The results indicated that nearly all of the Pd(II) (>98%) was transferred from the aqueous phase into the organic phase. N-pentanol was the most appropriate modifier for the extraction of Pd(CN)(4)(2-). Palladium can be separated efficiently by DDPB over base metals (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) from alkaline cyanide medium. The extraction was quite fast and equilibrium could be established within 3 min. Most of Pd(II) (>96%) in the organic phase could be stripped with ammonium thiocyanate aqueous solutions, from which elemental palladium could potentially be recovered by the addition of hydrazine hydrate. The organic phase after stripping can be recycled for a continuous extraction-stripping operation. The extraction mechanism can be deduced based on FTIR spectrum and slope analysis while the mechanism of stripping can be explained by the principle of minimum charge density and Le Chatelier's principle. The proposed method was applied to extract palladium from real cyanide leaching liquor of Pd flotation concentrate with satisfactory results.

The novel isolates were Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, aerobic ovoid- to coccoid-shaped and non-spore-forming. Strain YIM 78023(T) grew at 20-60 degrees C and pH 6.0-9.0 with optimal growth observed at 40-50 degrees C and pH 8.0, while strain YIM 78058 grew at 25-60 degrees C and pH 6.0-10.0 with optimal growth at 45-50 degrees C and pH 8.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated these two isolates within the family Acetobacteraceae with high sequence similarities to members of the genera Roseomonas and Belnapia (all sequence similarities <94.5 %). In addition to the above two genera, these strains also clustered with the genera Craurococcus and Paracraurococcus (having sequence similarities <93.3%) in the phylogenetic tree, but with a distinct lineage within the family Acetobacteraceae. The major ubiquinone was 0-10 and the major fatty acids observed were C-18:1 omega 7c, summed feature 4 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G+C contents observed for strains YIM 78023(T) and YIM 78058 were 74.3 and 74.0 mol%, respectively. Morphological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results suggest that strains YIM 78023(T) and YIM 78058 are representatives of a novel species of a new genus within the family Acetobacteraceae, for which the name Crenalkalicoccus roseus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Crenalkalicoccus roseus is YIM 78023(T) (=JCM 19657(T)=KACC 17825(T)).

Most uncertain data mining algorithms consider aleatory (random) uncertainty of data, i.e. these algorithms require that exact probability distributions or confidence values are attached to uncertain data. However, knowledge about uncertainty may be incomplete in the case of epistemic (incomplete) uncertainty of data, i.e. probabilities of uncertain data may be imprecise, coarse, or missing in some applications. The paper focuses on uncertain data which miss probabilities, specially, value-uncertain discrete objects which miss probabilities (for short uncertain objects). On the other hand, classification is one of the most important tasks in data mining. But, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method to learn Naive Bayesian classifier from uncertain objects. So the paper studies Naive Bayesian classification of uncertain objects. Firstly, the paper defines interval probabilities of uncertain objects from probabilistic cardinality point of view, and bridges the gap between uncertain objects and the theory of interval probability by proving that interval probabilities are F-probabilities. Secondly, based on the theory of interval probability, the paper defines conditional interval probabilities including the intuitive concept and the canonical concept, and the conditional independence of the intuitive concept. Further, the paper gives a formula to effectively compute the intuitive concept. Thirdly, the paper presents a Naive Bayesian classifier with interval probability parameters which can handle both uncertain objects and certain objects. Finally, experiments with uncertain objects based on UCI data show satisfactory performances.

By mainly considering the mutual associations among the given objects and based on the game theory, in this paper we study the multi-objective oriented categorization. Based on the idea of Shapley value in the coalitional game, we first propose the concept of priority groups and give the efficient algorithm for computing the satisfaction degree of players in a group. Based on the idea of strategic games and Nash equilibrium, we then give the algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium to solve the conflicts between the strategies of players, and consequently achieve the ultimate multi-objective oriented groups. Preliminary experiments and performance studies verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.

The colorimetric and fluorescence responses, allowing naked-eye detections, are based on Hg2+-induced opening of the rhodamine spirocycle. Among all the testes ions, only Hg2+ generated a significant fluorescence enhancement of up to 300-fold, with a bright yellow-green emission. This sensor was a low toxic compound, and was successfully applied in the in vivo imaging of Hg2+ in Spill 2 cells and C. elegans. This approach provides a sensitive and accurate method for the estimation of Hg2+ in environmental, tobacco and biological applications.

To infer the biogeographic history of the woodwardioid ferns, the phylogeny of Woodwardia was estimated using rbcL and rps4 sequences from divergent distribution regions including the Himalayas. Phylogenetic results support Woodwardia as a monophyletic group with Woodwardia areolatae and W virginica as basal, these two species from eastern North America diverged early, which are sister clades to the remaining species from America, Europe, and Asia. Based on analyses of the fossil records of these species for divergence times, Woodwardia species were estimated to have diverged initially in the Paleogene of North America. After its New World origin, a greater diversification and expansion of Woodwardia occurred in eastern Eurasia, with the European arrival of Woodwardia radicans during the Middle Miocene. Compared to earlier reports, a migration back into North America via the Bering land bridge is consistent with these data.

The influence of Ba contents on phase structures, compositional distribution and electrical properties of (Na0.5Bi0.5)(1-x)BaxTiO3 ceramics were systematically investigated to further understand the nature of phase transition. It was found that the phase structure of (Na0.5Bi0.5)(1-x)BaxTiO3 transforms from rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry at x = 0.06 similar to 0.07 and Ba2+ segregation forms the coexistence of Ba-rich tetragonal and Ba-deficient rhombohedral phases close to MPB. The electrical properties of prepared samples regularly changed with Ba content, which is closely related to the distribution of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. The prepared sample near MPB exhibited the largest dielectric constant and the excellent piezoelectric properties (the maximal measuring field reached 78 kV/cm and the piezoelectric constant d (33) = 151pC/N).

The co-aggregates were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde; meanwhile dextrin and xanthan gum as protecting agents were added, which provides high affinity with the enzyme molecules. The immobilized glucoamylase was stable over a broad range of pH (3.0-8.0) and temperature (55-75 degrees C); dependence shows more catalytic activity than a free enzyme. The thermostability, kinetic behavior, and first-order inactivation rate constant (k(i)) were investigated. The two types of protector made the immobilized glucoamylase more robust than the free form. Both of the immobilized enzymes have excellent recyclability, retaining over 45% of the relative activity after 24 runs. In addition, immobilized enzymes reduced only 40% of the initial activity after three months by the storability measure, indicating high activity.

Here, we demonstrate that plasmon modes in graphene-coated dielectric nanowire (GNW) waveguides can be excited by a monolayer graphene ribbon. What is more the transverse resonant frequency spectrum of the GNW can be flexibly tuned by adjusting the chemical potential of graphene, and amplitude of the resonance peak varies linearly with the imaginary part of the analyte permittivity. As a consequence, the GNW works as a probe for capturing the molecular spectrum. Broadband sensing of toluene, ethanol and sulfurous anhydride thin layers is demonstrated by calculating the changes in spectral intensity of the propagating mode and the results show that the intensity spectra correspond exactly to the infrared spectra of these molecules. This may open an effective avenue to design sensors for detecting nanometric-size molecules in the terahertz and infrared regimes.

The stopband for a GW with two-layer PEC surfaces is carefully studied, considering the top-layer PEC width, pin size, pin height, columns of pins, as well as dielectric substrate thickness and permittivity. A strategy of the GW packaging for such an irregular PEC surface is presented. In addition to the unit cell-based stopband study, such GW packaging is also demonstrated for a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)-microstrip line structure, which is typical of the circuit with two-layer PEC surfaces. A Chebychev bandpass filter built on the SIW and microstrip line is finally designed and fabricated to provide experimental verifications. In particular, a dedicated defect of the side air gap existing in the SIW-based circuits using the GW PMC packaging is found, and an effective remedy is presented.

This paper efficiently mines the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations over spatially uncertain data sets and makes the following contributions: 1) the concept of the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations based on a possible world model is defined; 2) a framework for discovering the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations is set up; 3) a matrix method is proposed to improve the computation of the prevalence probability of a top-k candidate, and two pruning rules of the matrix block are given to accelerate the search for exact solutions; 4) a polynomial matrix is developed to further speed up the top-k candidate refinement process; 5) an approximate algorithm with compensation factor is introduced so that relatively large quantity of data can be processed quickly. The efficiency of our proposed algorithms as well as the accuracy of the approximation algorithms is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments using both synthetic and real uncertain data sets.

To identify the requirements for a successful evacuation, we first investigated the casualties in the Ludian earthquake. Then, a simulation model was developed using a typical building destroyed during the earthquake. This model was integrated with the social force model to describe indoor earthquake evacuation behaviors under different conditions. Instantaneous average speed and social forces were estimated. Finally, the acquired safety escape time (ASET) was determined using finite-element method. We adopted the pedestrian library of Any-Logic software to calculate the required safety escape time (RSET) values under different conditions. We found that RSET was greater than ASET. Thus, people at home failed to escape. RSET varied with escaping velocity. RSET decreased as the velocity increased in a certain range. RSET was influenced by people distribution across rooms. Wall designs affected RSET. A reasonable wall layout could shorten the path distance and consequently reduce RSET. The results of the present work implied that ASET is related to earthquake ground motion (EGM). Seismic energy is concentrated at the start of EGM. Therefore, buildings collapse instantly, and people at home hardly escape from the indoors and must seek temporary security zones in their rooms. In addition, the relative velocity seismic response of a building should be considered.

Spatial and temporal patterns of drought have been analyzed by several methods, ranging from satellite images to historical records; however, drought is generally identified by climate elements. Drought indices are quantitative measures that characterize drought levels by assimilating data from one or several variables (indicators). A number of different indices have been developed to quantify droughts, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, using the remote sensing image to acquire the vegetation cover data, and combined with meteorological data and the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to discuss the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought. Based on precipitation observations Pu'er City, Yunnan Province, ten counties (districts) ten meteorological observation stations from 1961 to 2010 monthly for 50 years, mainly in ArcGIS10.1 analysis platform, using Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test method for time-series trends in precipitation was tested, using ArcGIS in inverse distance weighting interpolation tool were precipitation the amount and distribution of precipitation anomaly percentage. Finally, precipitation anomaly percentage grading standards drought intensity distribution of drought The results showed that: Pu'er City under the effect of temperature, altitude, vegetation cover, and many other factors, forming the situation that the rainfall is a little more in north-south and less in east-west, the drought incidence appears more in northwest and less in southeast, more in spring and winter and less in summer and fall.

The results revealed that both bacterial and archaeal community composition differed between regions and archaeal community composition was more affected by season than bacterial; regardless of sampling location, the dominant bacterial phyla included Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, and the most dominant archaeal phylum was Euryarchaeota; in digesters from both regions, Chloroflexi as the first or second most dominant bacteria accounted for 21.50-26.10 % of bacterial library sequences, and the phylum Crenarchaeota as the second most dominant archaea accounted for 17.65-19.77 % of archaeal library sequences; the species Methanosaeta concilii as the most dominant archaeal species accounted for 67.80-72.80 % of the sequences. This study found that most of the abundant microbial communities in 19 biogas digesters are similar, and this result will provide enlightenment for finding the universal nature in rural biogas digesters at tropical and subtropical regions in China.

By assuming a time-dependent broken power-law injection and spatial dependence of convection velocity, magnetic field strength and diffusion coefficient on the radial distance of an expanding system, we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck transport equation including convection, diffusion, adiabatic loss and radiative loss in spherical coordinates, and investigate the effects of magnetic field, PWN age, maximum energy of electrons, and diffusion coefficient on electron spectra and non-thermal photon emissions. Our results indicate that (1) electron spectra and the corresponding photon spectra are a function of radial distance r of the expanding system; (2) for a given expansion velocity, the increase of the PWN age causes a slower decrease of the convection velocity (V proportional to r(-beta)) and a more rapid decrease of the magnetic field strength (B proportional to r(-1+-beta)), but a more rapid increase of the diffusion coefficient (kappa proportional to r(1+beta)) because the index beta decreases with the PWN age; and (3) the lower energy part of the electron spectra is dominated by convection and adiabatic loss, but the higher energy part is dominated by the competition between synchrotron loss and diffusion, and such a competition is a function of radial distance. Therefore the diffusion effect has an important role in the evolution of electron spectra as well as non-thermal photon spectra in a PWN.

Manifold ranking (MR) has been used to great effect for the saliency detection, since it not only incorporates the local spatial information but also utilizes the labeling information from background queries. However, MR completely ignores the feature information extracted from each superpixel. In this paper, we propose an MR-based matrix factorization (MRMF) method to overcome this limitation. MRMF models the ranking problem in the matrix factorization framework and embeds query sample labels in the coefficients. By incorporating spatial information and embedding labels, MRMF enforces similar saliency values on neighboring superpixels and ranks superpixels according to the learned coefficients. We prove that the MRMF has good generalizability, and develops an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Nesterov method. Experiments using popular benchmark data sets illustrate the promise of MRMF compared with the other state-of-the-art saliency detection methods.

With increasing growth temperature, Ge films undergo a transition from amorphous to microcrystalline, then to polycrystalline. After annealing, these thin films transform into polycrystalline films with the (111) preferred orientation and identical crystal sizes. The surfaces of the amorphous and microcrystalline Ge films are severely coarsened, whereas the polycrystalline Ge film still displays a smooth surface. The growth mechanisms of Ge films with different crystalline phases in the annealing process are discussed, which can explain their morphology evolutions. Additionally, their infrared absorptions are enhanced after annealing, and this is useful for fabricating high-efficiency Si-based solar cells.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete polyprotein sequences of YCNMV and selected members of the family Potyviridae clearly showed that this virus should be assigned to the genus Macluravirus and suggest that YCNMV is a new member of the genus Macluravirus.

Experimental results demonstrate that addition of BESO into the organic phase can significantly enhance the basicity of amine N1923, in which the pH(50) value can reach up to 11.91. Slope analysis suggested that the composition of the extracted complexes in the organic phase is [Au(CN)(2)(-)center dot RNH3+center dot 2BESO]. The extracted complexes were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electrical conductivity analysis. FTIR and H-1 NMR studies reveal strong interactions between BESO and N1923 molecules through hydrogen bonding between the O atoms in the S=O groups and the H atoms in the -NH2 groups, forming S=O center dot center dot center dot H-N. This hydrogen bonding enhances the basicity of N1923 and consequently the ability of N1923 to capture proton; Au(CN)(2)(-) serves as a counter anion against the protonated amine cation in the organic phase. Electrical conductivity measurements confirmed ionic character of the extracted complexes. The Au(I) extraction in the N1923/BESO system most probably involves the ion-association (ion pair) mechanism. A plausible microstructural model of the extracted complexes was proposed in the paper. Moreover, gold could be efficiently stripped from the loaded organic phase by using sodium hydroxide solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The multiblock copolymers were produced within seven hours with narrow latex particle size distribution, high solid content and good latex stability. The thermal stability, thermal processability, microphase separation and mechanical properties of multiblock copolymers as well as corresponding random and blending (co)polymers were also investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) instrument, Haake torque rheometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), tensile and impact tests, respectively. The TG results revealed the multiblock copolymer has a good thermal stability with the initial decomposition temperature higher than 350 A degrees C. Rheological results demonstrated that the multiblock copolymers have higher torque values than corresponding random and blending (co)polymers. DSC and SEM analysis denoted that there exists phase separation of multiblock and blending (co)polymers. For multiblock copolymer, the impact strength increased by 27.39 % to 7. 44 kJ m(-2) with the composition of 60 wt% of styrene units and 40 wt% of n-butyl acrylate units. The tensile strength of multiblock copolymer increased with the increase of styrene composition.

They are ubiquitously associated with almost all plants studied to date. Numerous studies have indicated that these fungi have an impressive array of biotechnological potential, such as enzyme production, biocontrol agents, plant-growth promoting agents, bioremediation, biodegradation, biotransformation, biosynthesis and nutrient cycling. These fungi may represent an underexplored reservoir of novel biological resources for exploitation in the pharmaceutical, industry and agriculture.

This is a challenging intelligent video surveillance problem that remains an active area of research due to the need for performance improvement. Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Although the keep it simple and straightforward (KISS) metric learning method for discriminative distance metric learning has been shown to be effective for the person re-identification, the estimation of the inverse of a covariance matrix is unstable and indeed may not exist when the training set is small, resulting in poor performance. Here, we present dual-regularized KISS (DR-KISS) metric learning. By regularizing the two covariance matrices, DR-KISS improves on KISS by reducing overestimation of large eigenvalues of the two estimated covariance matrices and, in doing so, guarantees that the covariance matrix is irreversible. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses for supporting the motivations. Specifically, we first prove why the regularization is necessary. Then, we prove that the proposed method is robust for generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging person re-identification datasets, VIPeR, GRID, and CUHK 01, and show that DR-KISS achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

This strain was capable of resisting arsenate and arsenite with MICs of 40 and 20 mM, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene of the novel isolate displayed 96.7-94.2% sequence similarities to those of other known species of the genus Luteimonas. The respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8). The DNA G+C content was 71.4 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0, iso-C-11:0, iso-C-11:0 3-OH and iso-C-17:1 omega 9c. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. Phylogenetic and physiological analysis indicated that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Luteimonas, for which the name Luteimonas arsenica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 26-35(T) (=KCTC 42824(T)=CCTCC AB 2014326(T)).

The magnitude of a trend was estimated using Sen's Nonparametric Estimator of Slope approach. The statistical significance of a trend was assessed by the MK test. The results showed that mean annual air temperature has been increasing by 0.08 degrees C /decade during the past 50 years as a whole. The climate change trend in air temperature was more significant in the winter (0.13 degrees C/decade) than in the summer (0.03 degrees C/decade). Annual precipitation tended to increase slightly thereafter and the increasing was mainly during the crop-growing season. Both the greatest variation of the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation were observed at the dry-hot valley area of middle reaches. Significant warming rates were found in the upper reaches whereas the dry-hot basins of middle reaches experienced a cooling trend during the past decades. Despite of the overall increasing in precipitation, more obvious upward-trends were found in the dry-hot basins of middle reaches whereas the upper reaches had a drought trend during the past decades.

The endosperm genomic DNA hypomethylation has been identified in angiosperm, but it is difficult to dissect the mechanism of how this hypomethylation is established and maintained because endosperm is ephemeral and disappears with seed development in most dicots. Castor bean (Ricinus communis), unlike Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), endosperm is persistent throughout seed development, providing an excellent model in which to dissect the mechanism of endosperm genomic hypomethylation in dicots. We characterized the DNA methylation-related genes encoding DNA methyltransferases and demethylases and analyzed their expression profiles in different tissues. We examined genomic methylation including CG, CHG, and CHH contexts in endosperm and embryo tissues using bisulfite sequencing and revealed that the CHH methylation extent in endosperm and embryo was, unexpectedly, substantially higher than in previously studied plants, irrespective of the CHH percentage in their genomes. In particular, we found that the endosperm exhibited a global reduction in CG and CHG methylation extents relative to the embryo, markedly switching global gene expression. However, CHH methylation occurring in endosperm did not exhibit a significant reduction. Combining with the expression of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mapped within transposable element (TE) regions and genes involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, we demonstrate that the 24-nucleotide siRNAs played a critical role in maintaining CHH methylation and repressing the activation of TEs in persistent endosperm development. This study discovered a novel genomic DNA methylation pattern and proposes the potential mechanism occurring in dicot seeds with persistent endosperm.

We proved that for rotationally symmetric maps between rotationally symmetric spaces, both biharmonicity and f-biharmonicity reduce to a 2nd order linear ordinary differential equation. As applications, we give a method to produce biharmonic maps and f-biharmonic maps from given biharmonic maps and we construct many examples of biharmonic and f-biharmonic maps from the standard sphere S-2 and between two such spheres. Our examples include non-conformal proper biharmonic maps from Riemann spheres (S-2, f(-1)g(0)) -> S-2 and (S-2, f(-1)g(0)) -> S-n, or non-conformal f-biharmonic maps from the standard spheres (S-2, g(0)) -> S-2 and (S-2, g(0)) -> S-n with two singular points.

These ZTO films have been systematically studied for the application in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). The Hall effects measurements show that the charge mobility of the ZTO semiconductor is over 16.5 cm(2).V-1.S-1, which is the highest mobility value ever reported for oxide buffer made by using solution process. By applying the ZTO buffer layer in the inverted PSCs of P3HT:PC61BM, the power conversion efficiency of the device is 30% higher than that of the devices made with other common buffer layers such as ZnO and TiO2. Light intensity-dependent JV studies and PL measurements also indicate that ZTO buffer layer reduces surface recombination. This work demonstrates that the solution-synthesized ZTO is a promising new buffer layer with superior electron extraction capability for the solar cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Relationship between flavonoids and photoprotection in shade-developed Erigeron breviscapus transferred to sunlight	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						chlorophyll fluorescence; flavonoid; phenolics; protection; photodamage	CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE; ASCORBIC-ACID; HIGH LIGHT; PEROXIDASE REACTION; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; XANTHOPHYLL CYCLE; PHOTOINHIBITION; LEAVES; STRESS; PLANTS	Flavonoids are thought to participate in protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photoinhibition under excessive light. Flavone glycoside, scutellarin, is a main active ingredient extracted from Erigeron breviscapus, the plant used in Chinese medicine. Shade-developed leaves of E. breviscapus were transferred from shade to full sunlight to quantify a relationship between the concentration of leaf scutellarin and tolerance to high radiation stress or the recovery from photoinhibition. The maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry showed a diurnal fluctuation in both shaded and sunlit leaves throughout the day. It indicated dynamic photoinhibition in the leaves of Erigeron, i.e., higher photoinhibition at solar noon and lower one in the morning and late afternoon. The sun-developed leaves reached the higher scutellarin content and values of nonphotochemical quenching coefficient with a lower degree of photoinhibition than the shade-developed leaves. When the shade-developed leaves were transferred to full sunlight, the content of scutellarin was declining continuously for 10 d and then was increasing for 15 d. After 50 d, all leaves became the sun-developed leaves with their scutellarin contents of about 138.5 +/- 5.2 mg g(-1)(dry mass, DM) which was significantly higher than that of the shade-developed leaves [107.8 +/- 9.8 mg g(-1)(DM)]. During acclimatization, the degree of photoinhibition was negatively correlated with the scutellarin content. Our results demonstrated a synchronous fluctuation between the flavonoid content and degree of protection against photoinhibition.	[Zhou, R.; Su, W. H.; Zhang, G. F.; Zhang, Y. N.; Guo, X.

Rhinconichthys purgatoirensis sp. nov. is designated on a newly discovered specimen consisting of a nearly complete skull with pectoral elements. Only known previously by two Cenomanian age specimens from England and Japan, the North American specimen significantly extends the geographic and stratigraphic range of Rhinconichthys. The skull of Rhinconichthys is elongate, including an expansive gill basket, and estimated maximum body length ranges between 2.0 and 2.7 m. Rhinconichthys was likely an obligate suspension-feeder due to its derived cranial morphology, characterized by a remarkably large and elongate hyomandibula. The hyomandibula mechanically acts as a lever to thrust the jaw articulation and hyoid arch both ventrally and anterolaterally during protraction, thus creating a massive buccal space to maximize filtering of planktonic prey items. Cladistic analysis supports a monophyly of suspension-feeding pachycormids including Rhinconichthys, but further resolution within this Glade will require more information through additional fossil specimens.

In this study, polyphyllin VII (PPL7) was biotransformed by endophytes from the medicinal plant Paris polyphylla Smith, var. yunnanensis. This produced a new compound, ZH-2, with pharmacological activity in vitro and in vivo. ZH-2 was more potent than PPL7 in selectively killing more chemoresistant than chemosensitive breast cancer cells. ZH-2 also re-sensitized chemoresistant breast cancer cells, as evidenced by the improved anti-cancer activity of commonly-used chemotherapeutic agent in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical samples. This anti-chemoresistance effect of ZH-2 was associated with inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Taken together, our findings are the first one to link biotransformation with a biomedicine. The results provide insights into developing new pharmacologically-active agents via biotransformation by endophytes.

In this paper, the radiation characteristics of circular microstrip patch antenna was firstly analyzed based on cavity model theory, and then spiral beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) were generated, using elliptical microstrip patch antenna, with a single feed probe instead of a standard circular patch with two feedpoints. Moreover, by combining the proposed elliptic microstrip patch antenna with Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), a wireless OAM transmission system was established and the real-time transmission of text, image and video in a real channel environment was realized. Since the wireless OAM transmission has the advantage of good safety and high spectrum utilization efficiency, this work has theoretical significance and potential application.

The surface and cross-section morphologies of the formed pyramid structure were examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The results revealed that numerous silicon pyramid-like structures with hemlines of 0.1 similar to 3 pin and height of 0.1 2 pin are close together, and the top angle of the pyramid structure is 90 degrees. Additionally, the systematic study of the effects of the etching time and the concentration of FeCl3 on the pyramid-like structures by the atom configuration model of silicon crystal faces demonstrated that the etching proceeds preferentially along the < 100 > directions of silicon. A formation mechanism of the pyramid-like structure is proposed. The results imply that the synergetic effect of Cu nanoparticles and Fe(III) could conveniently generate a pyramid-like architecture on the surface of silicon in hydrofluoric acid solution.

The effects of operating parameters, such as feed solution pH, flow rate ratio, the high gravity factor, the concentration of D2EHPA, initial iron concentration, stripping solution concentration were examined. The experimental results showed that the IS-RPB was effective in the separation of In(III) and Fe(III)under favorable operating conditions. The extraction and stripping efficiency as high as 99% could be achieved, at a separation factor in excess of 3000. Compared with other mixing devices, IS-RPB contactor has better micromixing characteristics, which has a good application prospect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We find that the stacking geometries and interlayer distances significantly affect the electronic structure of G/h-BN systems. By studying four stacking geometries, we conclude that the monolayer G/h-BN systems should possess metallic electronic properties. The monolayer G/h-BN systems can be transited from metallicity to semiconductor by increasing h-BN layers. It reveals that the alteration of interlayer distances 2.50-3.50 angstrom can obtain the metal semiconductor semimetal variation and a tunable band gap for G/h-BN composite systems. The band dispersion along K-H direction is analogous to the band of rhombohedral graphite when the G/h-BN systems are semiconducting.

How to choose adequate number of principal components (PCs) to represent the original system in an optimal way is a key issue for PCA. Note that the traditional PCA, only using a few top PCs while discarding the other PCs, might significantly lose power in genetic association studies if all the PCs contain non-ignorable signals. In order to make full use of information from all PCs, Aschard and his colleagues have proposed a multi-step combined PCs method (named mCPC) recently, which performs well especially when several traits are highly correlated. However, the power superiority of mCPC has just been illustrated by simulation, while the theoretical power performance of mCPC has not been studied yet. In this work, we attempt to investigate theoretical properties of mCPC and further propose a novel and efficient strategy to combine PCs. Extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed method is more robust than existing procedures. A real data application to detect the association between gene TRAF1-C5 and rheumatoid arthritis further shows good performance of the proposed procedure.

Plant communities respond to environmental gradients via intraspecific and/or interspecific variation in plant functional traits. However, the relative contribution of these two responses to environmental factors remains poorly tested. We measured six functional traits (height, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf carbon concentration (LCC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC)) for 55 tree species occurring at five elevations across a 1200 m elevational gradient of subalpine forests in Yulong Mountain, Southwest China. We examined the relative contribution of interspecific and intraspecific traits variability based on community weighted mean trait values and functional diversity, and tested how different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes (climate and soil variables). Species turnover explained the largest amount of variation in leaf morphological traits (leaf thickness and SLA) across the elevational gradient. However, intraspecific variability explained a large amount of variation (49.3%-76.3%) in three other traits (height, LNC and LPC) despite high levels of species turnover. The detection of limiting similarity in community assembly was improved when accounting for both intraspecific and interspecific variability. Different components of trait variation respond to different environmental axes, especially soil water content and climatic variables. Our results indicate that intraspecific variation is critical for understanding community assembly and evaluating community response to environmental change.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that an easily available MOF, Fe-MIL-101, possesses intrinsic activity against human SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells and suppress the proliferation of SKOV3 cells (IC50 = 23.6 mu g mL(-1)) and normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (BABL-3T3, IC50 = 78.3 mu g mL(-1)) cells. It was more effective against SKOV3 cells than typical anticancer drugs such as artesunate (ART, IC50 = 96.9 mu g mL(-1)) and oxaliplatin (OXA, IC50 = 64.4 mu g mL(-1)), but had less effect on normal BABL-3T3 cells compared with ART (IC50 = 36.6 mu g mL(-1)) and OXA (IC50 = 13.8 mu g mL(-1)). Fe-MIL-101 induced apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in HUVECs and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Fe-MIL-101 exhibited stronger antiangiogenic effects in HUVEC cells than antiangiogenic inhibitor (SU5416) via downregulation the expression of MMP-2/9. Our results reveal a new role of Fe-MIL-101 as a novel, non-toxic anti-angiogenic agent that restricted ovarian tumour growth. These findings could open a new avenue of using MOFs as potential therapeutics in angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including ovarian cancer.

The larva possesses a pair of three-fingered great appendages, a hypostome, and four pairs of well-developed biramous appendages. More posteriorly, a series of rudimentary limb Anlagen revealed by X-ray microcomputed tomography shows a gradient of decreasing differentiation toward the rear. This, and postembryonic segment addition at the putative growth zone, are features of late-stage metanauplii of eucrustaceans. L. illecebrosa and other SGA arthropods, however, are considered representative of early chelicerates or part of the stem lineage of all euarthropods. The larva of an early Cambrian SGA arthropod with a small number of anterior segments and their respective appendages suggests that posthatching segment addition occurred in the ancestor of Euarthropoda.

However, studies identifying local-scale WAs for on-ground conservation efforts are still very limited. This paper investigated the spatial patterns of wilderness in a global biodiversity hotspot - Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) in southwest China. Wilderness was classified into levels 1 to 10 based on a cluster analysis of five indicators, namely human population density, naturalness, fragmentation, remoteness, and ruggedness. Only patches characterized by wilderness level 1 and >= 1.0 km(2) were considered WAs. The wilderness levels in the northwest were significantly higher than those in the southeast, and clearly increased with the increase in elevation. The WAs covered approximately 25% of TPRR's land, 89.3% of which was located in the >3,000m elevation zones. WAs consisted of 20 vegetation types, among which temperate conifer forest, cold temperate shrub and alpine ecosystems covered 79.4% of WAs' total area. Most WAs were still not protected yet by existing reserves. Topography and human activities are the primary influencing factors on the spatial patterns of wilderness. We suggest establishing strictly protected reserves for most large WAs, while some sustainable management approaches might be more optimal solutions for many highly fragmented small WAs.

The intrinsic hollow nanostructure can shorten the lengths for both electronic and ionic transport, enlarge the surface areas of electrodes, and improve accommodation of the volume change during Na+ insertion/extraction cycling. Therefore, The stable reversible capacity of Fe2O3@MIL-101(Fe)/C electrode is 710 mAhg(-1), and can be retained at 662 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles with the retention of 93.2%. Especially, its overall rate performance data confirm again the importance of the hierarchical hollow structures and multi-elements characteristics toward high capacities in both low and high current rates. This general strategy may shed light on a new avenue for fast synthesis of hierarchic hollow functional materials for energy storage, catalyst, sensor and other new applications.

With the help of a chain rule of subdifferential established in the paper, without the solvability assumption, we provide a sufficient condition for a nonconvex inequality to have a global generalized error bound.

YIM 342 was partially purified by ultrafiltration followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and dialysis. This procedure was followed by a single purification step using gel filtration chromatography to give a 10.41% yield, 1912.2U/mg specific activity, and 32-fold purification enrichment. The molecular mass of the purified a-amylase was determined to be 68 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimum temperature and pH of the a-amylase activity were 80 degrees C and 9.0, respectively. Furthermore, the high hydrolysis rate toward amylose and amylopectin suggested the enzyme has significant potential for applications in starch degradation. The K-m and V-max of the amylase toward soluble starch was 4.18 mu g/mL and 7.48 mmol/min/mg, respectively. This enzyme hydrolyzes soluble starch to glucose, maltose, and maltotriose, indicating that the amylase represents a promising candidate for applications in the biofuel industry.

ELEGANS; LIFE-SPAN; TERM STARVATION; DAUER FORMATION; FAT; NOREPINEPHRINE; CATECHOLAMINES; IDENTIFICATION; ANGIOGENESIS	Starvation is probably the most common stressful situation in nature. In vertebrates, elevation of the biogenic amine norepinephrine levels is common during starvation. However, the precise role of norepinephrine in nutrient deprivation remains largely unknown. We report that in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, up-regulation of the biosynthesis of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine, serves as a mechanism to adapt to starvation. During nutrient deprivation, the nuclear receptor DAF-12, known to sense nutritional cues, up-regulates the expression of tbh-1 that encodes tyramine beta-hydroxylase, a key enzyme for octopamine biosynthesis, in the RIC neurons. Octopamine induces the expression of the lipase gene lips-6 via its receptor SER-3 in the intestine. LIPS-6, in turn, elicits lipidmobilization. Our findings reveal that octopamine acts as an endocrine regulator linking nutrient cues to lipolysis to maintain energy homeostasis, and suggest that such a mechanism may be evolutionally conserved in diverse organisms.

Existing theories suggest that diminished visual prowess among domestic chickens reflect changes driven by the relaxation of functional constraints on vision, but the evidence identifying the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for this change has not been definitively characterized. Here, a genome-wide analysis of the domestic chicken and Red Junglefowl genomes showed significant enrichment for positively selected genes involved in the development of vision. There were significant differences between domestic chickens and their wild ancestors regarding the level of mRNA expression for these genes in the retina. Numerous additional genes involved in the development of vision also showed significant differences in mRNA expression between domestic chickens and their wild ancestors, particularly for genes associated with phototransduction and photoreceptor development, such as RHO (rhodopsin), GUCA1A, PDE6B and NR2E3. Finally, we characterized the potential role of the VIT gene in vision, which experienced positive selection and downregulated expression in the retina of the village chicken. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection, rather than relaxation of purifying selection, contributed to the evolution of vision in domestic chickens. The progenitors of domestic chickens harboring weaker vision may have showed a reduced fear response and vigilance, making them easier to be unconsciously selected and/or domesticated.

An efficient implementation of such numerical scheme is often desired for practical usage. In this paper, based on fast discrete Sine transform, we design an efficient algorithm to implement this scheme. To do this, Poisson equation is first discretized by fourth-order compact finite difference method. The subsequent discretized system is not solved by the usual method matrix inversion, instead it is solved with the fast discrete Sine transform. By doing this way, the computational cost of proposed algorithm for such scheme with large grid numbers can be greatly reduced. Detailed numerical algorithm of this fast solver for one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three dimensional Poisson equation has been presented. Numerical results in one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions and four dimensions have shown that the applied compact finite difference scheme has fourth order accuracy and can be efficiently implemented.

The theory mentioned that the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) could be used to estimate the limiting distribution of the excess value over a certain threshold; thus the tail behaviors are analyzed. However, the central behavior is important because it may affect the estimation of model parameters in GPD, and the evaluation of catastrophic insurance premiums also depends on the central behavior. This paper proposes four mixture models to model earthquake catastrophic loss and proposes Bayesian approaches to estimate the unknown parameters and the threshold in these mixture models. MCMC methods are used to calculate the Bayesian estimates of model parameters, and deviance information criterion values are obtained for model comparison. The earthquake loss of Yunnan province is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. Results show that the estimation of the threshold and the shape and scale of GPD are quite different. Value-at-risk and expected shortfall for the proposed mixture models are calculated under different confidence levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the role of nutritional deficiencies in this metabolic reprogramming (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/glycolysis interconversion) is not completely known yet. Here, we showed that under regular culture condition, the proliferation of U251 cells, but not other tumor cell lines, preferentially performed the Warburg effect and was remarkably inhibited by oxamic acid which can inhibit the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); whereas under serum starvation, glycolysis was depressed, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) was enhanced, and the activity of OXPHOS was reinforced to maintain cellular ATP content in a high level, but interestingly, we observed a decreased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the upregulated activity of mitochondrial complex I was confirmed by Western blots and showed that the mitochondrial-related protein, NDUFA9, NDUFB8, ND1, and VDAC1 were remarkably increased after serum starved. Mechanistically, nutritional deficiencies could reduce hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protein expression to increase CMYC protein level, which in turn increased nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) transcription to enhance the activity of OXPHOS, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming by the changes of microenvironment during the carcinogenesis can provide some novel therapeutic clues to traditional cancer treatments.

The results revealed that G. luteus fermentation could significantly improve the antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of S. miltiorrhiza. The main antioxidant constituents were characterized by spectroscopic analysis as salvianolic acids. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantification also showed the enhanced content of salvianolic acid B after fermentation. The present study suggests that G. luteus fermentations are effective in the S. miltiorrhiza salvianolic acids' enrichment process.

Coordination of self-renewal in glioblastoma by integration of adhesion and microRNA signaling	NEURO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						cancer stem cell; glioblastoma; JAM-A; miR-145	GLIOMA STEM-CELLS; ADJUVANT TEMOZOLOMIDE; INITIATING CELLS; BRAIN-TUMORS; CANCER-CELLS; AKT PATHWAY; GROWTH; MIR-145; INVASION; IDENTIFICATION	Background. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) provide an additional layer of complexity for tumor models and targets for therapeutic development. The balance between CSC self-renewal and differentiation is driven by niche components including adhesion, which is a hallmark of stemness. While studies have demonstrated that the reduction of adhesion molecules, such as integrins and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), decreases CSC maintenance. The molecular circuitry underlying these interactions has yet to be resolved. Methods. MicroRNA screening predicted that microRNA-145 (miR-145) would bind to JAM-A. JAM-A overexpression in CSCs was evaluated both in vitro (proliferation and self-renewal) and in vivo (intracranial tumor initiation). miR-145 introduction into CSCs was similarly assessed in vitro. Additionally, The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was evaluated for expression levels of miR-145 and overall survival of the different molecular groups. Results. Using patient-derived glioblastoma CSCs, we confirmed that JAM-A is suppressed by miR-145. CSCs expressed low levels of miR-145, and its introduction decreased self-renewal through reductions in AKT signaling and stem cell marker (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) expression; JAM-A overexpression rescued these effects. These findings were predictive of patient survival, with a JAM-A/miR-145 signature robustly predicting poor patient prognosis. Conclusions. Our results link CSC-specific niche signaling to a microRNA regulatory network that is altered in glioblastoma and can be targeted to attenuate CSC self-renewal.

Strain CFH S0483(T) was able to grow at 10-37 degrees C, at pH 7.0-9.0 and tolerated NaCl up to 2.0 % (w/v). The whole-cell sugars were mannose, galactose, glucose and ribose. The isolate contained L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, D-alanine, D-glutamic acid and glycine in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Strain CFH S0483(T) exhibited a menaquinone system with MK-12, and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15 : 0, anteiso-C-17 : 0 and iso-C-16 : 0. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CFH S0483(T) was 71.6 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis, and low DNA-DNA hybridization values, strain CFH S0483(T) could not be classified into any recognized species of the genus Agromyces. Strain CFH S0483(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Agromyces, for which the name Agromyces insulae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CFH S0483(T) (=KCTC 39117(T) =CCTCC AB 2014301(T)).

The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in the connexins, gap junction proteins in vertebrate, has been implicated in regulating channel closure. However, little is known about how the hemichannel close responds to apoptotic signaling transduction leading to the reduction of neighboring cellular apoptosis in an invertebrate. An insect Bac-to-Bac expression system, pFastBacTM HT A, allows us to construct an N-terminally elongated SpliInx2 (Nte-Inx2) and SpliInx3 (Nte-Inx3). Here, we demonstrated that recombinant baculovirus Bac-Nte-Inx2 (reBac-Net-Inx2) and Bac-Nte-Inx3 (reBac-Nte-Inx3) closed the endogenous hemichannel on the Sf9 cell surface. Importantly, primary baculovirus infections significantly caused early apoptosis, and this apoptosis was reduced by hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells at 24-h post-infection (PI). Although N-terminal-elongated residue led to the increase in the phosphorylated sites in both Nte-Inx2 and Nte-Inx3 and an additional transmembrane domain in Nte-Inx3, both the proteins localized on the cell surface, suggesting Nte-Inxs proteins could mediate hemichannel closure. Further supporting evidence showed that hemichannel closure was dependent on N-Inxs expressed by baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, which began to express at 18-24 h PI. These results identify an unconventional function of N-terminal-elongated innexins that could act as a plug to manipulate hemichannel closure and provide a mechanism connecting the effect of hemichannel closure directly to apoptotic signaling transduction from intracellular to extracellular compartment.

The results indicate that the release of latent heating exerted by the low-frequency variability of anomalous land-sea thermal contrast is one of the most important physical processes correlating with the zonal movement of the IIE, in which the release of latent heating over eastern East Asia makes the greatest contribution. When a lower apparent moisture sink occurs over the South China Sea but a higher one over southern China, an anomalously positive land-sea thermal contrast is formed. An anomalous convergent zone in relation to the positive land-sea thermal contrast, located in the eastern part of the IIE, will favor the IIE to move more eastward than normal, and vice versa. An anomalous divergent zone located in the eastern part of the IIE will benefit the IIE to shift more westward than normal. Experiments using a linear baroclinic model confirm the physical processes revealed by the observational analysis.

Boosting is considered stronger than bagging on noise-free data set with complex class structures, whereas bagging is more robust than boosting in cases where noise data are present. In this paper, we extend both ensemble approaches to clustering tasks, and propose a novel hybrid sampling-based clustering ensemble by combining the strengths of boosting and bagging. In our approach, the input partitions are iteratively generated via a hybrid process inspired by both boosting and bagging. Then, a novel consensus function is proposed to encode the local and global cluster structure of input partitions into a single representation, and applies a single clustering algorithm to such representation to obtain the consolidated consensus partition. Our approach has been evaluated on 2-D-synthetic data, collection of benchmarks, and real-world facial recognition data sets, which show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing benchmarks for a variety of clustering tasks.

Here, we provide a novel structure (Al/Poly(9,9-di-n-octylfuorenyl-2,7-diyl)(PFO)/ZnO/ITO) to demonstrate the UV photovoltaic (PV) response. A rather smooth surface (RMS roughness: 0.28 nm) may be reached by solution process, which sheds light on the development of large-array, light-weight and low-cost UV FPA detectors.

The chemical structures, crystalline properties, phase change properties, thermal energy storage mechanism, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized PCMs were respectively characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, accelerated thermal cycling testing and thermogravimetric analysis. The intrinsic crystalline structure in SSPCMs is not influenced by the crosslinking reaction between two components. However, compared with the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), the lamellae and spherulite size in SSPCMs decrease to some entente and dramatically, respectively. The SSPCMs have proper phase change temperature of about 45 degrees C and high phase change enthalpy of about 100 J/g much less than the PEG, resulted from the small spherulite and lamellae size working together. The SSPCM-based thermal energy storage relies on the phase change from the crystalline state to the amorphous state and vice versa. The SSPCMs have good thermal reliability and stability with the degradation temperature higher than 300 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Study on the adaptive mechanisms to salt stress in hemp through comparative proteome analysis is one important way to solve this problem. In this paper, iTRAQ-based proteomics technology was first used to study the differential proteomics of leaves of seedling under salt stress (600 mM sodium chloride) for 4 days in salt-resistant industrial hemp and salt-sensitive varieties. There were 403 and 252 differential proteins identified through LC-ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry, respectively, and these were classified into 14 categories: primary metabolism, energy, protein destination and storage, disease/defense, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, transport, transcription, signal transduction, cell structure, secondary metabolism, intracellular traffic, cell growth/division and unknown. Hemp adapted to stress mainly by improved ATP metabolism, regulating photosynthesis according to light intensity, strengthening chlorophyll synthesis, promoting cell relaxation and enlargement, improving synthesis of osmoregulation substances, enhancing flow of inorganic sulfur in the body, regulating aquaporins, strengthening transmission of ion transport signals, improving signal transmission between proteins and between proteins and cytomembranes, improving selective absorption and transportation speed of organic and inorganic molecular, degrading hemicellulose cell walls, controlling transport of cellular material in and out, and promoting metabolism and cell stability. The results provide important reference information for research on molecular mechanisms of salt-stress adaption in hemp. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, the actinobacterium of the genus Sinomonas was reported to synthesis silver nanoparticles for the first time. A photo-irradiation based method was developed for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, which includes two day old cultural supernatant of novel species Sinomonas mesophila MPKL 26 and silver nitrate solution, exposed to sunlight. The preliminary synthesis of silver nanoparticles was noted by the color change of the solution from colorless to brown; the synthesis was further confirmed using UV-visible spectroscopy which shows a peak between 400 and 450 nm. Spherical shape silver nanoparticles of size range 4-50 nm were synthesized, which were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy result indicates that, the metabolite produced by the novel species S. mesophila MPKL 26 was the probable reducing/capping agent involved in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The synthesized silver nanoparticles maintained consistent shape with respect to different time periods. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were evaluated for the antimicrobial activity against multi drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus which show good antimicrobial activity. The method developed for synthesis is easy, requires less time (20 min) and produces spherical shape nanoparticles of size as small as 4 nm, having good antimicrobial activity. Hence, our study enlarges the scope of actinobacteria for the rapid biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and can be used in formulating remedies for multi drug resistant S. aureus.

The effects of fabrication parameters (deposition time, HF concentration, H2O2 concentration, and etching time) on the morphology structure, antireflection property of textured mc-Si were carefully studied. The large scale SiNWs arrays with different structure can be obtained under various fabrication conditions. Meanwhile, the results indicate that the fabricate parameters have important effect on the reflectance of textured mc-Si sample in the order of etching time > deposition time > H2O2 concentration > HF concentration. The comprehensive research results indicate that it is more beneficial for the nanowire arrays with tapering structure and the length of 13 mu m to obtain excellent antireflection property. Under these optimization conditions, the textured mc-Si shows an outstanding anti-reflectance ability of similar to 5.6%, which indicates that the Ag-catalysis etched mc-Si shows a huge potential application in high-efficiency polysilicon solar cells.

The software produces Classic Venn, Edwards' Venn and Nested Venn diagrams and allows for eight sets in a graph mode and 31 sets in data processing mode only. In comparison, previous programs produce Classic Venn and Edwards' Venn diagrams and allow for a maximum of six sets. The software incorporates user-friendly features and works in Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Its graphical interface does not require a user to have programing skills. Users can modify diagram content for up to eight datasets because of the Scalable Vector Graphics output. VennPainter can provide output results in vertical, horizontal and matrix formats, which facilitates sharing datasets as required for further identification of candidate genes. Users can obtain gene lists from shared sets by clicking the numbers on the diagram. Thus, VennPainter is an easy-to-use, highly efficient, cross-platform and powerful program that provides a more comprehensive tool for identifying candidate genes and visualizing the relationships among genes or gene families in comparative analysis.

J	Liu, WF; Ma, TZ; Tao, DP; You, JN				Liu, Weifeng; Ma, Tengzhou; Tao, Dapeng; You, Jane			HSAE: A Hessian regularized sparse auto-encoders	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Hessian regularization; Sparse representation; Auto-encoder; Manifold	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PERSON REIDENTIFICATION; IMAGE; FEATURES; NETWORK	Auto-encoders are one kinds of promising non-probabilistic representation learning paradigms that can efficiently learn stable deterministic features. Recently, auto-encoder algorithms are drawing more and more attentions because of its attractive performance in learning insensitive representation with respect to data changes. The most representative auto-encoder algorithms are the regularized auto-encoders including contractive auto-encoder, denoising auto-encoders, and sparse auto-encoders. In this paper, we incorporate both Hessian regularization and sparsity constraints into auto-encoders and then propose a new auto-encoder algorithm called Hessian regularized sparse auto-encoders (HSAE). The advantages of the proposed HSAE lie in two folds: (1) it employs Hessian regularization to well preserve local geometry for data points; (2) it also efficiently extracts the hidden structure in the data by using sparsity constraints. Finally, we stack the single-layer auto-encoders and form a deep architecture of HSAE. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct extensive experiments on the popular datasets including MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset and compare the proposed HSAE with the basic auto-encoders, sparse auto encoders, Laplacian auto-encoders and Hessian auto-encoders. The experimental results demonstrate that HSAE outperforms the related baseline algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main difficulty of large scale surveillance video summarization arises from the contradiction between the high-degree spatiotemporal redundancies and the limited storage budget. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of large scale surveillance video summarization on the basis of event detection. In the proposed approach, we firstly obtain the trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians in a tracking-by-detection manner, and then detect the abnormal events using the trajectories. Finally, we design a disjoint max-coverage algorithm to generate a summarized sequence with maximum coverage of interested events and minimum number of frames. Compared with traditional key frame-based approaches, our approach enjoys the following favorable features. First, important information can be efficiently extracted from the redundant contents since the approach is event-centric and those interested events contain almost all the important information. Second, abnormal events are successfully detected by combining the Random Forest classifier and the trajectory features. Third, the abnormal events are designed to display, and hence further reduces the compression ratio. Due to the above features, the proposed approach is suitable for different scenarios, ranges from highway to crowded crossings. Experiments on 12 surveillance sequences validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SIRT1, the human homolog of SIR2, is considered a candidate gene as a modifier of human life expectancy. Methods: In the current study we included 616 long-lived individuals and 846 matched younger controls to investigate associations between 8 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e., rs12778366, rs3758391, rs3740051, rs33957861, rs7896005, rs12413112, rs11599176 and rs4746720) in the SIRT1 gene and human longevity. Results: The 8 SNPs had strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and were in an LD block, which was characterized by 4 common haplotypes that capture 99.3 % of the genetic variation present within it. We found no evidence for statistically significant associations between the tested SIRT1 SNPs and longevity at the allele, genotype or haplotype levels. Conclusions: Current findings show that several common variants in SIRT1 are not associated with human longevity.

In a clinical setting, RAT is used to treat a variety of diseases; however, it can also result in physical dependence and addiction. To investigate the pharmacology and addiction mechanism of RAT as a medication, we have obtained the optimized structure of the dopamine III receptor (D3R) complex protein with RAT. On the basis of this structure, by using the method of potential mean force (PMF) with umbrella sampling and the simulated phospholipid bilayer membrane (also known as the POPC bilayer membrane), the molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain the trajectories with the changes of free energy on the structure for RAT to move along the molecular channels within D3R. The change of free energy for RAT to transfer toward the outside of the cell along the functioning molecular channel within D3R is 91.4 kJ " mo1-1. The change of free energy for RAT to transfer into the POPC bilayer membrane along the protecting molecular channel within D3R is 117.7 kJ " mo1-1. These results suggest that RAT is more likely to exert its molecular functions and to increase the release of functioning dopamine molecules by transferring along the functioning molecular channel within D3R, which result in a variety of functional effects by RAT including dependence and addiction. The obtained results show that the pharmacology and addiction mechanism of RAT as a medication are closely related to the molecular dynamics and mechanism for RAT to transfer along molecular channels within dopamine receptors.

Litsea species have been used globally in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases including influenza, stomach aches, diarrhea, diabetes, vomiting, bone pain, inflammation, illness related to the central nervous system and other ailments. The purpose of this review is to provide updated, comprehensive and categorized information on the ethnobotany, phytochemistry and pharmacological research of Litsea species in order to explore their therapeutic potential and evaluate future research opportunities. Materials and methods: All the available information on Litsea species was actualised by systematically searching the scientific literatures including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and South American herbal classics, library catalogs and scientific databases (PubMed, SciFinder, Web of Science, Google Scholar, VIP and Wanfang). The Plant List, International Plant Name index and Scientific Database of China Plant Species were used to validate scientific names. Results: 407 secondary metabolites have been reported from Litsea species. Litsea Species are sources of secondary metabolites with interesting chemical structures (alkaloids, lactones, sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, lignans, and essential oils) and significant bioactivities. Crude extracts, fractions and phytochemical constituents isolated from Litsea show a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-HIV, insecticidal, etc. Conclusions: From data collected in this review, the genus Litsea comprises a wide range of therapeutically promising and valuable plants, and has attracted much attention owing to its multiple functions. Many traditional uses of Litsea species have now been validated by modern pharmacology research. Deep and systematic phytochemical investigation of the genus Litsea and the pharmacological properties, especially its mechanism of action and toxicology, to illustrate its ethnomedicinal use, explore the therapeutic potential and support further health-care product development will undoubtedly be the focus of further research.

J	Guo, Y; Wang, DM				Guo, Yun; Wang, Deming			Studies on plant cuticles from the Lower-Middle Devonian of China	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY			English	Article						Cuticle; Epidermis; Stoma; Early plant; Devonian; China	DREPANOPHYCUS-SPINAEFORMIS; XUJIACHONG FORMATION; YUNNAN PROVINCE; LECLERCQIA-COMPLEXA; VASCULAR PLANTS; EASTERN YUNNAN; NEW-BRUNSWICK; LAND PLANTS; SP NOV.; NEMATOTHALLUS	Numerous plant cuticles were collected from five sections in the Lower-Middle Devonian of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, China. Based on these cuticles and published data, we recognize five types of stomata or stoma-like pores in Devonian plants, i.e., anomocytic, rosette and complex types of stomata, pores like in Nematothallus,h and pores within thick cuticle. Anomocytic and/or rosette types of stomata are more common in some horneophytopsids, rhyniopsids, renalioids, zosterophyllopsids, lycopsids and a progymnosperm. Complex type found only in the Middle Devonian likely occurred in Orestovia and Schuguria. Pores like in Nematothallus and pores within thick cuticle are documented in both the Lower and Middle Devonian and are usually observed on dispersed cuticles which have relationship with non-vascular plants. The various plant species share only five types of stomata and stoma-like pores. It is difficult to understand the exact affinities of epidermises without other macrofossil information.

In this study, we evaluated the fungal diversity in the rhizosphere soil of 2-yr-old healthy Panax notoginseng cultivated in Wenshan, China. Methods: Culture-independent Illumina MiSeq and culture-dependent techniques, combining molecular and morphological characteristics, were used to analyze the rhizospheric fungal diversity. A diffusion test was used to challenge the phytopathogens of P. notoginseng. Results: A total of 16,130 paired-end reads of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 were generated and clustered into 860 operational taxonomic units at 97% sequence similarity. All the operational taxonomic units were assigned to five phyla and 79 genera. Zygomycota (46.2%) and Ascomycota (37.8%) were the dominant taxa; Mortierella and unclassified Mortierellales accounted for a large proportion (44.9%) at genus level. The relative abundance of Fusarium and Phoma sequences was high, accounting for 12.9% and 5.5%, respectively. In total, 113 fungal isolates were isolated from rhizosphere soil. They were assigned to five classes, eight orders (except for an Incertae sedis), 26 genera, and 43 species based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer. Fusarium was the most isolated genus with six species (24 isolates, 21.2%). The abundance of Phoma was also relatively high (8.0%). Thirteen isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one test fungus. Conclusion: Our results suggest that diverse fungi including potential pathogenic ones exist in the rhizosphere soil of 2-yr-old P. notoginseng and that antagonistic isolates may be useful for biological control of pathogens.

J	Liu, J; Wang, CB; Liu, L; Sun, WH				Liu, Jin; Wang, Chuan-Bing; Liu, Lu; Sun, Wei-Huai			The response of local power grid at low-latitude to geomagnetic storm: An application of the Hilbert Huang transform	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; INDUCED CURRENTS; HAZARD	The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is an adaptive data analysis method that can accommodate the variety of data generated by nonlinear and nonstationary processes in nature. In this paper, we focus on the small geomagnetically induced current (GIC) at the local substations in low-latitude power grid of China, responding to a moderate storm on 14-18 July 2012. The HHT is applied to analyze the neutral point currents (NPCs) of transformers measured at different substations, and the GIC indices converted from local geomagnetic field measurements. The original data are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition. After removal of the quasi-diurnal components related with the solar quiet variation, the IMFs representing storm disturbances are transformed into Hilbert energy spectra. The results show that some transformers have more or less responses to the moderate storm in the form of Hilbert energy spectra with the frequency around 2-3 mHz. A comparison on the amplitude changes of the spectra total energy of NPCs' perturbation during storm time intervals at different sites suggests that a shell type of three-phase single transformer group seems to be more vulnerable in the storm. Although the low-latitude power grids usually show very small GIC, these can be used to investigate the potential risk of space weather to the system.

Converging evidence suggests that glutamatergic signaling seems to play important roles in the pathophysiology of depression. Methods: We studied the antidepressant effects of 3'-deoxyadenosine (3'-dA, Cordycepin) and the critical role of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor in male CD-1 mice via behavioral and biochemical experiments. After 3'-dA treatment, the phosphorylation and synaptic localization of the AMPA receptors GluR1 and GluR2 were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). The traditional antidepressant imipramine was applied as a positive control. Results: We found that an injection of 3'-dA led to a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, which was significantly faster and stronger than imipramine, after 45 min in tail suspension and forced swim tests. This antidepressant effect remained after 5 days of treatment with 3'-dA. Unlike the psycho-stimulants, 3'-dA did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. After 45 min or 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation in both the PFC and HIP. In addition, after 45 min of treatment, 3'-dA significantly up-regulated GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2 levels, at the synapses in the PFC. After 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA significantly enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2, at the synapses in the PFC and HIP. Moreover, the AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was able to block the rapid antidepressant effects of 3'-dA. Conclusion: This study identified 3'-dA as a novel rapid antidepressant with clinical potential and multiple beneficial mechanisms, particularly in regulating the prefrontal AMPA receptor signaling pathway.

Rayleigh wave dispersion measurements are made using a multitaper technique for both minor-arc and major-arc wave trains. The global phase-velocity maps confirm many features associated with surface tectonics including the ocean-continent dichotomy and the signature of lithospheric cooling in oceanic plates. In addition, the high-resolution phase-velocity maps reveal a major change in the distribution of small-scale anomalies in the Pacific at different wave periods. We calculate the global average of Rayleigh wave phase velocity in major tectonic regions and show that large discrepancies exist between our model and global crustal and mantle models: (1) In oceanic regions, short-period (<similar to 40 s) Rayleigh waves are faster than calculations based on models CRUST2.0 and S40RTS. The discrepancies could be explained by a thinner crust or faster wave speeds in the crust or upper mantle. The implementation of model CRUST1.0 significantly improves the agreement, with phase-velocity discrepancies less than 0.5 per cent on average. (2) In Archean cratons, Rayleigh wave phase velocities in our model are faster than calculations based on model S40RTS at periods longer than similar to 40 s; and the global average in orogenic belts is similar to 1-2 per cent slower than CRUST1.0 at periods shorter than similar to 50 s.

J	Liu, K; Zhou, Y				Liu, Kui; Zhou, Ying			Travelling-wave Green tensor and near-field Rayleigh-wave sensitivity	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Surface waves and free oscillations; Seismic tomography; Theoretical seismology; Wave scattering and diffraction	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CRUST; UPPER-MANTLE STRUCTURE; SEISMIC TOMOGRAPHY; SPECTRAL-ELEMENT; FREQUENCY TOMOGRAPHY; FRECHET KERNELS; ADJOINT METHODS; NORTH-AMERICA; SURFACE-WAVES; PHASE DELAYS	Travelling-wave Green tensor has been widely used in calculations of synthetic seismograms and finite-frequency sensitivities of surface waves. The classic travelling-wave decomposition is based on a far-field approximation and may not be valid when applied to construct sensitivity kernels in regions close to the receiver. In this paper, we calculate synthetic seismograms and finite-frequency sensitivity kernels of Rayleigh waves based on travelling-wave representation of Green tensor that fully accounts for near-field effects. We show that far-field approximation is adequate for synthetic seismograms when the source-receiver epicentral distance is greater than the dominant wavelength. Errors in Rayleigh-wave sensitivity kernels introduced by far-field approximation are in general negligible for single-station measurements except for in a small region around the station, and the errors are more significant in sensitivity kernels for interstation measurements. In addition, interstation measurements are strongly sensitive to structures outside the region between the two stations, even for two stations along the same great circle path from the seismic source.

The isolate grew at 15-37 degrees C, pH 6.0-8.0 and in the presence of 0-3 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, xylose, galactose, mannose, ribose, arabinose, glucose and rhamnose. The acyl type of muramic acid was glycolyl. The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unidentified phospholipid. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-16 : 0, 10-methyl C-17 : 0 and iso-C-15 : 0. MK-9(H-6) was the predominant menaquinone. The genomic DNA G+ C content was determined to be 69.4 mol%. These chemotaxonomic data and the morphological properties were consistent with those of the genus Hamadaea. The strain showed highest sequence similarities to Hamadaea tsunoensis CGMCC 4.1403(T) on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and was found to form a coherent cluster in the neighbour-joining tree. The DNA-DNA hybridization experiment indicated that the DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain YIM C0533(T) and H. tsunoensis CGMCC 4.1403(T) was 34.4 +/- 1.3 %. In addition, the results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the isolate to be differentiated phenotypically from H. tsunoensis CGMCC 4.1403(T). On the basis of data from this polyphasic study, strain YIM C0533(T) is characterized as a novel species of the genus Hamadaea, for which the name Hamadaea flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM C0533(T) (=CPCC 204160(T) =KCTC 39591(T) =CGMCC 4.7289(T)). An emended description of the genus Hamadaea is also provided.

Strain EGI 80423(T) grew at pH 7.0-10.0 and with 0-14.0 % (w/v) NaCl, optimally at pH 8.0-9.0 and with 2.0-4.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Cells of strain EGI 80423(T) were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile cocci with diameters of 0.6-0.8 mm. The diagnostic diamino acid of the peptidoglycan was ornithine, and the interpeptide bridge was Orn <- Glu. The major fatty acids identified were iso-C-17 : (1)omega 9c, iso-C-15 : 0 and iso-C-17 : 0. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-4), while the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, two unknown phospholipids, two unknown glycolipids, six unknown phosphoglycolipids and five unknown polar lipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 80423(T) clustered with the single member of the genus Ornithinicoccus. Sequence similarity between strain EGI 80423(T) and Ornithinicoccus hortensis NBRC 16434(T). Because the type strain has been provided by NBRC, Japan was 97.7 %. The DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain EGI 80423(T) and O. hortensis NBRC 16434(T) was 36.84 %. Based on morphological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characteristics, and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain EGI 80423T represents a novel species of the genus Ornithinicoccus, for which the name Ornithinicoccus halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 80423(T) (=CGMCC 1.14989(T) =KCTC 39700(T)). The description of the genus Ornithinicoccus has also been emended.

We therefore aimed to determine whether common variations in the SIRT6 gene are associated with human longevity. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the SIRT6 gene and its 5 kb up-/downstream region, including rs350852, rs350844, rs352493, rs4807546 and rs3760905, have been successfully determined in 616 unrelated Chinese long-lived individuals (LLIs) (mean age: 102.4 +/- 2.3 years) and 846 younger controls (mean age: 48.9 +/- 10.6 years) from Hainan Island, China. The allele and genotype frequencies of the five SNPs showed no statistically significant difference between the LLIs and controls (all P > 0.05). The five SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium and defined seven common haplotypes. Likewise, no association between these haplotypes and longevity was observed (all P > 0.05). The present study reveals that common genetic variations in the SIRT6 gene are not associated with human longevity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We model the dust and free-free continuum emission in the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2. Aims. We want to reconstruct the 3D density and dust temperature distribution, as a crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas velocity field and molecular abundances. Methods. We employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to calculate the dust temperature self-consistently, providing a given initial density distribution. This density distribution of the entire cloud complex is then recursively reconstructed, based on available continuum maps, including both single-dish and high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a wide frequency range (v = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au, i. e., a spatial dynamic range of 10(5). Results. We find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2 can be reasonably well fitted by applying a superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas mass of 8.0 x 10(6) M-circle dot within a diameter of 45 pc. This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170 M-circle dot pc 3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400 M-circle dot and 20 700 M-circle dot and luminosities of 1.8 x 10(6) L-circle dot and 1.2 x 10(7) L-circle dot for Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H-2 column densities of 2.9 x 10(24) cm(2) for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5 x 10(24) cm(-2) for Sgr B2(M) in a 40 '' beam. For Sgr B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 M-circle dot, a luminosity of 6.6 x 10(5) L-circle dot, and an H-2 column density of 2.2 x 10(24) cm 2 in a 40 '' beam. We calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been converted to stars or dispersed.

The behavior, characterization, and water solubility of the inclusion complex were carefully investigated via fluorescence spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis, and H-1 and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, antitumor activity to human cancer lines and toxicity in mice were studied. Results showed that the inclusion complex formed in a 1:1 ratio with a considerable apparent stability constant K-s (4245.5 Lmol(-1)). Water solubility was considerably improved. In addition, the anticancer activity of the inclusion complex was better than that of cis-platinum (DDP, positive control). Most importantly, the toxicity of podophyllotoxin inclusion complex reduced and became more safety to mice which will be great valuable to research its applications as a kind of antitumor drug to human in the further.

Results show that LUCC makes the range of SWS narrow, which had significantly weakening effect to stronger wind than weaker wind. In addition, the decrease of probabilities for observed gentle breeze (GB), moderate breeze (MB), and wind speed greater than or equal to 8 m s(-1) (WSGE8) are more significant in large cities than that in small cities.

The full Coulomb stress changes are computed based on the discrete wavenumber method. We find that the static Coulomb stress changes caused by the M(s)7. 3 earthquake discourage aftershocks occurrence in the southwestern part of the aftershock zone, which may explain why the aftershock activity in this region is relatively weak. Aftershock rates at the region about 30 km to the northeast of the mainshock are relatively high, which are consistent with positive dynamic and static stress changes in that region, with the peak values of 2. 78 MPa and 0. 80 MPa, respectively. Aftershocks about 45 km north of the mainshock are mostly triggered by the dynamic stress change with a peak value of 0. 72 MPa. The peak values of dynamic stress change in the remote Shaya and Jiashi areas are 0. 09 MPa and 0. 1 MPa, respectively, which are high enough to trigger microearthquakes in these areas. Overall the spatial distributions of dynamic stress changes induced by the Yutian mainshock show asymmetrical patterns, and there is a positive correlation between the aftershock distribution and the positive area of dynamic stress change in the northeastern and northern regions.

The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) for their composition, structure/morphology, and BET surface area, respectively. The nanosheets consisting of nanoparticles prepared here are porous in nature, with average pore sizes of approximately 50 nm or smaller. The electrochemical properties of the Cd doped porous Co3O4 nanosheets were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 mol/L KOH solution. The 5% Cd doped porous Co3O4 nanosheets electrode shows the maximum specific capacitance as high as 737 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, which is 69% higher than that of the undoped porous Co3O4 nanosheets electrode. Furthermore, it has good specific capacitance retention of ca. 96% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. It shows a better cyclic stability than undoped porous Co3O4 nanosheets electrode, indicating that the Cd doped porous Co3O4 nanosheets is a promising electroactive material for supercapacitor.

Among these eight walls, two without any strengthening measures served as reference specimens; two were directly strengthened with horizontal and diagonal BFRP strips after they were constructed; and the rest were tested to defined damage levels and then repaired for retesting. The opening in the wall, the layer of the BFRP strip, and the vertical compression level were considered in the test design. Experimental results showed different failure modes of the specimens. Details of testing results were discussed regarding strength and drift, hysteretic characteristics, stiffness degradation, energy dissipation, and BFRP strip strains. A performance comparison analysis was also conducted between the constrained masonry walls and the unreinforced ones. Finally, a calculation method was proposed to estimate the ultimate lateral strength of BFRP retrofitted masonry walls.

Induction of trap formation in nematode-trapping fungi by bacteria-released ammonia	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						ammonia; bacteria; nematode-trapping fungus; trap formation; volatile organic compounds	ARTHROBOTRYS-OLIGOSPORA; PHASE MICROEXTRACTION; IDENTIFICATION; BIOCONTROL	A total of 11 bacterial strains were assayed for bacteria-induced trap formation in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora YMF101883 with two-compartmented Petri dish. These strains were identified on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of eight isolates were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and their structures were identified based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). At the same time, all isolates were used for quantitative measurement of ammonia by the indophenol blue method. The effects of pure commercial compounds on inducement of trap formation in A.oligospora were tested. Taken together, results demonstrated that the predominant bacterial volatile compound inducing trap formation was ammonia. Meanwhile, ammonia also played a role in other nematode-trapping fungi, including Arthrobotrys guizhouensis YMF100014, producing adhesive nets; Dactylellina phymatopaga YMF101474, producing adhesive knobs; Dactylellina cionopaga YMF101472, producing adhesive columns and Drechslerella brochopaga YMF101829, producing constricting rings.

This paper aims at providing compound recommendation engine for social media systems, and focuses on exploiting multi-sourced information (e.g. social networks, item contents and user feedbacks) to predict the ratings of users to items and make recommendations. For this, we suppose the users' decisions on adopting item are affected both by their tastes and the favors of trusted friends, and extend Collaborative Topic Regression to jointly incorporates social trust ensemble, topic modeling and probabilistic matrix factorization. We propose corresponding approaches to learning the latent factors both of users and items, as well as additional parameters to be estimated. Empirical experiments on Lastfm and Delicious datasets show that our model is better and more robust than the state-of-the-art methods on making recommendations in term of accuracy.

This organism was alkaline and grew optimally at pH 9 and 20 A degrees C in the presence of 4 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain CUG 00006(T) contained Q-10 as the major isoprenoid quinone and C-18:1 omega 7c as the main fatty acids. The DNA G + C content was 67.8 mol%. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain CUG 00006(T) was phylogenetically related to members of the genus Paracoccus, with the similarities ranging from 93.5 to 97.9 %. In particular, strain CUG 00006(T) was closely related to P. marcusii DSM 11574(T) (97.7 %), P. haeundaensis KCCM 10460(T) (97.8 %), and P. carotinifaciens IFO 16121(T) (97.7 %). On the basis of phylogenetic, physiological, and biochemical characterization, strain CUG 00006(T) is described as a new species of the genus Paracoccus, for which the name Paracoccus gahaiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain CUG 00006(T) (=CCTCC M 2014217(T) = KCTC 42687(T)).

J	Zhou, LH; Lu, K; Liu, WY				Zhou, Lihua; Lue, Kevin; Liu, Weiyi			An approach for community detection in social networks based on cooperative games theory	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						social networks; community detection; cooperative game	COMPLEX NETWORKS; ALGORITHM	Detecting communities is of great importance in social network analysis. However it is an issue that has not yet been satisfactorily solved, despite the efforts made by interdisciplinary research communities over the past few years, because of the nature of complexity in deciding how community structures should be recognized. In this paper we propose an approach based on cooperative game theory for community detection in social networks. We regard individuals as players, and regard communities as coalitions formed by players, and model community detection problem as the formation and optimization of coalitions. Furthermore, we define coalition profile for players to indicate coalitions that players joined, the order of a coalition profile is defined as the number of coalitions in a coalition profile, and we introduce a utility function to measure preference of coalition profiles. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to detect a coalition profile with maximal utility function values. We have implemented the algorithms developed in this study and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

NOV.; ANAEROBIC BACTERIUM; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; PROPOSAL; LINEAGE; RECLASSIFICATION; PROTEOBACTERIA; FUSOBACTERIUM; CLOSTRIDIUM; PHYLOGENY	We describe an interactive viewer for the All-Species Living Tree (LVTree). The viewer incorporates treeing and lineage information from the ARB-SILVA website. It allows collapsing the tree branches at different taxonomic ranks and expanding the collapsed branches as well, keeping the overall topology of the tree unchanged. It also enables the user to observe the consequence of trial lineage modifications by re-collapsing the tree. The system reports taxon statistics at all ranks automatically after each collapsing and re-collapsing. These features greatly facilitate the comparison of the 16S rRNA sequence phylogeny with prokaryotic taxonomy in a taxon by taxon manner. In view of the fact that the present prokaryotic systematics is largely based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the current viewer may help reveal discrepancies between phylogeny and taxonomy. As an application, we show that in the latest release of LVTree, based on 11,939 rRNA sequences, as few as 24 lineage modifications are enough to bring all but two phyla (Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) to monophyletic clusters.

This study aimed to screen antagonistic bacteria and develop a biocontrol system for root rot complex of Panax notoginseng. Methods: Pure-culture methods were used to isolate bacteria from the rhizosphere soil of notoginseng plants. The identification of isolates was based on the analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. Results: A total of 279 bacteria were obtained from rhizosphere soils of healthy and root-rot notoginseng plants, and uncultivated soil. Among all the isolates, 88 showed antagonistic activity to at least one of three phytopathogenic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Phoma herbarum mainly causing root rot disease of P. notoginseng. Based on the 16S rRNA sequencing, the antagonistic bacteria were characterized into four clusters, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetesi. The genus Bacillus was the most frequently isolated, and Bacillus siamensis (Hs02), Bacillus atrophaeus (Hs09) showed strong antagonistic activity to the three pathogens. The distribution pattern differed in soil types, genera Achromobacter, Acidovorax, Brevibacterium, Brevundimonas, Flavimonas, and Streptomyces were only found in rhizosphere of healthy plants, while Delftia, Leclercia, Brevibacillus, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Rhizobium, and Stenotrophomonas only exist in soil of diseased plant, and Acinetobacter only exist in uncultivated soil. Conclusion: The results suggest that diverse bacteria exist in the P. notoginseng rhizosphere soil, with differences in community in the same field, and antagonistic isolates may be good potential biological control agent for the notoginseng root-rot diseases caused by F. oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Panax herbarum.

In Brassica crops, as in many other species, genome-wide systematic analysis and functional studies of these genes are still lacking. As a first step to study their function in B. rapa ssp. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage), we comprehensively identified all GELP genes in the genome. We found a total of 121 Brassica rapa GDSL esterase/lipase protein genes (BrGELPs), forming three clades in the phylogenetic analysis (two major and one minor), with an asymmetrical chromosomal distribution. Most BrGELPs possess four strictly conserved residues (Ser-Gly-Asn-His) in four separate conserved regions, along with short conserved and clade-specific blocks, suggesting functional diversification of these proteins. Detailed expression profiling revealed that BrGELPs were expressed in various tissues, including floral organs, implying that BrGELPs play diverse roles in various tissues and during development. Ten percent of BrGELPs were specifically expressed in fertile buds, rather than male-sterile buds, implying their involvement in pollen development. Analyses of EXL6 (extracellular lipase 6) expression and its co-expressed genes in both B. rapa and Arabidopsis, as well as knockdown of this gene in Arabidopsis, revealed that this gene plays an important role in pollen development in both species. The data described in this study will facilitate future investigations of other BrGELP functions.

The 2MASS, WISE, IRAS and AKARI data are employed to make analyses. It is shown from several two-color diagrams that from 1 mu m to 60 mu m infrared radiations from circumstellar disks with the power law distribution play a very important role for infrared excesses which are much larger than that for ordinary Be stars. In the WISE two-color diagram, (W2-W3) vs. (W1-W2), some sources show thermal emissions probably due to dust surrounded and enhanced PAH features at 3.3 and 11.3 pm. In the wavelength longer than 60 mu m infrared radiations are not so influenced by the circumstellar disk, but mainly from the ISM surrounded. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chen, P.

Polyethylene glycols (PEGS) with 4000 and 6000 gimol number average molecular weight were used as phase change functional chain, castor oil as the skeleton, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were individually served as coupling reagent. The molecular structure, crystalline properties, phase change performances, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FFIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis (TG), respectively. The XRD patterns and POM images showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have the same crystalline structure and confined crystallization compared with pristine PEG. The DSC results indicated that the synthesized SSPCMs have high latent heats and a suitable phase change temperature range, and the maximum latent heats in melting and freezing process for the SSPCMs are 117.70 J/g and 109.00 J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test and TG analysis results indicated that synthesized SSPCMs have good thermal reliability and stability. The prepared SSPCMs show large potential application in the area of solar energy storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we examined the phylogenetic origin of Hippophae gyantsensis, a diploid species occurring in the western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Some of its morphological and molecular traits suggest a close relationship to H.rhamnoides ssp. yunnanensis while others indicate H.neurocarpa. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of sequence data of two maternally inherited chloroplast (cp) DNA fragments and the bi-parentally inherited nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) from 17 populations of H.gyantsensis, 15 populations of H.rhamnoides ssp. yunnanensis and 27 populations of H.neurocarpa across their distributional ranges, and modelled the niche differentiation of the three taxa. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that H.gyantsensis is a morphologically stable, genetically independent and ecologically distinct species. The inconsistent phylogenetic placements of the H.gyantsensis clade that comprised the dominant cpDNA haplotypes and ITS ribotypes suggested a probable diploid hybrid origin from multiple crosses between H.rhamnoides ssp. yunnanensis and H.neurocarpa. This tentative hypothesis is more parsimonious than alternative explanations according to the data available, although more evidence based on further testing is needed.

Most epiphytes exhibit clonal growth habit, but few studies have tested effects of physiological integration (resource sharing) on survival and growth of epiphytes and whether such effects vary with species. We conducted two experiments, one on individuals (single ramets) and another on groups (several ramets within a plot), with severed and intact rhizome treatments (without and with physiological integration) on two dominant epiphytic ferns (Polypodiodes subarnoena and Lepisorus scolopendrium) in a subtropical montane moist forest in Southwest China. Rhizome severing (preventing integration) significantly reduced ramet survival in the individual experiment and number of surviving ramets in the group experiment, and it also decreased biomass of both species in both experiments. However, the magnitude of such integration effects did not vary significantly between the two species. We conclude that resource sharing may be a general strategy for clonal epiphytes to adapt to forest canopies where resources are limited and heterogeneously distributed in space and time.

The South Asian monsoonal region in this study is referred to as a broad area that includes the Arabian Sea, the Indian peninsula, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indochina peninsula. The precipitation exhibits a significant enhancement in May, compared to that in the previous month. The present results indicate that the interannual variability of May precipitation in this region is significantly regulated by two independent factors: The Europe-West Asia (EWA) teleconnection and El Nino Southern Oscillation. The EWA teleconnection pattern is characterized by the see-saw pattern of upper-tropospheric geopotential height anomalies between the Europe and the Iranian plateau. Both the factors modulate the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature and lower-tropospheric zonal winds, and thus affect the rainfall in the monsoonal region. Therefore, both the extratropical circulation teleconnection and tropical forcing are crucial for inducing rainfall variability in May over the monsoonal region.

Such analyses are pointing to the existence of many cryptic species, especially in poorly understood groups such as the genus Limnonectes, and the L. kuhlii species complex in particular. To understand the Limnonectes frogs of China, we reconstruct the major matrilineal genealogy of Limnonectes from China and Southeast Asia based on 12S rRNA, tRNA(Val) and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Based on new data we recognize five species of Limnonectes in China including L. bannaensis, L. fujianensis, L. fragilis, L. taylori ( new record), and a new species from southern China and Myanmar. Phylogenetically, the new species is more closely related to the clade comprising L. taylori, L. megastomias, L. isanensis, L. nguyenorum, and L. jarujini from Thailand than to other Chinese species. This study supports previous findings of sympatric members of a species complex that are not each other's closest relatives.

In semi-arid regions, due to limited near-surface observational data and large errors in large-scale parameters obtained by the remote sensing method, there exist uncertainties in land surface parameters, which can cause large offsets between the simulated results of land-surface process models and the observational data for the soil moisture. In this study, observational data from the Semi-Arid Climate Observatory and Laboratory (SACOL) station in the semi-arid loess plateau of China were divided into three datasets: summer, autumn, and summer-autumn. By combing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the land-surface process model SHAW (Simultaneous Heat and Water), the soil and vegetation parameters that are related to the soil moisture but difficult to obtain by observations are optimized using three datasets. On this basis, the SHAW model was run with the optimized parameters to simulate the characteristics of the land-surface process in the semi-arid loess plateau. Simultaneously, the default SHAW model was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison test. Simulation results revealed the following: parameters optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm in all simulation tests improved simulations of the soil moisture and latent heat flux; differences between simulated results and observational data are clearly reduced, but simulation tests involving the adoption of optimized parameters cannot simultaneously improve the simulation results for the net radiation, sensible heat flux, and soil temperature. Optimized soil and vegetation parameters based on different datasets have the same order of magnitude but are not identical; soil parameters only vary to a small degree, but the variation range of vegetation parameters is large.

A Global Perspective on Drinking-Water and Sanitation Classification: An Evaluation of Census Content	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Following the recent expiry of the United Nations' 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), new international development agenda covering 2030 water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) targets have been proposed, which imply new demands on data sources for monitoring relevant progress. This study evaluates drinking-water and sanitation classification systems from national census questionnaire content, based upon the most recent international policy changes, to examine national population census's ability to capture drinking-water and sanitation availability, safety, accessibility, and sustainability. In total, 247 censuses from 83 low income and lower-middle income countries were assessed using a scoring system, intended to assess harmonised water supply and sanitation classification systems for each census relative to the typology needed to monitor the proposed post-2015 indicators of WASH targets. The results signal a lack of international harmonisation and standardisation in census categorisation systems, especially concerning safety, accessibility, and sustainability of services in current census content. This suggests further refinements and harmonisation of future census content may be necessary to reflect ambitions for post-2015 monitoring.

In this study, these two downscaling methods are used to simulate the surface climate of China and compared. The Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) is cross validated and used to downscale the regional climate of China. Then, the downscaled historical climate of 1981-2000 and future climate of 2041-2060 are compared with that from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model driven by the European Center-Hamburg atmosphere model and the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (ECHAM5/MPI-OM) and the L'Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 5, coupled with the Nucleus for European Modelling of the ocean, low resolution (IPSL-CM5A-LR). The SDSM can reproduce the surface temperature characteristics of the present climate in China, whereas the WRF tends to underestimate the surface temperature over most of China. Both the SDSM and WRF require further work to improve their ability to downscale precipitation. Both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods produce future surface temperatures for 2041-2060 that are markedly different from the historical climatology. However, the changes in projected precipitation differ between the two downscaling methods. Indeed, large uncertainties remain in terms of the direction and magnitude of future precipitation changes over China.

The fossil record offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct early character evolution of the nervous system via exceptional preservation in extinct representatives. Here we describe the neurological architecture of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the upper-stem group euarthropod Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis from the early Cambrian Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte (South China). The VNC of C. kunmingensis comprises a homonymous series of condensed ganglia that extend throughout the body, each associated with a pair of biramous limbs. Submillimetric preservation reveals numerous segmental and intersegmental nerve roots emerging from both sides of the VNC, which correspond topologically to the peripheral nerves of extant Priapulida and Onychophora. The fuxianhuiid VNC indicates that ancestral neurological features of Ecdysozoa persisted into derived members of stem-group Euarthropoda but were later lost in crown-group representatives. These findings illuminate the VNC ground pattern in Panarthropoda and suggest the independent secondary loss of cycloneuralian-like neurological characters in Tardigrada and Euarthropoda.

At first, we solve the Riemann problem of the pressureless relativistic Euler equations with a flux approximation, and obtain two kinds of solutions involving a family of delta shock wave and pseudo-vacuum state. Then, as the flux approximation vanishes, we show that the limits of the family of delta-shock and pseudo-vacuum solutions are exactly the delta-shock and vacuum state solutions of the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, respectively. Next, the Riemann problem of the relativistic Euler equations with a double parameter flux approximation including pressure is solved analytically. Furthermore, it is rigorously proved that, as the double parameter flux perturbation vanishes, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations; any two-rarefaction Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state.

J	Li, HQ; Tang, NS; Yi, JY				Li, Hui-Qiong; Tang, Nian-Sheng; Yi, Jie-Yi			Confidence intervals construction for difference of two means with incomplete correlated data	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Bootstrap; Confidence interval; Correlated data; Incomplete data	TESTING EQUALITY; PROPORTIONS	Background: Incomplete data often arise in various clinical trials such as crossover trials, equivalence trials, and pre and post-test comparative studies. Various methods have been developed to construct confidence interval (CI) of risk difference or risk ratio for incomplete paired binary data. But, there is little works done on incomplete continuous correlated data. To this end, this manuscript aims to develop several approaches to construct CI of the difference of two means for incomplete continuous correlated data. Methods: Large sample method, hybrid method, simple Bootstrap-resampling method based on the maximum likelihood estimates (B-1) and Ekbohm's unbiased estimator (B-2), and percentile Bootstrap-resampling method based on the maximum likelihood estimates (B-3) and Ekbohm's unbiased estimator (B-4) are presented to construct CI of the difference of two means for incomplete continuous correlated data. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed CIs in terms of empirical coverage probability, expected interval width, and mesial and distal non-coverage probabilities. Results: Empirical results show that the Bootstrap-resampling-based CIs B-1, B-2, B-4 behave satisfactorily for small to moderate sample sizes in the sense that their coverage probabilities could be well controlled around the pre-specified nominal confidence level and the ratio of their mesial non-coverage probabilities to the non-coverage probabilities could be well controlled in the interval [0.4, 0.6]. Conclusions: If one would like a CI with the shortest interval width, the Bootstrap-resampling-based CIs B1 is the optimal choice.

Acting as both diffusion cell and key imaging element, ALCL is of the function to measure the refractive index (RI) of liquid filled in its core in the way of spatial resolution. Comparing the ALCL with a symmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens (SLCL), the spherical aberration is reduced from about 300 mu m (SLCL) to less than 5 mu m (ALCL) when the RI of filled liquid is near 1.333, while the measurement accuracy of the RI of the ALCL is superior to 0.0002, which is much better than that of the SLCL. Equipped with the ALCL, the D value of triethylene glycol diffusing in water is measured at 25 degrees C. The result is D = 0.7515 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s, a value very close to the literature value. The rational design of ALCL gives the optical method for measuring the D value good measurement precision and direct observation of the diffusive process as well as a simple experimental instrument.

Phylogenetic analyses based on the genes related to adhesive materials can be of great importance for understanding the evolution of trapping devices. Recently, AoMad1, one homologous gene of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae cell wall protein MAD1, has been functionally characterized as involved in the production of adhesions in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. In this study, we cloned Mad1 homologous genes from nematode-trapping fungi with various trapping devices. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that species which formed nonadhesive constricting ring (CR) traps more basally placed and species with adhesive traps evolved along two lineages. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) revealed that significant positive selective pressure likely acted on the ancestral trapping devices including both adhesive and mechanical traps, indicating that the Mad1 genes likely played important roles during the evolution of nematode-trapping fungi. Our study provides new insights into the evolution of trapping devices of nematode-trapping fungi and also contributes to understanding the importance of adhesions during the evolution of nematode-trapping fungi.

Our empirical results evidence that the Wilson-score-based hybrid CI and the Wald-type CI together with the constrained maximum likelihood estimates perform well for small-to-moderate sample sizes in the sense that (i) their empirical coverage probabilities are quite close to the prespecified confidence level, (ii) their expected interval widths are shorter, and (iii) their ratios of the mesial non-coverage to non-coverage probabilities lie in interval [0.4, 0.6]. An example from a neurological study is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

Different from the usual framework of the node-based reconstruction, two optimization approaches (i.e., the global and partitioned reconstructions) are proposed to infer the structure of undirected networks from dynamics. These approaches are applied to evolutionary games occurring on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks via compressed sensing, which can more efficiently achieve higher reconstruction accuracy with relatively small amounts of data. Our approaches provide different perspectives on effectively reconstructing complex networks.

NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MENAQUINONES; GLYCOMYCES; EVOLUTION; BACTERIA	A novel actinobacterial strain, YIM ART06(T), was isolated from a rock sample of karst cave located at Guizhou province, south-west China, and was characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of strain YIM ART06(T) were in accordance with those of the genus Stackebrandtia. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YIM ART06(T) showed highest similarity to Stackebrandtia nassauensis JCM 14905(T) (98.0 %). The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains YIM ART06(T) and S. nassauensis JCM 14905(T) was, however, moderately high (62.9 %) but below the 70 % limit for species identification. Strain YIM ART06(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and mannose, ribose and xylose in the whole-cell hydrolysates. The predominant menaquinones detected were MK-10(H-4), MK-10(H-6), MK-11(H-4) and MK-11(H-6), while the cell membrane polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and three unidentified phospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain YIM ART06(T) was 71 mol%. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-17 : 0, iso-C-17 : 0, iso-C-16 : 0 and iso-C-15 : 0. Based on the taxonomic characteristics from the genotypic and phenotypic results, strain YIM ART06(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Stackebrandtia, for which the name Stackebrandtia cavernae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM ART06(T) (=KCTC 39599(T)=CCTCC AA 2015021(T)=DSM 100594(T)).

The cell wall of strain fd2-tb(T) contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, and whole-cell sugars were identified as glucose and ribose. The menaquinones MK-9(H-4), MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8) were also detected. In addition, the polar lipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, as well as five unidentified phospholipids, were detected. Major cellular fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15 : 0, iso-C-16 : 0, anteiso-C-17 : 0, iso-C-15 : 0 and C-16 : 0. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed that strain fd2-tbT exhibited 36.5 +/- 0.6 %, 43.5 +/- 2.0 %, 11.1 +/- 1.3 %, 10.3 +/- 3.1 %, 9.8 +/- 1.9 %, 48.9 +/- 3.9 % and 16.3 +/- 1.7 % relatedness to S. amritsarensis JCM 40119660(T), S. flavotricini NBRC 12770(T), S. polychromogenes NBRC 13072(T), S. racemochromogenes NRRL B-5430(T), S. globosus LMG 19896T, S. toxytricini NBRC 12823T and S. katrae NBRC 13447(T), respectively. Based on these analyses as well as some phenotypic differences, strain fd2-tb(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces yangpuensis sp. nov. is proposed.

NOV.; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION; SLUDGE; TREES; ACID; SOIL	A Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile actinomycete strain, designated EGI 60007(T), was isolated from healthy roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis F. collected from Yili County, Xinjiang Province, north-west China. A polyphasic approach was applied to study the taxonomic position of the new isolate. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain EGI 60007(T) had highest similarities with members of the genus Pseudoclavibacter, including Pseudoclavibacter chungangensis CAU 59(T) (96.98% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Pseudoclavibacter helvolus DSM 20419(T) (96.43 %) and Pseudoclavibacter terrae THG-MD12(T) (96.14 %). The neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 60007(T) clustered with members of the genus Pseudoclavibacter, and formed a distinct clade with P. chungangensis CAU 59(T). The polar lipids detected for strain EGI 60007(T) were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified lipid. The DNA G + C content was determined to be 63.3 mol%. The chemotaxonomic features of strain EGI 60007(T) showed typical characteristics of the genus Pseudoclavibacter, with MK-9 as the respiratory quinone, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid as the diamino acid in the peptidoglycan, and anteiso-C-15 : 0, anteiso-C-17 : 0 and iso-C-16 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The sugars of whole-cell hydrolysates were mainly mannose, rhamnose, ribose and glucose, and a minor amount of xylose. Based on the results of the phylogentic analysis supported by morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and other differentiating phenotypic characteristics, strain EGI 60007T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Pseudoclavibacter, for which the name Pseudoclavibacter endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 60007(T) (= CGMCC 1.15081(T) =KCTC 39112(T) =DSM 29943(T)).

Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed that the two strains were closely related to Mariniluteicoccus flavus YIM M13146(T) (98.1 and 98.0 % similarities, respectively) and formed a robust clade with M. flavus in the neighbour-joining tree. Optimum growth of the strains was observed at 28-32 degrees C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl. The chemotaxonomic profiles of the strains comprised anteiso-C-15 : 0 as the major cellular fatty acid, MK-9(H-4) as the predominant menaquinone, alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and LL-diaminopimelic acid as peptidoglycan components, and phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol as the major polar lipids. The G + C contents of the genomic DNA of strains YIM 2617(T) and YIM 2617-2 were 66.4 and 66.6 mol%, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridizations of the two strains with M. flavus YIM M13146(T) gave mean relatedness values of 47.6-2.0 and 43.2-1.5 %, respectively, while the relatedness value between them was 92.1-2.2 %. On the basis of the data recorded from the present study, strains YIM 2617(T) and YIM 2617-2 represent a novel species of the genus Mariniluteicoccus, for which the name Mariniluteicoccus endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed.

In particular, a simplified design of the PMC package is proposed for such a hybrid circuit. A fabricated SIW-GCPW filter was characterized without a lid, and with a traditional smooth lid, a modified smooth lid, a complete PMC lid and a simplified PMC lid. Both simulated and measured S-parameters show that the filter outband rejection using the proposed simplified PMC lid is better than the traditional and existing lids.

The hypothetical latent structure often needs critical examination based on experimental data. It is therefore important to know the sample size needed to ensure a reasonable chance of success. We investigate this issue for the EM-test and the test. They are shown to be asymptotically equivalent and have simple limiting distributions under two sets of local alternatives for commonly used mixture models. We obtain a simple sample-size formula and an associated simulation-based calibration procedure, and we demonstrate via data examples and simulation studies that they provide useful guidance for several common mixture models.

Ils montrent que ces deux tests sont asymptotiquement equivalents et qu'ils presentent une distribution limite simple sous des hypotheses locales pour des modeles de melange frequemment utilises. Les auteurs obtiennent une formule simple pour la taille d'echantillon pourvue d'une procedure de calibration basee sur la simulation. Ils demontrent a l'aide d'exemples de donnees et de simulations que leur approche s'avere utile pour de nombreux modeles de melange communs.

Here, we varied the orientation of cuboid chambers (with correspondingly small, medium and large sides as the chamber base) in a microcosm experiment involving a phytoplankton-zooplankton (Chlorella pyrenoidosa-Ceriodaphnia quadrangula) system at two volume scales (64 mL and 512 mL) to determine the effect of habitat orientation on the swimming activity and grazing rate of C. quadrangula. At a given chamber volume, the grazers spent more time in swimming vertically and swam slower (particularly in the horizontal direction) in the tall (small-based) chamber compared with the short (large-based) ones. Moreover, grazing rates of C. quadrangula were significantly lower in the tall chambers than short ones regardless of experimental time, consistent with the positive relationship between average swimming velocity and grazing rate. Our data indicate that habitat orientation may affect animal activity and foraging success, and we therefore suggest that habitat orientation deserves much more attention in future studies.

In the present study, a wound-healing assay indicated that PDS inhibited the migration of SKOV3 cells, and a Matrigel tube formation assay demonstrated the presence of inhibitory tube-structures following treatment with PDS. To date, there are no previous reports on the regulation of osteopontin (OPN), a glycophosphoprotein cytokine frequently expressed in ovarian carcinoma effusions by PDS. A reduction in the expression of OPN following PDS-treatment was observed using immunohistochemical and western blot experiments. These results suggest that PDS may be useful in the search for a potential ovarian cancer treatment.

J	Zhu, JQ; Li, YD				Zhu, Jia-Qing; Li, Yun-De			Inelastic electromagnetic production of J/psi in p-p ultra-peripheral collisions	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B			English	Article							WEIZSACKER-WILLIAMS APPROXIMATION; PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; PARTICLE PRODUCTION; GAMMA-GAMMA; HEAVY-IONS; LHC; SCATTERING; PHYSICS; PROTON; PHOTOPRODUCTION	J/psi production in p-p ultra-peripheral collisions through the inelastic electromagnetic process, where the virtual photons emitted from the incoming nucleon interact with the partons in the target nucleon, is studied. The comparisons between the results of the equivalent photon approximation approach and the exact treatment ones are presented. Based on the method of Martin and Ryskin, the coherent and incoherent contributions are considered simultaneously. The distributions of Q(2) (virtuality of the photon) and the total cross sections are calculated. The numerical results show that, the equivalent photon approximation approach is only effective in the Q(2) -> infinity region where Q(max)(2) is small enough. It can be seen that an improper choice of Q(max)(2) will cause obvious errors in the equivalent photon approximation approach (the total cross sections are more than twice larger than the exact ones), and the exact treatment needs to be adopted to dealing with the widely kinematics region of Q(2).

Increasing evidence indicates that miR-30a plays a profound role during the development of cancers. However, the functions of miR-30a in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still ambiguous. Here we found that miR-30a was decreased in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and in tissue samples from 14 patients by qRT-PCR, and also found that overexpression of miR-30a in A549 cells inhibited migration and invasion but not cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by wound-healing assay, matrigel invasion assay, MTS-based cell proliferation assay, and flow cytometry-based cell cycle analysis, respectively. We further explored the potential mechanism of miR-30a-mediated gene regulation in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. EYA2 is a predicted target of miR-30a, and it has been found that EYA2 expression is inhibited by miR-30a in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that EYA2 is a direct target of miR-30a by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay in A549 cells and showed that EYA2 protein levels are inversely correlated with miR-30a expression in A549 and BEAS-2B cells. In addition, we also confirmed the rescue effects of EYA2 overexpression in A549 cells by cotransfection with EYA2 expression vector and miR-30a mimics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that overexpression of miR-30a in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells can inhibit cell migration and invasion, which is partially attributed to the decrease of EYA2 expression. Our findings suggest that miR-30a may be used as a new potential target for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma in the future.

Here, we describe a new species, Sarcocystis tuagulusi, infecting five of 12 Williamson's mouse deer from southwest China. Mature sarcocysts are microscopic, up to 2280-mu m long. The sarcocyst wall had 8.2-mu m long villar protrusions, type 24. Using transmission electron microscopy, the protrusions on sarcocysts appeared as elongated, lancet- or leaf-like shapes in longitudinal sections; in contrast, the cross-sections revealed mushroom-shaped protrusions. In the core of the protrusion, a bundle of microtubules penetrated diagonally into a ground substance along the longitudinal axis. A phyogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA and cox1 sequences suggested S. tuagulusi is closely related to Sarcocystis species from ruminants that employ felids as definitive hosts.

HUMAN CLINICAL SPECIMENS; BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; COLORADO PLATEAU; GEN. NOV.; CHINA; DNA; CLASSIFICATION	A novel Gram-staining negative, motile, rod-shaped and aerobic bacterial strain, designated EGI 60010(T), was isolated from healthy roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis F. collected from Yili County, Xinjiang Province, North-West China. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain EGI 60010(T) showed 97.2 % sequence similarities with Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC 49188(T) and Ochrobactrum cytisi ESC1(T), and 97.1 % with Ochrobactrum lupini LUP21(T). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the new isolate clustered with members of the genera Ochrobactrum, and formed a distinct clade in the neighbour-joining tree. Q-10 was identified as the respiratory quinone for strain EGI 60010(T). The major fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c), C-19:0 cyclo omega 8c, summed feature 4 (C-17:1 iso I/anteiso B) and C-16:0. The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The DNA G+C content of strain EGI 60010(T) was determined to be 60.4 mol%. The genomic DNA relatedness values determined between strain EGI 60010(T) and the closely related strains O. anthropi JCM 21032(T), O. cytisi CCTCC AB2014258(T) and O. lupini NBRC 102587(T) were 50.3, 50.0 and 41.6 %, respectively. Based on the results of the molecular studies supported by its differentiating phenotypic characteristics, strain EGI 60010(T) was considered to represent a novel species within the genus Ochrobactrum, for which the name Ochrobactrum endophyticum sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is EGI 60010(T) (=CGMCC 1.15082(T) = KCTC 42485(T) = DSM 29930(T)).

Genetically based SI systems are widespread in flowering plants and function to reduce homozygosity and avoid inbreeding depression. However, out-crossing is always unfulfillable for populations with few S-alleles, such as in cultivated clonal populations or populations founded by few individuals. Under such conditions, there is a pressing demand to self-reproduce and pass on genetic information. We carried out a series of pollination and pollen tube observation experiments to explore how homozygous self-incompatible N. alata (S-allele identified and S-RNase active) sets fruits and to explore pseudo-self-fertility in these individuals. We observed several kinds of pollen tube abnormalities, including swelling, furcation, curve and inflexion, tip bursting and irregular callose plug deposition for flowers pollinated at different developmental stages. In addition, SI strength in this line of N. alata plants changed with floral age and flowering stages. That is, flowers became more self-compatible with floral aging, and SI strength in flowers at the end of flowering stages (stage III) was lower and more fruits were set at the top of the pseudo-raceme. Finally, SI strength also varied between individual flowers at the same plant and development stages. However, SI strength varied insignificantly among cultivated N. alata plants homozygous for the same S-allele. These findings indicate that SI in N. alata is plastic, with fruits set by aging flowers, especially flowers at stage III.

The measurements are carried out by THz time-domain spectroscopy in the temperature regime from 15 to 105 K. The frequency-dependent optical conductivity in the metallic phase region of the samples exhibits a non-Drude-like response. We find that below 105 K, both the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity can be reproduced by the Drude-Smith model. The important sample and material parameters of the LPCMO thin film (such as the persistence of velocity, the ratio of carrier density to effective mass, and electronic scattering time) can be determined by fitting experimental data. The results obtained agree with those obtained from four-probe electrical transport measurements.

Two types of techniques were proposed and explored, namely the SPE and the liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of the quaternary ammonium surfactant [cetytrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTMAB), cetyl pyridine bromide (CPB), benzyl dimethyl dodecyl ammonium chloride (BDMDAC), and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTMAC)]. The surfactant could react with Au(CN)(2)(-) to form the ionic complex, and the compound could be extracted by SPE column of reversed-phase bonded silica gel. Hence, a new method of SPE was proposed to extract gold with these features of the high selectivity, the reliability, and the simplicity. The experimental result shows that the recovery rate of gold is more than 98 %, and the solid-phase extraction column is not easily damaged and it can be repeatedly used. The new method can be used as the extraction process of gold from alkaline cyanide solution as well. Besides, the paper also puts forward a new process of gold extraction.

In the present study, five expert radiologists and five resident radiologists interpreted the sonograms of 178 nodes. The malignancy rating and patient management recommendation (biopsy or follow-up) were made without and then with the computer aid. Under these two reading conditions, the performances of radiologists and agreement among a group of radiologists were evaluated by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the statistic, respectively. With the computer aid, the performances of radiologists improved significantly, as indicated by the increase in the area under the ROC curve (A(z)) from 0.843 to 0.896 (p = 0.031) and from 0.705 to 0.822 (p < 0.001), for the expert and resident groups, respectively. Agreement among all 10 radiologists improved from slight to moderate as indicated by an increase in the value from 0.195 to 0.421 (p < 0.001). The average performance of residents with aid (A(z) = 0.822) was close to that of experts without aid (A(z) = 0.843).

Progress has been made in modeling these aspects by moving from ECHAM5/MPI-OM to MPI-ESM. MPI-ESM is more skillful than ECHAM5/MPI-OM in modeling the time-mean state and the extreme condition of the IIE. Though simulation of the interannual variability significantly deviates to some extent in both MPI-ESM and ECHAM5/MPI-OM, MPI-ESM-LR shows better skill in reflecting the relationship among sea surface temperature anomalies over the Pacific, circulation anomalies over East Asia, and IIE variability. The temperature becomes warmer under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in comparison with the historical experiments, but the position of the IIE and the key physical process in relation to the IIE variability almost remains the same, suggesting that the Indian summer monsoon tends to change in phase with the East Asian summer monsoon under each RCP scenario. The relatively realistic description of the physical processes modulated by terrain in MPI-ESM may be one of the most important reasons why MPI-ESM performs better in simulating the IIE.

The unique structure of KMn8O16 nanorods, with a length of 2-4 mu m, dispersed on the surface of RGO leads to a much enhanced electrical conductivity and ionic transport, finally achieving composites with an improved electrochemical performance. Electrochemical measurement results show a specific capacitance of 222.3 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g, much higher than that of the original alpha-MnO2. After 500 cycles at 2.0 A/g, the RGO/KMn8O16 composite electrode still retains 92.6% of its initial specific capacitance. The excellent electrochemical performance and durability observed for this composite electrode suggest its potential application for electrochemical capacitors.

The first type is a characteristic of pancrustaceans, the eyes of which comprise lenses arranged as hexagonal or rectilinear arrays, each lens crowning 8-9 photoreceptor neurons. Except for Scutigeromorpha, the second type typifies Myriapoda whose relatively large eyelets surmount numerous photoreceptive rhabdoms stacked together as tiers. Scutigeromorph eyes are facetted, each lens crowning some dozen photoreceptor neurons of a modified apposition-type eye. Extant chelicerate eyes are single-lensed except in xiphosurans, whose lateral eyes comprise a cuticle with a smooth outer surface and an inner one providing regular arrays of lens cylinders. This account discusses whether these disparate eye types speak for or against divergence from one ancestral eye type. Previous considerations of eye evolution, focusing on the eyes of trilobites and on facet proliferation in xiphosurans and myriapods, have proposed that the mode of development of eyes in those taxa is distinct from that of pancrustaceans and is the plesiomorphic condition from which facetted eyes have evolved. But the recent discovery of enormous regularly facetted compound eyes belonging to early Cambrian radiodontans suggests that high-resolution facetted eyes with superior optics may be the ground pattern organization for arthropods, predating the evolution of arthrodization and jointed post-protocerebral appendages. Here we provide evidence that compound eye organization in stem-group euarthropods of the Cambrian can be understood in terms of eye morphologies diverging from this ancestral radiodontan-type ground pattern. We show that in certain Cambrian groups apposition eyes relate to fixed or mobile eyestalks, whereas other groups reveal concomitant evolution of sessile eyes equipped with optics typical of extant xiphosurans. Observations of fossil material, including that of trilobites and eurypterids, support the proposition that the ancestral compound eye was the apposition type. Cambrian arthropods include possible precursors of mandibulate eyes. The latter are the modified compound eyes, now sessile, and their underlying optic lobes exemplified by scutigeromorph chilopods, and the mobile stalked compound eyes and more elaborate optic lobes typifying Pancrustacea. Radical divergence from an ancestral apposition type is demonstrated by the evolution of chelicerate eyes, from doublet sessile-eyed stem-group taxa to special apposition eyes of xiphosurans, the compound eyes of eurypterids, and single-lens eyes of arachnids. Different eye types are discussed with respect to possible modes of life of the extinct species that possessed them, comparing these to extant counterparts and the types of visual centers the eyes might have served.

However, traditional CCFR systems do not handle noisy data effectively. By analyzing in detail the basic strokes of Chinese characters, we propose that font recognition on a single Chinese character is a sequence classification problem, which can be effectively solved by recurrent neural networks. For robust CCFR, we integrate a principal component convolution layer with the 2-D long short-term memory (2DLSTM) and develop principal component 2DLSTM (PC-2DLSTM) algorithm. PC-2DLSTM considers two aspects: 1) the principal component layer convolution operation helps remove the noise and get a rational and complete font information and 2) simultaneously, 2DLSTM deals with the long-range contextual processing along scan directions that can contribute to capture the contrast between character trajectory and background. Experiments using the frequently used CCFR dataset suggest the effectiveness of PC-2DLSTM compared with other state-of-the-art font recognition methods.

Infall and outflow motions in the W3(H2O) have been characterized by observing HCN and HCO+ transitions. Highvelocity blue/red-shifted emission, tracing the outflow, show multiple knots, which might originate in episodic and precessing outflows. 'Blue-peaked' line profiles indicate that gas is infalling on to the W3(H2O) dust core. The measured large mass accretion rate, 2.3 x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1), together with the small free-fall time-scale, 5 x 10(3) yr, suggest W3(H2O) is in an early evolutionary stage of the process of formation of high-mass stars. For the W3(OH), a two-layer model fit to the HCN and HCO+ spectral lines and Spizter/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) images support that the W3(OH) H II region is expanding and interacting with the ambient gas, with the shocked neutral gas being expanding with an expansion time-scale of 6.4 x 10(3) yr. The observations suggest different kinematical time-scales and dynamical states for the W3(H2O) and W3(OH).

Their structures were elucidated using extensive spectral data interpretation, and their antifungal and synergistic activities were also evaluated. Koningiopisin C (3) exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina with an MIC of 16 mu g/mL. Although the antifungal activities of single compounds were not obvious, a mixture of six compounds (4-9) exhibited potent synergistic antifungal activity against P. cucumerina with an MIC of 16 mu g/mL, and the antifungal activity of the mixture of any two compounds with a 1:1 ratio was better than that observed from the individual compound. The synergistic biological activity of the metabolites in YIM PH 30002 demonstrates the significant ecological function of the endophyte for its host plant, and provides additional insight into the search for and development of agents for biological control.

The ZnO and In2O3 showed separated phases and different sizes deriving from the faster growth of ZnO than In2O3 using benzyl alcohol as the oxygen supplying agent. To demonstrate the usage of such Ag-functionalized IZO, the gas sensors have been fabricated and investigated for formaldehyde (HCHO) detection. The results reveal that the as-synthesized 3 wt% Ag-functionalized IZO samples exhibit high response of about 842.9 towards 2000 ppm HCHO at operating temperature of 300 degrees C. All sensors show rapid response and recovery. The highly sensing properties are attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the presence of these multiple functional materials, i.e. the special structure of IZO nanocomposites, the formation of the heterojunctions, the influence of Ag nanoparticles, and the mutual doping effect.

PLANT LEMNA-GIBBA; MICROCYSTIS-AERUGINOSA; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE; AQUATIC PLANTS; SAND BURIAL; WATER; LAKE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; INHIBITION	Cyanobacterial exudates are known to allelopathically inhibit submerged macrophytes, but the influence of the cyanobacteria growth phase on this effect is yet unknown. We compared the effect of exudates of the exponential growth phase of Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. Elenk with exudates during the decline phase on seedlings of the macrophyte species Potamogeton crispus L. Biomass, chlorophyll content, the ratio of variable-maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m), and light response capacity of P. crispus seedings were significantly inhibited when affected by M. aeruginosa exudates of the exponential growth phase but promoted by exudates of the decline phase. Tiller numbers of P. crispus increased by 350% under the influence of exponential phase exudates, but decreased by 60% when decline phase exudates were applied. Both exudates increased the malondialdehyde contents and decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase in P. crispus seedlings. We conclude that the exponential growth phase of cyanobacteria rather than the decline phase is important for disrupting photosynthesis and for inducing oxidative stress in submerged macrophytes. Planting P. crispus should thus not be applied in summer but during the cyanobacteria decline phase.

The Riemann problem of the pressureless relativistic Euler equations with a flux approximation is firstly solved, and a family of delta-shock and U-shaped pseudo-vacuum state solutions are constructed. Then it is shown that, as the flux approximation vanishes, the limits of the family of delta-shock and U-shaped pseudo-vacuum solutions are exactly the delta-shock and vacuum state solutions to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, respectively. Secondly, we study the Riemann problem of the isentropic relativistic Euler equations with a double parameter flux approximation including pressure term. We further prove that, as the pressure and two-parameter flux perturbation vanish, respectively, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted delta-measure which forms a delta shock wave; any two-rarefaction Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state.

In the present study we describe the features of strain YIM 77409T together with its genome sequence and annotation. The genome is 2,160,855 bp long and consists of 6 scaffolds with 67.4 % average GC content. A total of 2,313 genes were predicted, comprising 2,257 protein-coding and 56 RNA genes. The genome is predicted to encode a complete glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Additionally, a large number of transporters and enzymes for heterotrophy highlight the broad heterotrophic lifestyle of this organism. A denitrification gene cluster included genes predicted to encode enzymes for the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrous oxide, consistent with the incomplete denitrification phenotype of this strain.

However, the tolerance and alleviation mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. In the current study, the regulation and physiological response of Zea mays to its root-associated DSE, Exophiala pisciphila was analyzed under increased soil Cd stress (0, 10, 50, 100 mg kg(-1)). Under Cd stress, DSE inoculation significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and low-molecular weight antioxidants, while also inducing increased Cd accumulation in the cell wall and conversion of Cd into inactive forms by shoot and root specific regulation of genes related to metal uptake, translocation and chelation. Our results showed that DSE colonization resulted in a marked tolerance to Cd, with a significant decrease in cadmium phytotoxicity and a significant increase in maize growth by triggering antioxidant systems, altering metal chemical forms into inactive Cd, and repartitioning subcellular Cd into the cell wall. These results provide comprehensive evidence for the mechanisms by which DSE colonization bioaugments Cd tolerance in maize at physiological, cytological and molecular levels.

Few genome/transcriptome based studies have been conducted on how plants adapt to the environments of QTP compared to numerous studies on vertebrates. Crucihimalaya himalaica is a close relative of Arabidopsis with typical QTP distribution, and is hoped to be a new model system to study speciation and ecological adaptation in extreme environment. In this study, we de novo generated a transcriptome sequence of C. himalaica, with a total of 49,438 unigenes. Compared to five relatives, 10,487 orthogroups were shared by all six species, and 4,286 orthogroups contain putative single copy gene. Further analysis identified 487 extremely significantly positively selected genes (PSGs) in C. himalaica transcriptome. Theses PSGs were enriched in functions related to specific adaptation traits, such as response to radiation, DNA repair, nitrogen metabolism, and stabilization of membrane. These functions are responsible for the adaptation of C. himalaica to the high radiation, soil depletion and low temperature environments on QTP. Our findings indicate that C. himalaica has evolved complex strategies for adapting to the extreme environments on QTP and provide novel insights into genetic mechanisms of highland adaptation in plants.

With increasing population and economic development, human-induced N inputs are expected to continue to increase in the future, especially in many regions of developing countries. Because N sources vary substantially at different temporal and spatial scales and stages of economic development, it is of great importance for environmental managers to be able to simulate the dynamics of N inputs to a specific region of interest. Based on the concept of net anthropogenic N inputs (NANI), a quasi-mass-balance method, a system dynamics model simulating regional N inputs (NANI-SD) is developed and presented here for the first time. The NANI-SD model evaluates how much new N from anthropogenic activities is introduced to the whole basin, providing a simple but effective way to examine human influences on regional N cycles. Our application of the NANI-SD model to the Lake Dianchi basin in China shows that human-induced N inputs will continue to increase under current trends of development. Scenarios focused on lowering population growth rate and banning crop production were not effective in achieving long-term reductions in N inputs because their impacts were compensated by the increases in croplands and food imports, respectively. However, adjusting diet patterns and limiting livestock numbers within the basin were shown to be highly effective in controlling regional N inputs without compromising environmental sustainability of food imported regions. There was a significant trade-off between N self-sufficiency and N inputs to the region, posing the issue of "pollution transfer" as the regions of livestock production providing animal products to the Lake Dianchi basin could suffer from locally intensified levels of N pollution introduced while producing those animal N products. The positive relationship between NANI and the proportion of animal-based protein in food indicates that reducing meat consumption could be an effective way of controlling local N inputs without sacrificing food sovereignty. NANI to the basin could also be reduced by recycling N in human and livestock wastes, but its capacity to reduce NANI is limited and projected to diminish with time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Increased phenotypic plasticity can be especially beneficial for invasive clonal plants, allowing them to colonize new environments even when genetic diversity is low. However, the relative importance of genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity for invasion success remains largely unknown. Here, we performed molecular marker analyses and a common garden experiment to investigate the genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity of the globally important weed Altemanthera philoxeroides in response to different water availability (terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats). This species relies predominantly on clonal propagation in introduced ranges. We therefore expected genetic diversity to be restricted in the two sampled introduced ranges (the USA and China) when compared to the native range (Argentina), but that phenotypic plasticity may allow the species' full niche range to nonetheless be exploited. We found clones from China had very low genetic diversity in terms of both marker diversity and quantitative variation when compared with those from the USA and Argentina, probably reflecting different introduction histories. In contrast, similar patterns of phenotypic plasticity were found for clones from all three regions. Furthermore, despite the different levels of genetic diversity, bioclimatic modeling suggested that the full potential bioclimatic distribution had been invaded in both China and USA. Phenotypic plasticity, not genetic diversity, was therefore critical in allowing A. philoxeroides to invade diverse habitats across broad geographic areas.

With Markov chain Monte Carlo technique we model fourteen SEDs of 3C 279 using a leptonic model with a three-parameter log-parabola EED. The 14 SEDs can be satisfactorily fitted with the one-zone leptonic model. The observed gamma rays in 13 states are attributed to Compton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty torus. The curved gamma ray spectrum observed during 2014 2-8 April is well explained by the external Compton of dust radiation. It is found that there is a clear positive correlation between the curvature parameter b of the EED and the electron peak energy gamma(pk)'. No significant correlation between b and the synchrotron peak frequency.s is found, due to the varied product of Doppler factor and fluid magnetic field from state to state. We interpret the correlation of b - gamma(pk)' in a stochastic acceleration scenario. This positive correlation is in agreement with the prediction in the stage when the balance between acceleration and radiative cooling of the electrons is nearly established in the case of the turbulence spectral index q = 2.

The morphology and phase structure of the Nd-doped SnO2 nanoarrays were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman scattering spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the BET method. The results demonstrated that the Nd-doped SnO2 layered nanorod arrays showed a unique nanostructure combined together with double layered arrays of nanorods with a diameter of 12 nm and a length of several hundred nanometers. The Nd-doped layered SnO2 nanoarrays kept the crystal structure of the bulk SnO2 and possessed more surface defects caused by the Nd ions doped into the SnO2 lattice. The Nd dopant acts as a crystallite growth inhibitor to prevent the growth of SnO2 nanorods. An investigation into the gas-sensing properties indicated that the optimized doping level of 3.0 at% Nd-doped SnO2 layered nanorod arrays exhibited an excellent sensing response toward alcohol at a lower temperature of 260 degrees C. The enhanced sensor performance was attributed to the higher specific surface area, multi-defect surface structure and the excellent catalytic properties of Nd dopant that is able to increase the amount of active sites on the surface of semiconducting oxides. The Nd-doped SnO2 nanoarray sensors were considered to be a promising candidate for trace alcohol detections in environmental gas monitoring.

Epidemiological and toxicological analyses suggested that a newly discovered mushroom called Trogia venenata was the leading culprit for SUDs. At present, relatively little is known about the genetics and natural history of this mushroom. In this study, we analyzed the sequence variation at four DNA fragments among 232 fruiting bodies of T. venenata collected from seven locations. Our ITS sequence analyses confirmed that all the isolates belonged to the same species. The widespread presence of sequence heterozygosity within many strains at each of three protein-coding genes suggested that the fruiting bodies were diploid, dikaryotic or heterokaryotic. Within individual geographic populations, we found significant deviations of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, with the overall observed heterozygosity lower than that expected under random mating, consistent with prevalent inbreeding within local populations. The geographic populations were overall genetically differentiated. Interestingly, while a positive correlation was found between population genetic distance and geographic distance, there was little correlation between genetic distance and barium concentration difference for the geographic populations. Our results suggest frequent inbreeding, geographic structuring, and limited gene flow among geographic populations of T. venenata from southwestern China.

See vol. 15, pg. 1123, 2016)	CELL REPORTS			English	Article; Retracted Publication							CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; LIFE-SPAN; MICROBIOTA; LONGEVITY; PATHWAY	Many commensal bacteria in the gut are beneficial to the host immune system, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. Using culture-independent Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we show that bacterial diversity in the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans, the freeliving nematode, is distinct from that in soil. Of these bacteria, Bacillus subtilis is the most prominent species in the worm gut. We demonstrate that B. subtilis confers worm resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Enterococcus faecalis, by producing nitric oxide (NO). Deletion of the nos gene, which encodes an NO synthase, reduces the protective effect. NO promotes innate immune responses to P. aeruginosa PA14 by activating a conserved p38 mitogen protein kinase (MAPK) in C. elegans. Our work provides an example of antagonism of commensal bacteria against pathogens and illustrates the importance of commensal bacteria in host immunity.

Eight organic hole transport materials have been used in this study. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to measure the evolution of the physical, chemical and electronic structure of the interfaces at various stages of MoO3 deposition on these organic semiconductor surfaces. For the interface physical structure, it is found that MoO3 diffuses into the underlying organic layer, exhibiting a trend of increasing diffusion with decreasing molecular molar mass. For the interface chemical structure, new carbon and molybdenum core-level states are observed, as a result of interfacial electron transfer from organic semiconductor to MoO3. For the interface electronic structure, energy level alignment is observed in agreement with the universal energy level alignment rule of molecules on metal oxides, despite deposition order inversion.

Hypertension is a complex disease caused by many reasons including genetic, physiological, psychological and even social factors. In this paper, based on the information of biological pathways, we construct a network model of hypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationship between genes. Statistical and topological characteristics show that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and exhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among these genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven key hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb312,Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da. These genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the treatment of hypertension should focus on the combination of drugs on multiple genes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An investigation of exciton behavior in type-II self-assembled GaSb/GaAs quantum dots	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						GaSb quantum dots; liquid phase epitaxy; indirect exciton; weak quantum confinement	RECOMBINATION; LOCALIZATION; GROWTH	We report the investigation of exciton dynamics in type-II self-assembled GaSb/GaAs quantum dots. The GaSb/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) were grown using a modified liquid phase epitaxy technique. Statistical size distributions of the uncapped QDs were investigated experimentally by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretically by an eight-band k . p calculation, which demonstrated a dissolution effect. Furthermore, the low-temperature luminescence spectra of type-II GaSb/GaAs QDs with a thick capping layer exhibit well-resolved emission bands and LO-phonon-assisted transitions in the GaSb wetting layer. However, the luminescence lines quench at temperatures above 250 K, which is attributed to the weak quantum confinement of electrons participating in indirect exciton recombination. It was demonstrated that the room temperature stability of the excitons in type-II GaSb/GaAs QDs could be achieved by growing thin a capping layer, which provides strong quantum confinement in the conduction band and enhances the electron-hole Coulomb interaction, stabilizing the excitons.

A (G, k, lambda) difference matrix (briefly, (G, k, lambda)-DM) is a k x lambda v matrix D = (d(ij)) with entries from G, so that for any distinct rows x and y, the multiset {d(xi) center dot d(yi)(-1) : 1 <= i <= lambda v} contains each element of G exactly A times. In this paper, we are concerned about a (G, 4, A.)-DM whatever structure of a finite abelian group G is. Eventually for the following two cases: (1) lambda = 1 and G is non-cyclic, (2) lambda > 1 is an odd integer, we prove that a (G, 4, lambda)-DM exists if and only if G has no non-trivial cyclic Sylow 2-subgroups. Moreover, we point out that a (G, 4, lambda)-DM always exists for any even integer lambda >= 2 and any finite abelian group G. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It could be used as a kind of metallic current collector-free anode for lithium ion battery, which would significantly reduce the mass of the whole anode by 66%. The new flexible Fe3O4/buckypaper composite anode achieves a higher initial reversible capacity of 1120 mAh g(-1) and exhibits more stable performance compared with Fe3O4 anode coated on Cu foil by traditional electrode-fabrication technique. This is due to that the flexible 3D porous-structured Fe3O4/buckypaper composite is light weight and can accommodate the volume change of Fe3O4 during the lithiation/delithiation process, and promotes the diffusion and transfer of lithium ion and electron, respectively. Moreover, this buckypaper/Fe3O4 composite anode displays excellent rate capability, which maintains a discharge specific capacity of 210 mAh g(-1) when the applied current rate is 10 degrees C and still delivers 1150 mAh g(-1) after returning to 0.2 degrees C. Our work provides a new way to develop novel electrode structure for light-weighted and flexible lithium-ion battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For general solid-state illumination applications, a WOLED's color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) are two crucial parameters. This paper reports that WOLED device structures can be constructed using four stacked emission layers which independently emit lights at blue, green, yellow and red color respectively.

The outcome of combining two genomes in vertebrates remains unpredictable, especially because polyploidization seldom shows positive effects and more often results in lethal consequences because viable gametes fail to form during meiosis. Fortunately, the goldfish (maternal) x common carp (paternal) hybrids have reproduced successfully up to generation 22, and this hybrid lineage permits an investigation into the genomics of hybridization and tetraploidization. The first two generations of these hybrids are diploids, and subsequent generations are tetraploids. Liver transcriptomes from four generations and their progenitors reveal chimeric genes (> 9%) and mutations of orthologous genes. Characterizations of 18 randomly chosen genes from genomic DNA and cDNA confirm the chimera. Some of the chimeric and differentially expressed genes relate to mutagenesis, repair, and cancer-related pathways in 2nF(1). Erroneous DNA excision between homologous parental genes may drive the high percentage of chimeric genes, or even more potential mechanisms may result in this phenomenon. Meanwhile, diploid offspring show paternal-biased expression, yet tetraploids show maternal-biased expression. These discoveries reveal that fast and unstable changes are mainly deleterious at the level of transcriptomes although some offspring still survive their genomic abnormalities. In addition, the synthetic effect of genome shock might have resulted in greatly reduced viability of 2nF(2) hybrid offspring. The goldfish x common carp hybrids constitute an ideal system for unveiling the consequences of intergenomic interactions in hybrid vertebrate genomes and their fertility.

The soil -dwelling opportunistic bacterium Bacillus nematocida B16 uses a "Trojan horse" mechanism to kill Caenorhabditis elegans. The alterations in the intestinal microflora that occur after B16 infection remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the intestinal bacteria presented in normal and infected worms. The gut microbial community experienced a complex change after B16 inoculation, as determined through marked differences in species diversity, structure, distribution and composition between uninfected and infected worms. Regardless of the worm's origin (i.e., from soil or rotten fruits), the diversity of the intestinal microbiome decreased after infection. Firmicutes increased sharply, whereas Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria decreased to different degrees. Fusobacteria was only present 12 h post-infection. After 24 h of infection, 1228 and 1109 bacterial species were identified in the uninfected and infected groups, respectively. The shared species reached 21.97%. The infected group had a greater number of Bacillus species but a smaller number of Pediococcus, Halomonas, Escherichia and Shewanella species (P < 0.01). Therefore, this study provides the first evaluation of the alterations caused by pathogenic bacteria on symbiotic microbiota using C. elegans as the model species.

In order to assess the effects of continuous covariates or of time scales in a flexible way, a class of semiparametric mixed-effects double regression models( SMMEDRMs) is considered, in which we model the variance of the mixed effects directly as a function of the explanatory variables. In this paper, we propose a fully Bayesian inference for SMMEDRMs on the basis of B-spline estimates of nonparametric components. A computational efficient MCMC method which combines the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is implemented to simultaneously obtain the Bayesian estimates of unknown parameters and the smoothing function, as well as their standard deviation estimates. Finally, some simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

The paper demonstrates that the condition is only a sufficient one; it is not a necessary condition. The necessary condition is given. The backscattering of electron photons in a wiggle magnetic field can produce a 7-laser. It is possible that the amplitude of the 7-laser is small. The amplitude can be significantly increased by increasing the magnetic induction of the wiggle magnetic field, by reducing the wavelength of the wiggle magnetic field, and by making the monochromaticity of an incident electron beam better. In a laser standing wave field or a superposition field of a wiggle magnetic field and a laser standing wave field, the backscattering of electron photons can produce a quasi-laser with a shorter wavelength.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; CLASSIFICATION	A novel Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, moderately halophilic and alkalitolerant actinobacterium, designated EGI 80432(T), was isolated from a saline-alkaline soil of Xinjiang province, north-west China. Cells were non-endospore-forming cocci with a diameter of 0.5-0.8 mu m. Strain EGI 80432(T) grew in the presence of 0-9 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum at 3-5 %), and also grew within the pH range 6.0-10.0 (optimum at pH 8.0-9.0) on marine 2216E medium. The peptidoglycan type was A1 gamma. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, galactose, mannose and three unknown sugars as major sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The major fatty acids were C-17 : 1 omega 8c, summed feature 3 (C-16 : 1 omega 7c/C-16 : 1 omega 6c), C-18 : 1 omega 9c and iso-C-15 : 0 The polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one unknown phosphoglycolipid, three unknown phospholipids and four unknown polar lipids. The genomic DNA G + C content was 75.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain EGI 80432(T) clustered within the radius of the class Nitriliruptoria. Levels of sequence similarity between strain EGI 80432(T) and its phylogenetic neighbours Nitriliruptor alkaliphilus ANL-iso2(T) and Euzebya tangerina F10(T) were 94.1 and 88.1 %, respectively. Based on morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, a novel species of a new genus, Egicoccus halophilus gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed, within the new family and new order Egicoccaceae fam. nov. and Egicoccales ord. nov. in the class Nitriliruptoria. The type strain of Egicoccus halophilus is EGI 80432(T) (=CGMCC 1.14988(T)=KCTC 33612(T)).

Optimum growth was observed at 50-55 degrees C, at pH 7.0 and with 0-1.5 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YIM 78300(T) indicated that it belongs to the genus Brevibacillus. Similarity levels between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the new isolate and those of the type strains of Brevibacillus members were 96.9-96.3 %; highest sequence similarity was with Brevibacillus thermoruber DSM 7064(T). The predominant menaquinone was MK-7 and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15 : 0 and iso-C-17 : 0. The major polar lipids were phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, two unidentified phospholipids, an unidentified aminophospholipid and two unidentified polar lipids. The G + C content of the genomic DNA of strain YIM 78300(T) was 57.9 mol%. Based on phylogenetic analyses, and physiological and biochemical characteristics, strain YIM 78300(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Brevibacillus, for which the name Brevibacillus sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78300T (=DSM 29928(T)=CPCC 100738(T)).

NOV.; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES; TREES; WELLS; SOIL	A novel Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming, irregular rod-shaped, non-motile and facultatively anaerobic actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 101269(T), was isolated from the faeces of Rhinoceros unicornis living in Yunnan Wild Animal Park, Yunnan province, south-west China. The isolate grew at 10-35 degrees C, at pH 6-12 and with 0-9 % (w/v) NaCl. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of the organism contained LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified polar lipids, one unidentified aminophospholipid and three unknown glycolipids. The major cellar fatty acid was anteiso-C-15 : 0.MK-10(H-4) was the predominant menaquinone. The DNA G + C content was 69.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 101269(T) belonged to the genus Tessaracoccus, closely related to Tessaracoccus flavescens DSM 18582(T) (97.4 % similarity). Based on the evidence from the present study, strain YIM 101269(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Tessaracoccus, for which the name Tessaracoccus rhinocerotis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 101269(T) (=DSM 27579(T)=CCTCC AB 2013217(T)).

Growth was observed at pH 7.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.0), 15-28 degrees C (optimum 28 degrees C) and 0-8% (w/v) NaCl (grew without NaCl). Strains showed cylindrical spores with straight-chain morphology on aerial mycelium, but did not reveal sporangium-like structures or fragmentation of the substrate mycelium. Whole-cell hydrolysates of all strains contained galactose and ribose as the diagnostic sugars and meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4); MK-9 (H-6) and MK-10 (H-4) were present in smaller amounts. The phospholipid pattern consisted mainly of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The major fatty acids were i-C-15: 0, ai-C-15: 0, i-C-17 : 0 and ai-C-17 : 0. The genomic DNA G+C content was 68.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that strain YIM 75728(T) should be placed within the family Pseudonocardiaceae, in which the strain formed a distinct lineage. The combination of phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic data support the conclusion that strain YIM 75728(T) represents a novel species of a novel genus of the family Pseudonocardiaceae for which the name Actinorectispora indica gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. Strain YIM 75728(T) (=DSM 45410(T)=CCTCC AA 209065(T)) is the type strain of Actinorectispora indica. Strain YIM 75728(T) was considered as the type strain over the other two strains based on the highest sequence read length of the strain.

The taxonomy of strain YIM 4-4(T) was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Strain YIM 4-4(T) was Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile and formed red colonies. Optimal growth conditions were 28 degrees C, pH 8.0-11.0 and 0.5-2 % NaCl. The major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7 (MK-7). The polar lipid profile was composed predominantly of phosphatidylethanolamine, six unidentified polar lipids, one phospholipid and one aminolipid. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were iso-C-15 : 0, iso-C17 : 1I/anteiso-C17 : 1B, iso-C(16 : 1)G, iso-C-17 : 0 3-OH, C-16 : 1 omega 7c/C-16 : 1 omega 6c and iso-C-16 : 1. The genomic DNA G+C content was 43.0 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the members of the genera Cecembia, Fontibacter, Aquiflexum and Indibacter of the family Cyclobacteriaceae (phylum Bacteroidetes) were the most closely related, with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities ranging from 93.6 to 94.2 %. Other members of the family Cyclobacteriaceae showed sequence similarities <93.0 %. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic properties, strain YIM 4-4(T) represents a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Mongoliibacter ruber gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 4-4(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012966(T)=DSM 27929(T)).

Comparative analyses demonstrate that the internal flexibility and mobility of proteinase K are strongly dependent on the solvent temperatures but weakly on the protein temperatures. The constructed free energy landscapes (FELs) at the high solvent temperatures exhibit a more rugged surface, broader spanning range, and higher minimum free energy level than do those at the low solvent temperatures. Comparison between the dynamic hydrogen bond (HB) numbers reveals that the high solvent temperatures intensify the competitive HB interactions between water molecules and protein surface atoms, and this in turn exacerbates the competitive HB interactions between protein internal atoms, thus enhancing the conformational flexibility and facilitating the collective motions of the protein. A refined FEL model was proposed to explain the role of the solvent mobility in facilitating the cascade amplification of microscopic motions of atoms and atomic groups into the global collective motions of the protein.

In order to highlight the methods for the analysis of the systems, the neutral delay is assumed same as discrete delay. By the novel constructed Lyapunov functional, combining with the delay decomposition technique and free matrices, and using the new inequality rather than the Jensen inequality, the delay-dependent stability conditions are firstly obtained for the two kinds of neutral dynamical systems. Based on the stability condition, the Hoo performance result for the systems with Markovian jump is secondly provided. All of the delay-dependent stabilization results are formulated in terms of LMIs, which can be easily checked by the LMI control toolbox in Matlab. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the validity and potential of the developed criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In these simulations we consider the influence of tidal stresses using the rate-and state-dependent friction laws. Furthermore, the effects on tidal triggering due to the stress amplitude and periodic oscillation properties were investigated, and the triggering effects between the tidal normal and tidal shear stresses were compared. The results showed that the Ning'er earthquake sequence was a physical consequence of tidal effects. A transition period T-0 exists between the nucleation and failure processes of a seismic fault. When the period T of stress is equal to or becomes larger than T-0, the fault response becomes dependent on the periodic features of the loading stress; however, for T < T-0, the response of the fault is nearly independent of the period. Both the tidal normal and tidal shear stresses have similar effect in the nucleation and failure processes; the clock changes generally increase with the maximum amplitudes of the tidal stresses. Tidal normal and tidal shear stresses with positive amplitudes mainly induce earthquake triggering; however, the triggering effects induced by negative tidal stresses are smaller and faults are not sensitive to negative tidal stresses. Our results primarily reveal the physical mechanisms of tidal stress triggering.

In this paper, we systematically explore the efficiency-enhancing mechanism of ABX(3) (A = CH3NH3; B = Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) and provide the best absorber among ABX(3) when the organic framework A is CH3NH3 by first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the ABX(3) is mainly composed of anion X p states and that conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ABX(3) is primarily composed of cation B p states. The bandgap of the ABX(3) decreases and the absorptive capacities of different wavelengths of light expand when reducing the size of the organic framework A, changing the B atom from Pb to Sn, and changing the X atom from Cl to Br to I. Finally, based on our calculations, it is discovered that CH3NH3SnI3 has the best optical properties and its light-adsorption range is the widest among all the ABX(3) compounds when A is CH3NH3. All these results indicate that the electronegativity difference between X and B plays a fundamental role in changing the energy gap and optical properties among ABX(3) compounds when A remains the same and that CH3NH3SnI3 is a promising perovskite absorber in the high efficiency solar batteries among all the CH3NH3BX3 compounds.

Here, the device with the photoactive p-DTS(FBTTh2)(2):PC60BM blends has been studied by varying the annealing temperature. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current (J(sc)) has been achieved after the device was annealed at the temperature of 80 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) displayed that the p-DTS(FBTTh2)(2) tends to form big islands with well-defined crystalline structure (long coherence length) surrounded by small islands of the PC60BM after annealing, and reached the largest grain size of 27nm after annealing at 80 degrees C. AFM images demonstrated the most sufficient phase separation within the photoactive blend layer after annealing at 80 degrees C, which provides good photogenerated excitons dissociation. Such improvements have proved beneficial to decrease the ohmic loss and recombination in carrier-transport process via measuring series resistance and shunt resistance as well as hole mobility. This work opens up a new way to understand the relationship between thermal annealing and molecular interaction from the viewpoint of lattice relaxation.

The strain was characterised using a polyphasic taxonomic approach which confirmed that it belongs to the genus Streptomyces. Growth was observed over a pH range of 7-11 at 28 A degrees C. The cell wall was found to contain ll-diaminopimelic acid and traces of meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major fatty acid components were identified as iso-C-16:0 (46.8 %), C-17:1 (12.4 %), anteiso-C-15:0 (5.1 %) and anteiso-C-17:1 (4.8 %). The major polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. The major menaquinones were determined to be MK-9 (H-6) (70.3 %), MK-9 (H-4) (15.5 %) and MK-9 (H-8) (7.2 %). The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain was determined to be 71.4 mol %. The 16S rRNA gene sequence has been deposited in GenBank with accession number FJ919811. Although the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain NCL716(T) shares > 99 % similarity with that of Streptomyces bohaiensis strain 11A07(T), DNA-DNA hybridization revealed only 33.2 +/- A 3.0 % relatedness between them. Moreover, these two strains can be readily distinguished by some distinct phenotypic characteristics. Hence, on the basis of phenotypic and genetic analyses, it is proposed that strain NCL716(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lonarensis sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is NCL 716(T) (=DSM 42084(T) = MTCC 11708(T) = KCTC 39684(T)).

J	Wu, J; Zha, JL; Zhao, DM				Wu, Jian; Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming			Estimating the impact of the changes in land use and cover on the surface wind speed over the East China Plain during the period 1980-2011	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Surface wind speed; Drag coefficient; Pressure-gradient force; Frictional wind model; LUCC	ASIAN WINTER MONSOON; SUMMER MONSOON; DAILY RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BILINEAR INTERPOLATION; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; URBANIZATION; VISIBILITY; SATELLITE	Long-term changes in surface wind speed (SWS) are influenced by both large-scale circulation and relative resistance. The effects of large-scale circulation are embodied by the pressure-gradient force (PGF), which is mostly a natural factor, whereas the resistance is due to the drag between the air and the surface as well as in the different boundary layers, which is mainly caused by the anthropogenic land use and cover change (LUCC). We performed experiments using a simple dynamical method in which a balance among the PGF, Coriolis force, and drag is reached to separate the effects of the PGF and LUCC on the SWS, and then, to quantitatively estimate the influence of the LUCC on the SWS over the East China Plain (ECP) during the period 1980-2011. The results show a distinct decrease in the SWS in the station observation data with a rate of -0.13 m s(-1) (10 year)(-1), but there is no statistically significant long-term trend in the reanalysis data. At the same time, the drag coefficient induced by the LUCC shows an increasing trend, which is consistent with the 30 % increase in the rate of urbanization during the study period. In addition, the PGF fluctuates with distinct seasonal and interannual changes, and it has an insignificant long-term increasing trend during the period 1980-2011. At the same time, the spatial distribution of the linear trend coefficient of the normalized PGF is inconsistent with that of the SWS, but the linear trend coefficient of the normalized drag coefficient shows a similar spatial distribution as the SWS. Therefore, the increase in the drag coefficient induced by the LUCC should account for the long-term decrease in the SWS. The difference between the model wind speed, in which the drag coefficient is constrained to its value in the year 1980, and the observed wind speed at each station (SWSD) can reflect the influence of the LUCC on the SWS. Furthermore, the long-term changes in East Asian monsoons may not completely account for the observed wind speed decrease near the surface in the ECP region, but it is an important factor in the SWS.

In the current study, a ubiquitous and evolutionary conserved metal transporter gene, homology to natural resistance associated macrophage protein (Nramp), was cloned from a metal tolerant isolate of dark septate endophyte (DSE, Exophiala pisciphila), and its functional and transcript characterization were analyzed. The full-length Nramp gene from E. pisciphila (named EpNramp) was 1716 bp and expected to encode a polypeptide of 571 amino acid residues. EpNramp fused to green fluorescent protein suggested that EpNramp was a plasma membrane metal transporter, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis with 11 transmembrane domains. Yeast functional complementation revealed that EpNramp could complement the growth defect of Fe-uptake yeast mutant (fet3fet4 double mutant) by mediating the transport of Fe2+. Expression of EpNramp increased Cd2+ sensitivity and Cd2+ accumulation in yeast. In addition, qPCR data revealed that E. pisciphila significantly down regulated EpNramp expression with elevated Cd2+ exposure. Altogether, EpNramp is a bivalent cation transporter localized in cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of both Fe and Cd, and its activities partly attributed to the tolerance of DSE to toxic and excessive Cd2+ supplements.

PGC-1 alpha plays an important role in cellular metabolism and is associated with tumorigenesis, suggesting an involvement in cell cycle progression. However, the underlying mechanisms mediating its involvement in these processes remain unclear. To elucidate the signaling pathways involved in PGC-1 alpha function, we established a cell line, CH1 PGC-1 alpha, which stably overexpresses PGC-1 alpha. Using this cell line, we found that over-expression of PGC-1 alpha stimulated extra adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects were accompanied by up-regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint regulators CyclinD1 and CyclinB1. We hypothesized that ATP and ROS function as cellular signals to regulate cyclins and control cell cycle progression. Indeed, we found that reduction of ATP levels down-regulated CyclinD1 but not CyclinB1, whereas elevation of ROS levels down-regulated CyclinB1 but not CyclinD1. Furthermore, both low ATP levels and elevated ROS levels inhibited cell growth, but PGC-1 alpha was maintained at a constant level. Together, these results demonstrate that PGC-1 alpha regulates cell cycle progression through modulation of CyclinD1 and CyclinB1 by ATP and ROS. These findings suggest that PGC-1 alpha potentially coordinates energy metabolism together with the cell cycle.

Study of these relict species helps to understand past and recent ecological processes affecting species persistence, and also provides knowledge to guide human-assisted management and conservation practice. In this study, we investigated the current status of the remnant populations of Cathaya argyrophylla, one of the emblematic "living fossils", growing in the Dalou Mountains of South-Central China. We quantified the population structure of C. argyrophylla and investigated demographic changes of seedlings over a ten year period to learn the plant's regeneration patterns following the establishment of two national and provincial nature reserves in late 1970s. Notable "gaps" in age structure over 40 years were found, suggesting significant recruitment failures in these scattered population since the establishment of the nature reserves. Further, the number of dead individuals peaked at ages between 40 and 80 years and the seedlings showed high mortality in the past 10 years, probably due to intensified competition from the nearby broad-leaved trees and the reduction of suitable micro-habitats. These facts indicated that attention needs to be paid and follow-up measures should be taken to more effectively conserve C. argyrophylla in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tricyclazole at higher levels (20 and 40 mu g mL(-1)) reduced the growth and sporulation of E. pisciphila, but toxicity was not observed at a low concentration (2.5 mu g mL(-1)). Under cadmium (Cd) stress (50, 100 and 200 mg L-1), 2.5 mu g mL(-1) of tricyclazole reduced fungal growth and sporulation. These reduces indicated a decrease on Cd tolerance of E. pisciphila. For both the 0 and 2.5 mu g mL(-1) tricyclazole treatments, Cd was associated mostly with cell walls and was extracted by 2 % acetic acid and 1 M NaCl. The FTIR spectra of the E. pisciphila mycelia were similar for both 0 and 2.5 mu g mL(-1) tricyclazole treatments, which showed hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl and phosphate groups. Thus inhibition of melanin synthesis by tricyclazole did not change Cd accumulation characteristics in E. pisciphila. Results suggested that melanin played a protective role for E. pisciphila against Cd stress, but inhibition of melanin synthesis did not have a remarkable impact on Cd accumulation in E. pisciphila.

J	Chen, XR; Tang, NS; Zhou, Y				Chen, Xuerong; Tang, Niansheng; Zhou, Yong			Quantile regression of longitudinal data with informative observation times	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Estimating equation; Informative observation times; Longitudinal data; Quantile regression; Resampling method	VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS; MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; OPTIMIZATION ESTIMATORS; U-PROCESSES; TESTS	Longitudinal data are frequently encountered in medical follow-up studies and economic research. Conditional mean regression and conditional quantile regression are often used to fit longitudinal data. Many methods focused on the cases where the observation times are independent of the response variables or conditionally independent of them given the covariates. Few papers have considered the case where the response variables depend on the observation times or observation times are random variables associated with a counting process. In this paper, we propose a marginally conditional quantile regression approach for modeling longitudinal data with random observing times and informative observation times. Estimators of the parameters in the proposed conditional quantile regression are derived by constructing non-smooth estimating equations when the observation times follow a counting process. Consistency and asymptotic normality for these estimators are established. Asymptotic variance is estimated based on a resampling method. A simulation study is conducted and suggests that the finite sample performance of the proposed approach is very good, and an illustrative approach is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The surface morphology, chemical compatibility, thermal properties and thermal stability were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), respectively. The results show that there are only physical interactions between stearic acid and diatomite in composite PCM. XRD analysis reveals that crystal type is not affected by composite technology of SA/diatomite composite form-stable PCM with decrease in crystal size due to the limited pores in diatomite. The melting and freezing temperatures of stearic acid/diatomite composite, respectively, are 52.3 and 48.4 A degrees C. The latent heat of SA/diatomite composite reaches 57.1 J g(-1), potential to be used in a practical application. TG result indicates that the decomposition of SA/diatomite composite starts at 192 A degrees C, implying that the SA/diatomite has a good thermal stability.

In this method, both electric and magnetic fields are expanded in terms of the vector spherical harmonic (VSII) functions in spherical geometry and the divergence-free state of the magnetic field is enforced analytically by a projection method. Our simulations show that the Deutsch vacuum solution and the Michel monopole solution can be reproduced well by our pseudo-spectral code. Further, the method is used to present a time-dependent simulation of the force-free pulsar magnetosphere for an aligned rotator. The simulations show that the current sheet in the equatorial plane can be resolved well and the spin-down luminosity obtained in the steady state is in good agreement with the value given by Spitkovsky.

The morphology, crystal structure and optical properties of CoPc nanowires were characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies. Analyses of X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectra indicate that the crystal structure of CoPc nanowires represents a new polymorph, which is designated J-CoPc. These J-CoPc nanowires with high directionality (average diameter similar to 50 nm) surprisingly possess much broader optical absorption spectra in the visible spectral region than those of the alpha- and beta-phase CoPc, enabling high potential for practical applications in novel molecular electronic/optical devices.

Proteins, an important class of biological macromolecules, realize their functions through binding to themselves or other molecules. A detailed understanding of the protein-ligand interactions is therefore central to understanding biology at the molecular level. Moreover, knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the protein-ligand recognition and binding will also facilitate the discovery, design, and development of drugs. In the present review, first, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying protein-ligand binding, including the binding kinetics, thermodynamic concepts and relationships, and binding driving forces, are introduced and rationalized. Next, three currently existing protein-ligand binding modelsthe lock-and-key, induced fit, and conformational selectionare described and their underlying thermodynamic mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the methods available for investigating protein-ligand binding affinity, including experimental and theoretical/computational approaches, are introduced, and their advantages, disadvantages, and challenges are discussed.

However, VANET also raises important security and privacy concerns that must be properly addressed for widespread deployment. In this paper, we first proposed a provable secure pseudonym-based cryptosystem with a trusted authority, including a pseudonym-based encryption scheme, a pseudonym-based multi-receiver encryption scheme, a pseudonym-based signature scheme, and a pseudonym-based one-pass key establishment protocol. We then presented a secure and efficient data access scheme for VANET based on cooperative caching technology and the proposed pseudonym-based cryptosystem. The efficiency of data access was greatly improved by allowing the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple vehicles, and the anonymity of vehicles, data confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation were guaranteed by employing the proposed pseudonym-based cryptosystem. Simulation results have shown that the proposed data access scheme is suitable to the VANET environment.

QTL Mapping for Gray Leaf Spot Resistance in a Tropical Maize Population	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; ORYZA-SATIVA L.; ZEA-MAYS; OLIGOGENIC RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR MARKERS; LINE POPULATION; GENETIC-CONTROL; DIALLEL CROSS; DISEASE; INHERITANCE	A tropical gray leaf spot (GLS)-resistant line, YML 32, was crossed to a temperate GLS-susceptible line, Ye 478, to produce an F-2:3 population for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to GLS. The population was evaluated for GLS disease resistance and flowering time at two locations in Yunnan province. Seven QTL using GLS disease scores and six QTL using flowering time were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 in the YML 32 x Ye 478 maize population. All QTL, except one identified on chromosome 2 using flowering time, were overlapped with the QTL for GLS disease scores. The results indicated that QTL for flowering time in this population strongly corresponded to QTL for GLS resistance. Among the QTL, qRgls.yaas-8-1/qFt.yaas-8 with the largest genetic effect accounted for 17.9 to 18.1 and 11.0 to 21.42% of variations for GLS disease scores and flowering time, respectively, and these should be very useful for improving resistance to GLS, especially in subtropical maize breeding programs. The QTL effects for resistance to GLS were predominantly additive in nature, with a dominance effect having been found for two QTL on the basis of joint segregation genetic analysis and QTL analysis.

A propensity score method with a robust and efficient regression procedure called composite quantile regression for parameter estimation of the linear regression model with nonignorable missing covariates is proposed. Semiparametric estimation of the propensity score is based on the exponentially tilted likelihood approach. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are systematically investigated. The proposed method is resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response. Simulation studies and real data applications are used to illustrate its potential impacts and benefits compared with conventional methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The compound was characterized by X-ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 1 processed a layered structure built from [Co(tadd)(2)](n) chains and bpys. The two sets of layers interpenetrate to each other and generated a 3D inclined polycatenated 4(4)-sql net. The mechanism analysis shows the ligand of Htadd was transformed from methyl carbazate and the five-membered ring was produced through an in situ ester aminolysis and deamination reaction. Moreover, the fluorescence and magnetic properties of complex 1 were also studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In recent decades, many challenge problems in object tracking has been effectively resolved by using learning based tracking strategies. Number of investigations carried on learning theory found that when labeled samples are limited, the learning performance can be sufficiently improved by exploiting unlabeled ones. Therefore, one of the most important issue for semi-supervised learning is how to assign the labels to the unlabeled samples, which is also the principal focus of transductive learning. Unfortunately, considering the efficiency requirement of online tracking, the optimization scheme employed by the traditional transductive learning is hard to be applied to online tracking problems because of its large computational cost during sample labeling. In this paper, we proposed an efficient transductive learning for online tracking by utilizing the correspondences among the generated unlabeled and labeled samples. Those variational correspondences are modeled by a matching costs function to achieve more efficient learning of representative separators. With a strategy of fixed budget for support vectors, the proposed learning is updated by using a weighted accumulative average of model coefficients. We evaluated the proposed tracking on benchmark database, the experiment results have demonstrated an outstanding performance via comparing with the other state-of-the-art trackers.

Fertile axes with terminal pollen organs are dichotomous for 2-4 times and may be proximally attached by fragmentary pinnules. Pollen organs are synangiate and borne on the top of a short stalk. Synangia are radial in symmetry and each consists of 4-8 elongate microsporangia fused at base. Microsporangia have a longitudinal dehiscence line and show a tapered apex. The associated stem is spiny and bears a vegetative frond which bifurcates once at the basalmost part. Frond rachises possess one order of pinna arranged alternately. Pinnules are borne alternately, planate, highly dissected, and equally dichotomous for 2-3 times. Comparisons among Late Devonian seed plants recognize several branching patterns in the fertile fronds/axes bearing terminal pollen organs. Telangiopsis sp. reinforces that the Late Devonian pollen organs are synangiate usually with basally fused microsporangia. It is suggested that the evolutionary divergence of radial and bilateral symmetries of pollen organs may have occurred in the Famennian, when the earliest seed plants evolved planate and sometimes laminate pinnules.

The rod-like NiO core was prepared by thermal decomposition of NiC2O4 synthesized by corrosion of Ni foam with oxalic acid under hydrothermal conditions. Sphere-like MnO2 shell was deposited on the surface of NiO core through hydrothermal treatment with KMnO4 solution. The structure, composition, morphology evolution and surface chemical state of the NiO@MnO2 electrode were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obtained NiO and NiO@MnO2 electrodes were directly used as electrodes of supercapacitor, and their electrochemical performances were tested with cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the sphere-like MnO2 shell leads to an impressive enhancement of the performance including the areal capacitance (AC) and cycling stability, particular in the AC. To be more specific, the NiO@MnO2 exhibits a high AC of 3.584 F/cm(2) at a current density of 5 mA/cm(2), which is much higher than that of NiO electrode whose AC is 1.483 F/cm(2) at the same current density, demonstrating the potential to use NiO@MnO2 electrode for supercapacitor. At the same time, the related mechanisms for the superior performance were also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we showed that miR-342-5p and miR-608 suppressed the tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting NAA10 mRNA for degradation. Overexpression of miR-342-5p or miR-608 decreased NAA10 mRNA and protein levels and thereby suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression, as well as promoted apoptosis in SW480 and SW620 cells. More importantly, miR-342-5p and miR-608 significantly decreased the tumorigenic capacity of SW480 and SW620 cells in a mouse xenograft model. We also observed an inverse correlation between the expression of NAA10 and that of both miRNAs. Our results implicate miR-342-5p and miR-608 in colon cancer development and unveil the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, which involves NAA10.

This mainly stems from nonlinear relationships between V-NH3 and relevant factors. On the basis of 495 site-years of measurements at 78 sites across Chinese croplands, we developed a nonlinear Bayesian tree regression model to determine how environmental factors modulate the local derivative of V-NH3 to nitrogen application rates (N-rate) (VR, %). The V-NH3 -N-rate relationship was nonlinear. The VR of upland soils and paddy soils depended primarily on local water input and N-rate, respectively. Our model demonstrated good reproductions of V-NH3 compared to previous models, i.e., more than 91% of the observed VR variance at sites in China and 79% of those at validation sites outside China. The observed spatial pattern of V-NH3 in China agreed well with satellite-based estimates of NH3 column concentrations. The average VRs in China derived from our model were 14.8 +/- 2.9% and 11.8 +/- 2.0% for upland soils and paddy soils, respectively. The estimated annual NH3 emission in China (3.96 +/- 0.76 TgNH(3).yr(-1)) was 40% greater than that based on the IPCC Tier 1 guideline.

We find that silicon-rich and oxygen-rich clusters have different characteristics. Oxygen-rich clusters usually have oxygen atoms on the edges of the clusters, but separated from others by Si atoms. However, silicon-rich clusters tend to have rings nested within each other. The spectra for the structures have been calculated to compare with observed spectra. The predicted structures and spectroscopic properties are expected to be useful for the identification of silicon oxide species in the interstellar medium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since specific bee interactions influence the foraging performance of bees on flowers, they also act as drivers to regulate the assemblage of flower visitors. We selected squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) and its pollinators as a model system to study the foraging response of honey bees to the occurrence of bumble bees at two types of sites surrounded by a high amount of natural habitats (>= 58% of land cover) and a low amount of natural habitats (<= 12% of land cover) in a highland agricultural ecosystem in China. At the individual level, we measured the elapsed time from the departure of prior pollinator(s) to the arrival of another pollinator, the selection of honey bees for flowers occupied by bumble bees, and the length of time used by honey bees to explore floral resources at the two types of sites. At the community level, we explored the effect of bumble bee visitation on the distribution patterns of honey bees on squash flowers. Conclusively, bumble bee visitation caused an increase in elapsed time before flowers were visited again by a honey bee, a behavioral avoidance by a newly-arriving honey bee to select flowers occupied by bumble bees, and a shortened length of time the honey bee takes to examine and collect floral resources. The number of overall bumble bees on squash flowers was the most important factor explaining the difference in the distribution patterns of honey bees at the community level. Furthermore, decline in the number of overall bumble bees on the squash flowers resulted in an increase in the number of overall honey bees. Therefore, our study suggests that bee interactions provide an opportunity to enhance the resilience of ecosystem pollination services against the decline in pollinator diversity.

Integrating these hybrid materials within organic molecular thin film devices is key to fabricate functional devices. By evaporating ultra-thin films of organic semiconductor on thermally evaporated CH3NH3PbI3 and using in-situ ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, we directly measure the interfacial energy offset between CH3NH3PbI3 valence band maximum and the highest occupied molecular orbital for 5 different archetypal organic semiconductors. It is found that the energy offsets scale linearly as a function of the ionization energies of the organic semiconductors. The experimental data are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model for ideal semiconductor heterojunctions. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Thibau, E. S.; Llanos, A.; Lu, Z.

Herein, we reconstruct the phylogeny of 38 species of catfishes belonging to 28 genera and 14 families using the concatenated mitochondrial genes COI, cytb, and 16S rRNA, as well as the nuclear genes RAG1 and RAG2. The resulting phylogenetic trees consistently place Clupisoma as the sister taxon of Laides, and the five representative Asian schilbid genera form two monophyletic groups with the relationships (Ailia (Laides, Clupisoma)) and (Horabagrus, Pseudeutropius). The so-called "Big Asia" lineage relates distantly to African schilbids. Independent analyses of the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data yield differing trees for the two Asian schilbid groups. Analyses of the mitochondrial gene data support a sister-group relationship for (Ailia (Laides, Clupisoma)) and the Sisoroidea and a sister-taxon association of (Horabagrus, Pseudeutropius) and the Bagridae. In contrast, analyses of the combined nuclear data indicate (Ailia (Laides, Clupisoma)) to be the sister group to (Horabagrus, Pseudeutropius). Our results indicate that the Horabagridae, recognized by some authors as consisting of Horabagrus, Pseudeutropius and Clupisoma does not include the latter genus. We formally erect a new family, Ailiidae fam. nov. for a monophyletic Asian group comprised of the genera Ailia, Laides and Clupisoma.

We identified 84 molecular-line transitions from 17 species and their isotopologues. The molecular gas distribution of these lines mainly peaks in the continuum position of W51 North, and has a small tail extending to the west, probably associated with W51 d2. In addition to the commonly detected nitrogen-and oxygen-bearing species, we detected a large number of transitions of acetone (CH3COCH3) and methyl formate (CH3OCHO), which might suggest that these molecules are present in an early evolutionary stage of massive stars. We have also found that W51 North is an ethanol-rich source. There is no obvious difference in the molecular gas distributions between the oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing molecules. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, with the XCLASS tool, the molecular column densities and rotation temperatures are estimated. We have found that the oxygen-bearing molecules have considerably higher column densities and fractional abundances than the nitrogen-bearingmolecules. The rotation temperatures range from 100 to 200 K, suggesting that the molecular emission could originate from a warm environment. Finally, based on the gas distributions, fractional abundances and the rotation temperatures, we conclude that CH3OH, C2H5OH, CH3COCH3 and CH3CH2CN might be synthesized on the grain surface, while gas phase chemistry is responsible for the production of CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO and CH2CHCN.

These requirements heavily rely on the success of image (video) annotation, and thus large scale image annotation through innovative machine learning methods has attracted intensive attention in recent years. One representative work is support vector machine (SVM). Although it works well in binary classification, SVM has a non-smooth loss function and can not naturally cover multi-class case. In this paper, we propose manifold regularized kernel logistic regression (KLR) for web image annotation. Compared to SVM, KLR has the following advantages: (1) the KLR has a smooth loss function; (2) the KLR produces an explicit estimate of the probability instead of class label; and (3) the KLR can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. We carefully conduct experiments on MIR FLICKR dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of manifold regularized kernel logistic regression for image annotation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we use a novel rapid reinforcement paradigm to probe the temporal dynamics of the neural circuit underlying rapid object shape perception and thus test this feedforward assumption. Our results show that two shape stimuli are optimally reinforcing when separated in time by similar to 60 ms, suggesting an underlying recurrent circuit with a time constant (feedforward + feedback) of 60 ms. A control experiment demonstrates that this is not an attentional cueing effect. Instead, it appears to reflect the time course of feedback processing underlying the rapid perceptual organization of shape.

The structures of oxaliplatin/CDs were confirmed by NMR, FUR, TGA, XRD as well as SEM analysis. The results show that the water solubility of oxaliplatin was increased in the complex with CDs in 1:1 stoichiometry inclusion modes, and the cyclohexane ring of oxaliplatin molecule was deeply inserted into the cavity of CDs. Moreover, the stoichiometry was established by a Job plot and the water stability constant (K-c) of oxaliplatin/CDs was calculated by phase solubility studies, all results show that the oxaliplatin/beta-CD complex is more stable than free oxaliplatin, oxaliplatin/HP-beta-CD and oxaliplatin/gamma-CD. Meanwhile, the inclusion complexes displayed almost twice as high cytotoxicity compared to free oxaliplatin against HCT116 and MCF-7 cells. This satisfactory water solubility and higher cytotoxic activity of the oxaliplatin/CD complexes will potentially be useful for their application in anti-tumour therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Saponins are believed to be the major bioactive ingredients in P. notoginseng. Two different processes, steaming and biotransformation, were used to study the transformations of saponins in P. notoginseng. During an 8-h steaming process, the ginsenosides Rb1, Rd, Rg1, Re and notoginsenoside R1, decreased to 1.07 mg/g dry weight (DW), 0.91, 0.64, 0 and 0 mg/g DW, respectively. Meanwhile, ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3, 20(S)-Rh1, F2 and compound K significantly increased to 5.85, 6.10, 0.81 and 6.62 mg/g DW, respectively. On the other hand, one fungus was isolated from the root of P. notoginseng, which could transform ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside Rd specifically. The fungus was identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum species based on sequence analysis of the rRNA internal transcribed spacers region. The results implied a prospective feasibility for setting up different processing techniques to improve the quality of P. notoginseng and add its value.

Spatial dynamics of bacterial communities in rural household biogas digesters in different climatic regions of Yunnan plateau, China	BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						biogas digester; bacterial community; 16S rRNA gene clone library; spatial dynamic; redundancy analysis (RDA); metabolic pathway	ARCHAEAL COMMUNITIES; WASTE-WATER; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; FOOD	In order to reveal correlations between spatial dynamics, metabolic pathways and environmental factors of bacterial communities present in household biogas digesters in different climatic regions of Yunnan Plateau, bacterial communities were characterized based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences and redundancy analysis (RDA) from 4 representatives of the biogas digesters located in 4 different climatic regions. Four 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from sampled activated sludges, which resulted in a total of 14 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. These are responsible for completion of hydrolysis, fermentation, hydrogenesis and acetogenesis in the fermentation metabolic process. RDA analysis identified a positive correlation between the abundances of bacterial communities and environmental temperatures as well as volatile solid contents of the four samples. The results demonstrate that biogas digesters were promoted in tropical and subtropical regions, while organic wastes containing a high VS were utilized as raw materials, because under these conditions the most diverse bacteria are predicted to improve the efficiency of the biogas fermentation system.

The family Tephritidae includes over 4257 species distributed worldwide, so the complete mitochondrial genome would be helpful for bioidentification, biogeography and phylogeny. The B. correcta genome consists of 15 936 bp. Annotation indicated that the structure and orientation of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA sequences were typical of, and similar to, the ten closely related tephritid species. The nucleotide composition shows heavily biased toward As and Ts accounting 73.2% and exhibits a slightly positive AT skew, which is similar to other known tephritid species and other insects. The phylogenetic tree indicated the presence of three distinct families (Tephritidae, Muscidae, Drosophilidae) in Order Diptera.

We continued the study of subsoil karren that forms under tight, poorly permeable contact with soil and of rain flutes formed by water at various temperatures. We determined the pattern of the reshaping of plaster tubes that are wider at the flow inlet than at the outlet end. The results are a significant contribution to explaining the formation of high ceiling niches and pockets in karst caves. The third experiment was carried out in phreatic conditions where water in a flume was forced to flow between layers of different composition. During the experiment, we observed the typical development of channels between pure plaster layers (uniform limestone beds), between plaster layers with added Portland cement reinforced fragments (breccia beds), siporex dissolving beds) and between three different layer types.

Second, we prove the equivalence of some norms in the introduced spaces and derive their completeness, reflexivity, uniform convexity, and compactness of some imbeddings, which can be regarded as a novelty item. Then, as an application, we present a recent approach via variational methods and critical point theory to obtain the existence of solutions for p-Laplacian conformable fractional differential equation boundary value problem on time scale T: T-alpha(vertical bar T-alpha(u)vertical bar T-p-2(alpha)(u))(t) = del F(sigma(t),u(sigma(t))), Delta-a.e. t is an element of [a,b](T)(kappa 2), u(a)-u(b) = 0, T-alpha(u)(a)-T alpha(u)(b) = 0 where T-alpha(u)(t) denotes the conformable fractional derivative of u of order alpha at t, sigma is the forward jump operator, a,b is an element of T,0 < a < b, p > 1, and F : [0,T](T) x R-N -> R . By establishing a proper variational setting, we obtain three existence results. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the existence results.

Macro-/ mesoporous 5 at% Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Ag-AZO composite powders were prepared by a one-step solution combustion method and used to fabricate gas sensors. Both powders showed the same macro-/mesoporous morphology but have different grain sizes and separated silver phase due to the fast growth of ZnO and the reduction of Ag+. The capability of Ag-AZO was investigated for VOCs detection, including n-butanol, methanol, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol and formaldehyde. It is found that the added Ag greatly increases the gas response towards different VOCs. Particularly 2.5 at% Ag-AZO shows the most superior gas sensing performance to 100 ppm VOCs at an operating temperature of 240 degrees C, which is also the optimum operating temperature of other sensors. The results may be attributed to the synergistic effects of these doped and composite elements, the amount of adsorbed oxygen and the macro-/mesoporous morphology.

In previous studies, it was found that the water molecules can mediate proton transfer from nitrogen to oxygen, but the results of this study show that water molecules can also catalyse proton transfer from carbon to oxygen. With the mediation of water, the energy barriers were greatly lowered. The calculated energy barriers indicate that the para-position of phenol has higher reactivity than the ortho-position. The reaction occurs in a concerted mechanism. However, the process exhibits asynchronous characteristics, particularly the C-C bond formation precedes the proton transfer and the proton transfer from water molecules to the carbonyl oxygen is ahead of proton abstraction from the benzene ring.

Here, we demonstrate a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence properties of AIE molecules by confining them within the nanochannels of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). AIE molecules (4,4'-(hydrazine-1,2-diylidene bis(methanylylidene)) bis(3-hydroxybenzoic acid), HDBB) with pH-dependent emission were successfully integrated into UiO-66 resulting in a UiO-66 superset of HDBB complex while maintaining the crystal structure by the host-guest process. The fluorescence properties of HDBB can be modulated by virtue of the unique nanospace confining effect. Furthermore, UiO-66 superset of HDBB was used as a sensitive and selective fluorescent probe for Cu2+ detection in aqueous solution. This study provides a facile strategy for the construction of high performance AIE based luminescent materials with adjustable properties for potential applications.

The appearance of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) plays a key role in forming the unique CNTs@MnOOH core-shell. A high dielectric loss tangent value was observed for the samples with/without SDBS. Significantly, the CNTs@MnOOH core-shell nanocomposites exhibit an electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of 13-15 dB in the frequency range of 8-18 GHz, which can be attributed to the improved absorption loss, resulting from the increased electrical conductivity, and the improved impedance matching of the core-shell structure. Moreover, the increasing interfaces between the MnOOH and CNTs favor the electromagnetic attenuation performance. Our findings strongly confirm that the CNTs@MnOOH core-shell nanocomposites can be considered as a potential candidate for electromagnetic applications.

Identification of QTLs for resistant starch and total alkaloid content in brown and polished rice	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Resistant starch; Total alkaloids; Quantitative trait locus; Brown and polished rice	DIABETES PREVENTION; POPULATION; GENES; CHINA; FOODS; RATS; MAP	An F-3 population consisting of 117 F-2:3 families derived from a cross between two varieties of rice, Gongmi No. 3 and Diantun 502, with a large difference in their resistant starch and total alkaloid content, was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Two QTLs of resistant starch for rice (qRS7-1, qRS7-2) were identified in a linkage group on chromosome 7, which could explain phenotypic variance from 7.6 to 17.3%, due to additive effects for resistant starch from Gongmi No. 3 or over-dominance effects for qRS7-2 of the marker interval (RM3404-RM478) on chromosome 7 from Gongmi No. 3, accounting for 13.8-17.3% of the phenotypic variance. Two QTLs of total alkaloids for brown rice (qALb7-1, qALb7-2) were identified in the same linkage group, which could explain phenotypic variance from 7.7 and 19.3%, respectively, due to dominance or over-dominance effects for total alkaloids on chromosome 7 from Diantun 502. To our knowledge, these are the first QTLs to be identified, which are related to resistant starch and total alkaloid content in rice. These results are beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of, as well as for developing markers linked with, resistant starch and total alkaloids of functional components for marker-assisted selection breeding in rice.

In order to understand how nitrogen stress causes changes in mycelial proteins, we analyzed differentially expressed mycelial proteins from the M. oryzae virulent strain CH-63 using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry in complete medium or under nitrogen starvation conditions. A total of 975 +/- 70 and 1169 +/- 90 protein spots were detected in complete medium and under nitrogen starvation conditions, respectively. Forty-nine protein spots exhibited at least 2-fold upregulation or down-regulation at the protein level according to PDQuest7.4. Moreover, 43 protein spots were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Among these spots, 6 proteins were functionally unknown and 37 proteins were categorized into 5 groups according to their functions, including development, metabolism, biosynthesis, and biological process. These 37 proteins were further analyzed for their enriched metabolic pathways by KOBAS2.0, and 14 proteins were found to be involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and nitrogen metabolism. Taken together, the regulation of M. oryzae growth under the nitrogen starvation conditions appears to be complex because of the various proteins and enzymes involved.

The biological properties of the compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that the benzimidazole ring and 1-(naphthalen-2-yl) ethan-1-one or 2-naphthylmethyl substituent at the imidazolyl-3-position were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. Compound 41 was observed as a potent derivative with IC50 values of 3.24-8.78 mu M and exhibited cytotoxic activity selectively against HL-60, A-549 and MCF-7 cell lines. Meanwhile, high inhibitory activities selectively against HL-60 and MCF-7 cell lines were observed for compound 51. Moreover, compound 51 was able to induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxicity of compound 51 against human normal lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was further evaluated.

The crystal structure, morphology, and specific surface area were thoroughly characterized. It is found that the Pt-SnO2 nanocomposites consist of a large amount of small spheres with average diameters up to hundreds of nanometers, and every small sphere is composed of numerous primary nanocrystallites with an average size of about 8 nm. Compared with the pristine SnO2, the presence of Pt nanoparticles has no influence on the growth behavior of the SnO2 microspheres. The gas sensors based SnO2 microspheres in a composite with Pt nanoparticles not only show a lower operating temperature and immensely enhanced responses, but also exhibit a faster response and recovery speeds and remarkable stability to methanol, especially the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2 nanocomposite. The gas sensor based on the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2 nanocomposite exhibits a response value of 190.88 to 100 ppm methanol at a low operating temperature of 80 degrees C, while the gas sensor based on pristine SnO2 only displayed a response value of 19.38 at an operating temperature of 200 degrees C. The reasonable explanation of the gas-sensing performance enhancement for the gas sensors based on Pt-SnO2 nanocomposites is attributed to the strong spillover effect of the Pt nanoparticles and the electronic interaction between Pt nanoparticles and SnO2 microspheres, both of which promoted the low temperature gas-sensing performance.

Deuterium labeling experiments were carried out to identify the major product ions. Although compounds have similar structures, the profiles of their MS/MS spectra vary greatly. For compounds 1 and 2, abundant product ions both in high and low mass range can be detected. A six-member H rearrangement and the cleavage of C1-C2 bond connecting rings A, C and D play an important role in providing the product ions in low mass range. For compounds 3-9, the relative abundance of product ions in low mass range is low. This may result from the loss of HCOOCH3 occurring readily because C4-C5 double bond prevents six-member H rearrangement. Main fragmentation patterns of compounds 10-14 are the loss of the different side-chain groups and the cleavage of pyrrol and pyridine rings. A series of ion clusters detected in low mass range are characteristic ions for compounds 10-14. Fragmentation patterns of compounds 15 and 16 were elucidated. Four groups of isomers in these compounds were distinguished by characteristic product ions or fragmentation patterns.

OBJECTIVE: By simultaneously taking into account the natural attributes of the Doppler equipment, blood flow as well as vessel wall of pulsatile carotid arteries with a stenosis, a computer simulation method is presented to produce the compound Doppler ultrasound blood flow signals. METHODS: The in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) axial as well as radial blood flow signals are simulated by superposing a series of cosine functions regulated by the spectrograms estimated from the axial and radial velocity profiles firstly obtained through the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, respectively. Meanwhile, the I/Q Doppler signals echoed from pulsatile near (anterior) and far (posterior) walls are reproduced based on their radial movements during a cardiac cycle. Ultimately, those confirmed quadrature signals are summed to generate the compound Doppler signals including the contribution from both blood flow and stenosed vessel-wall. RESULTS: The compound Doppler ultrasound signals echoed from both axial and radial blood flows as well as vessel walls with obstruction grades of 0% (normal arteries), 10% and 25% are simulated respectively. The real signals from the left carotid artery with an approximately 10% stenosis degree are also collected for further assessing the believability of simulated versions. CONCLUSIONS: The simulated and clinical tests demonstrate that the proposed computer simulation method can produce compound Doppler signals with confirmed qualitative and quantitative characteristics resembled with the clinical versions, which could be used as an theoretical data source for evaluating the performance of the signal separation between pulsatile blood flows and vessel walls with mild stenosed-lesions.

In this paper, we study robust partially functional linear regression model in which a scale response variable is explained by a function-valued variable and a finite number of real-valued variables. For the estimation of the regression parameters, which include the infinite dimensional function as well as the slope parameters for the real-valued variables, we use polynomial splines to approximate the slop parameter. The estimation procedure is easy to implement, and it is resistant to heavy-tailederrors or outliers in the response. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Finally, we assess the finite sample performance of the proposed method by Monte Carlo simulation studies.

Furthermore, recent preclinical studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that in rodents, chronic stress and the stress hormone cortisol cause oxidative damage to mitochondrial function and membrane lipids in the brain. Mitochondria play a key role in synaptic neurotransmitter signaling by providing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mediating lipid and protein synthesis, buffering intracellular calcium, and regulating apoptotic and resilience pathways. Membrane lipids are similarly essential to central nervous system (CNS) function because cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and sphingolipids form a lipid raft region, a special lipid region on the membrane that mediates neurotransmitter signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Low serum cholesterol levels, low antioxidant capacity, and abnormal early morning cortisol levels are biomarkers consistently associated with both depression and suicidal behaviors. In this review, we summarize the manner in which nutrients can protect against oxidative damage to mitochondria and lipids in the neuronal circuits associated with cognitive and affective behaviors. These nutrients include 3 fatty acids, antioxidants (vitamin C and zinc), members of the vitamin B family (Vitamin B12 and folic acid), and magnesium. Accumulating data have shown that these nutrients can enhance neurocognitive function, and may have therapeutic benefits for depression and suicidal behaviors. A growing body of studies suggests the intriguing possibility that regular consumption of these nutrients may help prevent the onset of mood disorders and suicidal behaviors in vulnerable individuals, or significantly augment the therapeutic effect of available antidepressants. These findings have important implications for the health of both military and civilian populations.

It aims at generating more realistic ultrasonic signals to provide an environment for evaluating ultrasound signal processing and imaging and a framework for investigating the behaviors of blood flow field modulated by wall motion. This model takes into account fluid-structure interaction, blood pulsatility, stenosis of the vessel, and arterial wall movement caused by surrounding tissue's motion. The axial and radial velocity distributions of blood and the displacement of vessel wall are calculated by solving coupled Navier-Stokes and wall equations. With these obtained values, we made several different phantoms by treating blood and the vessel wall as a group of point scatterers. Then, ultrasound echoed signals from oscillating wall and blood in the axisymmetric stenotic-carotid arteries were computed by ultrasound simulation software, Field II. The results show better consistency with corresponding theoretical values and clinical data and reflect the influence of wall movement on the flow field. It can serve as an effective tool not only for investigating the behavior of blood flow field modulated by wall motion but also for quantitative or qualitative evaluation of new ultrasound imaging technology and estimation method of blood velocity.

Under the framework of a two-stage design, it has been shown that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analysis. Several robust tests have been proposed for joint analysis to handle the problem of unknown genetic mode of inheritance. However, existing joint analysis of combining test statistics from both stages might suffer from a loss of efficiency if the combined test statistics are not sufficient or the weight of the statistic for each stage is not appropriate. In this article, we propose a new strategy for joint analysis by combining the raw data rather than the test statistics across stages and construct a robust MAX3-based test for two-staged GWASs, which can make full use of the information of the data from both stages. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure is more powerful and computationally much faster than the existing joint analysis procedures. An application to a type 2 diabetes dataset is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

We successfully adopted the hydroxylation of tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti) in air and a post-sintering procedure to synthesize the TiO2-coated V2O5 micro-particles. Afterwards, systematic electrochemical characterization was performed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of V2O5 micro-particles as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with and without the TiO2 coating. As for the V2O5 micro-particles, the maximum discharge specific capacity reaches 247.8 mA h g(-1), which gradually decreases to 212.6 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) between 2 and 4 V (vs. Li/Li+). Under the same conditions, TiO2 coated V2O5 micro-particles deliver the highest capacity of 246.6 mA h g(-1) and keeps at 229.1 mA h g(-1) for the 50th cycle. The results indicated that the TiO2 coating could effectively suppress the electrochemical property degradation of V2O5 crystalline micro-particles, improving its cycling stability during long-term charge-discharge measurements through the protective role of the TiO2 layer.

This would support a familial pattern for type 2 diabetes. Thereby, we analyzed complete mtDNA genomes from two families, A and B, from Southwest China that demonstrated maternally inherited type 2 diabetes. Our data support that mtDNA lineages from families A and B belong to haplogroups A4 and D4h1, respectively. This suggests that maternally inherited type 2 diabetes with similar penetrances can arise in Chinese individuals with strikingly different maternal genetic backgrounds. Two private coding region mutations (G13759A in MT-ND5 and G15930A in tRNA-Thr) were identified in family B. Further evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses suggest that both these mutations have multiple origins and are unlikely to be disease causing.

However, the precise role of the pathoadaptive mutations in persistence in chronic airways infection remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that pyocyanin, a well-described P. aeruginosa virulence factor that plays an important role in the initial infection, promotes autophagy in bronchial epithelial cells. Disruption of phzM, which is required for pyocyanin biosynthesis, leads to a significant reduction in autophagy in Beas-2B cells and lung tissues. Pyocyanin-induced autophagy is mediated by the EIF2AK4/GCN2-EIF2S1/eIF2 alpha-ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, rats infected with the phzMD mutant strain have high mortality rate and numbers of colony-forming units, compared to those infected with wild-type (WT) P. aeruginosa PA14 strain, during chronic P. aeruginosa infection. In addition, the phzMD mutant strain induces more extensive alveolar wall thickening than the WT strain in the pulmonary airways of rats. As autophagy plays an essential role in suppressing bacterial burden, our findings provide a detailed understanding of why reduction of pyocyanin production in P. aeruginosa in chronic airways infections has been associated with better host adaptation and worse outcomes in cystic fibrosis.

J	Zhang, GS; Li, JC				Zhang, Guo Sheng; Li, Jian Cha			Distribution of inorganic phosphorus in profiles and particle fractions of Anthrosols across an established riparian buffer and adjacent cropped area at the Dian lake (China)	SOLID EARTH			English	Article							SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; LAND-USE; SIZE FRACTIONS; NITROGEN; ACCUMULATION; MANAGEMENT; FERTILIZER; SEDIMENT; NITRATE; LOSSES	Riparian buffers can trap sediment and nutrients sourced from upper cropland, minimizing the eutrophication risk of water quality. This study aimed to investigate the distributions of soil inorganic phosphorus (Pi) forms among profile and particle-size fractions in an established riparian buffer and adjacent cropped area at the Dian lake, southwestern China. The Ca-bound fraction (62 %) was the major proportion of the Pi in the riparian soils. After 3 years' restoration, buffer rehabilitation from cropped area had a limited impact on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, but has contributed to a change in Pi forms. In the 0-20 cm soil layer, levels of the Olsen-P, non-occluded, Ca-bound, and total Pi were lower in the buffer than the cropped area; however, the Pi distribution between the cropped area and the buffer did not differ significantly as depth increased. The clay fraction corresponded to 57% of TP and seemed to be both a sink for highly recalcitrant Pi and a source for labile Pi. The lower concentration of Pi forms in the silt and sand particle fraction in the surface soil was observed in the buffer area, which indicated that the Pi distribution in coarse particle fraction had sensitively responded to land use changes.

The results show that the substitution at 4-position of the 1,2,4-triazole with a benzyl, 4-bromophenacyl or naphthylacyl group could be crucial for prommoting cytotoxic activity. Especially, compound 28 was found to be the most powerful derivative with IC50 values lower than 3.50 mu M against five investigated tumor cell lines, while compound 19 showed selective activity against leukemia (HL-60) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines with IC50 values of 0.80 and 1.76 mu M, respectively. Compound 19 can induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells.

Here, we aimed to investigate the mutations and to characterize the phenotypes of a Han Chinese family with early-onset maternally inherited type 2 diabetes. Detailed clinical assessments and genetic screening for mutations in the HNF4 alpha, GCK, HNF-1 alpha, IPF-1, HNF1 beta, and NEUROD1 genes were carried out in this family. One HNF4A mutation (p.T130I) and two HNF1A polymorphisms (p.I27L and p.S487N) were identified. Mutation p.T130I was associated with both early-onset and late-onset diabetes and caused downregulated HNF4A expression, whereas HNF1A polymorphisms p.I27L and p.S487N were associated with the age of diagnosis of diabetes. We demonstrated that mutation p.T130I in HNF4A was pathogenic as were the predicted polymorphisms p.I27L and p.S487N in HNF1A by genetic and functional analysis. Our results show that mutations in HNF4A and HNF1A genes might account for this early-onset inherited type 2 diabetes.

In the special case when F is the subdifferential mapping of a proper lower semicontinuous function f, it is known that such a generalized metric subregularity is very closely related to the well-posedness of f. Using the technique of variational analysis and in terms of the coderivative, we established some sufficient conditions for a multifunction to be metrically subregular/regular with respect to an admissible function phi. In particular, we extend some existing results on the metric regularity and Holder metric regularity.

In this study, we present a one-step nonaqueous sol-gel route to form mixed-phase TiO2 at relatively low temperatures from 160 to 220 degrees C. The structure, morphology and surface chemical state were examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The influence of the preparation temperature on the structural characteristics including grain size and phase content were investigated using the Rietveld refinement. Through TEM, the evolution from sphere-like anatase nanoparticle to hexagonal rutile single-crystal was investigated. The photocatalytic activities of the obtained anatase and anatase-rutile TiO2 were evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light, and a distinct enhanced activity was observed. Through the UV-vis spectrum and mass spectrum, the pathway of RhB degradation caused by the mixed-phase TiO2 with visible light was studied. At the same time, the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic properties was presented. The mechanisms were verified with UV-vis measurements.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							EMENDED DESCRIPTION; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; CLASSIFICATION; SOIL	A novel obligately halophilic, facultatively alkaliphilic actinobacterium, designated EGI 80759(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of Tamarix hispida Willd, Karamay, Xinjiang province, north-west China. Cells of strain EGI 80759(T) were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile and non-endospore-forming rods. Strain EGI 80759(T) showed obligately halophilic growth with a tolerance to 8-25 % (w/v) NaCI (optimum growth at 10-12 %, w/v) and facultatively alkaliphilic growth within the pH range 7.0-11.0 (optimum growth at pH 9.0-10.0). Cell-wall hydrolysates of the isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid (peptidoglycan type A1 gamma), with glucose, glucosamine, ribose and mannose as the major sugars. The major fatty acids identified were 10-methyl-C-17 : 0, C-17 : 1 omega 8c and C-17 : 0. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 72.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that strain EGI 80759(T) clustered with members of the class Nitriliruptoria and showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Euzebya tangerina F10(T) (90.3 %) and Nitriliruptor alkaliphilus ANL-iso2(T) (88.1 %). On the basis of the data obtained from phenotypic and chemotaxonomic studies and the phylogenetic analysis, the isolate is proposed to be a representative of a novel genus and a novel species, Egibacter rhizosphaerae gen. nov., sp. nov., of a proposed novel family, Egibacteraceae fam. nov., and order, Egibacterales ord. nov., within the class Nitriliruptoria.

Double bonds in the oleic acid molecules were activated and further grafted with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) in butyl acetate to obtain acrylate copolymer-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) was used as the cross-linking agent to immobilize the surface structure of the nanoparticles. Fe3O4 templates were then disposed of with excessive concentrated HCl solution, and monodispersed ultra-fine and an ultra-light hollow polymer/iron eutectic system with a size range of 18-30 nm was thus obtained. The molecular structures, crystal information, thermal properties, and morphology of the prepared nano-particles were characterized. The results showed that the hollow nanoparticles were composed of an amorphous outer layer and a crystalline inner layer, and that the outer layer and the inner layer mainly consisted of acrylate copolymers and ordered iron oxide atoms, respectively. The cross-linked macromolecular architectures and the chemical bond between Fe atoms and polymeric chains are the main driving force to form such a hollow eutectic system that has never been reported previously. The preparation method reported in this paper firstly develops a route to synthesize hollow polymer/metal eutectic materials, and these hollow nanoparticles have large potential application in the fields of nanoreactors and catalysts.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to clarify its inclusion mechanism. Enabled by encapsulation with cyclodextrin, the water solubility of satraplatin was successfully increased to 7.4 mg mL(-1) and significantly improved by phase solubility studies. Meanwhile, the stability of satraplatin in acidic and weak alkaline aqueous solution was also effectively enhanced by forming the inclusion complex. Importantly, in an in vitro cytotoxicity test, the satraplatin encapsulated complex displayed superior cytotoxicity compared to free satraplatin against A549 and MCF-7 cells but was almost non-toxic to Caco-2 cells. In an in vivo antitumor test, this satraplatin encapsulated complex has shown much better activity in repressing lung cancer than free satraplatin but nearly no damage to intestinal mucosa by oral administration evaluated in xenograft mice models. Overall, the development of the current satraplatin/beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex has significantly improved the bioavailability of satraplatin and could benefit further applications in related pharmaceutical formulations.

This compound is a reversible photoresponsive chiral liquid crystal, capable of the formation of multistimuli responsive organogels in organic solvents. The liquid crystalline, photo responsive and gelling properties as well as chiral induction and chiral amplification properties were demonstrated by polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and affected by UV irradiation. The compound can act as a chiral mesogenic dye dopant to induce a highly helical twisting chiral phase in the common nematic phase of 5CB. This compound can show reversible photoresponsive properties in solution, in the liquid crystalline state and in the gel state. The gel formed by this compound in organic solvents can be reversibly modified under different environmental stimuli including light, temperature and shear. SEM and AFM reveal that the gelator molecules self-assemble into helical fibers of 58-130 nm in width and tens of micrometers in length and these fibers form three-dimensional networks.

The analytical formula of Airy beam with the tunable tail is derived. Airy beam with the single tail can be obtained by adjusting the ration of the beam width of elliptical flat-topped Gaussian beam. The tail length of Airy beam can be controlled by the order N of incident beam. The normalized intensity distributions of Airy beam with the tunable tail propagating in free space are studied, and the propagation dynamics of Airy beam with the single tail are investigated. Compared with the Airy beam generated from the fundamental Gaussian beam or the flat-topped Gaussian beam, some interesting and useful information has been found.

Selection and successful propagation of native tree species are important for improving ecological restoration of these forests. We carried out a series of experiments to study the propagation requirements of indigenous subtropical tree species in Southwest China. Seeds of 21 tree species collected from the natural forest were materials for the experiment. This paper examines the seed germination and seedling growth performance of these species in a nursery environment. Germination percentages ranged from 41% to 96% and were 50% for 19 species. The median length of germination time (MLG) ranged from 24 days for Padus wilsonii to 144 days for Ilex polyneura. Fifteen species can reach the transplant size (15 cm in height) within 12 months of seed collection. Nursery-grown seedlings for each species were planted in degraded site. Two years after planting, the seedling survival rate was >50% in 18 species and >80% in 12 species. Based on these results, 17 species were recommended as appropriate species for nursery production in forest restoration projects. Our study contributes additional knowledge regarding the propagation techniques for various native subtropical tree species in nurseries for forest restoration.

The morphology and phase structure of the La-doped SnO2 nanoarrays were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the BET method. The results showed that the La-doped SnO2 layered nanorod array demonstrated a unique nanostructure combined together with double layers of nanorod arrays and could be indexed to a tetragonal structure. The gas sensing performance of La-doped SnO2 nanoarrays indicated that La doping could enhance the sensing response to acetone. The 3.0 at% La-doped level of the SnO2 sensor not only showed good selectivity and excellent stability, but also exhibited a rapid response and recovery compared to the pristine and other La-doped levels of SnO2 nanoarrays. The gas sensing mechanism of the La-doped SnO2 layered nanoarray was discussed. The La-doped SnO2 sensors are considered to be promising candidates for applications in detecting acetone.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	4.5 YEARS OF MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS OF MRK 421 DURING THE ARGO-YBJ AND FERMI COMMON OPERATION TIME	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: individual (Markarian 421); galaxies: active; gamma-rays: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	LARGE-AREA TELESCOPE; TEV GAMMA-RAYS; BL-LAC OBJECTS; ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SHOCK ACCELERATION; GIANT FLARE; SKY SURVEY; RADIATION; EMISSION	We report on the extensive multi-wavelength observations of the blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) covering radio to gamma-rays, during the 4.5 year period of ARGO-YBJ and Fermi common operation time, from 2008 August to 2013 February. These long-term observations, extending over an energy range of 18 orders of magnitude, provide a unique chance to study the variable emission of Mrk 421. In particular, due to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the entire. energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low-and high-activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. The X-ray flux is clearly correlated with the TeV gamma-ray flux, while the GeV gamma-rays only show a partial correlation with the TeV gamma-rays. Radio and UV fluxes seem to be weakly or not correlated with the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to a few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

However, compared to submerged macrophytes, the influence of emergent macrophytes on sedimentation dynamics have been studied less often. In this study, a field experiment was conducted to compare the influence of three typical emergent macrophytes (Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Carex brevicuspis, and Phalaris arundinacea) on sedimentation characteristics in Dongting Lake. In addition, the factors that determine sediment characteristics were also investigated. Both vegetation type and vegetation removal treatments had significant effects on sedimentation depth. Compared to the non-vegetated treatment, sedimentation depths were much greater in the vegetated treatments in all three communities. The order of sediment-trapping ability, from highest to lowest was P. arundinacea > M. sacchariflorus > C. brevicuspis; sedimentation rate was much higher in the P. arundinacea community than that in the other two communities, especially in the Tuanzhou and Chapanzhou lakeshores. In the vegetated treatment, clay and fine sand contents were significantly influenced by both vegetation type and vegetation removal treatment, whereas fine silt, coarse silt, and coarse sand contents were significantly affected only by vegetation type. Sand content was higher, but clay and silt contents were lower in the M. sacchariflorus community compared to the other two communities. Median particle size in the M. sacchariflorus community was much higher than that in the other two communities in both non-vegetated and vegetated treatments. Organic matter content, total N, and sediment pH were influenced by vegetation type alone. Sediment in the M. sacchariflorus community had a lower pH but higher organic matter and total N content compared to the other two communities. Multiple linear regression indicated that sediment characteristics were significantly correlated with vegetation characteristics (e.g. plant density, height, and biomass), elevation, and flooding time. The data indicate that the roles of these three emergent macrophytes in promoting sedimentation vary significantly, which is mainly due to their different structural properties and distribution patterns. Our results provide experimental information on the role of emergent macrophytes in promoting sedimentation and may assist in the effective management of Dongting Lake.

The sexual morph does not significantly differ from O. luteorubella, whereas the asexual morph obtained from its ascospore isolate resembles members of the non-predacious genus Dactylella, because it has fusiform phragmoconidia borne singly at the apex of conidiophores. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain dustered with a clade that included available strains of the O. luteorubella aggregate and was distant from all analysed Dactylella species. Within this clade, the new strain fell between species with filiform conidia and those of a Pseudotripoconidium anamorph. By combining morphological and phylogenetic analyses, we conclude that our isolate belongs to a new taxon. Pleomorphism of the new taxon is described and discussed.

Then we prove a Massera type theorem for impulsive dynamic equations on time scales and based on this theorem, we establish a criterion for the existence and uniformly asymptotic stability of a unique positive almost periodic solution of the system. Finally, we give an example to show the feasibility of our main results. Our example also shows that the continuous time system and its corresponding discrete time system have the same dynamics.

In the presence of cholesterol, the MB molecules are displaced by cholesterol in the CX6-Gra. MB complex, leading to a "switch off" electrochemical response. A linear response range of 0.50 to 50.00 mu M for cholesterol with a low detection limit of 0.20 mu M (S/N = 3) was obtained by using the proposed method. This method could be successfully utilized to detect cholesterol in serum samples, and may be expanded to the analysis of other non-electroactive species. Besides, the host-guest interaction between cholesterol and CX6 was studied by molecular modeling calculations, which revealed that the complexation could reduce the energy of the system and the complex of a 1 : 1 host-guest stoichiometry had the lowest binding free energy of -8.01 kcal mol(-1). In addition, the constructed electrochemical sensing platform is important as it does not use any enzyme or antibody for the detection of cholesterol efficiently and selectively over common interfering species.

In this study, a virulent bacteriophage, QHHSV-1, of the family Siphoviridae that specifically infects H. ventosae QH52-2 was isolated from the Qiaohou salt mine. Restriction analysis indicated that QHHSV-1 is a dsDNA virus with a genome size of 33.5-39.5 kb. Transmission electron microscopy showed that QHHSV-1 is a typical representative of the Siphoviridae, with an icosahedral head (47 nm in diameter) and a non-contractile tail (75 nm in length). We also assessed the adsorption rate of QHHSV-1 for the host bacterium and found significant inhibition after the addition of 10 mM CaCl2. Based on a one-step growth curve, we determined a latent period of 30 min and a burst size of 73 PFU/infected cell. At the optimal pH of 8.0, 25.9 and 15.2 % of the phages survived after a 60-min incubation at 50 and 60 A degrees C, respectively. Phage replication was possible at a wide range of salt concentrations, from 2.0 to 20 % (w/v), with an optimum concentration of 5 %. The survival of QHHSV-1 at different salt concentrations decreased with time and 25 % survival after 25 days at 30 % salt concentration.

Specially, spatiotemporal dynamics of breather two-soliton and multi-soliton including deformation between bright and dark multi-soliton each other, and deflection with different directions and angles are investigated and exhibited to ()D KdV equation. Some new nonlinear phenomena are revealed under the small perturbation of parameter.

Plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted increasing interest in colorimetric sensing, due to their outstanding optical, chemical, and catalytic properties. Their colors, derived from the absorption of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), strongly depend on the shape, size, constituent, and aggregates states, which could be tuned by cysteine. This review highlights the recent advances in cysteine detection with plasmonic nanoparticles as colorimetric platforms, wherein the colors of nanomaterials change upon the introduction of cysteine, which could be easily followed by the naked eye without requiring any instrumentation. The selective and sensitive detection mechanisms are discussed. The presence of cysteine could adjust the shape, size, constituent, and interparticle distance of nanomaterials, leading to the color transformation. In addition, the introduction of cysteine could adjust the catalytic capability of nanomaterials, resulting in the color variance. Based on those mechanisms, the colorimetric detection of cysteine could be achieved in a facile way. Finally, challenges and future perspectives are outlined.

I. DISCOVERY OF AN EXTREMELY YOUNG CLASS 0 PROTOSTELLAR OBJECT AND A PROTO-BROWN DWARF CANDIDATE IN THE BRIGHT-RIMMED CLUMP PGCC G192.32-11.88	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						ISM: jets and outflows; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; stars: formation	MASSIVE-STAR-FORMATION; SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; RADIATION-DRIVEN IMPLOSION; IRAS POINT SOURCES; H-II REGIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; STELLAR OBJECTS; EVOLUTION; CONTINUUM; COLLAPSE	We are performing a series of observations with ground-based telescopes toward Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) in the lambda Orionis complex in order to systematically investigate the effects of stellar feedback. In the particular case of PGCC G192.32-11.88, we discovered an extremely young Class 0 protostellar object (G192N) and a proto-brown dwarf candidate (G192S). G192N and G192S are located in a gravitationally bound brightrimmed clump. The velocity and temperature gradients seen in line emission of CO isotopologues indicate that PGCC G192.32-11.88 is externally heated and compressed. G192N probably has the lowest bolometric luminosity (similar to 0.8 L-circle dot) and accretion rate (6.3 x 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1)) when compared with other young Class 0 sources (e.g., PACS Bright Red Sources) in the Orion complex. It has slightly larger internal luminosity (0.21 +/- 0.01 L-circle dot) and outflow velocity (similar to 14 km s(-1)) than the predictions of first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs). G192N might be among the youngest Class 0 sources, which are slightly more evolved than an FHSC. Considering its low internal luminosity (0.08 +/- 0.01 L-circle dot) and accretion rate (2.8 x 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1)), G192S is an ideal proto-brown dwarf candidate. The star formation efficiency (similar to 0.3%-0.4%) and core formation efficiency (similar to 1%) in PGCC G192.32-11.88 are significantly smaller than in other giant molecular clouds or filaments, indicating that the star formation therein is greatly suppressed owing to stellar feedback.

Using whole genome sequences from a total of 58 canids (12 gray wolves, 27 primitive dogs from Asia and Africa, and a collection of 19 diverse breeds from across the world), we find that dogs from southern East Asia have significantly higher genetic diversity compared to other populations, and are the most basal group relating to gray wolves, indicating an ancient origin of domestic dogs in southern East Asia 33 000 years ago. Around 15 000 years ago, a subset of ancestral dogs started migrating to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, arriving in Europe at about 10 000 years ago. One of the out of Asia lineages also migrated back to the east, creating a series of admixed populations with the endemic Asian lineages in northern China before migrating to the New World. For the first time, our study unravels an extraordinary journey that the domestic dog has traveled on earth.

The complex 1 was utilized as a representative chemosensor to detect small molecules, cations and anions, respectively. Interestingly, 1 exhibited dual-functional detection of Pb2+ and Fe3+ ions in ethanol with excellent linear variation to quantify the corresponding concentration change. In addition, the temperature-dependent luminescence properties of 1, 2 and 7 have also been investigated systematically, which demonstrated that both 1 and 7 have potential to quantitatively detect temperature as a luminescent thermometer over a wide range from 10-300 K for 1 and 10-170 K for 7. Thus, the as-obtained Ln-MOF materials have potential to serve as the first examples of a multifunctional luminescent sensor for quantitatively detecting the temperature (10-300 K) and the concentration of Pb2+ and Fe3+ ions in ethanol solution.

Calculation of the Nemerow pollution index revealed that all sampled soils were heavily polluted. The concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in the maize samples presented a decreasing trend from roots to shoots to seeds, except for Zn (roots > seeds > shoots), and the content of HMs in the maize roots was positively correlated with both soil total and extractable HMs. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) intensively colonised in the maize roots, and their functional roles are discussed in the soils contaminated by HMs. The study results showed that intensive mining and smelting activities contributing to soil metal contamination present a high metal-pollution risk for crops grown.

J	Wu, Q; Jin, Y; Fan, H				Wu, Qiong; Jin, Yuan; Fan, Hui			Evaluating and comparing performances of topographic correction methods based on multi-source DEMs and Landsat-8 OLI data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; TM DATA; RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; MINNAERT CORRECTION; NORMALIZATION; ACCURACY; TERRAIN; LANDSCAPE; SELECTION	Topographic correction is a crucial and challenging step in interpreting optical remote-sensing images of extremely complex terrain environments due to the lack of universally suitable correction algorithms and digital elevation models (DEMs) of adequate resolution and quality. The free availability of open source global DEMs provides an unprecedented opportunity to remove topographic effects associated with remote-sensing data in remote and rugged mountain terrains. This study evaluated the performances of seven topographic correction methods including C-correction (C), Cosine C-correction (CC), Minnaert correction (M), Sun-canopy-sensor (SCS) correction (S), SCS+C-correction (SC), Teillet regression correction (TR), and the Terrain illumination correction model (TI) based on multi-source DEMs (local topographic map, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM filled-finished A/B and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM) data sets) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data using visual and statistical evaluation strategies. Overall, these investigated topographic correction methods removed topographic effects associated with Landsat-8 OLI data to varying degrees. However, the performances of these methods generally depend on the use of different DEMs and evaluation strategies. Among these correction methods, the SCS+C-correction performed best and was less sensitive to the use of different DEMs. The performances of topographic corrections based on free and open-access DEMs were generally better than or comparable to those based on local topographic maps. In particular, the topographic correction performance was greatly improved using the SRTM filled-finished B (FFB) data set with a resampling scheme based on the average value within a 3 x 3 pixel window. Nevertheless, further quantitative investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of DEMs and evaluation strategies used to select topographic correction methods.

Cupric oxalate ( CuC2O4 center dot xH(2)O) micro-sheets were firstly peeled off by immersing Cu foil in oxalic acid solution at room temperature, and then they were converted into CuO with preserved configuration after thermal treatment at 350 degrees C. Various techniques were employed for the characterization of the structure and morphology of as-prepared products. Results revealed that the samples were composed of a large amount of porous CuO micro-sheets, which were constructed by plenty of nano-sized primary particles. A gas sensor was fabricated using as-prepared CuO micro-sheets and was systematically investigated for its ability to detect n-butanol. Due to the porous structure of CuO micro-sheets, the sensor based on CuO micro-sheets manifests a remarkably improved sensing performance, including high response, good selectivity, excellent reproducibility and stability, and limit of detection as low as 10 ppm at 160 degrees C, suggesting its greatly promising applications in gas sensing.

However, the adaptation mechanisms for halophilism are still unclear. Here, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification based quantitative proteomics to investigate the functions of the membrane proteome after salt-stress. A total of 683 membrane proteins were identified and quantified, of which 126 membrane proteins displayed salt-induced changes in abundance. Intriguingly, bioinformatics analyses indicated that these differential proteins showed two expression patterns, which were further validated by phenotypic changes and functional differences. The majority of ABC transporters, secondary active transporters, cell motility proteins, and signal transduction kinases were up-regulated with increasing salt concentration, whereas cell differentiation, small molecular transporter (ions and amino acids), and secondary metabolism proteins were significantly up-regulated at optimum salinity, but down-regulated or unchanged at higher salinity. The small molecule transporters and cell differentiation-related proteins acted as sensing proteins that played a more important biological role at optimum salinity. However, the ABC transporters for compatible solutes, Na+-dependent transporters, and cell motility proteins acted as adaptive proteins that actively counteracted higher salinity stress. Overall, regulation of membrane proteins may provide a major protection strategy against hyperosmotic stress.

The 3D binary map series (BMS) generated by PCNN effectively describes image feature information such as edges and regional distribution, so BMS can be treated as the basis of extracting 1D oscillation time series (OTS) for an image. However, the traditional methods using BMS did not consider the correlation of the binary sequence in BMS and the space structure for every map. By further processing for BMS, a novel facial feature extraction method is proposed. Firstly, consider the correlation among maps in BMS; a method is put forward to transform BMS into frequency map series (FMS), and the method lessens the influence of noncontinuous feature regions in binary images on OTS-BMS. Then, by computing the 2D entropy for every map in FMS, the 3D FMS is transformed into 1D OTS (OTS-FMS), which has good geometry invariance for the facial image, and contains the space structure information of the image. Finally, by analyzing the OTS-FMS, the standard Euclidean distance is used to measure the distances for OTS-FMS. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of OTS-FMS in facial recognition, and it shows better recognition performance than other feature extraction methods.

However, its distribution and expansion is seldom reported in China. This study for the first time conducted a survey on the new distribution of A. mearnsii at the Kunming Changshui Airport (Yunnan Province, China), through monitoring on population characteristics (number, density, height and ground diameter) and spatial distribution (spread distance). Our survey results show that A. mearnsii has spread rapidly across the airport. This study discusses three factors of environmental factors, human disturbance and weed characteristics behind this successful invasion. The species invasion has a strong potential to change the local vegetation structure, enhances the probability of bird strikes at the airport, and is vulnerable to invade new biogeographic regions if it is not controlled. Currently, eradication combined with mechanical control is considered to be the best option for control. Our study helps improve awareness about the potential risk of A. mearnsii invasion in other airports around China and the world.

By using some fixed point theorems in Banach space and inequality technique, some completely new sufficient conditions of the existence and exponential stability of piecewise pseudo-almost periodic solutions are established for impulsive non-autonomous high-order Hopfield neural networks with variable coefficients and delays. Finally, a numerical example and simulations are given to illustrate that the obtained results are feasible and effective. It is the first time that the existence and stability of the pseudo-almost periodic solutions for impulsive nonautonomous neural networks are obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the constraint relation of three conics formed by three 3D lines according to the paracatadioptric projection is divided into three situations. In the first, three groups of vanishing points in orthogonal directions are formed by the principle point coordinates and six intersection points of the three conics. In the second, six groups of vanishing points in orthogonal directions are determined by common diameters on the unit sphere and tangents at intersection points of the three conics. In the third, three groups of circular points are formed by each side of a complete quadrangle formed by two circular points and the intersection points of the three conics. These three methods can solve the camera intrinsic parameters effectively and accurately, as verified by simulation and real data applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The search for a simple method to upgrade device performance for OPDs becomes increasingly important. Here, the performance of an OPD in the near-infrared (NIR) region is tremendously improved by doping iodine into the device's active layer (P3HT:PCBM:I-2), 2.7 wt% iodine doping may increase the absorption by 31.3% for the active film and result in a similar to 11 000-fold increase in responsivity for the detector. A high detectivity (D*) of similar to 1.6 x 10(12) cm Hz(1/2) W-1, a good specific responsivity (R) of similar to 80 A W-1 and a large EQE (external quantum efficiency) of 120% are achieved under illumination (lambda = 850 nm) at room temperature. Systematic characterizations reveal that iodine-doping can introduce acceptor states in the energy band gap for the polymer layer, and thus increase the harvesting to long wavelength photons. A small dose of iodine doping can significantly induce improvement in device performance. This work demonstrates a simple but feasible method to enhance an NIR optoelectronics device.

Various techniques were employed for the characterization of the structure and morphology of the as-prepared products. The gas-sensing characteristics of the fabricated sensors were investigated for various concentrations of xylene at different temperatures. At a low operation temperature of 160 degrees C, the sensors possess an excellent gas response, selectivity, linear dependence, low detection limitation, and repeatability as well as long-term stability. In particular, for the high gas response of the 10.0 mol% WO3 decorated TiO2 nanoparticles based sensor, its response reaches 92.53 for 10 ppm xylene, which is much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 based sensor. And the detection limit is 1 ppm. Those values demonstrate the potential of using WO3 decorated TiO2 nanoparticles for xylene gas detection, particularly with low concentration xylene. Apart from this, the mechanism related to the advanced properties was also investigated and presented.

Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and labetalol were selected as the probe and target molecules, respectively. When R6G enters into the SCX6 host, its fluorescence is quenched by MnO2@RGO. However, on addition of labetalol to the preformed R6G.SCX6-MnO2@RGO complex, the R6G molecule is displaced by labetalol from the host of SCX6, leading to a "switch-on" fluorescence response. This is due to the fact that the binding constant of the labetalol/SCX6 complex is much higher than that of R6G/SCX6. The fluorescence intensity of the SCX6-MnO2@RGO$ R6G complex increased linearly with increasing concentration of labetalol ranging from 1.0 to 18.0 mu M. The proposed method showed a detection limit of 0.25 mu M for labetalol. In addition, 2D NMR and molecular modeling studies indicated that the salicylamide part of the labetalol molecule inserted into the cavity of SCX6, while the phenylpropyl group located outside of the SCX6 host.

However, understanding of the EOF2 mode is still limited. In this study, the authors identify that the EOF2 mode physically depicts the latitudinal variation of the climatological summer-mean rainy belt along the Yangtze River valley (YRRB), based on a 160-station rainfall dataset in China for the period 1951-2011. The latitudinal variation of the YRRB is mostly attributed to two different rainfall patterns: one reflects the seesaw (SS) rainfall changes between the YH and SC (SS pattern), and the other features rainfall anomalies concentrated in SC only (SC pattern). Corresponding to a southward shift of the YRRB, the SS pattern, with above-normal rainfall in SC and below-normal rainfall in the YH, is related to a cyclonic anomaly centered over the SC-East China Sea region, with a northerly anomaly blowing from the YH to SC; while the SC pattern, with above-normal rainfall in SC, is related to an anticyclonic anomaly over the western North Pacific (WNP), corresponding to an enhanced southwest monsoon over SC. The cyclonic anomaly, related to the SS pattern, is induced by a near-barotropic eastward propagating wave train along the Asian upper-tropospheric westerly jet, originating from the mid-high latitudes of the North Atlantic. The anticyclonic anomaly, for the SC pattern, is related to suppressed rainfall in the WNP.

Based on an enhanced electrical conductivity through micro-current network induced by unique 2D nanostructures of RGO, the electron hopping between Mn2+ and Mn3+ is discussed. Benefiting from the enhanced effect of Debye dipolar relaxation and Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization on dielectric properties, electromagnetic wave propagating and microwave attenuation performance, the maximum EMI shielding effectiveness of 29 dB is achieved.

To do so, we used 15 monochromatic lights (emitting various specific wavelengths from 340 to 649 nm) and white light. E. formosa adults, which are diurnal insects, showed a positive phototaxis to a broad spectrum of light, with peaks of sensitivity at 414, 340, 450, and 504 nm. These results show that this parasitoid is generally more sensitive to short wavelength lights than long wavelength lights across all spectral ranges tested. Furthermore, E. formosa adults showed an increased phototactic response at low intensities and a decreased response at high intensities, for both ultraviolet light and violet light. Thus, E. formosa showed both colour and intensity preferences. This experiment provides a scientific basis for the development of colour traps for insect pest management and improves understanding of the ecological significance of colour vision by E. formosa.
