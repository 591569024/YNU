Single-crystal X-ray structural analyses reveal that the five complexes demonstrate different molecular frameworks coming from various coordination modes and flexibilities of different dicarboxylate zwitterionic pyridine ligands and central metal atoms. Mononuclear twofold dinuclear 2D twofold interpenetrating net for 2, four-coordinate mononuclear twofold interpenetrating 2D layer for 3, mononuclear 2D layer arranged in parallel and with large grids for 4, and twofold trans interpenetrating 2D network for compound 5. The structural diversities in 1-5 indicate that the nature of the ligands and the presence of different metal atoms have a great influence on central metal coordination modes and the structural topologies of the metal-organic molecular architectures. In addition, pi center dot center dot center dot pi stacking interactions also play important roles in the final crystal packing and supramolecular frameworks. The powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, and photoluminescence properties of 1-5 were studied, which show that architectures play an important role in emission bands and intensities.

In this paper, we report a set of analytical equations which describe how and where defects form during exciton-driven degradation of an OLED and their impact on device operation. This set of equations allows us to quantify changes in the exciton and defect populations as a function of time in neat layers of 4,4'-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP) in simple bilayer OLEDs. CBP produces luminescent defects which present a unique opportunity to quantify the exciton capturing dynamics of the defects. Through modeling of the time and current density dependence of both the CBP and defect emission, we clearly identify CBP singlet excitons as the source of OLED degradation. Further analysis of experimental data on devices with precisely positioned exciton capturing layers suggests that defects are formed near organic heterojunctions. Published by AIP Publishing.

The knowledge-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis has allowed the production of designer analogs by rational metabolic pathway engineering. While successful, structural alterations are limited, with designer analogs often produced in compromised titers. The discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis complements the knowledge-based approach by exploring the vast combinatorial biosynthesis repertoire found in Nature. Here we showcase the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis by targeting the domain of unknown function and cysteine lyase domain (DUF-SH) didomain, specific for sulfur incorporation from the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic machinery, to discover the LNM family of natural products. By mining bacterial genomes from public databases and the actinomycetes strain collection at The Scripps Research Institute, we discovered 49 potential producers that could be grouped into 18 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis of the DUF-SH didomains. Further analysis of the representative genomes from each of the clades identified 28 lnm-type gene clusters. Structural diversities encoded by the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries were predicted based on bioinformatics and confirmed by in vitro characterization of selected adenylation proteins and isolation and structural elucidation of the guangnanmycins and weishanmycins. These findings demonstrate the power of the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity and highlight Nature's rich biosynthetic repertoire. Comparative analysis of the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries provides outstanding opportunities to dissect Nature's biosynthetic strategies and apply these findings to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity.

Despite these favorable properties, peroxidase-mimicking nanozymes suffer from the optimum reaction occurring in acidic solutions, which greatly limits their applications in biological systems. Herein, we demonstrate that copper Metal-Organic Polyhedra (Cu-MOP) nanorods exhibit high peroxidase-mimicking activity at a physiological pH value. Cu-MOP nanorods catalyze the generation of strong chemiluminescence signals in the presence of luminol/H2O2 and the oxidation of 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate acid) (ABTS) by H2O2 produces a green color reaction in a neutral pH solution. The Cu-MOP nanorod driven generation of color reactions is applied to develop a H2O2 sensor, and furthermore is implemented to develop a glucose detection platform.

The heterostructures enhance the interaction between CeO2 and Bi2WO6 and contain rich oxygen vacancies, leading to generate more heterojunctions. The hollow capsule of the photocatalyst improve the light efficiency significantly due to the effective multiple reflections in the cave. Therefore, the novel materials show a remarkable reduction performance for Cr(VI) and detoxification of cyanide under visible light irradiation. The concentration of Cr(VI) decreases sharply with the irradiation time, and 99.6% of Cr(VI) is degraded within 60 min. meanwhile, the chromium ions can be adsorbed completely. Moreover, the removal rate for cyanide is as high as 98.3%. Combined with the analysis of in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy technology, the photocatalytic reduction mechanism of Cr(VI) is confirmed as a proton coupled electron transfer process. The improved photocatalytic activity of CeO2-Bi2WO6 heterojunctions and oxygen vacancies can be attributed to the enhanced photoabsorption properties and effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Particularly, CeO2@Bi2WO6 photocatalysts having an excellent magnetism are easy to be fast collected after photocatalytic reaction, displaying its great potential used in the energy and environmental science.

Hence, a functional-structural composite consisting of a central compact Ti-13Nb-13Zr core with an outer porous Ti-10% HA layer was fabricated by spark plasma sintering. The central alloy provides excellent mechanical properties (compressive strength of 1289.7 MPa), while the outer layer has appropriate pore characteristics (micro and macro-pores between 100-400 mu m) and elasticity modulus (14.9 GPa). In vitro bioactivity study showed the formation of bone-like apatite precipitates on porous Ti-HA layer. This work might provide a strategy for designing and fabricating multifunctional materials that could be potential as bone implants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, B; Pei, YJ; Wu, H; Huang, DJ				Li, Bo; Pei, Yijian; Wu, Hao; Huang, Dijiang			MADM-based smart parking guidance algorithm	PLOS ONE			English	Article								In smart parking environments, how to choose suitable parking facilities with various attributes to satisfy certain criteria is an important decision issue. Based on the multiple attributes decision making (MADM) theory, this study proposed a smart parking guidance algorithm by considering three representative decision factors (i.e., walk duration, parking fee, and the number of vacant parking spaces) and various preferences of drivers. In this paper, the expected number of vacant parking spaces is regarded as an important attribute to reflect the difficulty degree of finding available parking spaces, and a queueing theory-based theoretical method was proposed to estimate this expected number for candidate parking facilities with different capacities, arrival rates, and service rates. The effectiveness of the MADM-based parking guidance algorithm was investigated and compared with a blind search-based approach in comprehensive scenarios with various distributions of parking facilities, traffic intensities, and user preferences. Experimental results show that the proposed MADM-based algorithm is effective to choose suitable parking resources to satisfy users' preferences. Furthermore, it has also been observed that this newly proposed Markov Chain-based availability attribute is more effective to represent the availability of parking spaces than the arrival rate-based availability attribute proposed in existing research.

However, diverse pretreatment methods (e.g. storage, preparation and extraction) are being used for soil samples. For the uniformity of methods as well as for the comparison of results, it is important to understand if specific treatment methods can compromise original delta O-18(P) values. Here, Ag3PO4 and KH2PO4 were used to test whether a modified Hedley sequential extraction and purification procedure can alter the delta O-18(P) values of phosphate standards. Additionally, to test the effect of sample storage and drying conditions, two types of soils were first processed by using eight different pretreatment methods including sterilizing, storing, drying, and sieving and then the delta O-18(P) values of each soil P pool were measured. Results indicate that the extraction and purification procedure, drying temperature (< 0 degrees C to 80 degrees C) and sieving mesh (20 to 100) had no significant effect on the delta O-18(P) values of Pi (inorganic P) pools, but storage at room temperature (without microbial growth inhibitor-HgCl2 added) can lead to significant changes in delta O-18(P) values of almost all P pools. For the two soils studied, the delta O-18(P) decrease from H2O (H2O-Pi) to NaHCO3 (NaHCO3-Pi), NaOH (NaOH-Pi) and HCl (HCl-Pi), and organic P was also found in the extraction solution of HCl. Furthermore, the delta O-18(P) values calculated from isotope mass balance were different from the measured values suggesting variable extraction of different P pools during single and sequential extraction methods. Collectively these results highlight the need for a unified and standard processing and extraction methods for soil samples to allow meaningful intercomparison of results.

As a free-living nematode, C elegans is exposed to a variety of microorganisms, including toxic or pathogenic bacteria, in soil. C elegans can develop efficient avoidance responses to pathogenic bacteria to minimize the infection risk. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen avoidance in C elegans remains unclear. In this report, we showed that the miRNA mir-67 was involved in a behavioral avoidance response to P. aeruginosa PA14. Exposure to P. aeruginosa PA14 induced the expression of mir-67 in worms. mir-67(n4899) mutants exhibited a reduced ability to avoid P. aeruginosa PA14. By combining quantitative proteomic analysis with miRNA target prediction algorithms, we identified SAX-7/L1CAM, which is transmembrane cell adhesion receptor molecule, as the target of mir-67. Silencing of sax-7 by RNAi on mir-67 mutants rescued avoidance behavioral. Our data demonstrate that the mir-67-SAX-7 pathway modulate the behavioral avoidance response to pathogens, thus providing a new perspective in the role of miRNAs in host microbe interactions.

Here, we fabricated a hierarchical nanocomposite with metal-organic cuprous tetracyanoquinodimethane (CuTCNQ) in a 3D conductive carbon nanofibers (CNFs) network by insitu growth, and evaluated it as flexible cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). CuTCNQ in such flexible composite electrode is able to exhibit a high capacity of 252mAhg(-1) at 0.1C and highly reversible stability for 1200cycles within the voltage range of 2.5-4.1V (vs. Na+/Na). A high specific energy of 762Whkg(-1) was obtained with high average potential of 3.2V (vs. Na+/Na). The insitu-formed electroactive metal-organic composites with tailored nanoarchitecture provide a promising alternative choice for high-performance cathode materials in SIBs with high energy.

Discovering microRNAs, identifying their targets and further inferring microRNA functions in mediating plastic developmental responses to environmental changes have been a critical strategy for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. In this study, the dynamic expression patterns of microRNAs under contrasting hydrological habitats in the amphibious species Alternanthera philoxeroides were identified by time course expression profiling using high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 128 known and 18 novel microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed under contrasting hydrological habitats. The microRNA: mRNA pairs potentially associated with plastic internode elongation were identified by integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles, and were validated by qRT-PCR and 5' RLM-RACE. The results showed that both the universal microRNAs conserved across different plants and the unique microRNAs novelly identified in A. philoxeroides were involved in the responses to varied water regimes. The results also showed that most of the differentially expressed microRNAs were transiently up-/down-regulated at certain time points during the treatments. The fine-scale temporal changes in microRNA expression highlighted the importance of time-series sampling in identifying stress-responsive microRNAs and analyzing their role in stress response/tolerance.

To obtain a good description of the vector meson production experimental data at HERA, we introduce a vector meson mass dependent skewness factor into the skewness effect. Then we extend the skewness improved model to the LHC energies. The numerical results of our model are in good agreement with the J/psi and psi(2S) data in ultra-peripheral proton-proton collisions at LHC, which show the significance of the vector meson mass-dependent skewness factor. A prediction of the exclusive charmonium photo-production in ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions is performed since it can provide a good way to test the effectiveness of the color glass condensate.

The order of average concentrations of mineral elements was K>Ca>Mg>P>Na>Mn>Fe>Zn>Cu>Pb>Ni>Cr>Cd. The min and max element contents for different mineral elements were K(2439.37-36929.92 mg/Kg(-1)dw), Ca(2108.02-10130.27 mg/Kg(-1)dw), Mg(1 166.75-6996.91 mg/Kg(-1)dw), P(277.63-4091.87 mg/Kg(-1)dw), Na(53.11-1874.58 mg/Kg(-1)dw), Mn(37.64-2430.03 mg/Kg(-1)dw), Fe(33.33-1747.84 mg/Kg(-1)dw) , and Zn(22.12-178.36 mg/Kg(-1)dw), etc. Sixteen ethanol extracts had promoting effects on cell proliferation, and three of them, Humata platylepis (5, P%=36.3), Polypodisdesamoena (12, P%=32.3), and Drynaria rigidula (25, P%=36.8), had the most proliferative effects. From the research, we found that the high content of Ca and low content of Mn could result ina positive effect on proliferation of the osteoblast-like UMR-106 cell, while the low content of Ca and high content of Mn could result in an inhibitive effect on the proliferation of the osteoblast-like UMR-106 cell. The mineral element contents and biological activity of Davallioid showed a wide variability among different species.Mineral elements and biological activity in different Drynaria fortunei varied in the range and we confirmed that this was the result of different geo-environmental conditions and soil characteristics.

Kernel parameters make a great impact on the performance of the KDA model. Specifically, for KDA with the popular Gaussian kernel, to select the scale parameter is still a challenging problem. Thus, this paper introduces the KDA method and proposes a new method for Gaussian kernel parameter selection depending on the fact that the differences between reconstruction errors of edge normal samples and those of interior normal samples should be maximized for certain suitable kernel parameters. Experiments with various standard data sets of protein subcellular localization show that the overall accuracy of protein classification prediction with KDA is much higher than that without KDA. Meanwhile, the kernel parameter of KDA has a great impact on the efficiency, and the proposed method can produce an optimum parameter, which makes the new algorithm not only perform as effectively as the traditional ones, but also reduce the computational time and thus improve efficiency.

The Eu dopant acted as a crystal growth inhibitor to prevent the SnO2 nanorods growth up, resulting in tenuous SnO2 nanorods ordered arrays. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the tetragonal rutile-type structure with a systematic average size reduction and unit cell volume tumescence, while enhancing the residual strain as the Eu-doped content increases. The surface defects that were caused by the incorporation of Eu ions within the surface oxide matrix were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The results of the response properties of sensors based on the different levels of Eu-doped SnO2 layered nanoarrays demonstrated that the 0.5 at % Eu-doped SnO2 layered nanorods arrays exhibited an excellent sensing response to methanal at 278 degrees C. The reasons of the enhanced sensing performance were discussed from the complicated defect surface structure, the large specific surface area, and the excellent catalytic properties of Eu dopant.

A principal feature is that this deposit is structurally controlled by normal faults, whereas other typical deposits nearby (e.g. Maozu) are controlled by reverse faults. The origin of the Yinchanggou deposit is still controversial. Ore genetic models, based on conventional whole-rock isotope tracers, favor either sedimentary basin brine, magmatic water or metamorphic fluid sources. Here we use in situ Pb and bulk Sr isotope features of sulfide minerals to constrain the origin and evolution of hydrothermal fluids. The Pb isotope compositions of galena determined by femtosecond LA-MC-ICPMS are as follows: Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.17-18.24, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.69-15.71, Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.51-38.63. These in situ Pb isotope data overlap with bulk-chemistry Pb isotope compositions of sulfide minerals (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.11-18.40, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.66-15.76, Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.25-38.88), and both sets of data plotting above the Pb evolution curve of average upper continental crust. Such Pb isotope signatures suggest an upper crustal source of Pb. In addition, the coarse-grained galena in massive ore collected from the deep part has higher Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios (18.18-18.24) than the fine-grained galena in stockwork ore sampled from the shallow part (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.17-18.19), whereas the latter has higher Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios (38.59-38.63) than the former (Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.51-38.59). However, both types of galena have the same Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios (15.69-15.71). This implies two independent Pb sources, and the metal Pb derived from the basement metamorphic rocks was dominant during the early phase of ore formation in the deep part, whereas the ore-hosting sedimentary rocks supplied the majority of metal Pb at the late phase in the shallow part. In addition, sphalerite separated from different levels has initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.7101 to 0.7130, which are higher than the ore formation age-corrected Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of country sedimentary rocks (Sr-87/Sr-86(200 Ma) = 0.7083-0.7096), but are significantly lower than those of the ore formation age-corrected basement rocks (Sr-87/Sr-86(200 Ma) = 0.7243-0.7288). Again, such Sr isotope signatures suggest that the above two Pb sources were involved in ore formation. Hence, the gradually mixing process of mineralizing elements and associated fluids plays a key role in the precipitation of sulfide minerals at the Yinchanggou ore district. Integrating all the evidence, we interpret the Yinchanggou deposit as a strata-bound, normal fault-controlled epigenetic deposit that formed during the late Indosinian. We also propose that the massive ore is formed earlier than the stockwork ore, and the temporal-spatial variations of Pb and Sr isotopes suggest a certain potential of ore prospecting in the deep mining area.

Changes in free energy due to the movement of SBD within D3R are determined, and the molecular dynamic mechanisms of SBD transmitting along molecular channels are probed. Molecular simulated results show that the change in free energy is calculated as 171.7 kJ . mol(-1) for the transmission of SBD toward the outside of the cell along the y+ axis functional molecular channel and is 275.0 kJ.mol(-1) for movement toward the intracellular structure along the y-axis. Within the internal structure of D3R, the changes in free energy are determined to be 103.6, 242.1, 459.7, and 127.8 kJ . mol(-1) for transmission of SBD along the x+, x-, z+, and z-axes, respectively, toward the cell bilayer membrane, which indicates that SBD leaves much more easily along the x+ axis through the gap between the TM5 (the fifth transmembrane helix) and TM6 (the sixth transmembrane helix) from the internal structure of D3R. The values of free-energy changes indicate that SBD molecules can clear the protective channel within D3R, which helps dopamine molecules to leave the D3R internal structure along the x+ axis and to prevent them for exerting excessive neurotransmitter function. Therefore, our results suggest that SBD is effective for development as a drug for treating schizophrenia and its pharmacology is closely related to its dynamics and mechanisms within the molecular pathway of dopamine receptors.

J	Han, M; Li, JY; Xu, XY; Hu, JF				Han Ming; Li Jian-You; Xu Xiao-Ya; Hu Jia-Fu			Analysis for crustal anisotropy beneath the southeastern margin of Tibet by stacking azimuthal receiver functions	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						P receiver functions; Crustal anisotropy; Pms splitting; Azimuthal stacking; Southeastern Tibet	RED-RIVER FAULT; SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; UPPER-MANTLE; SPLITTING ANALYSIS; EASTERN MARGIN; CENTRAL-ASIA; PLATEAU; DEFORMATION; YUNNAN; FLOW	The continental collision between India and Eurasia in the Cenozoic has resulted in significant crustal shortening across Asia and uplifting of the Tibetan Plateau. Lithosphere that has undergone deformation may record this process in the form of fabric such as foliation and lineation from ductile deformation, as well as non-horizontal interfaces between materials with different properties within the crust or at the bottom of the crust (Moho). As a proxy for deformation, seismic anisotropy plays an important role in constraining the mode and location of the Earth's deformation. Crustal seismic anisotropy has been reported to exist in many active tectonic regions such as the southeastern margin of Tibet, where the crustal thickness almost increases to the twice from the southern Yunnan to the Songpan-Garze (SG) fold system and the northern part of the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond-shaped block (SYDSB). In general, seismic anisotropy in the Earth's upper crust is caused by stress-induced alignment of cracks, while it in the lower crust and mantle is usually attributed to strain-induced lattice-preferred orientation of the minerals in the crust and mantle. In the southeastern margin of Tibet, besides of crustal thickening, distinctly different mechanisms have been suggested to accommodate the huge convergences caused by the continental collision between India and Eurasia. Since the early 1990s, some core shear phases, such as SKS and SKKS are widely used to probe the mantle anisotropy, leading to seismic anisotropy being observed in many tectonic domains. However, the splitting could be induced by one or more anisotropic layers anywhere along the ray path between the locations of the shear waves generated and received, SKS/SKKS phases splinting have excellent lateral resolution but limited vertical resolution. Unlike the SKS/SKKS phases converted at the CMB, the Moho P-to-S phase (Pms) is converted at the crust-mantle boundary; therefore, the source region inducing anisotropy can be exactly confined within the crust. Thus, the Pms splitting provides an opportunity to isolate the anisotropy of the crust from that of the deep mantle, and also gives clues as to the deformations within the whole crust in the past and/or present. Within anisotropy crust, the arrival time of P-to-S conversion at Moho (Pms) not only depends on incident angle and crustal thickness, but also on the azimuth of seismic event. The crustal deformation beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, which is located at the southeastern margin of Tibet, is very strong. In this study, the 3-components teleseismic data, which is recorded at 108 stations located in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, is used to extract P receiver functions, and these P receiver functions with different epicentral distance are moveout corrected to a reference distance of 67. Then, in order to enhance signals-to-ratio, the P receiver functions are stacked in 10 bin along the back azimuth direction so that the observation arrival time of Pms can be picked up in the stacked trace corresponding different back-azimuth. On the solution surface composed of splitting time and fast orientation, the expected splitting parameters are located at the point which minimizes the difference between observation and theoretic arrival time of Pms. The experiments on synthetic and real waveforms confirmed that this approach is stable and significantly reduces uncertainty. We obtained 96 splitting parameters of Pms phase from 108 stations, the results indicated that the anisotropy in crust is very strong in Sichuan and Yunnan region, and the splitting time of Pms phase varies from 0.07 s +/- 0.07s to 1.27 s +/- 0. 10 s, with an average of 0. 54 12 s. The comparison between GPS vectors and fast orientations indicates that the upper crust is decoupled from lower crust beneath Indochina block, but that it is coupled on the northern SYDSB, SG fold system and Sichuan basin. However, on the southern SYGSB, the crustal deformation is primarily controlled by Xiaojiang fault and Jinshajiang-Red River fault.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			The impact of land use and land cover changes on East Asian summer monsoon precipitation using the WRF-mosaic approach	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						land use and land cover changes; precipitation; East Asia summer monsoon; circulation; moisture flux	REGIONAL CLIMATE; CHINA; SIMULATIONS; VEGETATION	Based on satellite-derived land surface data, the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes between the 1980s and 2010s on the monsoon-related circulation and precipitation over East Asia was explored using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model with the mosaic approach, which could consider subgrid-scale LULC characteristics and the corresponding changes. Simulated results using the satellite-based LULC data show that the monsoon-related precipitation and rain belt movement could be well reproduced, whereas the precipitation was generally overestimated. In terms of the general effect of LULC changes between the 1980s and 2010s, the precipitation decreased in the north and increased in the south. Significant subregional characteristics are apparent in China, especially with respect to East Asian summer monsoon (EASM)-related precipitation. The increased roughness induced weakened near-surface wind speeds in the southern part of the EASM region, while the decreased roughness resulted in intensified values in the northern part. Meanwhile, the impacted EASM-related circulation and moisture flux, which could be well explained by the LULC changes induced, influenced the pressure gradient and temperature gradient at low to middle latitudes, resulting in a weakened moisture flux from the southwest and the southeast, whereas it intensified from the South China Sea and at middle to high latitudes. In general, with weakened moisture flux at low to high latitudes, the EASM-related rain belt's northward movement was restrained. Although the enhanced westerly currents contributed to the increased moisture flux at middle to high latitudes, the precipitation there decreased due to the stronger weakened northward moisture flux.

(PE) is widely consumed as a functional food and used as a folk medicine due to its remarkable nutritional and pharmacological effects. Mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (cDDP) are the most widely used forms of chemotherapeutic drug, but their clinical use is limited by their genotoxicity to normal cells. We aimed to determine whether PE has potential to reduce the genotoxicity, while improving the anticancer effect, of MMC and cDDP. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion assay and colony-forming assay. Genomic instability (GIN) was measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Co-treatment (72 h) with PE at 20-320 mu g/ml significantly enhanced the efficacy of MMC (0.05 mu g/ml) and cDDP (1 mu g/ml) against Colo205 colorectal cancer cells (P < 0.05), and at 80-320 mu g/ml significantly decreased MMCand cDDP-induced GIN and multinucleation in normal colonic NCM460 cells (P < 0.05). PE significantly decreased the mitotic index (P < 0.01), blocked mitotic progression (P < 0.05), and promoted apoptosis (P < 0.01) in MMC- and cDDP-treated NCM460 cells, suggesting that PE-mediated inhibition of mitosis and induction of apoptosis may limit the division and survival of highly damaged cells. Also, PE was found to inhibit the clonal expansion of MMC- and cDDP-treated NCM460 cells (P < 0.05) and decrease the heterogeneity of the surviving clones. PE potentiates the anticancer efficacy of MMC and cDDP, while preventing their genotoxicity and inhibiting clonal expansions of unstable genomes in normal cells. These data suggest that PE has the potential to reduce the risk of secondary cancers induced by chemotherapeutics.

Traditional resource service models focus on modeling the attributes, interfaces, and descriptions of the resources into resource information services. Such resource services are suitable for local environment but suffer semantic heterogeneities in open cloud environment. Recently, well-designed ontologies are applied in resource service models to unify the schema and eliminate the semantic heterogeneities among the services. However, the effectiveness of ontology-based models mainly depends on the expertise of the ontology experts in ontology designing. Moreover, it is difficult to catch the dynamic changes in the cloud once the ontology has been embedded. In this paper, a semantic model is presented for information resource service modeling that uses semantic links instead of ontologies. The model takes advantage of semantic links to enable automated integrating and distributed updating in resource service cloud. In the experiment, the model is applied on practical manufacturing resources from a wheel manufacturing company. The case study and experimental results show that the proposed model is suitable for modeling manufacturing resources into cloud services and enables the flexible and distributed manipulation on resource services in the cloud environment.

As the first line of defense against microbial pathogens, the innate immune system is crucial in tree shrews. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is important in the pathophysiology of infection, inflammation and cancer, where it promotes disease development or sustains immune reactions. The present study aimed to obtain further insight into the tree shrew IL-6 (tsIL-6) system, and the function of tsIL-6 in the antiviral and antibacterial response. In the present study, the mRNA and genomic sequence of the tsIL-6 gene were characterized, and the tissue distribution and expression profile of this gene were analyzed in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment. The full-length tsIL-6 mRNA consisted of 1,152 bp with an open reading frame of 627 bp encoding 208 amino acids, a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 62 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 436 bp. The genome sequence of the tsIL-6 gene was 5,265 bp in length, comprising of five exons and four introns. The predicted tsIL-6 protein contained a 25-amino-acid-long signal peptide and a conserved IL-6 domain. Phylogenetic analysis based on the coding sequences revealed that tsIL-6 was closely related to IL-6 in humans. Residues crucial for receptor binding were completely conserved in the tree shrew protein. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that tsIL-6 mRNA was expressed in all examined tissues of healthy tree shrews, with high levels in the muscle and spleen. Following poly I:C challenge, the expression levels of tsIL-6 were upregulated in four tissues associated with immune system, the liver, spleen, kidney and intestine. Taken together, the molecular and bioinformatics analyses based on the IL-6 sequence revealed that the tree shrew has a close phylogenetic association with humans. These results provide insight for future investigations on the structure and function of tsIL-6.

TOC and TN presented similar variation trends, suggesting the same and stable sources of organic matter; the bad correlation between the grain size and TOC content indicated that the organic matter occurrence was neither controlled by the grain size nor the surface absorption of the fine particles, but it may has something to do with the complicated sedimentary hydrodynamic force, the input of organic matter and microbial action. Judging on the basis of C/N ratio and delta C-13(TOC), the organic carbon in sediments was a mixture of terrigenous and marine organic carbon, testifying to the land-sea interaction characteristic of the study area. The indexes experienced abrupt changes at about 6.5 ka BP, when the lighter terrigenous organic carbon made an increased proportion to the heavier marine organic carbon. The phenomenon reflected the enclosure of the lagoon and the reduced exchange interactions with the seawater of open seas.

The propagation expression for the cross-spectral density of the partially coherent EHGB and SHGB propagating in a uniaxial crystal is derived. With the help of the derived formula, some analyses are illustrated by numerical examples related to the evolution properties of the spectral density, the spectral degree of coherence, and the effective beam width of the partially coherent EHGB and SHGB in a uniaxial crystal. It is shown that propagation properties of the partially coherent EHGB and SHGB in an isotropic crystal are much different from the evolution properties in an anisotropic crystal. The evolution behavior of spectral density and the spectral degree of coherence depends on the parameters of the uniaxial crystals (the ratio of extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices), and beam parameters including the coherence length and the beam order, as well as the propagation distance.

SynT cells are differentiated from trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) during early embryogenesis. Mouse TSCs can spontaneously differentiate into cells of mixed lineages in vitro upon withdrawal of stemness-maintaining factors. However, differentiation into defined placental cell lineages remains challenging. We report here that canonical Wnt signaling activation robustly induces expression of SynT-II lineage-specific genes Gcm1 and SynB and suppresses markers of other placental lineages. In contrast to mouse TSCs, the induced SynT-II cells are migratory. More importantly, the migration depends on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the c-MET signaling axis. Furthermore, HGF-expressing cells lie adjacent to SynT-II cells in developing murine placenta, suggesting that HGF/c-MET signaling plays a critical role in SynT-II cell morphogenesis during the labyrinth branching process. The availability of SynT-II cells in vitro will facilitate molecular understanding of labyrinth layer development.

Drought prediction and sustainable development of the ecological environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Drought prediction; Ecological environment; Sustainable development		In the 1990s ecological early warning research began with the aim of elucidating the effect of drought in dry regions of the world. Drought has been a prevalent natural disaster, ravaging the Yun'nan province of China for over 5 years since 2009. Due to the extensive range, depth and devastating losses, the drought has reached a once-in-a-century severity. Yun'nan province suffered particularly badly from the drought, which took its toll on both the ecological environment and the sustainable economic development of the province. We chose to study Pu'er city in Yun'nun province for this research, and analysed the drought traits of Pu'er city utilizing geographic information technology. We applied the Mann-Kendall test for trend, linear tendency estimation and percentage of precipitation anomalies, as well as using combinations of monthly data searches of meteorological reports from 1980-2010. The results showed that except for a small rise in spring precipitation, the overall rainfall of Pu'er city showed a decreasing trend. The results of this study can provide an adequate and reliable theoretical basis and technological methods for use in government decision making, and promote research into early warning ecology.

When multiple-subject multivariate time series data are available, dynamic factor analysis models with random effects offer one way of modeling patterns of within- and between-person variations by combining factor analysis and time series analysis at the factor level. Using the Dirichlet process (DP) as a nonparametric prior for individual-specific time series parameters further allows the distributional forms of these parameters to deviate from commonly imposed (e.g., normal or other symmetric) functional forms, arising as a result of these parameters' restricted ranges. Given the complexity of such models, a thorough sensitivity analysis is critical but computationally prohibitive. We propose a Bayesian local influence method that allows for simultaneous sensitivity analysis of multiple modeling components within a single fitting of the model of choice. Five illustrations and an empirical example are provided to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in facilitating the detection of outlying cases and common sources of misspecification in dynamic factor analysis models, as well as identification of modeling components that are sensitive to changes in the DP prior specification.

Role of Wall Shear Stress in Cryptosporidium parvum Oocyst Attachment to Environmental Biofilms	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Cryptosporidium; attachment; biofilms; bioreactors; shear; waterborne pathogens	PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; MASS-TRANSFER; FLOW; WATER; TEMPERATURE; ADHESION; DETACHMENT; DEPOSITION; VELOCITY; GROWTH	This study investigated Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst deposition onto biofilms as a function of shear stress under laminar or turbulent flow. Annular rotating bioreactors were used to grow stabilized stream biofilms at shear stresses ranging from 0.038 to 0.46 Pa. These steady-state biofilms were then used to assess the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on C. parvum oocyst attachment. C. parvum deposition onto biofilms followed a pseudo-second-order model under both laminar (after a lag phase) and turbulent flows. The total number of oocysts attached to the biofilm at steady state decreased as the hydrodynamic wall shear stress increased. The oocyst deposition rate constant increased with shear stress but decreased at high shear, suggesting that increasing wall shear stress results in faster attachment of Cryptosporidium due to higher mass transport until the shear forces exceed a critical limit that prevents oocyst attachment. These data show that oocyst attachment in the short and long term are impacted differently by shear: higher shear (to a certain limit) may be associated with faster initial oocyst attachment, but lower shear is associated with greater numbers of oocysts attached at equilibrium. IMPORTANCE This research provides experimental evidence to demonstrate that shear stress plays a critical role in protozoan-pathogen transport and deposition in environmental waters. The data presented in this work expand scientific understanding of Cryptosporidium attachment and fate, which will further influence the development of timely and accurate sampling strategies, as well as advanced water treatment technologies, to target protozoan pathogens in surface waters that serve as municipal drinking water sources.

Herein, we explore the evolution of the Serama, the smallest breed of chicken. Leveraging comparative population genomics, analyses identify several genes that are potentially associated with the growth and development of bones and muscles. These genes, and in particular both POU1F1 and IGF1, are under strong positive selection. Three allopatric dwarf bantams (Serama, Yuanbao, and Daweishan) with different breeding-histories, form distinct clusters and exhibit unique population structures. Parallel genetic mechanisms underlay their variation in body size. These findings provide insights into the multiple and complex pathways, depending on genomic variation, that chicken can take in response to aviculture selection for dwarfism.

The origin and genetic mechanism underlying domestication of the laboratory rat remain largely elusive. In the present study, large scale genomes supported a single origin for the laboratory rat, possibly from a sister group to wild rats from Europe/Africa/Middle East. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses uncovered many artificially selected genes (e.g., FOXP2, B3GATT, and CLOCK) involved in the nervous system. These genes associate with learning ability and regulation of circadian rhythm, which likely enabled the successful domestication of the laboratory rat. Particularly, many genes, including mitochondrial genes responsible for energy metabolism, displayed a substantially increased expression in the brain of laboratory rats compared with wild rats. Our findings demystify the origin and evolution of this model animal, and provide insight into the process of its domestication.

We isolate a previously unrecognized dust structure likely to be associated with SNR S147. The structure, which we term as 'S147 dust cloud', is estimated to have a distance d = 1.22 +/- 0.21 kpc, consistent with the conjecture that S147 is associated with pulsar PSR J0538 + 2817. The cloud includes several dense clumps of relatively high extinction that locate on the radio shell of S147 and coincide spatially with the CO and gamma-ray emission features. We conclude that the usage of CO measurements to trace the SNR associated MCs is unavoidably limited by the detection threshold, dust depletion and the difficulty of distance estimates in the outer Galaxy. 3D dust extinction mapping may provide a better way to identify and study SNR-MC interactions.

The resulting metal complexes exhibit more negative energy levels (vs vacuum) as compared to 2,2', 7,7'-tetrakis(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), high hole extraction efficiency, but low hole mobilities and conductivities. Application of dopants typically used for Spiro-OMeTAD was not successful, indicating a more complicated mechanism of partial oxidation besides the redox potential. However, utilization as hole-transport material was successful, giving a highest efficiency of 11.1% under AM 1.5G solar illumination.

Generally, nitrogen-dopedanatase/brookite mixed phases TiO2 nanoparticles obtained by hydrothermal or solvothermal method need to be at high temperature and with long time heating treatment. Furthermore, the surface areas of them are low (<125 m(2)/g). There is hardly a report on the simple and direct preparation of N-doped anatase/brookite mixed phase TiO2 nanostructures using sol-gel method at low heating temperature. In this paper, the nitrogen-doped anatase/brookite biphasic nanoparticles with large surface area (240 m(2)/g) were successfully prepared using sol-gel method at low temperature (165 degrees C), and with short heating time (4 h) under autogenous pressure. The obtained sample without subsequent annealing at elevated temperatures showed enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) with 4.2-, 9.6-, and 7.5-fold visible light activities compared to P25 and the amorphous samples heated in muffle furnace with air or in tube furnace with a flow of nitrogen at 165 degrees C, respectively. This result was attributed to the synergistic effects of nitrogen doping, mixed crystalline phases, and high surface area.

Hence, it is drawing more and more attentions and variants of Auto Encoders have been reported including Contractive Auto-Encoders, Denoising Auto-Encoders, Sparse Auto Encoders and Nonnegativity Constraints Auto-Encoders. Recently, a Discriminative Auto-Encoders is reported to improve the performance by considering the within class and between class information. In this paper, we propose the Large Margin Auto-Encoders (LMAE) to further boost the discriminability by enforcing different class samples to be large marginally distributed in hidden feature space. Particularly, we stack the single-layer LMAE to construct a deep neural network to learn proper features. And finally we put these features into a softmax classifier for classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset for classification respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMAE outperforms the traditional Auto-Encoders algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of the minimum-cost spanning K-tree problem is to choose a subset of edges to form a spanning K-tree with the minimum weight. In this paper, we consider the constructing spanning K-tree problem that is a generalization of the minimum-cost spanning K-tree problem. We are required to construct a spanning K-tree T-K whose n + K edges are assembled from some stock pieces of bounded length L. Let c(0) be the sale price of each stock piece of length L and k(T-K) the number of minimum stock pieces to construct the n + K edges in T-K. For each edge e in G, let c(e) be the construction cost of that edge e. Our new objective is to minimize the total cost of constructing a spanning K-tree T-K, i.e., min(TK) {Sigma(e is an element of TK) c(e) + k(T-K) . c(0)}. The main results obtained in this paper are as follows. (1) A 2-approximation algorithm to solve the constructing spanning K-tree problem. (2) A 3/2-approximation algorithm to solve the special case for constant construction cost of edges. (3) An APTAS for this special case.

WAT reportedly plays a key, beneficial role in the maintenance of glucose and lipid homeostasis during de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Pu'erh tea extract (PTE) can inhibit harmful, ectopic DNL in the liver, thus protecting against hepatosteatosis, in mice with diet-induced obesity. We examined whether PTE could induce DNL in WAT and consequently protect against hepatosteatosis. C57BL/6 male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with/without PTE for 16 weeks. Systemic insulin sensitivity was determined using HOMA-IR, insulin- and glucose-tolerance tests, and WAT adipogenesis was evaluated by histological analysis. Adipogenesis-, inflammation-, and DNL-related gene expression in visceral AT (VAT) and subcutaneous AT (SAT) was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Regression analysis was used to investigate the association between DNL in WAT and systemic insulin resistance or hepatosteatosis. Pu'erh tea extract significantly reduced the gain of body weight and SAT, but not VAT adiposity, in mice fed the high-fat diet and induced adipogenesis in VAT. The expression of DNL-related genes, including Glut4, encoding an important insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4), were highly elevated in VAT. Moreover, PTE inhibited VAT inflammation by simultaneously downregulating inflammatory molecules and inducing expression of Gpr120 that encodes an anti-inflammatory and pro-adipogenesis receptor (GPR-120) that recognizes unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, including DNL products. The expression of DNL-related genes in VAT was inversely correlated with hepatosteatosis and systemic insulin resistance. Activation of DNL in VAT may explain PTE-mediated alleviation of hepatosteatosis symptoms and systemic insulin resistance.

J	Tang, NS; Li, DW; Tang, AM				Tang, Nian-Sheng; Li, De-Wang; Tang, An-Min			Semiparametric Bayesian inference on generalized linear measurement error models	STATISTICAL PAPERS			English	Article						Cook's distance; Dirichlet process prior; Generalized linear models; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Measurement error models	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS	The classical assumption in generalized linear measurement error models (GLMEMs) is that measurement errors (MEs) for covariates are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as the multivariate normal distribution. This paper uses a centered Dirichlet process mixture model to relax the fully parametric distributional assumption of MEs, and develops a semiparametric Bayesian approach to simultaneously obtain Bayesian estimations of parameters and covariates subject to MEs by combining the stick-breaking prior and the Gibbs sampler together with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Two Bayesian case-deletion diagnostics are proposed to identify influential observations in GLMEMs via the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Cook's distance. Computationally feasible formulae for evaluating Bayesian case-deletion diagnostics are presented. Several simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate our proposed methodologies.

An iterative algorithm for identifying strong H-tensors was given in Li et al. (J Comput Appl Math 255:1-14, 2014), where the method does not stop in finite iterative steps when the tensor is not a strong H-tensor. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we present a new algorithm which always terminates after finite iterative steps and needs fewer iterations than the earlier one for a general tensor. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, it is an NP-hard problem and solutions obtained by existing heuristic algorithms have a significant gap up to the optimal solutions. Motivated by this fact, we propose three swarm optimization algorithms: discrete artificial bee colony, discrete artificial fish swarm, and discrete shuffled frog leaping. In addition, we investigate how to utilize the impact of search behavior to improve the performance of the algorithm, and we design the self-adaptive parameter settings to balance between the exploitation and exploration of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to generate a good initial solution. Compared with some algorithms from the literature, the simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can maximize the global dominant share fairly and increase the resource utilization, and they are highly adaptable to different situations.

However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms have not previously been identified. The proliferation of A549 was assessed by MTT assay. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was assessed in A549 with a H(2)DCFDA probe. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the JC-1 staining. Apoptosis were measured by annexin-V/PI assay and autophagy by acridine orange staining and GFP-LC3 fluorescence assay. The expression of autophagic and apoptotic proteins was determined by Western blot. The compound HC6h increased accumulation of vesicles, acridine orange-stained cells and LC3-II in A549 cells. Inhibition of compound HC6h-induced autophagy by bafilomycin A1 increased apoptosis. Compound HC6h enhanced activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP cleavage in A549 cells. Compound HC6h leads to the rapid generation of intracellular ROS. Moreover, compound HC6h induced phosphorylation of JNK and was conferred by the increased ROS levels. Furthermore, down-regulation of JNK attenuated autophagic and apoptotic effect in response to HC6h. The induction of ROS upon HC6h treatment leads to the activation of JNK that mediates autophagy and apoptosis in human A549 cancer cells. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 4394-4403, 2017.

The spatially radiative properties of 3C 58 and G21.5-0.9 are modelled in the frame of a spatially dependent model. Combining with the dynamical evolution of each PWN, the time evolution of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the radial variations of the photon indices of 3C 58 and G21.5-0.9 are calculated. Our modelling results show that observed multiband SEDs and the radial variations of the photon indices in X-ray band of these two PWNe can be reproduced well. From the modelling results, the values for the present-day diffusion coefficient and magnetic field are derived, including the values at the termination shock and the spatial average. The spatial changes of the present-day photon indices at different bands are predicted and our results show that the photon indices obviously vary with radial distance in almost all of energy range except that in radio and GeV gamma-ray bands.

However, designing and simulating new NPR artistic styles remains extremely challenging. Chalk art style is a very famous artistic work all over the world, and few algorithms have been put forward to illustrate this style. This paper presents a novel NPR technique which generates a chalk art drawing from a 2D photograph automatically. We aim at obtaining a set of lines surface with coarse appearance and generating stroke textures of the real chalk painting. Firstly, the edge of the source image is extracted by difference-of-Gaussian filter method. To simulate chalk painting's lines, image diffusion and enhancement techniques are proposed to produce coarse and rough lines. Secondly, we developed an improved line integral convolution and dilation operation methods to produce the chalk stroke texture. Finally, the edge image, stroke texture image and color image will be mapped to another background image to generate the chalk art drawing. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method in producing the color chalk stylistic illustrations, and the methods can simulate the characters of the real chalk art painting. The proposed method of this paper will enlarge the research and application fields of NPR. Meanwhile, it provides a tool for the user to create chalk art paintings via computers even without painting skill.

The molecular mechanisms of bacterial blight resistance in O. officinalis have not yet been elucidated. The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant growth, development and stress response. However, little is known about the numbers, structure, molecular phylogenetics, and expression of the WRKY genes under Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) stress in O. officinalis due to lacking of O. officinalis genome. Therefore, based on the RNA-sequencing data of O. officinalis, we performed a comprehensive study of WRKY genes in O. officinalis and identified 89 OoWRKY genes. Then 89 OoWRKY genes were classified into three groups based on the WRKY domains and zinc finger motifs. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that the evolution of OoWRKY genes were consistent with previous studies of WRKYs, and subgroup IIc OoWRKY genes were the original ancestors of some group II and group III OoWRKYs. Among the 89 OoWRKY genes, eight OoWRKYs displayed significantly different expression (>2-fold, p<0.01) in the O. officinalis transcriptome under Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress 48 h, suggesting these genes might play important role in PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O. officinalis. QRT-PCR analysis and confirmation of eight OoWRKYs expression patterns revealed that they responded strongly to PXO99 and C5 stress 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the trends of these genes displaying marked changes were consistent with the 48 h RNA-sequencing data, demonstrated these genes played important roles in response to biotic stress and might even involved in the bacterial blight resistance. Tissue expression profiles of eight OoWRKY genes revealed that they were highly expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower, especially in leaf (except OoWRKY71), suggesting these genes might be also important for plant growth and organ development. In this study, we analyzed the WRKY family of transcription factors in O. officinalis. Insight was gained into the classification, evolution, and function of the OoWRKY genes, revealing the putative roles of eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs in Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O. officinalis.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of chilling tolerance (CT) in O. longistaminata should thus provide a basis for rice CT improvement through molecular breeding. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to profile global transcriptome alterations and crucial genes involved in response to long-term low temperature in O. longistaminata shoots and rhizomes subjected to 7 days of chilling stress. A total of 605 and 403 genes were respectively identified as up-and down-regulated in O. longistaminata under 7 days of chilling stress, with 354 and 371 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found exclusively in shoots and rhizomes, respectively. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways were enriched in commonly induced genes in both tissues; in contrast, only the photosynthesis pathway was prevalent in genes uniquely induced in shoots, whereas several key metabolic pathways and the programmed cell death process were enriched in genes induced only in rhizomes. Further analysis of these tissue-specific DEGs showed that the CBF/DREB1 regulon and other transcription factors (TFs), including AP2/EREBPs, MYBs, and WRKYs, were synergistically involved in transcriptional regulation of chilling stress response in shoots. Different sets of TFs, such as OsERF922, OsNAC9, OsWRKY25, and WRKY74, and eight genes encoding antioxidant enzymes were exclusively activated in rhizomes under long-term low-temperature treatment. Furthermore, several cis-regulatory elements, including the ICE1-binding site, the GATA element for phytochrome regulation, and the W-box for WRKY binding, were highly abundant in both tissues, confirming the involvement of multiple regulatory genes and complex networks in the transcriptional regulation of CT in O. longistaminata. Finally, most chilling-induced genes with alternative splicing exclusive to shoots were associated with photosynthesis and regulation of gene expression, while those enriched in rhizomes were primarily related to stress signal transduction; this indicates that tissue-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms synergistically contribute to O. longistaminata long-term CT. Our findings provide an overview of the complex regulatory networks of CT in O. longistaminata.

We find that tofu wastewater is a good source of raw material in making fluorescent CQDs. The corresponding CQDs can be fabricated simply via hydrothermal reaction to carbonize the organic matter in the yellow serofluid of tofu wastewater. Two sorts of CQDs can be obtained within the deionized water and NaOH solution, respectively, where the CQDs in water (NaOH solution) can emit blue (green) light under the UV irradiation. It is found from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that the basic difference between these two sorts of CQDs is the contents of C-O and C=O bonds on the surface of the CQDs. This difference can cause different features of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CQDs. On the basis of the obtained results from the XPS and PL measurements, we propose a mechanism in understanding and explaining the photon-induced light emission from CQDs. This study is relevant to the fabrication and application of fluorescent CQDs as, e.g., light display materials.

In orchids, prezygotic reproductive isolation has been considered to be strong, because their associations with highly specific pollinators. In this study, the reproductive ecology and reproductive isolation of two sympatric Habenaria species, H. davidii and H. fordii, was investigated by floral phenology and morphology, hand-pollination experiments and visitor observation in southwest China. The two species were dependent on insects for pollination and completely self-compatible. A number of factors have been identified to limit gene flow between the two species and achieved full reproductive isolation. Ecogeographic isolation was a weak barrier. H. fordii and H. davidii had completely overlapped flowering periods, and floral morphology plays an important role in floral isolation. The two species shared the same hawkmoth pollinator, Cechenena lineosa, but the pollinaria of the two orchids were attached on different body parts of pollinators. Prezygotic isolation was not complete, but the interspecific pollination treatments of each species resulted in no seed sets, indicating that unlike many other orchid species, in which the postzygotic reproductive isolation is very weak or complete absence, the post-zygotic isolation strongly acted in the stage of seed production between two species. The results illustrate the reproductive isolation between two species involves multiple plant life-history stages and a variety of reproductive barriers can contribute to overall isolation.

To explore the role of a group III histidine kinase (AlHK1) on A. longipes pathogenesis, the invasion progress of A. longipes was monitored. We found that the wild-type strain C-00 invaded faster than the AlHK1disrupted strain HK Delta 4 in the early and middle infection stages and the reverse trend occurred in the late infection stage. Then, eight invasion transcriptomes were performed using RNA-Seq and 205 shared, 505 C-00 and 222 HK.4 specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The annotation results showed seven antioxidant activity genes were specifically identified in the HK.4 DEGs. A subsequent experiment confirmed that HK.4 was more resistant to low concentrations oxidative stress than C-00. In addition, the results from 1) statistics for the number of DEGs, GO enriched terms, DEGs in clusters with rising trends, and 2) analyses of the expression patterns of some DEGs relevant for osmoadaptation and virulence showed that changes in C-00 infection existed mainly in the early and middle stages, while HK.4 infection arose mainly in the late stage. Our results reveal firstly the pathogenesis of A. longipes regulated by AlHK1 and provide useful insights into the fungal-plant interactions.

MnO2 amounts is estimated to be 24.7 wt% in CS@MnO2 nanocomposites. A high dielectric loss value and an electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of 16-23 dB were observed for the CS@MnO2 in the frequency range of 8-18 GHz, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced absorption loss. The incorporation of the CS with MnO2 improves the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the electromagnetic impendence matching has been significantly ameliorated. Moreover, the increasing interfaces between the CS and MnO2 facilitate the microwave attenuation as well. Thus, the electromagnetic shielding performances were greatly enhanced. Our findings provide an effective methodology for the synthesis of the CS@MnO2 core-shell nanocomposite for potential electromagnetic applications.

In this study, 55 BrrCDPK genes, which were phylogenetically clustered into four subfamilies, were identified. Chromosome locations indicated that the CDPK family in turnip expanded by segmental duplication and genome rearrangement. Moreover, gene expression profiles showed that different BrrCDPKs were expressed in specific tissues or stages. Transcript levels of BrrCDPKs indicated that they were involved in abiotic and biotic stresses and that paralogs exhibited functional divergence. Additionally, we identified 15 Rboh genes in turnip; the results of yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that BrrRbohD1 interacted only with BrrCDPK10 and that BrrRbohD2 interacted with BrrCDPK4/7/9/10/17/22/23. Most of the genes play an important role in pst DC3000 defense by regulating the accumulation of H2O2 and stomatal closure. Our study may provide an important foundation for future functional analysis of BrrCDPKs and reveal further biological roles.

The results showed the followings. 1) The decomposition rate of cellulose and semi-cellulose were close to maximal level at day 40.2) At the phylum level, the most dominant bacteria and archaea were Firmicutes and Euryarchaeota respectively. 3) Most dominant species maintained predominant positions even though the microbial community structure changed throughout the fermentation; in particular, the abundance of dominant bacteria increased when the biogas fermentation peak appeared. 4) The four most dominant bacterial species were involved in hydrolysis of cellulose and semi-cellulose. 5) The metabolic pathway and microbial composition in hydrolysis and acidogenesis are very similar, but those in acetogenesis and methanogenesis are different to some extent. The acetogenesis pathway almost disappeared between days 24 and 72.6) Even though the overall microbial communities consisted of >400 species, the key bacteria and archaea for hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis comprised 13-15 species, and most of these species had high similarity (>= 97%) to culturable strains.

A series of sensitivity model simulations were conducted to investigate the influences of these parameters on radiation balance, meteorological variables, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), as well as planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in regions around Beijing in summer 2014. Model validation demonstrated that the updated parameters represented urban surface characteristics more realistically and the simulations of meteorological variables were evidently improved to be closer to observations than the default parameters. The increase in building height tended to increase and slightly decrease surface air temperature at 2 m (T2) at night and around noon, respectively, and to reduce wind speed at 10 m (WS10) through a day. The increase in road width led to significant decreases in T2 and WS10 through the whole day, with the maximum changes in early morning and in evening, respectively. Both lower surface albedo and inclusion of anthropogenic heat (AH) resulted in increases in T2 and WS10 over the day, with stronger influence from AH. The vertical extension of the impact of urban surface parameters was mainly confined within 300 m at night and reached as high as 1600 m during daytime. The increase in building height tended to increase TKE and PBLH and the TKE increase was larger at night than during daytime due to enhancements of both mechanical and buoyant productions. The increase in road width generally reduced TKE and PBLH except for a few hours in the afternoon. The lower surface albedo and the presence of AH consistently resulted in increases of TKE and PBLH through both day and night. The increase in building height induced a slight divergence by day and a notable convergence at night, whereas the increase in road width led to a remarkable divergence through the entire day. Both AH and lower surface albedo induced a wind convergence over the day, which tended to strengthen nighttime mountain downslope wind and daytime southerly wind to the south of Beijing, but to weaken daytime upslope wind in mountain areas.

By establishing some comparison theorems of dynamic equations with impulses and delays on time scales, a permanence result for the model is obtained. Furthermore, based on the permanence result, by studying the Lyapunov stability theory of impulsive dynamic equations on time scales, we establish the existence and uniformly asymptotic stability of a unique positive almost periodic solution of the system. Finally, we give an example to show the feasibility of our main results, and our example also shows that the continuous time system and its corresponding discrete time system have the same dynamics. Our results of this paper are completely new even if for both the case of the time scale T=R and the case of the time scale T=Z. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Most of these processes require initiators, transition metal catalysts, or organometallic reagents. Herein, we report the discovery of a simple organic system (2-azaallyl anions) that enables radical coupling reactions under transition-metal-free conditions. Deprotonation of N-benzyl ketimines generates semistabilized 2-azaallyl anions that behave as "super-electron-donors" (SEDs) and reduce aryl iodides and alkyl halides to aryl and alkyl radicals. The SET process converts the 2-azaallyl anions into persistent 2-azaallyl radicals, which capture the aryl and alkyl radicals to form C-C bonds. The radical coupling of aryl and alkyl radicals with 2-azaallyl radicals makes possible the synthesis of functionalized amine derivatives without the use of exogenous radical initiators or transition metal catalysts. Radical clock studies and 2-azaallyl anion coupling studies provide mechanistic insight for this unique reactivity.

To obtain insights into the mechanism of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, we analyzed the transcriptome of ZIKV infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) for changes in alternative splicing (AS), gene isoform (ISO) composition and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression. Methods: We analyzed differentially expressed lncRNAs, AS, ISO from RNA-seq data in ZIKV infected hNPCs. Results: We obtained 149 differentially expressed lncRNAs, including potential viral targets to modulate cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and immune response. The infection induced 262 cases of AS occurring in 229 genes, which were enriched in cell death, RNA processing, transport, and neuron development. Among 691 differentially expressed ISOs, upregulated ISOs were enriched in signaling, regulation of transcription, and amino acid biosynthesis, while downregulated ISOs were mostly enriched in cell cycle. Importantly, these analyses revealed specific links between ZIKV induced changes in cellular pathways and the type of changes in the host transcriptome, suggesting important regulatory mechanisms. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed candidate lncRNAs, AS events and ISOs which may function in ZIKV infection induced cell cycle disruption, apoptosis and attenuation of neurogenesis, and shed light on the roles of lncRNAs, AS and ISOs in virus-host interactions, and would facilitate future studies of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.

However, to what extent chemokines influence human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is not yet completely understood. In this study, we applied protein array to screen chemokines found within the cytokine pool in the culture supernatant of hPSCs. Our results showed that chemokines were the predominant supernatant components, and came from three sources: hPSCs, feeder cells, and culture media. Chemotaxis analysis of IL-8, SDF-1 alpha, and IP-10 suggested that chemokines function as uniform chemoattractants to mediate in vitro migration of the hPSCs. Chemokines mediate both differentiated and undifferentiated states of hPSCs. However, balanced chemokine signaling tends to enhance their stemness in vitro. These results indicate that chemokines secreted from both stem cells and feeder cells are essential to mobilize hPSCs and maintain their stemness.

Folate deficiency (FD) has been shown to induce chromosomal instability (CIN), yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used human NCM460 colon mucosal cells as a model to investigate the effect of FD on spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a cell-cycle regulatory pathway preventing CIN during mitosis. Cells were maintained in medium containing 1.36 (FD) and 2260 nM (control, FC) folate for 21 days. CIN was measured by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay; mitotic infidelity was determined by aberrant mitosis analysis; SAC activity was assessed by nocodazole-challenge assay, and the expression of core SAC genes was examined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that, relative to FC, FD significantly induced CIN in a time-dependent way (P < 0.01). Mitotic cells cultured in FD medium had significant higher frequencies of misalignment, misegregation and spindle multipolarity than those cultured in FC medium (P < 0.01). FD-induced SAC impairment and overriding, resulting premature mitotic exit and cell multinucleation (P < 0.05). Moreover, FD deregulated the expression of several key SAC genes (P < 0.01). Overall, these data are the first to demonstrate that FD substantially compromises SAC network which predisposes cells to mitotic aberrations and CIN. These results establish a new link between folate metabolism and SAC signalling, two pathways that are highly relevant for tumorigenesis.

Fossil leaves sporadically found in latest Carboniferous and Permian floras have putatively been ascribed to cycads. However, their true affinity remains unclear due to the lack of anatomical evidence. Virtually all modern cycads have pinnate leaves, but this type of leaf morphology is by no means unique for cycads. Pinnate leaves of Plagiozamites oblongifolius Halle 1927 with well-preserved cuticles showing the epidermal anatomy are here described from the upper Permian Xuanwei Formation of Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The cuticles show a clear differentiation into costal and intercostal zones; stomata are confined to the intercostal zones on both the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The external morphology and the epidermal anatomy of these fossil leaves are closely comparable with those of extant cycads, particularly members of the family Zamiaceae.

HH 111, with a spectacular collimated optical jet, is one of the most well-known Herbig-Haro objects. We report the detection of a new source, NH3-S, in the vicinity of HH 111/HH 121 (similar to 0.03 pc from the HH 111 jet source) in two epochs of the ammonia observations. This constitutes the first detection of this source, in a region that has been thoroughly covered previously by both continuum and spectral line interferometric observations. We study the kinematic and physical properties of HH 111 and the newly discovered NH3-S. We also use HCO+ and HCN (J = 4-3) data obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (CO)-C-13, (CO)-C-12, and (CO)-O-18 (J = 2-1), N2D+ (J = 3-2), and (CS)-C-13 (J = 5-4) data to gain insight into the nature of NH3-S. The chemical structure of NH3-S shows evidence for "selective freeze-out," an inherent characteristic of dense cold cores. The inner part of NH3-S shows subsonic nonthermal velocity dispersions indicating a "coherent core," while they increase in the direction of the jets. Archival near-to far-infrared data show no indication of any embedded source in NH3-S. The properties of NH3-S and its location in the infrared dark cloud suggest that it is a starless core located in a turbulent medium, with the turbulence induced by Herbig-Haro jets and associated outflows. More data are needed to fully understand the physical and chemical properties of NH3-S and if/how its evolution is affected by nearby jets.

This QPO signal is highly statistically significant at the similar to 5 sigma confidence level, with a quality factor of Q = f / Delta f > 13.6. The X-ray intensity changed by a factor of 3, with a root mean square fractional variability of 14.3%. Furthermore, this QPO signal is present in the data of all three EPIC detectors and two RGS cameras and its frequency follows the f(QPO)-M-BH relation spanning from stellar-mass to supermassive black holes. Interestingly, a possible QPO signal with a period of similar to 4200 s had been reported in the literature. The frequency ratio of these two QPO signals is similar to 3:2. Our result is also in support of the hypothesis that the QPO signals can just be transient. The spectral analysis reveals that the contribution of the soft excess component below similar to 1 keV is different between epochs with and without QPO. This property, as well as the former frequency ratio, are well-detected in X-ray BH binaries, which may shed some light on the physical origins of our event.

This was done by comparing the relationship between the velocity distributions and corresponding Doppler power spectra. First, a geometric vessel model with axisymmetric stenosis was established. This made it possible to obtain the blood flow velocity distributions for different degrees of stenosis from the solutions of the Navier Stokes equations. Then, the Doppler spectra were calculated for the entire segment of the vessel that was covered by the sound field. Finally, the maximum frequency locations for the spectra were determined based on the intersections of the maximum values chosen from the calculated blood flow velocity distributions and their corresponding spectra. The computational analysis showed that the maximum frequencies, which corresponded to the maximum blood flow velocities for different degrees of stenosis, were located at different positions along the spectral falling edges. The location for a normal (stenosis free) vessel was in the middle of the falling edge. For vessels with increasing degrees of stenosis, this location shifted approximately linearly downward along the falling edge. For 40% stenosis, the location reached a position at the falling edge of 0.32. Results obtained using the Field II simulation tool demonstrated the validity of the theoretical analysis and calculations, and may help to improve the maximum velocity estimation accuracy for Doppler blood flow spectra in stenosed vessels.

The Cs-137 method has been widely used to estimate soil erosion and redistribution but has seldom been used to evaluate process-based erosion models. This study evaluated spatial erosion patterns predicted by the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model using Cs-137-estimated spatially distributed erosion data and quantified the effects of slope length on erosion along rangeland hillslopes. Eight rangeland hillslopes in midwestern Oklahoma were selected. The WEPP rangeland model was parameterized with observed soil and vegetation data. One downslope transect was sampled for each hillslope. At each sampling position, seven samples along a contour line were composited to represent the Cs-137 inventory for that slope position to reduce random spatial variation. Both methods predicted low soil erosion rates, with the maximum erosion rates being near 2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). The erosion rates predicted by the two methods were significantly correlated at P = 0.01, and the medians were not significantly different; however, a paired f-test showed that WEPP predicted significantly lower erosion rates than the Cs-137 method. More importantly, the WEPP-predicted soil erosion patterns in response to slope length agreed very well with those predicted by the Cs-137 method. The loci of the maximum and minimum erosion rates were similar between the two methods for seven transects. The WEPP rangeland model predictions for the spatial patterns of relative soil erosion intensity along a hillslope compared favorably with Cs-137 method estimates.

In fact, such an adaptive link weight introduces a new time scale tau(a), not necessarily equal to the time scale of game strategy tau(epsilon). Inspired from aforementioned above, we investigate the effect of w = tau(epsilon)/tau(a) on the evolution of cooperative behavior. Through numerical simulation, we find cooperation can be promoted effectively with a larger value of w, which is related to the increase of average link weight in the structured population.

After calculating the correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, and standard deviation between the iTVDI and observed topsoil moisture at 10 and 20 cm for seven sites, the effectiveness of the new index in depicting topsoil moisture conditions was verified. The drought area indicated by iTVDI mapping was then compared with the drought-affected area reported by the local government. The results indicated that the iTVDI can monitor drought more accurately than the traditional TVDI during the dry season in Yunnan Province. Using iTVDI facilitates drought warning and irrigation scheduling, and the expectation is that this new index can be broadly applied in other areas.

The cells of the novel strains were Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, motile, non-spore-forming and coccus-shaped. The two strains both contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The whole-cell sugars were arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose and ribose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-2). The polar lipid profile of both strains comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, one unknown phosphoglycolipid and five unknown phospholipids. The predominant fatty acids of both strains were anteiso-C-15:0. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 121936(T) and YIM 121940(T) were 74.7 and 75.2 %, respectively. Strain YIM 121936(T) was closely related to Kineococcus aurantiacus IFO 15268(T) (97.19 %), Kineococcus gypseus YIM 121300(T) (97.00 %) and Kineococcus mangrovi NBRC 110933(T) (97.00 %). Strain YIM 121940(T) was closely related to K. aurantiacus IFO 15268(T) (97.41 %), Kineococcus endophytica KLBMP 1274(T) (97.18 %), Kineococcus rhizosphaerae RP-B16(T) (97.09 %), Kineococcus radiotolerans SRS 30216(T) (97.09 %), K. gypseus YIM 121300(T) (97.00 %) and K. mangrovi NBRC 110933(T) (97.00 %).

The cellular polar lipids contained phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingophospholipid, four unidentified phospholipids, five unidentified lipids and three unidentified aminophospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 41.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain h337(T) should be assigned to the genus Sphingobacterium. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity analysis showed that strain h337(T) was most closely related to 'Sphingobacterium yamdrokense' 3-0-1 (98.8 %) and Sphingobacterium yanglingense CCNWSP36-1(T) (98.5 %) and shared less than 97% similarity with other species of the genus Sphingobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization data indicated that the isolate represented a novel genomic species belonging to the genus Sphingobacterium. The characteristics determined in this polyphasic taxonomic study indicated that strain h337(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium tabacisoli sp. nov. (type strain h337(T)=KCTC 52298(T)=CCTCC AB 2017155(T)) is proposed.

The Strategic Analysis of Driving Forces Determining Success for a Console Manufacturer in the Console Market - the Positioning Strategy of Nintendo	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategy Management	SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT; INDIA; BANGLADESH; COAST	Though the console market is steadily growing, the competition is very fierce. A variety of key factors get involved in the successful survival in the console market, including branding, cost, exclusive games, innovation, online feature, price, reliability, third parties support, technology, and timing. However, it is not easy to sustain the competitive advantages in an extremely fierce console market with other strong competitors for a long time, if there is not any change to console manufacturers. In addition to keep the original strength, Nintendo applies the most appropriate strategy to sustain its competitive advantages in the next generation.	[Lee, S.

Although the intestine and the epidermis of C. elegans that is in contact with pathogens are likely to function as sites for the immune function, recent studies indicate that the nervous system could control innate immunity in C. elegans. In this report, we demonstrated that protein kinase A (PKA)/KIN-1 in the neurons contributes to resistance against Salmonella enterica infection in C. elegans. Microarray analysis revealed that PKA/KIN-1 regulates the expression of a set of antimicrobial effectors in the non-neuron tissues, which are required for innate immune responses to S. enterica. Furthermore, PKA/KIN-1 regulated the expression of lysosomal genes during S. enterica infection. Our results suggest that the lysosomal signaling molecules are involved in autophagy by controlling autophagic flux, rather than formation of autophagosomes. As autophagy is crucial for host defense against S. enterica infection in a metazoan, the lysosomal pathway also acts as a downstream effector of the PKA/KIN-1 signaling for innate immunity. Our data indicate that the PKA pathway contributes to innate immunity in C. elegans by signaling from the nervous system to periphery tissues to protect the host against pathogens.

In the present study, tubers of I. henryi were fermented by several fungi, and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of non-fermented and fermented I. henryi were measured. The results showed that the fermentation of l. henryi with Clonostachys rogersoniana 828H2 is effective for improving the AChE inhibitory activity. A key biotransformation was found during the C. rogersoniana fermentation for clarifying the improvement of the AChE inhibitory activity of I. henryi: (S)-actinodaphnine (1) was converted to a new 4-hydroxyaporphine alkaloid (4R,6aS)-4-hydroxyactinodaphnine (2) that possessed a stronger AChE inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 17.66 +/- 0.06 mu M. This paper is the first to report that the pure strain fermentation processing of f. henryi and indicated C. rogersoniana fermentation might be a potential processing method for J. henryi.

Through field investigations and behavioral assays conducted in four populations of Stemona tuberosa from 2011-2016, we demonstrate that hornets are the primary seed dispersers of S. tuberosa and play an important role in "long-distance" seed dispersal in this species. Furthermore, some ant species act as secondary dispersers and may transport the seeds to safe sites. Hornets and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at different spatial scales. This unique example of insect-plant mutualism may be an underestimated but important strategy to ensure "long-distance" seed dispersal in other myrmecochorous plants.

However, the mechanism how MbBV regulates apoptosis remains unclear. eIF4A, one of translation initiation factors, was found from a Spodoptera litura transcriptome, the expression of which in the parasitized hemocytes of S. litura was inhibited in RT-qPCR analysis. The western blot also illustrated eIF4A at 6-day post-parasitization was inhibited in hemocytes. For testing interaction of MbBV-eIF4A-apoptosis, a cDNA clone encoding 1,266bp of eIF4A was obtained from S. litura hemocytes and sequenced. Then, a 48kDa V5-fusion protein of the eIF4A was detected by using the anti-V5 antibody at 72-h post-transfection in the High Five cells, which is located in the cell cytoplasm. In vitro, overexpression of eIF4A rescued the apoptotic High Five cells induced by MbBV. Conversely, in vivo, loss of eIF4A proteins by dsRNA feeding increased apoptosis of hemocytes. Furthermore, RNAi and parasitism significantly increased apoptosis of hemocytes in S. litura. These findings suggested that MbBV inhibited the expression of eIF4A, which was required for apoptosis mediated by MbBV. This study will contribute to biological pest control and enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying polydnavirus-parasitoid-host interaction.

Among them, compound 7b displayed potent cytotoxic activity in vitro against SK-OV-3 and HCT116 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.5 and 0.2 mu M, respectively. In general, the antiproliferative activity was correlated with the binding property of the colchicine binding site and inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization. In addition, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis revealed that selected compounds caused disruption of the mitotic spindle assembly and G(2)/M phase arrest of the cell cycle, which correlated with proliferation inhibitory activity. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated the interaction of 7b at the colchicine binding site of tubulin. These results indicate these compounds are promising inhibitors of tubulin polymerization for the potent treatment of cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we shall generalize this result by classifying all connected arc-transitive cubic graphs of order four times an odd square-free integer. It is shown that, for each of such graphs Gamma, either the full automorphism group Aut Gamma is isomorphic to PSL(2, p), PGL(2, p), PSL(2, p) x Z(2) or PGL(2, p) x Z(2), or Gamma is isomorphic to one of 5 graphs.

M71 treated with salicylic acid (SA). A total of 60,664,200 raw reads were assembled into 26,044 unigenes. BLAST assigned 8,767 (33.7%) and 10,840 (41.6%) unigenes to 40 Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and 108 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. A total of 3,713 unigenes comprising 1,504 upregulated and 2,209 downregulated unigenes were found to be differentially expressed between SA-induced and control fungi. Based on the camptothecin biosynthesis pathway in plants, 13 functional genes of Xylaria sp. M71 were mapped to the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, suggesting that the fungal 10-hydroxycamptothecin is produced via the MVA pathway. In summary, analysis of the Xylaria sp. M71 transcriptome allowed the identification of unigenes that are putatively involved in 10-hydroxycamptothecin biosynthesis in fungi.

In the nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora, we found that ROS were produced during conidial germination, hyphal extension, and trap formation in the presence of nematodes. Generation of an AoNoxA knockout strain demonstrated the crucial role of NADPH oxidase in the production of ROS in A. oligospora, with trap formation impaired in the AoNoxA mutant, even in the presence of the nematode host. In addition, the expression of virulence factor serine protease P186 was up-regulated in the wild-type strain, but not in the mutant strain, in the presence of Caenorhabditis elegans. These results indicate that ROS derived from AoNoxA are essential for full virulence of A. oligospora in nematodes.

It is found that the samples can respond strongly to the NIR radiation so that the temperature dependence of the reflectivity can be measured accordingly. Interestingly, the temperature induced phase separation and nano-droplet states in the nanowire samples with different diameters can be identified and observed optically without making ohmic contact electrodes on the samples. The onset temperature of the nano-droplet state measured optically is in line with that obtained from previous transport measurements. Importantly, via examining the dependence of the NIR reflectivity upon radiation wavelength, we find that the electronic localization effect exists in the LPCMO nanowires in both electronic states. Such information cannot be directly obtained from electric transport and magneto-transport experiments. The interesting and important experimental findings from this study demonstrate that the simple and contactless NIR reflection measurements can be employed to conveniently study and characterize the basic physical properties of perovskite manganites based nanostructure systems.

Our new ALMA observations reveal sequential high-mass star formation taking place within one subvirial filamentary clump (the G9.62 clump) in the G9.62+0.19 complex. The 12 dense cores (MM1-MM12) detected by ALMA are at very different evolutionary stages, from the starless core phase to the UC H II region phase. Three dense cores (MM6, MM7/G, MM8/F) are associated with outflows. The mass-velocity diagrams of the outflows associated with MM7/G and MM8/F can be well-fit by broken power laws. The mass-velocity diagram of the SiO outflow associated with MM8/F breaks much earlier than other outflow tracers (e.g., CO, SO, CS, HCN), suggesting that SiO traces newly shocked gas, while the other molecular lines (e.g., CO, SO, CS, HCN) mainly trace the ambient gas continuously entrained by outflow jets. Five cores (MM1, MM3, MM5, MM9, MM10) are massive starless core candidates whose masses are estimated to be larger than 25 M-circle dot, assuming a dust temperature of <= 20 K. The shocks from the expanding H II regions ("B" and "C") to the west may have a great impact on the G9.62 clump by compressing it into a filament and inducing core collapse successively, leading to sequential star formation. Our findings suggest that stellar feedback from H II regions may enhance the star formation efficiency and suppress low-mass star formation in adjacent pre-existing massive clumps.

The data showed that the fluctuations of precipitation stable isotopes at Qamdo during the different seasons revealed various moisture sources. The westerlies and local recycling moisture dominated at the study area before the pre-monsoon and after the post-monsoon seasons, which resulted in similar trends of both precipitation stable isotopes and temperature. The marine moisture was transported to the northern Hengduan Mountains by the winter India-Burma Trough combined with convection. Consequently, stable isotopes in subsequent precipitation were occasionally observed to decrease suddenly. However, delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation at Qamdo were lower during the monsoon period and the duration of those low values was longer because of the effects of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the strengthening convection. Our findings indicate that the effects of seasonal precipitation differences caused by various climate systems, including the winter India-Burma Trough and Indian Summer Monsoon, need to be considered when attempting to interpret tree-ring and ice core records for the Hengduan Mountains.

Growth occurred at 37-50 degrees C (optimum, 45 degrees C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 6.5-7.0) and in the presence of 0.5-1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5 %). The major cellular fatty acids were C-18 : 1 omega 7c, C-16 : 0, C(19 : 0)cyclo omega 8c, and C-18 : 1 2-OH. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 69.8 mol%. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-10. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, one unidentified aminolipid and two unidentified phospholipids. Bacteriochlorophyll alpha and carotenoic acids were not detected. Strain YIM 72346(T) was not observed for the accumulation of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The strain shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence identities with Crenalkalicoccus roseus YIM 78023(T) (93.3 %) and Craurococcus roseus NS130(T) (92.7 %), but formed a distinct lineage within the family Acetobacteraceae in the phylogenetic trees. On the basis of genotypic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analyses, strain YIM 72346(T) is considered to represent a novel genus and species of the family Acetobacteraceae, for which the name Caldovatus sediminis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Caldovatus sediminis is YIM 72346(T) (=KCTC 52714(T)=CGMCC 1.16330(T)).

J	Cao, J; Zhang, WK; Tao, Y				Cao, Jie; Zhang, Wei-kang; Tao, Yun			Thermal Configuration of the Bay of Bengal-Tibetan Plateau Region and the May Precipitation Anomaly in Yunnan	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; LOW-LATITUDE HIGHLANDS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; WINTER MONSOON; PART I; FEEDBACK; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; CLIMATE	This paper describes the study of the relationship between the thermal configuration of the Bay of Bengal (BOB)-Tibetan Plateau (TP) region and the precipitation anomaly in Yunnan, a province in China, in May using ERA-Interim data and precipitation data for May from 125 meteorological stations across Yunnan for 1979-2014. Results from the analysis indicate that the interannual variability of May precipitation in Yunnan is significantly modulated by the BOB-TP thermal configuration. Model runs with a linear baroclinic model suggest physical consistency. The thermal conditions over the BOB mainly impact the May precipitation anomaly in Yunnan via changes in water vapor transport from the eastern BOB northeastward to southwestern Yunnan. The second factor influencing precipitation anomalies relates to the characteristics and variability of cold air transport from the TP to northeastern Yunnan. When the BOB (the TP) is occupied by positive (negative) diabatic heating, a thermal gradient with a warmer (colder) center over the BOB and a colder (warmer) center over the TP is established, and more-than-normal (less than normal) precipitation in Yunnan will occur in May. This relationship can persist from April to the following May to some extent; therefore, the BOB-TP thermal configuration in April could be used to forecast May precipitation in Yunnan.

J	Liu, WF; Zhang, LB; Tao, DP; Cheng, J				Liu, Weifeng; Zhang, Lianbo; Tao, Dapeng; Cheng, Jun			Support vector machine active learning by Hessian regularization	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						Active learning; Semi-supervised; Manifold regularization; Image segmentation; Activity recognition; Hessian	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; IMAGE; EIGENMAPS	It is time-consuming and expensive to gather and label the growing multimedia data that is easily accessible with the prodigious development of Internet technology and digital sensors. Hence, it is essential to develop a technique that can efficiently be utilized for the large-scale multimedia data especially when labeled data is rare. Active learning is showing to be one useful approach that greedily chooses queries from unlabeled data to be labeled for further learning and then minimizes the estimated expected learning error. However, most active learning methods only take into account the labeled data in the training of the classifier. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised algorithm to learn the classifier and then perform active learning scheme on top of the semi-supervised scheme. Particularly, we employ Hessian regularization into support vector machine to boost the classifier. Hessian regularization exploits the potential geometry structure of data space (including labeled and unlabeled data) and then significantly leverages the performance in each round. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we carefully conduct extensive experiments including image segmentation and human activity recognition on popular data-sets respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve a better performance than the traditional active learning methods. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The ZnO/oligoaniline nanocomposites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TG/DTA, and physical adsorption of nitrogen. The adsorption and photocatalytic efficiency of the resulting materials were evaluated for removal of dyes. The adsorption data for dyes removal met pseudo-second order kinetic model. The role of adsorption on photocatalysis was investigated under different reaction conditions. Simultaneous adsorption and photocatalysis (SAP) emerged enhancing effect on cationic dyes, while equilibrium adsorption followed by photodegradation (EAP) improved the catalytic rate of anionic dye. The apparent first-order model was chosen as kinetic equation to estimate photocatalytic reaction. Under SAP mode, ZnO/oliganiline nanocomposite exhibited a higher catalytic rate compared to pure ZnO nanoparticles for dyes photodegradation. The incorporation of oligianiline support significantly enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO nanoparticles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Collaborative QoS prediction is recently proposed addressing this issue by borrowing ideas from recommender systems. Going down this principle, we propose novel deviation-based neighborhood models for QoS prediction by taking advantages of crowd intelligence. Different from existing works, our models are under a two-tier formal framework which allows an efficient global optimization of the model parameters. The first component gives a baseline estimate for QoS prediction using deviations of the services and the users. The second component is founded on the principle of neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and contributes fine-grained adjustments of the predictions. Also, contextual information is used in the neighborhood component to strengthen the predicting ability of the proposed models. Experimental results, on a large-scale QoS-specific dataset, demonstrate that deviation-based neighborhood models can overcome existing difficulties of heuristic collaborative filtering methods and achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art prediction methods. Also, the proposed models can naturally exploit location information to ensure more accurate prediction results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The spatiotemporal variations of heat wave occurrence/duration/amplitude are compared between the two definitions. Considering the significant differences in regional climatology, relative threshold is more meaningful to detect the local extremes. By utilizing the empirical orthogonal function, the integral index heat wave total intensity is decomposed into three dominant modes: interdecadal (ID), interannual-tripole (IA-TR), and interannual-dipole (IA-DP) modes. The ID mode shows uniform anomalies over the whole China, with the maximum in north, and its corresponding time series depict notable interdecadal variations with a turning point around mid-1990s. The IA-DP mode exhibits opposite-signed anomalies over north and south China. The IA-TR mode shows an anomalous tripole pattern with negative anomalies over central China and positive anomalies over north and south China in its positive phase. Both the IA-DP and IA-TR patterns are more obvious since mid-1990s with mainly year-to-year variations before that. All the three modes are controlled by anomalous high-pressure systems, which are accompanied by local-scale dry land conditions. The diabatic heating associated with anomalous convective activities over tropical western Pacific triggers Rossby wave trains propagating northward along the East Asia, which causes abnormal heat waves through descending motion over the high-pressure nodes. In turn, the severe convections are generated by enhanced Walker circulation in the tropical Pacific due to warming and/or cooling sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical western and eastern Pacific, respectively.

Efficient conservation can be possible only with the long-term participation and understanding of the communities. Ritual beliefs of the indigenous people are one of the important tools to understand the local communities and aid the nature conservation. In this paper, we documented contemporary ritual practices and ritual plant uses among the Naxi people and discussed the importance of traditional knowledge on ritual practice in the conservation of plants in the mountains presenting a case study of the Dongba culture. Methods: This study was carried out from July in 2013 to July in 2014. To document and analyze the present state of the ritual plant used by the Naxi people we conducted an ethnobotanical survey. We interviewed local people including Dongba priests using the semi-structured questionnaire. During the field study, we participated in the local religious activities to witness the use of different plants in ritual activities of the Naxi people. We interviewed twenty-two key informants and eleven of them were male. All the specimens of documented species were collected and deposited at the herbarium of Kunming Institute of Botany. Results: The survey results revealed the Naxi people possessed sound knowledge of the traditional ritual plants and great diversity of plants used in many of Naxi rituals and festivals. From the survey, we documented 32 ritual plant species belonging to 24 genera of 17 families used in various ritual activities. The ritual plants were grouped into two categories, namely those burned as incense, and those used for decoration. The incense plants like Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and Pistacia weinmanniifolia were probably promising natural aromatic resource. Plants of genus Quercus were the most frequently used species. The places for ritual activities were diverse, such as the incense burners inside and outside the house and sacred trees at the Baishuitai. Local people except the young generation had an abundant of traditional knowledge. Conclusions: Our study shows the live ritual activities and the beliefs of the residents are keeping the plant diversity and the entire forest preserved as sacred mountains. Our study emphasizes traditional belief and an alternative view of conservation that is not led mainly by governmental policies, as local practices and ritual plants uses play as constant reminders to the Naxi on nature conservation. However, further research is recommended for in-depth understanding the role of traditional belief in biodiversity conservation.

S. argenteus has been reported in many countries and can threaten human health. S. schweitzeri has not been associated with human infections, but has been isolated from non-human primates. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity of these two species will remain elusive until an exploratory evolutionary framework is established. Results: We present genomic comparison analysis among members of SAC based on a pan-genome definition, which included 15 S. argenteus genomes (five newly sequenced), six S. schweitzeri genomes and 30 divergent S. aureus genomes. The three species had divergent core genomes and rare interspecific recombination was observed among the core genes. However, some subtypes of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements and prophages were present in different species. Of 111 tested virulence genes of S. aureus, 85 and 86 homologous genes were found in S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri, respectively. There was no difference in virulence gene content among the three species, but the sequence of most core virulence genes was divergent. Analysis of the agr locus and the genes in the capsular polysaccharides biosynthetic operon revealed that they both diverged before the speciation of SAC members. Furthermore, the widespread geographic distribution of S. argenteus, sequence type 2250, showed ambiguous biogeographical structure among geographically isolated populations, demonstrating an international spread of this pathogen. Conclusions: S. argenteus has spread among several countries, and invasive infections and persistent carriage may be not limited to currently reported regions.

To achieve this goal, three novel heterolepic Ir(III) complexes, namely (ptq)(2)Ir(acac), (ttq)(2)Ir(acac) and (tptq)(2)Ir(acac), were designed and synthesized by utilizing extended pi-conjugated thieno[3,2-c] quinoline derivatives as cyclometalating ligands. These complexes display intense red phosphorescence emission in the range of 610-620 nm. Accordingly, a vacuum-deposited red PhOLED based on (ptq) 2Ir(acac) shows the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.9% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.61, 0.36). In particular, the device exhibits an extraordinary low efficiency roll-off of 7.8% at a luminance of 1000 cd m(-2).

Short isobornyl methacrylate (IM) building blocks in the two ends of molecular chain were incorporated to guarantee the mechanical properties of the TPEs at high temperature (i.e., heat resistance) because of the high glass-transition temperature (T-g) of poly(isobornyl methacrylate) (PIM; approximate to 180 degrees C). The microphase separation, tensile properties at different temperatures, dynamic mechanical properties, oil resistance, and thermal stability of the TPEs were extensively characterized. The TPEs had distinct microphase separation with a wide inter-T-g interval (150-185 degrees C). The tensile strength and elongation at break of the TPEs decreased with increasing temperature from 25 to 100 degrees C because of the reduced interactions in the phase domain. Even so, the TPEs had a high elongation at break beyond 200% and little change in the tensile strength even at 100 degrees C together with a wide quasi-platform stage between the T-g values in dynamic mechanical analysis; this indicated good heat resistance. Meanwhile, the TPEs had an enhanced oil resistance and a thermal stability higher than 300 degrees C. These TCP-based TPEs with heat and oil resistance broaden the application potential in practical fields. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations revealed that removal of the N-terminal tails of histone H3, known to destabilize nucleosomes, causes a rearrangement of two arginines of histone H2A, namely R81 and R88 by altering the electrostatic environment of the H2A alpha 3 domain. Whether this rearrangement is the cause or the effect of decreased stability, is unclear. Here, we emulate the altered electrostatic environment that was found after H3 tail clipping through charge-modifying mutations to decouple its impact on intranucleosomal interactions from that of the histone tails. Forster resonance energy transfer experiments on recombinant nucleosomes and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal a compensatory role of those amino acids in nucleosome stability. The simulations indicate a weakened interface between H2A-H2B dimers and the (H3-H4)(2) tetramer, as well as between dimers and DNA. These findings agree with the experimental observations of position and charge dependent decreased nucleosome stability induced by the introduced mutations. This work highlights the importance of the H2A alpha 3 domain and suggests allosteric effects between this domain and the outer DNA gyre as well as the H3 N-terminal tail.

In this study, we simulated the lake's volume by constructing an empirical relationship between the area of Lake Merzbacher, determined from satellite images, and the lake's water storage, derived from digital elevation models. Results showed that the lake water supply rate before Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) generally agreed well with those during the GLOFs from 2009 to 2012 but not in 2008 and 2015. Furthermore, we found that the combination of glacial meltwater and ice calving is not enough to fully explain the supply rate during GLOFs in 1996 and 1999, suggesting other factors affect the supply rate during GLOFs as well. To examine this further, we compared the water supply rate before and during GLOF events in 1999 and 2008. We inferred that quickly released short-term and intermediate-term water storage by glaciers have likely contributed to both flood events in those years. This study highlights the need to improve our understanding of the supply component of outburst floods, such as irregularly released stored water may lead to GLOF events with generally three different types: case I (singular event-triggered englacial water release), case II (glacier melt due to temperature changes), and case III (englacial water release mixed with glacier melt). Plain Language Summary Glacial lake outburst is one of natural hazards related to glaciers. The glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) of Merzbacher which almost occurs every year threatens lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure both in the mountains and downstream, posing myriad challenges for the communities. The regional warming leads to the increasing to supply for the Lake Merzbacher from Inylchek glacier. Importantly, quickly released intermediate- and short-term water storage by glaciers probably contributed to floods, which increase flood volume and lead to severe risk on the downstream socioeconomy.

However, the dynamic processes involved in the evolution and deformation of the Tibetan plateau remain poorly understood due to the absence of reliable geophysical observations. In this study, 159 earthquakes of magnitude Ms >= 6.2 were selected, which were recorded by 50 permanent broadband stations deployed in southwest China, and 1873 pairs of P-wave receiver functions with high signal-to-noise ratio were isolated. On the basis of a linearized inversion algorithm, a two-step inversion procedure was implemented that not only reduced the dependence of the inversion results on the initial models, but also provided a statistical estimation of the solution. Thus, we obtained an accurate 3D image of the S-wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle in the southeast margin of the Tibetan plateau. Our results reveal that an extensive intracrustal low-velocity zone spreads beneath southwest China, and further suggest that a lower crustal flow coming from eastern Tibet is blocked by the Jinshajiang-Red River fault to the west and the Xiaojiang fault to the east and extends largely by the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond-shaped block. This crustal flow along the southeastern margin of Tibet does not appear to be restricted to two narrow low-velocity channels as was advanced, but rather reflects the southeastward extrusion of crustal material as a way of tectonic escape.

After grinding and annealing, VOx quasi-aerogel is converted into well-crystallized V2O5 nanorods (V2O5 NRs) which can be used as a promising cathode material with high capacity for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Besides, TiO2 coated V2O5 nanorods (TiO2-V2O5 NRs) are obtained by a simple hydrolysis reaction of tetrabutyl titanate under wet-chemistry condition and followed by post-sintering in air. Electrochemical measurements indicate that TiO2-V2O5 NRs as cathode material for LIBs exhibit more stable cycling performance (highest specific capacity is 261.6 mAh g(-1) and 223.0 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) between 2 and 4 V vs. Li/Li+) and better rate capability (exhibiting 155.8 mAh g(-1) under 800 mA g(-1)) compared with unmodified V2O5 NRs (highest capacity is 269.7 mAh g(-1) and 212.7 mAh g(-1) for the 50th cycle at 100 mA g(-1); delivering 112.2 mAh g(-1) under 800 mA g(-1)). The improved performance could be attributed to the protective effect of TiO2 coating layer between active V2O5 NRs and electrolyte. This work provides a facile and scalable route to synthesize high-performance nano-structured V2O5 cathode and its surface-modified counterpart for LIBs application.

The SLM consisted of a synergistic mixture of primary amine N1923 and bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfoxide (BESO) in kerosene as carrier and a hydrophobic microporous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane as the solid support. The presence of both BESO and N1923 extractants in the liquid membrane induces an evident synergistic effect, allowing the latter to transfer Au(I) from the highly alkaline solution (pH > 9.21). The fundamental parameters influencing the gold transport, such as stirring speed, composition of the liquid membrane, feed pH, NaOH concentration in stripping solution, and initial gold concentration in the feed solution were explored. The gold transport is almost quantitative after 7 h under the optimum process conditions: a mixture of (0.50 mol/L N1923 + 0.75 mol/L BESO) in kerosene as membrane phase, stirring rate of 1000 rpm in both phases, 5.0 mg/L gold in 0.20 mol/L NaCl solution with a pH of 9.60, and 0.10 mol/L NaOH as stripping agent. The parameters defining the mass transfer model of Au(I) through the SLM are experimentally determined as: maximum permeability coefficient, P = 31.45 x 10(-6) m/s, the diffusion coefficient for [Au(CN)(2-)center dot RNH3+center dot 2BESO] complex across the liquid membrane, D-org = 1.42 x 10(-12) m(2)/s, and the thickness of the aqueous diffusion layer, d(aq) = 2.07 x 10(-5) m. Selectivity of this SLM system was evaluated by performing the permeation test of Au(CN)(2-) with other metal cyanide species in aqueous solution and it was found that the gold ions were preferred over other impurity ones. Finally, stability of this SLM system has also been examined on a continuous run mode and satisfactory stability was observed for five runs.

However, few studies have examined selection quantitatively from multiple sources on the same trait identified the agent of natural selection experimentally. Here we quantified phenotypic selection on traits, including flowering phenology and aspects of floral display via female fitness, in the distylous perennial herb Primula alpicola. To determine the role of pollinators in generating selection effects on floral traits, we compared the phenotypic selection gradients in open-pollinated and hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that pollinator-mediated linear selection on flowering start and correlational selection on the number of flowers and scape height explains most of the net phenotypic selection on these traits suggesting pollinators played an important role in shaping floral diversity. We used path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine how herbivores affected the relationship between floral traits and female fitness, but no significant selection was caused by seed predators. These results suggest pollinators, not herbivores maybe the significant agent of selection on flora traits.

Electronic properties of bilayer phosphorene quantum dots in the presence of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							LAYER BLACK PHOSPHORUS	Using the tight-binding approach, we investigate the electronic properties of bilayer phosphorene (BLP) quantum dots (QDs) in the presence of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. Since BLP consists of two coupled phosphorene layers, it is of interest to examine the layer-dependent electronic properties of BLP QDs, such as the electronic distributions over the two layers and the so-produced layer-polarization features, and to see how these properties are affected by the magnetic field and the bias potential. We find that in the absence of a bias potential only edge states are layer polarized while the bulk states are not, and the layer-polarization degree (LPD) of the unbiased edge states increases with increasing magnetic field. However, in the presence of a bias potential both the edge and bulk states are layer polarized, and the LPD of the bulk (edge) states depends strongly (weakly) on the interplay of the bias potential and the interlayer coupling. At high magnetic fields, applying a bias potential renders the bulk electrons in a BLP QD to be mainly distributed over the top or bottom layer, resulting in layer-polarized bulk Landau levels (LLs). In the presence of a large bias potential that can drive a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition in BLP, these bulk LLs exhibit different magnetic-field dependences, i.e., the zeroth LLs exhibit a linearlike dependence on the magnetic field while the other LLs exhibit a square-root-like dependence.

Many questions about the gayal such as its origin, population history, and genetic basis of local adaptation remain largely unresolved. De novo sequencing and assembly of the whole gayal genome provides an opportunity to address these issues. We report a high-depth sequencing, de novo assembly, and annotation of a female Chinese gayal genome. Based on the Illumina genomic sequencing platform, we have generated 350.38 Gb of raw data from 16 different insert-size libraries. A total of 276.86 Gb of clean data is retained after quality control. The assembled genome is about 2.85 Gb with scaffold and contig N50 sizes of 2.74 Mb and 14.41 kb, respectively. Repetitive elements account for 48.13% of the genome. Gene annotation has yielded 26 667 protein-coding genes, of which 97.18% have been functionally annotated. BUSCO assessment shows that our assembly captures 93% (3183 of 4104) of the core eukaryotic genes and 83.1% of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs. We provide the first comprehensive de novo genome of the gayal. This genetic resource is integral for investigating the origin of the gayal and performing comparative genomic studies to improve understanding of the speciation and divergence of bovine species. The assembled genome could be used as reference in future population genetic studies of gayal.

Using a matched space for time scales, a new concept of periodic time scales is introduced. Based on it, new concepts of periodic functions, almost periodic functions and almost automorphic functions whose concepts were defined on translations of their arguments are proposed through non-translational shifts. The results in this paper provide new methods to consider periodic solution, almost periodic solution and almost automorphic solutions for q-difference equations and others on irregular time scales via the background of the algebraic structure.

Primary amine catalysts exhibit either unusual stereoselectivity or reactivity, which is not observable with secondary amine catalysts. Moreover, reversal of diastereofacial selectivity between primary and secondary amine catalysts is disclosed. These new reactions provide useful methods for the syntheses of chiral 3-substituted 3-amino-2-oxindoles and dihydroquinazolinones bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of AG-041R and DPC 083 and the total synthesis of (-)-psychotriasine.

The probe exhibited higher selectivity towards the target molecule over other thiol and amino acids at pH 7.2 in aqueous media CH3CN-HEPES (0.02 mol/L, pH 7.2,1:9, v/v). The reaction mechanism is attributed to the cysteine-induced SNAr substitution-rearrangement reaction. Remarkable enhancement of up to 20-fold in fluorescence intensity was achieved in the detection of cysteine. When applied for the fluorescence imaging of cysteine, the compound 1 emitted a green fluorescence in Hi5 cell cytoplasm.

The lakes span more than 2 orders of magnitude in size (areas of 210-27,000km(2)) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada, the U.S., and China. Lake-generated microseisms create spectral peaks at periods near 1s and are often polarized as Rayleigh waves propagating away from the lake. In contrast to ocean-generated microseisms, lake-generated microseisms are only observed within about 25-30km of the shoreline. This is consistent with the well-known high attenuation of short-period Rayleigh waves (R-g). It is unclear if lake-generated microseisms are produced by a linear shoaling process, analogous to primary ocean microseisms, or a nonlinear wave-wave interaction process, analogous to secondary ocean microseisms. If they are mainly produced by shoaling, lake-generated microseisms might provide a spatially integrated measure of shoreline erosion. Regardless of the source mechanism, lake-generated microseisms appear to provide a record of ice phenology for lakes that freeze in the winter. Such data could contribute to assessing the effects of climate change on high-latitude lakes in remote areas. Finally, it is likely that lake-generated microseisms are useful for imaging the geological structure of the shallow crust, information that is important for quantifying seismic hazard and can be difficult to obtain in urban areas where active source imaging is not feasible.

Bactrocera tau (Walker) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a significant pest and member of the Tephritidae family that has expanded its normal host range from Cucurbitaceae to many other plant families. The objective of this study was to monitor the impact of novel host plants on genetic variation in B. tau. In this study, under laboratory conditions, we examined genetic variation based on microsatellite molecular markers of B. tau when development occurred on one novel host (banana) and two traditional hosts (pumpkin and cucumber) for 15 continuous generations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that the genetic difference (10.39%) among populations feeding on the various hosts was significant, but not among populations from different generations. It appears that host food, more than population generations, played a critical role in genetic variation of B. tau. The effect of hosts on genetic variation of B. tau was greater on the novel host compared with the traditional Cucurbitaceae hosts. The significant genetic variation of the banana-feeding populations was reflected in difficulties of balancing in frequency of gene and genotype, reduced genetic diversity, and more divergent genetic difference.

LATEX; ACTIVATION; THERAPY	Three new macrocyclic diterpenoids, euphoscopoids A - C (1 - 3), including two new jatrophanes and a new lathyrane, were isolated from the whole plant of Euphorbia helioscopia. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. Antifeedant and cytotoxic activities of these isolates were evaluated. All compounds showed significant antifeedant activity against a generalist plant-feeding insect, Helicoverpa armigera, with EC50 values ranging from 2.05 to 4.34 mu g/cm(2). In addition, compound 2 showed moderate cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines NCI-H1975, HepG2, and MCF-2, while compounds 1 and 3 were not active at 80 mu M. The results suggested not only the defensive function of macrocyclic diterpenoids in E. helioscopia against insect herbivores, but also their potential applications as new natural insect antifeedants.

The radiation of metazoan life apparent in the Ediacaran (-635-541 million years ago) and Cambrian (-541-488 million years ago) periods is increasingly accepted to represent ecological diversification resulting from earlier key genetic developmental events and other innovations that occurred in the late Tonian and Cryogenian periods (-850-635 million years ago). The Cambrian has representative animals in each major ecospace category, the early Cambrian in particular having witnessed the earliest known complex animal communities and trophic structures, including symbiotic relationships. Here we report on newly discovered Cricocosmia and Mafangscolex worms that are hosts to aggregates of a new species of tiny worm in the lower Cambrian (Series 2, Stage 3) Chengjiang Lagerstatte of Yunnan Province, southwest China. The worm associations suggest the earliest known record of aggregate infestation of the integument of a soft-bodied bilaterian, host specificity and host shift.

In the case when the objective function f undergoes the tilt perturbations in the sense of Poliquin and Rockafellar, adopting admissible functions phi and psi, this paper introduces and studies the stable well-posedness of f with respect to phi(in brief, phi-SLWP) and tilt-stable local minimum of f with respect to psi (in brief, psi-TSLM). In the special case when phi(t) = t(2) and psi(t) = t, the corresponding phi-SLWP and psi-TSLM reduce to the stable second order local minimizer and tilt stable local minimum respectively, which have been extensively studied in recent years. We discover an interesting relationship between two admissible functions phi and psi: psi(t) = (phi')(-1)(t), which implies that a proper lower semicontinuous function f on a Banach space has phi-SLWP if and only if f has psi-TSLM. Using the techniques of variational analysis and conjugate analysis, we also prove that the strong metric phi'-regularity of partial derivative f is a sufficient condition for f to have phi-SLWP and that the strong metric phi'-regularity of partial derivative[(co) over bar (f + delta(BX)[(x) over bar, r])] for some r > 0 is a necessary condition for f to have phi-SLWP. In the special case when phi(t) = t(2), our results cover some existing main results on the tilt stability.

The effects of C and Y doping and annealing temperatures on the structural and optical properties, and photocatalytic activity were investigated. We found that both C and Y doping can broaden the absorption spectrum of TiO2 to the visible light region and inhibit recombination of photogenerated electron/hole pairs. The incorporation of Y into the TiO2 lattice inhibited growth of crystalline grains, which increased the specific surface area and enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance of the samples was investigated in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue under visible light irradiation. The rate of methyl blue degradation over the (C, Y)-co-doped TiO2 sample was much higher than those of undoped TiO2, C-TiO2, and Y-TiO2. Additionally, the apparent first-order rate constant of the co-doped sample was 3.5 times as large as that of undoped mix phase TiO2 under the same experimental conditions. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergic effect of (C, Y)-co-doping and the formation of an appropriate crystalline structure.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed H + He spectrum can be reproduced well with a model of cosmic rays escaping from the supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy. In this model, particles are accelerated in a SNR through a non-linear diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. Three components of high energy light nuclei escaped from the SNR are considered. It should be noted that the proton spectrum observed by KASCADE can be also explained by this model given a higher acceleration efficiency.

In order to discover structurally diverse and novel B-Raf inhibitors (BRIs), a virtual screening of BRIs against ZINC database was performed by using a combination of pharmacophore modelling, molecular docking, 3D-QSAR model and binding free energy (Delta G(bind)) calculation studies in this work. After the virtual screening, six promising hit compounds were obtained, which were then tested for inhibitory activities of A375 cell lines. In the result, five hit compounds show good biological activities (IC50 < 50 mu M). The present method of virtual screening can be applied to find structurally diverse inhibitors, and the obtained five structurally diverse compounds are expected to develop novel BRIs.

Pollen deposition and seed production after a single visit by a pollinator are often used to estimate pollinator effectiveness. However, seed production is not always directly related to pollen deposition because not all pollen grains that are deposited on a stigma are compatible or conspecific. In the field, we tested pollinator effectiveness based on pollen deposition and the resulting seed production after single visits by different pollinator groups in a gynodieocious alpine plant Cyananthus delavayi (Campanulaceae). Our results showed that mean pollen deposition was generally inconsistent with mean seed production when comparisons were performed among different pollinator groups and sexes. In general, the correlations were not significant between pollen deposition and seed production in both perfect and female flowers after single visits by halictid bees, bumble bees, and hoverflies. We suggest seed set of virgin flowers after single visits is a more reliable indicator of pollinator effectiveness than pollen deposition and would be a better indicator of pollinator effectiveness for future studies.

The geoaccumulation index (I (geo)) showed that enrichment levels of trace metals followed an order of Cu > Pb > Zn > As > Cr > Hg while the potential ecological risk factor () indicated that the potential ecological risk of the metals was in the order of Cu > Pb > As > Hg > Zn > Cr. Among these 22 sites, this investigation identified 9 sites at moderate ecological risk, 3 sites at considerable ecological risk, and 4 sites at high ecological risk according to the potential ecological risk index (RI). Hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) of soil metal concentrations separated the study sites into four groups, which are supported by the significant difference in RI values. Geographically, three regions in the Liberty State Park brownfield site were determined based on the CA results and RI values. Subarea 1 had low ecological risk while subareas 2 and 3 had a greater potential for ecological risk. Significant correlations of Pb with Cr and Zn were observed in subareas 2 and 3, respectively. This study shows that statistical approaches coupled with a risk assessment index provide a more comprehensive interpretation of land contamination than a single approach in support of planning land redevelopment.

Spores were not observed under a range of conditions. Strain 1404(T) was observed to grow at 15-45 degrees C and pH 6.0-10.0 and in presence of 0-5% (w/v) NaCl concentration. The cell wall of strain 1404(T) was found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, and the predominant respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid as well as three unidentified polar lipids. The major fatty acids profile of strain 1404(T) consisted of iso-C-15:0 (25.6 %), anteiso-C-15:0 (18.4 %) and iso-C-14:0 (12.1 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 1404(T) was affiliated to the genus Bacillus and was closely related to Bacillus oryzisoli 1DS3-10(T), Bacillus benzoevorans DSM 5391(T) and Bacillus circulans DSM 11(T) with sequence similarity of 98.3, 98.2 and 96.9 %, respectively. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 39.4 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization values indicated that relatedness between strain 1404(T) and the type strains of closely related species of the genus Bacillus was below 41 %. Therefore, on the basis of the data from the polyphasic taxonomic study presented, strain 1404(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name proposed is Bacillus endozanthoxylicus sp. nov. The type strain is 1404(T) (= CCTCC AB 2017021(T) = KCTC 33827(T)).

In this study, we identify the WD40-repeat protein WDR91 as a Rab7 effector that couples Rab switching with PtdIns3P down-regulation on endosomes. Loss of WDR91 greatly increases endosomal PtdIns3P levels, arresting endosomes at an intermediate stage and blocking endosomal-lysosomal trafficking. WDR91 is recruited to endosomes by interacting with active guanosine triphosophate-Rab7 and inhibits Rab7-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In mice, global Wdr91 knockout causes neonatal death, whereas brain-specific Wdr91 inactivation impairs brain development and causes postnatal death. Mouse neurons lacking Wdr91 accumulate giant intermediate endosomes and exhibit reduced neurite length and complexity. These phenotypes are rescued by WDR91 but not WDR91 mutants that cannot interact with Rab7. Thus, WDR91 serves as a Rab7 effector that is essential for neuronal development by facilitating endosome conversion in the endosome-lysosome pathway.

MORPHOLOGY, MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS, AND DEMONSTRATION OF A DEFINITIVE HOST FOR SARCOCYSTIS ROMMELI FROM CATTLE (BOS TAURUS) IN CHINA	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY			English	Article							WATER-BUFFALOS; N. SP.; SINENSIS; SEQUENCES; BOVIFELIS; HIRSUTA; CYCLE	Sarcocysts of Sarcocystis rommeli were found for the first time in 6 of 34 (17.6%) cattle (Bos taurus) in China. With light microscopy, sarcocysts of S. rommeli were up to 1,130 lm long, with a striated, 4-8-lm-thick cyst wall. Using transmission electron microscopy, the villar protrusions (vp) were 4.7-5.2 3 0.2-0.3 lm, and 0.3-0.5 lm apart from each other. The vp contained microtubules extending from the top of the vp to the middle of the ground substance layer (gsl). A BLAST search of the near full-length 18S rRNA and partial mitochondrial cox1 sequences of S. rommeli revealed 98.7% identity and 99.2% identity with sequences of Sarcocystis bovini in GenBank, respectively. Two domestic cats (Felis catus) fed sarcocysts of S. rommeli shed oocysts/sporocysts in their feces with a prepatent period of 14 to 15 days; the partial mitochondrial cox1 sequences of these oocysts/sporocysts shared the high identities, that is, 99.4% and 99.5%, with cox1 sequences of S. rommeli sarcocysts and S. bovini sarcocysts, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a definitive host for S. rommeli.	[Hu, J. J.; Huang, S.; Wen, T.; Liang, Y.; Li, H. L.] Yunnan Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hu, J.

Scaffolding proteins and other cytoskeletal elements play an essential role in morphogenetic processes in bacteria. Here we describe how OtsA, in addition to its role in trehalose biosynthesis, functions as an osmotic stress sensor to regulate cell morphology in Arthrobacter strain A3. In response to osmotic stress, this and other Arthrobacter species undergo a transition from bacillary to myceloid growth. An otsA null mutant exhibits constitutive myceloid growth. Osmotic stress leads to a depletion of trehalose-6-phosphate, the product of the OtsA enzyme, and experimental depletion of this metabolite also leads to constitutive myceloid growth independent of OtsA function. In vitro analyses indicate that OtsA can self-assemble into protein networks, promoted by trehalose-6-phosphate, a property that is not shared by the equivalent enzyme from E. coli, despite the latter's enzymatic activity when expressed in Arthrobacter. This, and the localization of the protein in non-stressed cells at the mid-cell and poles, indicates that OtsA from Arthrobacter likely functions as a cytoskeletal element regulating cell morphology. Recruiting a biosynthetic enzyme for this morphogenetic function represents an intriguing adaptation in bacteria that can survive in extreme environments.

Early Cambrian oxygen minimum zone-like conditions at Chengjiang	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Chengjiang; Burgess Shale type preservation; Cambrian; geochemistry; oxygen minimum zone; water column chemistry	FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; XIAOTAN SECTION; OCEAN CHEMISTRY; TRACE-METALS; PERU MARGIN; NITROGEN; IRON; EDIACARAN; EVOLUTION	The early Cambrian succession at Chengjiang contains the most diverse Cambrian fossil assemblage yet described, and contributes significantly to our understanding of the diversification of metazoans in the Cambrian "explosion". The Cambrian Period occupies a transitional episode of global ocean chemistry, following the oxygenation of the surface ocean and of shallow marine environments during the Ediacaran Period, but prior to the establishment of a predominantly oxygenated deep ocean in the mid -Paleozoic. Despite recent attention, a detailed understanding of the chemical conditions that prevailed in early Cambrian marine settings and the relationship of those conditions to early metazoan ecosystems is still emerging. Here, we report multi-proxy geochemical data from two drill cores through the early Cambrian (Series 2) Yu'anshan Formation of Yunnan, China. Results reveal dynamic water-column chemistry within the succession, which progressively shifted from euxinic to oxic conditions during deposition of the Yu'anshan Formation. The Chengjiang biota occurs in strata that appear to have been deposited under an oxygen-depleted water column that may have supported denitrification, as in modern oxygen-minimum zones. The oxygenated benthic environments in which the Chengjiang biota thrived were proximal to, but sharply separated from, the open ocean by a persistent anoxic water mass that occupied a portion of the outer shelf. Oxygen depletion in the lower water column developed dynamically in response to nutrient availability and possibly at lower thresholds of productivity due to lower atmospheric oxygen concentrations in Cambrian. These findings suggest that the frequent development of oxygen-limiting conditions in continental margin settings provided an environmental barrier that may have affected biogeographic, ecological and evolutionary development of early metazoan communities.

In this paper, the changes of probabilities in different wind ranges and probability distribution of SWS from 1970 to 2011 were studied. The results show: (1) The annual mean SWS declined at a rate of -0.15 m s(-1) decade(-1), meanwhile, the monthly mean variation of probabilities for six wind ranges showed a bimodal fluctuation. (2) The long-term trends of probabilities of 0.3-1.5 m s(-1) and 1.6-3.3 m s(-1) increased, while the probabilities of 3.4-5.4 m s(-1) 5.5-7.9 m s(-1), and >= 8.0 m s(-1) declined over the 42-year period. (3) The probability of SWS beyond 3.0 m s(-1) was lower in large city than that in small city, meanwhile, the probability density function curves in similar sized city in different climate zones were not consistent, which implied that the probability distribution of SWS could be affected by both urbanization and climate characteristics.

Concurrently, a set of heat conduction models, which is used to derive a theoretical equation for describing the relationship between T-D and T-S, has been well constructed. It indicates that the temperate difference Delta T (Delta T = T-D - T-S) increase with the decrease of chamber vacuum, while decrease with the reduction of distance between the tungsten heater and sample holder. Our calculated results based on the theoretical equation can be well agreed with the experimental data in the temperature range of 600-1000 K, but exhibit a deviation with experimental ones below 600 K. In this article, the reason for inducing the temperature deviations between experiment and theoretical calculation has been well elucidated. Our work provides a useful technique to understand the basis of temperature deviation in general heating and thermal conduction systems, at the same time, presents a simple and practicable method to correct this deviation.

Light rain reduction over past 30years mainly happened in partly cloudy weather, which accounted for 84% of the decrease of total light rain days and amount in the warm seasons over Eastern China during the period 1979-2009. The primary cause of the significant reduction of light rain in partly cloudy weather was the relative humidity decrease in the low troposphere, which was induced by both the air temperature increase and water vapour content (WVC) decrease, while warming played a much more important role compared with the WVC in the change of light rain in most regions of Eastern China.

Follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) has been reported to promote cellular metabolism and survival. FSTL1 has been revealed to be highly expressed in adult kidney tissues, and high FSTL1 levels have been reported in mouse and human serum samples; however, the roles of FSTL1 in the regulation of kidney function remain to be elucidated. In the present study, FSTL1 was demonstrated to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of FSTL1 were also investigated and the results suggested that FSTL1 may exert its actions through the modulation of Akt signaling. In addition, FSTL1 was revealed to produce no effect on the migratory capabilities of mIMCD3 cells. The results of the present study suggested that FSTL1 may facilitate the formation of tight junctions and regulate their function in renal tubular epithelia.

However, they have been explored with limited success in their biomedical use, and thus a tremendous challenge still exists in the exploration of Te nanoparticles that can treat tumors as an effective anticancer agent. Here, we introduce bifunctional Te nanodots with well-defined nanostructure as an effective anticancer agent for photo-induced synergistic cancer therapy with tumor ablation, which is accomplished using hollow albumin nanocages as a nanoreactor. Under near-infrared light irradiation, Te nanodots can produce effective photothermal conversion, as well as highly reactive oxygen species such as center dot O-2(-) and dismutated center dot OH via a type-I mechanism through direct electron transfer, thereby triggering the potent in vivo hyperthermia and simultaneous intracellular reactive oxygen species at tumors. Moreover, Te nanodots possess perfect resistance to photobleaching, effective cytoplasmic translocation, preferable tumor accumulation, as well as in vivo renal elimination, promoting severe photo-induced cell damage and subsequent synergy between photothermal and photodynamic treatments for tumor ablation. These findings provide the insight of elemental Te nanodots for biomedical research.

The prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate the prepared sample is uniform mesoporous black Ti3+/N-TiO2 spheres with high crystallinity of anatase, high surface area of 100 m(2) g(-1), large pore size of 6.5 nm and narrow band gap of 2.11 eV, could be easily controlled with the diameter from 200 to 800 nm. Meanwhile, the photoresponse extends to near-infrared region owing to Ti3+ and N codoping. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation ratio of methyl orange is up to 96% and photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is similar to 150 mu mol h(-1), which are several times higher than that of pristine TiO2. Besides, the possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed. The excellent photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to N and Ti3+ doping resulting in high visible light utilization and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and the mesoporous networks offering more surface active sites.

We comprehensively investigated the fate of QDs with carboxyl terminal functional groups (carboxyl-QDs) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo and larvae subjected to either waterborne exposure or cardiovascular system microinjection. On waterborne exposure, carboxyl-QDs exhibited an intensive adsorption and accumulation in the chorion of embryos, and their predominate target organs were the gill and intestinal tract in larvae. On microinjection, carboxyl-QDs were rapidly delivered into the cardiovascular system and specifically deposited in veins and the capillary network system of zebrafish larvae, but not in the arterial system. Taken together, we found that the exact tissue condition including epidermal structures, mucus secretion and vascular microstructures strongly affected the adsorption, uptake and distribution of carboxyl-QDs in zebrafish. This work highlights the intensive tissue epidermal adsorption and accumulation of carboxyl-QDs and their specific vein and capillary deposition in the cardiovascular system in zebrafish early-life stages.

A new approach integrating hazard, sensitivity, resilience, exposure and risk is developed to assess the VRWR from climate change. Drought is regarded as the key hazard, with its frequency and severity defined using a surface humidity index. Exposure is quantitatively linked with indicators of population and social and economic characteristics using statistical and Geographical Information System (GIS) methodologies. Risk is defined as the product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, while vulnerability is treated as a function of sensitivity and adaptation. Vulnerability and risk in the water resources system in the coming 20 years are assessed for the RCP 4.5 scenario. The results reveal that both hazard and exposure of water resources display strong spatial variation in the study area. High hazard and exposure are found in the northern Tianshan Mountain as well as the eastern part of Hexi Corridor. Water resources are particularly sensitive to variation in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream areas of Hexi Corridor, rivers in Central Asia, headwater streams of Tarim River and most of Chang Tang Plateau. Our assessment shows that there is high vulnerability of and risk to water resources in the study area, especially in the areas of Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and Tarim River. Under the RCP 4.5 climate change scenario, the vulnerability and risk decline over the entire area but remain at a serious level in inland rivers in Hexi Corridor, northern Tianshan Mountain and headwater streams of Tarim River. Thus, these areas are the highest priority for strengthening policy measures to adapt to climate change and reduce exposure and vulnerability and their risk to water resources.

ENSO variability reflected in precipitation oxygen isotopes across the Asian Summer Monsoon region	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						oxygen isotope; precipitation; moisture source; convection; Asian Summer Monsoon; El Niffo Southern Oscillation	TIBETAN PLATEAU; STABLE-ISOTOPES; INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS; WATER ISOTOPES; DELTA-O-18; CONVECTION; CLIMATOLOGY; RECORDS; SPACE	Oxygen isotope signals (delta O-18) from paleo-archives are important proxies for past Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) climate reconstruction. However, causes of interannual variation in the. delta O-18 values of modern precipitation across the ASM region remain in argument. We report interannual delta O-18 variation in southern Tibetan Plateau precipitation based on long-term observations at Lhasa. These data, together with precipitation delta O-18 records from five Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations and two ice core delta O-18 records, were used to define a regional metric of ASM precipitation delta O-18 (ASMOI). Back-trajectory analyses for rainy season precipitation events indicate that moisture sources vary little between years with relatively high and low delta O-18 values, a result that is consistent for the south (Lhasa), southeast (Bangkok), and east ASM regions (Hong Kong). In contrast, delta O-18 values at these three locations are significantly correlated with convection in the estimated source regions and along transport paths. These results suggest that upstream convection, rather than moisture source change, causes interannual variation in ASM precipitation delta O-18 values. Contrasting values of the ASMOI in El Nino and La Nina years reveal a positive isotope-El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) response (e.g., high values corresponding to warm phases), which we interpret as a response, to changes in regional convection. We show that the isotope-ENSO response is amplified at high elevation sites and during La Nifia years. These findings should improve interpretations of paleo-delta O-18 data as a proxy for past ASM variation and provide new opportunities to use data from this region to study paleo-ENSO activity.

However, the strength of this link has rarely been ascertained with real pollinators. We conducted pollinator observations and estimated selection through female fitness on flowering phenology and floral traits between two Primula secundiflora populations. We quantified pollinator-mediated selection by subtracting estimates of selection gradients of plants receiving supplemental hand pollination from those of plants receiving open pollination. There was net directional selection for an earlier flowering start date at populations where the dominant pollinators were syrphid flies, and flowering phenology was also subjected to stabilized quadratic selection. However, a later flowering start date was significantly selected at populations where the dominant pollinators were legitimate (normal pollination through the corolla tube entrance) and illegitimate bumblebees (abnormal pollination through nectar robbing hole which located at the corolla tube), and flowering phenology was subjected to disruptive quadratic selection. Wider corolla tube entrance diameter was selected at both populations. Furthermore, the strength of net directional selection on flowering start date and corolla tube entrance diameter was stronger at the population where the dominant pollinators were syrphid flies. Pollinator-mediated selection explained most of the between-population variations in the net directional selection on flowering phenology and corolla tube entrance diameter. Our results suggested the important influence of pollinator-mediated selection on floral evolution. Variations in pollinator assemblages not only resulted in variation in the direction of selection but also the strength of selection on floral traits.

The synthesis mechanism of hollow CuS@MoS2 microcubes is based on the transformation from Cu2O to CuS and the precipitation formation of MoS2 at the same time. The hollow microspheres are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. CuS@MoS2 hollow microcbues can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 912 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a specific density of 500 mA g(-1), and maintain good rate capability from 500 to 4000 mA g(-1). This hollow frame contributes greatly for the alleviation of mechanical stress during electrochemical cycling, and buffers volume change of active materials. Meanwhile, hollow structure shortens the diffusion distance of lithium ions, and thus is beneficial for its rate performance. Furthermore, hybrid materials are also a valid way to improve the electrochemical property of transition metals sulfides. Therefore, the prepared CuS@MoS2 microcubes present enhanced electrochemical performance. The reported strategy is general, fast and can also be possibly applied for the fabrication of other advanced hollow materials used in the energy and environmental filed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We establish the spatial and temporal controls on erosion and sediment transport in the modern Tibetan rain shadow. The Hotan River drains the North Kunlun block and is characterized by zircon populations at 160-230 Ma and 370-520 Ma. The -Yarkand River shares these grains with the Hotan, but also has a very prominent zircon population at 40-160 Ma, which is common in Karakoram basement, indicating heavy sediment flux from these ranges to that drainage. This implies a strong control on erosion by topographic steepness and precipitation mediated through glaciation. Our zircon data confirm earlier studies that indicated that the Taklimakan sand is derived from both the Kunlun and Pamir Mountains. AFT ages are younger in the Hotan River than in the Kashgar River, which drains the Pamir, and in both are younger than in the Transhimalaya and parts of the western edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Exhumation is estimated at similar to 1000 m/m. y. in the North Kunlun and similar to 500 m/m. y. in the eastern Pamir, which have been exhuming more slowly than the western ranges in the recent past. Holocene aggradation terracing was dated using quartz optically stimulated luminescence methods and is mostly associated with times of fluctuating climate after 4 ka, with phases of valley filling dated at 2.6, 1.4, and 0.4 ka. The heights and volumes of the terraces show that sediment storage in the mountains is not a significant buffer to sediment transport, in contrast to the more monsoonal Indus system directly to the south. South of the Mazatag Ridge a significant eolian deposit accumulated similar to 500 yr ago, but this has been deflated in more recent times. Comparison of the modern river data with those previously measured from Cenozoic foreland sedimentary rocks shows that no sediment similar to that of the modern Yarkand River is seen in the geologic record, which is inferred to be younger than 11 Ma, and probably much less. Uplift of the North Kunlun had started by ca. 17 Ma, somewhat after that of the Pamir and Songpan Garze of northwestern Tibet, dated to before 24 Ma. Sediment from the Kunlun reached the foreland basin between 14 and 11 Ma. North Kunlun exhuma-tion accelerated before 3.7 Ma, likely linked to faster rock uplift.

As the most typical DL model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieves outstand performance for big RS data classification. Recently, a variant of CNN, dubbed canonical correlation analysis network (CCANet), was proposed to abstract the two-view image features. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark databases validate the effectiveness of CCANet. However, the CCANet structure is powerless when the observations arrive from more than two sources. To serve the multiview purpose, in this letter, we propose multiview CCANets (MCCANets). Particularly, the MCCANet model learns the stacked multiperspective filter banks by the MCCA method and builds a deep convolutional structure. In the output stage, the binarization and the blockwise histogram are employed as nonlinear processing and feature pooling, respectively. To access the effectiveness of the MCCANet, we conduct a host of experiments on the RSSCN7 RS database. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the MCCANet outperforms the two-view CCANet.

The Development of Artificial Life and Its Relationship with Artificial Intelligence	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Artificial Life		Artificial life (also known as AL) is an interdisciplinary study of life-like processes that applies the synthetic methodology instead of analysis methodology to observe the living process of living systems in the artificial environment and make the essential property of emergent behaviors clear. Meanwhile, artificial life is also a field of living system research which is jointly associated with biology, life science, computer science, and philosophy. In addition, the nature of artificial life is not only established on the study of "life-as-we-know-it", but also that of "life-as-it-might-be". In that, the fundamental property of natural living systems can be effectively discovered by the comprehensive process based on "life-as-it-might-be".

A new, cheap and robust support (i.e. hydrotalcite-activated carbon composite, HT-AC) was prepared by physical milling of home-made HT and commercial AC, which required using less chemical consumption and simpler chemical protocol. Au/HT-AC catalyst showed superior catalytic performance for aerobic oxidation of HMF in water under mild conditions compared to Au/HT and Au/AC catalysts, respectively. It was found that the HT-AC support with the optimal ratio (2:1 in mass ratio) significantly enhanced FDCA yield and catalytic stability. After 12 hat 100 degrees C, 99.5% FDCA yield was achieved using O-2 at 0.5 MPa. Moreover, 99% FDCA yield was obtained using air as oxidant after 18 h. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable stability during recycling up to six times. The influence of different reaction parameters was studied and optimized. Furthermore, the properties of catalysts were characterized by ICP-MS, N-2 isotherms, XRD, XPS and TEM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the pathophysiology of PTB is not well-understood. We tested the hypothesis that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the placenta-derived MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) could disrupt placental development and hence result in PTB. Nineteen selected SNPs in MICA were genotyped in a case-control study of 127 premature infants and 634 term controls in a Chinese Han population. We found that significantly increased PTB risk was associated with homozygosity for the A variant of rs2256318 (adjusted odds ratio = 6.97 and 95% confidence interval = 2.34-20.74 for A/A, compared with G/G genotype, P = 0.001). In addition, the A/A genotype of rs2256318 was associated with decreased placental weight of neonates (beta = -25.331; P = 0.033). Furthermore, stratified analysis demonstrated that the A/A genotype of rs2256318 was associated with increased PTB risk in female group. In addition, we observed statistical interaction between the polymorphism rs2516448 and sex (P = 0.04). No significant differences in the distribution of haplotypes between cases and controls were detected. Our results indicate that the polymorphism of rs2256318 in MICA may contribute to the etiology of PTB through interfering with placental development. These findings need to be further validated in larger and multi-ethnic populations.

The complete genome of QHHSV-1 is composed of a circular double-stranded DNA of 37,270 base pairs in length, with 66.8% G+C content and 69 putative open reading frames (ORFs), which were classified into five functional groups, including morphogenesis, replication/regulation, packaging, lysis and lysogeny. A putative Cro repressor gene and an integrase gene were found in the genome, showing that QHHSV-1 may utilize a lambda-like repression system under unfavorable conditions. QHHSV-1 is the first report of the whole genome sequence of the virulent Halomonas phage belonging to the family Siphoviridae.

However, few studies have been performed on the phylogenetic relationships and biosynthetic potential of actinomycetes across lichen species. In the present study, a total of 213 actinomycetes strains were isolated from 35 lichen samples (22 lichen genera) collected in Yunnan Province, China. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed an unexpected level of diversity among these isolates, which were distributed into 38 genera, 19 families, and 9 orders within the Actinobacteria phylum. The detailed taxa of isolates had no clear relationship to the taxonomic affiliations of the associated lichens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the isolation of Actinophytocola, Angustibacter, Herbiconiux, Kibdelosporangium, Kineosporia, Kitasatospora, Nakamurella, Nonomuraea, Labedella, Lechevalieria, Lentzea, Schumannella, and Umezawaea species from lichens. At least 40 isolates (18.78%) are likely to represent novel actinomycetes taxa within 15 genera. In addition, all 213 isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity and screened for genes associated with secondary metabolite production to evaluate their biosynthetic potential. These results demonstrate that the lichens of Yunnan Province represent an extremely rich reservoir for the isolation of a significant diversity of actinomycetes, including novel species, which are potential source for discovering biologically active compounds.

Since the industrial revolution, the expansion of construction land has profoundly changed the status of land use coverage and changes. This study is proposed to reconstruct the spatial pattern of construction land (urban construction land and rural settlement land) for five historical periods over the past 200 years in Jiangsu Province with 200 m x 200 m grids on the basis of quantitative estimation. Urban construction land is estimated based on data about city walls, four gates along walls, and other socio-economic factors. Rural settlement land is calculated based on the rural population and per capita housing allowance. The spatial pattern of historical construction land is simulated based on the distribution of modern construction land in 1985 with a quantitative-boundarysuitability control method and thorough consideration over connectivity of different land use types. The study concludes that: (1) the amount of construction land in Jiangsu Province is estimated at 963.46 km(2) in 1820, 1043.46 km(2) in 1911, 1672.40 km(2) in 1936, 1980.34 km(2) in 1952 and 10,687.20 km(2) in 1985; and (2) the spatial distribution of construction land features the great proclivity to water bodies and main roads and the strong polarization of existent residence. The results are verified directly and indirectly by applying the trend verification of construction land changes and patterns, the correlation analysis between rural settlement land and local arable land, and quantitative accuracy test of the reconstructed construction land to actual historical survey maps covering four sample regions in 1936.

J	Yang, Y; Li, ZZ; Wang, W; Tao, DP				Yang, Yun; Li, Zongze; Wang, Wei; Tao, Dapeng			An adaptive semi-supervised clustering approach via multiple density-based information	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Density-based clustering; Constraint-based clustering; Constraint information	CONSTRAINTS	Since multimedia information has been dramatically increasing, multimedia data mining has drawn much more attentions than ever. As one of important mining tasks, clustering provided underpinning techniques for discovering the intrinsic structure and condensing information over large amount of multimedia data. Although many approaches have been proposed to improve performance and accuracy of clustering process in semi-supervised learning way, they are still quite sensitive to the assumptions of cluster structures and algorithm parameters setups. In this paper, we propose an adaptive semi-supervised clustering approach via multiple density-based information. It can automatically determine sets of important density-based parameters in use of both labeled and unlabeled data. Based on the different sets of density-based parameters, our approach is able to adaptively identify complex cluster structures in different size, shape and density without knowing the number of clusters; moreover, it is quite insensitive to the noise. Our approach has been generally evaluated on synthetic data and a collection of benchmark data sets, and yields promising clustering results.

Rhododendron rex Levl. is a perennial woody species from the family Ericaceae and an endangered plant with high ornamental value endemic to Southwestern China. Nevertheless, the genetic and genomic information of R. rex remain unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing for R. rex leaf samples, and generated large transcript sequences for functional characterization and development gene-associated SSR markers. A total of 164,242 unigenes were assembled and 115,089 (70.07%) unigenes were successfully annotated in public databases. In addition, a total of 15,314 potential EST-SSRs were identified, and the frequency of SSRs in the R. rex unigenes was 9.32%, with an average of one EST-SSR per 5.65 kb. The most abundant type was repeated di-nucleotide (54.63%), followed by mono-(26.03%) and tri-nucleotide (18.51%) repeats. Based on the SSR-containing sequence, 100 primer pairs were randomly selected and synthesized and used for assessment of the polymorphism. Thirty-six primer pairs were polymorphic and revealed polymorphism among 20 individuals from four R. rex populations. A total of 197 alleles were identified, with an average of 5.472 alleles per locus. The Polymorphism Information Content ranged from 0.154 to 0.870, with a mean of 0.482. The newly developed EST-SSR markers exhibited high transferability (58.33-83.33%) among the six subgenera. Thus, these novel EST-SSR markers developed would provide valuable sequence resources for population structure, genetic diversity analysis, and genetic resource assessments of R. rex and its related species.

Here, we conduct morphological and transcriptomic response of endophytic fungus (Aspergillus montevidensis ZYD4) in both the presence and absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, the colony morphology of the A. montevidensis ZYD4 changed drastically and exhibited decreased colony pigmentation. Extensive conidiophores development was observed under salt stress; conidiophores rarely developed in the absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, yellowcleistotheciumformation was inhibited, while glycerol and compatible sugars continued to accumulate. Among differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs), 733 of them were up-regulated while 1,619 unigenes were down-regulated. We discovered that genes involved in the accumulation of glycerol, the storage of compatible sugars, organic acids, pigment production, and asexual sporulation were differentially regulated under salt stress. These results provide further understanding of the molecular basis of osmoadaptive mechanisms of halophilic endophytic fungi.

ALMA Observations of the Archetypal "Hot Core" That Is Not: Orion-KL	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						evolution; ISM: jets and outflows; ISM: molecules; stars: formation	SUBMILLIMETER ARRAY; APERTURE SYNTHESIS; LINE; REGION	We present sensitive high angular resolution (similar to 0"-0"3) continuum Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the archetypal hot core located in the Orion Kleinmann-Low (KL) region. The observations were made in five different spectral bands (bands 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9) covering a very broad range of frequencies (149-658 GHz). Apart from the well-known millimeter emitting objects located in this region (Orion Source I and BN), we report the first submillimeter detection of three compact continuum sources (ALMA1-3) in the vicinities of the Orion-KL hot molecular core. These three continuum objects have spectral indices between 1.47 and 1.56, and brightness temperatures between 100 and 200 K at 658 GHz, suggesting that we are seeing moderate, optically thick dust emission with possible grain growth. However, as these objects are not associated with warm molecular gas, and some of them are farther out from the molecular core, we thus conclude that they cannot heat the molecular core. This result favors the hypothesis that the hot molecular core in Orion-KL core is heated externally.	[Orozco-Aguilera, M.

Discovery of Two New Hypervelocity Stars from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Surveys	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Galaxy: center; Galaxy: halo; Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics; stars: early-type	GALACTIC HALO; BLACK-HOLE; ORIGIN; MASS; EJECTION; MILKY	We report the discovery of two new unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs) from the LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. They are, respectively, a B2V-type star of similar to 7M(circle dot) with a Galactic rest-frame radial velocity of 502 km s(-1) at a Galactocentric radius of similar to 21 kpc and a B7V-type star of similar to 4M(circle dot) with a Galactic rest-frame radial velocity of 408 km s-1 at a Galactocentric radius of similar to 30 kpc. The origins of the two HVSs are not clear given their currently poorly measured proper motions. However, the future data releases of Gaia should provide proper motion measurements accurate enough to solve this problem. The ongoing LAMOST spectroscopic surveys are expected to yield more HVSs to form a statistical sample, providing vital constraints on understanding the nature of HVSs and their ejection mechanisms.

Much of beetle speciosity is attributable to myriad life habits, particularly diverse-feeding strategies involving interactions with plant substrates, such as wood. However, the life habits and early evolution of wood-boring beetles remain shrouded in mystery from a limited fossil record. Here we report new material from the upper Permian (Changhsingian Stage, ca. 254-252 million-years ago) of China documenting a microcosm of ecological associations involving a polyphagan wood-borer consuming cambial and wood tissues of the conifer Ningxiaites specialis. This earliest evidence for a component community of several trophically interacting taxa is frozen in time by exceptional preservation. The combination of an entry tunnel through bark, a cambium mother gallery, and up to 11 eggs placed in lateral niches-from which emerge multi-instar larval tunnels that consume cambium, wood and bark-is ecologically convergent with Early Cretaceous bark-beetle borings 120 million-years later.

In this paper a detailed geochemical and mineralogical record of these changes is presented from a distal alluvial fan sedimentary sequence in the northern Weihe Basin. We established that, in addition to glacial-interglacial variation, there are three distinctly different units deposited over the past 1 m.y. These units are the result of variations in the overall tectonic regime in the northern Weihe Basin. Fine-grained detrital minerals were predominantly delivered during colder climatic periods, whereas evaporative minerals were dominantly deposited during the warmer, interglacial periods, probably as a result of strong seasonal contrast. This compositional variation demonstrates the importance of climate control on hinterland erosion, surface runoff, chemical weathering and evaporation. Al-normalized ratios of indicative major elements relative to average loess composition, indicate important variations in sedimentary processes, mostly related to sediment flux. Si-enrichment is an index for past flooding events, while Fe enrichment, just like K and Ti, reflects influx of clays. In contrast, Ca and Mn are strongly enriched throughout the core, associated with the authigenic precipitation of carbonates, especially during interglacial periods. The lower (similar to 1000-690 ka) and upper (similar to 330-0 ka) units of the core are characterized by relative intense and frequent flooding, which coincided with extensive ponding in the study area. In the middle unit (similar to 690-330 ka) increased salinity levels caused by evaporation, as reflected in the high Sr/Ca ratio and dolomite abundance, led to increased carbonate precipitation. Simultaneously, the increased influx of fine sediments indicates increased clay production in the source area as a result of a more intense summer monsoon strength after 600 ka.

Herein, hierarchical structured ferro-cobalt alloyed crystals supported on nitrogen doped activated porous carbon fibers (FeCo2@APCFs) were prepared by a combination of multicomponent electrospinning, activation, and carbonization. Benefiting from the precursor design and activation process, the carbon fibers derived from a PAN/PBZ (polyacrylonitrile/polybenzoxazine) precursor exhibited a tunable porous structure with an ultrahigh specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume of 2085 m(2) g(-1) and 1.12 cm(3) g(-1), respectively. Most importantly, the FeCo2 crystals can be directly synthesized by carbonization at high temperature in a N-2 flow with no other reducing gases. The as-prepared FeCo2@APCFs exhibited robust activation of PMS with reactive oxygen radicals (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot, and O-1(2)) for ultrafast removal of organic pollutants, as well as good stability and recyclability with high total organic carbon (TOC) removal. The catalyst suspended in aqueous solution after catalysis can be easily separated with an external magnet without tedious separation processes. This study is meaningful for the development of novel catalyst carriers or a fascinating strategy for wastewater treatment.

By facilely controlling the doping acid, acidity, and ANI/HA weight ratio during the fabrication, PANI with a controllable doping degree, redox state, and content is grown on halloysite nanotubes. The cyclohexene selective oxidation result shows that PANI@HA nanotubes are effective catalysts in a solvent-free reaction system with H2O2 as the oxidant, and their catalytic activity relies on the doping acid, acidity, and ANI/HA weight ratio in the fabrication. PANI@HA synthesized with HCl as a doping acid to condition the acidity at 1 M and 2.04 ANI/HA weight ratio (PANI@HA/1 M/2.04-HCl) demonstrates highest catalytic activity (98.17% conversion and 99.50% selectivity to 1,2-cyclohexanediol). The cyclohexene selective catalytic activity matches well with the PANI doping degree in PANI@HA. In addition, the optimal reaction condition is 20 mg catalyst, 2.5 mL H2O2, 70 degrees C, and 24 h. Furthermore, PANI@HA/1 M/2.04-HCl exhibits superior dihydroxylation activity toward 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene and cycling performance with 99.11% conversion and 96.92% selectivity to 1,2-cyclohexanediol after five cycles. The CV of PANI@HA indicates that the cyclohexene selective oxidation is attributed to a reversible redox reaction of PANI in PANI@HA for catalytic decomposition of H2O2.

The extremely wide field-of-view, excellent instantaneous (u, v)-coverage and sensitivity to degree-scale structure that the Murchison Widefield Array provides enable instrumental calibration, removal of instrumental artefacts, and correction for ionospheric Faraday rotation through imaging techniques. With the demonstrated polarimetric capabilities of the Murchison Widefield Array, we discuss future directions for polarimetric science at low frequencies to answer outstanding questions relating to polarised source counts, source depolarisation, pulsar science, low-mass stars, exoplanets, the nature of the interstellar and intergalactic media, and the solar environment.

Samples with a fixed sphere diameter but different Au densities are examined. It is demonstrated that strong and characteristic light emission from these samples can be achieved under optical excitation. In a short excitation wavelength regime (280-470 nm), the peak position in the photoemission spectrum increases almost linearly with excitation wavelength. In a relatively longwavelength excitation regime (478-520 nm), photoluminescence (PL) can be observed where the peak position in the PL spectrum depends very little on excitation wavelength and two peaks can be seen in the PL emission spectrum. These effects do not change significantly with varying sample density, although it is found that the intensity of the light emission increases with sample density. We find that the features of the PL emission from foamed gold with micro/nanoscale hollow spheres differ significantly from those observed for Au nanoparticles. This study is relevant to the application of Au micro/nanostructures as advanced optoelectronic materials and devices.

In the past decade, a large number of methods have been proposed for PSSP. In order to learn the latest progress of PSSP, this paper provides a survey on the development of this field. It first introduces the background and related knowledge of PSSP, including basic concepts, data sets, input data features and prediction accuracy assessment. Then, it reviews the recent algorithmic developments of PSSP, which mainly focus on the latest decade. Finally, it summarizes the corresponding tendencies and challenges in this field. This survey concludes that although various PSSP methods have been proposed, there still exist several further improvements or potential research directions. We hope that the presented guidelines will help nonspecialists and specialists to learn the critical progress in PSSP in recent years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Traps are developed from vegetative mycelia, but they are quite different from hyphae in both morphological and physiological characteristics. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation have attracted much attention. In this investigation, Arthrobotrys oligospora, a nematode-trapping fungus, has three-dimensional networks and genomics and proteomics were recently performed, so as to reveal the relationship between actin cytoskeleton and trap formation. Both actin staining via FITC-phalloidin and treatment of actin polymerization inhibitor Lat-B illustrated that the actin cytoskeleton played an important role in trap development. Furthermore, absence of the conserved actin-associated protein Crnlp caused a structural defect of traps and failure to infect nematodes. It was observed that mutant Delta crn1 represented a reduced number of rings and a lower complexity of three-dimensional networks, likely due to the disturbance of actin branching. Collectively, our study confirmed the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton as well as the conserved actin-associated protein Crnlp in trap formation. It further suggested the manners in which Crnlp influences the development of three-dimensional networks in A. oligospora. (C) 2017 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Wang, Z; Bader, MY; Liu, X; Zhu, ZM; Bao, WK				Wang, Zhe; Bader, Maaike Y.; Liu, Xin; Zhu, Zhangming; Bao, Weikai			Comparisons of photosynthesis-related traits of 27 abundant or subordinate bryophyte species in a subalpine old-growth fir forest	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						adaptation; competition; dominance; ecophysiology; feather moss; functional traits; gas exchange; growth form	LEAF ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; SCALING RELATIONSHIPS; LIGHT RESPONSES; MOSSES; ECOLOGY; POLYTRICHACEAE; UNDERSTORY; DYNAMICS; FORMOSUM; NITROGEN	Bryophyte communities can exhibit similar structural and taxonomic diversity as vascular plant communities, just at a smaller scale. Whether the physiological diversity can be similarly diverse, and whether it can explain local abundance patterns is unknown, due to a lack of community-wide studies of physiological traits. This study re-analyzed data on photosynthesis-related traits (including the nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations, photosynthetic capacities, and photosynthetic nutrient use efficiencies) of 27 bryophyte species in a subalpine old-growth fir forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We explored differences between taxonomic groups and hypothesized that the most abundant bryophyte species had physiological advantages relative to other subdominant species. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the differences among species and trait values of the most abundant and other co-occurring subdominant species. Species from the Polytrichaceae were separated out on both PCA axes, indicating their high chlorophyll concentrations and photosynthetic capacities (axis 1) and relatively high-light requirements (axis 2). Mniaceae species also had relatively high photosynthetic capacities, but their light saturation points were low. In contrast, Racomitrium joseph-hookeri and Lepidozia reptans, two species with a high shoot mass per area, had high-light requirements and low nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations and photosynthetic capacities. The nutrient concentrations, photosynthetic capacities, and photosynthetic nutrient use efficiencies of the most abundant bryophyte species did not differ from co-occurring subdominant species. Our research confirms the links between the photosynthesis-related traits and adaptation strategies of bryophytes. However, species relative abundance was not related to these traits.

From west to east, they are: the Sucuoma (235 +/- 2 Ma), Ajisenduo (224 +/- 2 Ma), Jiaduocuo (218 +/- 1 Ma), Cuojiaoma (219 +/- 1 Ma), Maxionggou (225 +/- 2 Ma), Dongcuo (222 +/- 3 Ma) and Daocheng (220 +/- 2 Ma) plutons. Most of the plutons have granitic compositions and contain high SiO2, Al2O3 and K2O + Na2O, but low MgO, FeO* and CaO contents. They have similar trace element patterns, with depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE, e.g., Nb and Ta) and enrichment in large -ion lithophile elements (LILE, e.g., Rb, Th and U). Samples from the Sucuoma, Jiaduocuo and Dongcuo plutons have similar zircon Hf isotopic compositions (epsilon(Hf)(t) = -1.8 to-03,-3.1 to 0.4 and-4.6 to-1.4, respectively), whereas those from the Ajisenduo pluton exhibit more unradiogenic Hf (epsilon(Nf)(t) =-11.9 to-4.8). Additionally, the Sucuoma pluton has the lowest initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values (0.7060-0.7090) but the least negative epsilon(Nd)(t) (-4.9 to-3.3) values, whereas samples from the Ajisenduo pluton have the highest initial 87Sr/86Sr values (0.7111-0.7160), but the most negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-7.9 and-113). All the samples have similar high radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.6-19.4; (207)pb/(204)pb = 15.7-15.5; Pb-208/Pb-204 = 39.1-40.4). Based on the new geochemical data, it is determined that most of the granitoids are I-type granites and the magma source was a mixture of the metamorphic Kangding Complex, which is considered to be the basement of the western Yangtze Craton, and metasediments from the basement. However, the samples from the Ajisenduo pluton are S-type granites that were derived from partial melting of basement metasediments with only limited components from the Kangding Complex. Together with an evaluation of previously-published work, these new data indicate a dominant magmatic peak at ca. 216 Ma for the Late Triassic granitoids of the YAB and that the ages of Late Triassic magmatism become younger eastward towards the Garle-Litang suture zone. We consider that slab roll-back, with subsequent slab break-off, best explains the origin of these granitic plutons. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The condensation reaction includes two steps: (1) formation of the quinonemethide (QM) intermediate from hydroxymethylresorcinol; (2) Michael addition between the quinonemethide and resorcinol anion. The first step is the rate-determining step. Two mechanisms, unimolecular elimination of the conjugate base (E1cb) and water-aided elimination (WAE), were identified for the formation of QM. The hydroxymethylresorcinol anion produces neutral QM while the dianion produces a quinonemethide anion (QMA). The calculated potential energy barriers suggested that the QMA formation is much more favorable. Although resorcinol-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde condensations share a common mechanism, the former would be faster if the QMA participates in condensations. The potential energy barriers for formation of 2-QM, 4-QM, 6-QM, 2-QMA, and 4-QMA were calculated. The results show that the formations of 6-QM and 4-QMA have relatively lower energy barriers. This rationalized previous experimental observations that the 2,4-(2,6-) and 6,6'-(4,4'-) methylene linkages were dominant, whereas the 2,2'-linkage was almost absent. The resorcinol-phenol-formaldehyde co-condensations were also calculated. The cold-setting characteristic of phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde co-condensed resin can be attributed to participation of resorcinol quinonemethides in condensations.

The magnetic anomalies were compared with other geophysical data such as gravity anomalies, terrestrial heat flow, and seismic activities to reveal similarities and differences and relationships between crustal magnetic anomalies and geological structure. The research results show that the magnetic anomalies are relatively weak in the Sanjiang (Three Rivers) and western Yunnan orogenic belts west of the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe, and Red River fault zones, and relatively strong in the rhombic block. The crustal magnetic anomalies in the study region were mainly generated by the shallow magnetic bodies superposed on the background of weak magnetism basement. The satellite magnetic anomalies show that the central Yunnan depression area has clear dipole field characteristics. The positive and negative magnetic anomaly zones distributed along the Red River fault zonet have consistent strikes with that of the faults. The Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault, the Red River fault, the Kangding-Yiliang-Shuicheng fault and the Mile-Shizong-Shuicheng fault zones surrounding the rhombic block are transition belts between strong and weak magnetic anomalies. The places with active seismicity and the areas with high terrestrial heat flow values have negative or relatively weak crustal magnetic anomalies.

Here, we explore the feasibility of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) screening method specifically for the Dai people. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from Dai people for premarital screening. Double-blind, parallel hemoglobinopathy screening was conducted using both traditional hematological methods (red cell indexes and hemoglobin electrophoresis, then DNA sequencing) and an NGS approach. Results: Among 951 tested individuals, we found a thalassemia carrier rate of 49.5% (471/951) using the NGS screen, in contrast to 22.0% (209/951) found using traditional methods. Almost 74.8% (217/290) of alpha-thalassemia carriers and 30.5% (25/82) of composite alpha- and beta-thalassemia carriers were missed by traditional screens. The proportion of such alpha- and beta-thalassemia carriers among the Dai people is 8.6% (82/951). For beta-thalassemia carriers, the high ratio (66/99) of CD26 mutations may suggest a correlation between CD26 and the environmental adaption of the Dai people. Conclusions: Methodological comparisons demonstrate the superiority of NGS for both sensitivity and specificity, provide a comprehensive assessment of thalassemia screening strategies, and indicate that NGS is a competitive screening method, especially among populations with a high prevalence of disease.

The study was conducted at five selected spots along Lashihai Lake at the same time each week from August 2011 to September 2013. In total, 62 waterbird species were recorded, of which 38.71%, 35.48%, 16.13%, and 9.68% were winter migrants, passage visitors, residents, and summer migrants, respectively. We found important seasonal changes in waterbird species composition and population size. Waterbird species richness was highest from September to the following April, with the total species numbers peaking in December. Total individual numbers peaked twice from late November to early December and mid-to-late February. However, waterbird species and individual numbers were comparatively lower from May to August. The change in species composition was determined by the arrival and departure dynamics of winter migrants and passage visitors. Winter migrants primarily caused the periodic changes in population size. Of concern, species and overall waterbird numbers seemed to be lower than the numbers in historical records. The decline of waterbird numbers implies that environmental changes caused by the implementation of the dam upstream of Lashihai Lake may have had adverse effects on this waterbird population. This study confirms the existence of major seasonal changes in species composition and size of the waterbird population at Lashihai Lake.

The woods of both species are characterized by gradual transition from early wood to late wood, predominantly uniseriate pitting in the tracheid walls, the absence of axial parenchyma and traumatic resin canals, the presence of axial and radial resin ducts, uniseriate rays, smooth to slightly pitted ray tracheids and pinoid/taxodioid pits in cross-field pits. They differ in that P uniseriata wood has unisetiate marginal ray tracheids and taxodioid (occasionally cupressoid) pits whereas P nanfengensis wood has ray tracheids usually arranged as biseriate, as well as pinoid and taxodioid cross-field pits. The fossil woods showed a considerable anatomical similarity to extant species P bungeana and P roxburghii, respectively, which are now absent from central Yunnan. Pinus uniseriata is the first macrofossil record for subsection Gerardianae. Pinus nanfengensis is the first fossil record of the subsection Pinaster outside Europe.

However, little work has been done to determine the key endophytes and their associated functions that benefit or harm plant growth or protect the host from pathogens at the community level. In this study, we attempted to identify plant growth-promoting endophytes within the bacterial groups identified as part of the core tomato root microbiome. In total, 49 bacterial endophytic strains, identified as members of the phyla of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were picked and isolated from tomato roots on selected media. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using the 16S rRNA gene sequences that were obtained from the isolated bacterial endophytes and the core OTUs of the previously published tomato root microbiome. The results indicated that the isolates clustered into groups of the orders Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, and Xanthomonadales, representing the majority of the Proteobacterial groups of tomato root endophytes, in addition to the phylum Firmicutes. In vitro bioassays showed that most strains (31 of the 49 isolated endophytic strains) showed antagonistic activity against the tested microbial targets, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. Most of the endophytic isolates with antimicrobial activities were from the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas. However, few of the identified active strains clustered with the core endophytic groups. In experiments to assess the ability of endophytes to promote the growth of wheat plants in vivo, almost all the isolated tomato root endophytic strains demonstrated an ability to promote plant growth. Four strains were shown to produce IAA when grown in medium containing Ltryptophan. The IAA-producing Pseudomonas spp. closely clustered with the most abundant Pseudomonadales OTU, which harbored an intact IAA synthesis pathway using the precursor tryptophan. Eighteen identified nitrogen-fixing endophytes were primarily Bacillus and Rhizobium species. The results suggested that in tomato root endophytes, most of the tested plant host-benefiting traits were derived from bacteria of three genera, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Rhizobium. Bacillus strains have great taxonomic and functional potential to explore as biological agents that contribute" diverse nutrient acquisition and growth promotion activities to their hosts. As one of the most predominant groups in the healthy tomato root endophytic microbiome, the majority of Pseudomonas spp. showed the most promising potential in promoting plant growth, while other species demonstrated their ability as biological control agents, especially for the fungal targets.

After the fermentation process, tea polyphenols are oxidized by polyphenol oxidase to form oxidized tea polyphenols (OTPs). OTPs contain a significant amount of hydrophobic phenyl groups that can bind with non-aqueous materials. Here, we determined whether OTPs can bind with lipids and reduce fat uptake and assessed the effect of OTPs on decreasing obesity and alleviating hyperlipidaemia and other metabolic syndromes. Methods Rats were divided into three groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD) and OTP groups. The control and HFD groups were fed a chow diet and a high-fat diet, respectively, for 12 weeks; the OTP group was fed a high-fat diet for 6 weeks and then a high-fat diet containing 2 % OTP for 6 weeks. The serum and excrement triglyceride (TAG) and total cholesterol (CHOL) concentrations were determined, and liver tissue and white adipose tissue were collected to detect the expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Results Our results revealed that OTPs failed to decrease the serum concentrations of TAG and CHOL. OTPs alleviated the accumulation of lipids in the liver tissue and changed the expression levels of the regulators of lipid metabolism, i.e., peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (ppars), compared with the rats fed a high-fat diet alone. We also observed a significantly decreased reduction of weight in the visceral white adipose, enhanced regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation by PPARa and enhanced biosynthesis of mitochondria in the visceral white adipose of the OTP rats compared with the HFD rats. Additionally, OTPs promoted the excretion of lipids. Conclusion Our results suggest that OTPs alleviate the accumulation of lipids in liver and visceral white adipose tissue and promote lipid excretion in rats in vivo.

In this work, we explored potential biomedical applications of graphene oxide (GO) by systematically studying antibacterial capacity of GO in both macrophages and animal models. Three types of bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and P. aeruginosa (Pa) were used for in vitro study. Kp was also selected as a representative multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterium for in vivo study. In in vitro study, GO effectively eradicated Kp in agar dishes and thus protected alveolar macrophages (AM) from Kp infection in the culture. In the in vivo evaluation, GO were introduced intranasally into mouse lungs followed by testing organ tissue damage including lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) penetration, bacterial dissemination, and mortality in Kp-infected mice. We found that GO can prohibit the growth and spread of Kp both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significantly increased cell survival rate, less tissue injury, subdued inflammatory response, and prolonged mice survival. These findings indicate that GO could be a promising biomaterial for effectively controlling MDR pathogens. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditionally, wetlands are preserved by establishing nature reserves within them. However, the driving forces of estuarine wetland degradation change at different temporal and spatial scales, rendering it necessary to evaluate the entire river delta wetland system. We analyzed the links between management of the Yellow River (YR) and estuarine wetland conservation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We measured changes in river runoff and sediment discharge from 1950, and spatial changes in the tail channels from 1855. Changes in the wetland areas of the entire delta, the natural reserves, and the river buffer areas were calculated. Finally, the effects of ecological water supplementation of the YR, mandated in 2008 by the Chinese government to protect estuarine wetlands, were also analyzed. The results indicated that not only the reductions in river runoff and sediment discharge, but also shifts in the tail channels, influenced estuarine wetlands. In addition, ecological water supplementation from the YR have improved wetland health. We suggest that increasing the connectivity between old and new rivers is important to improve the integrity of estuarine wetland ecosystems. Linking river management to estuarine wetland conservation would aid in the planning and improvement of the wetland network in the delta. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, JY; Wilf, P; Ding, ST; An, PC; Dai, J				Wu, Jing-Yu; Wilf, Peter; Ding, Su-Ting; An, Peng-Cheng; Dai, Jing			LATE MIOCENE CYCLOCARYA (JUGLANDACEAE) FROM SOUTHWEST CHINA AND ITS BIOGEOGRAPHIC IMPLICATIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						biogeography; Cyclocarya; Juglandaceae; Miocene; southwest China; winged fruits	LATE PLIOCENE; WEST YUNNAN; LEAVES; ILJINSKAJA; EVOLUTION; CLIMATES; PROVINCE; EOCENE; FRUITS; UPLIFT	Premise of research. Cyclocarya Iljinskaya (Juglandaceae) is a genus with a single living species that is endemic to central and south China. The genus has an abundant North American and Eurasian fossil record from the Paleocene to the Pliocene, documenting its spread across Europe to western Siberia during the Oligocene and its arrival in Japan by the Miocene. However, there have been no fossil occurrences of Cyclocarya near its modern distribution. In this study, we describe a new species of Cyclocarya from the upper Miocene Nanlin Formation in Lianghe County, western Yunnan Province, southwest China, and discuss its biogeographic implications. Methodology. We examined the fossil fruit using LM and SEM, and we compared its morphology with fruits of fossil Cyclocarya and extant Cyclocarya paliurus (Batalin) Iljinsk. Pivotal results. The fossil fruit of Cyclocarya simipaliurus sp. nov. consists of a small nutlet that is surrounded by a circular and flange-like wing. The nutlet is circular in plan view and oblate in longitudinal view. Nutlet structure and the epidermal characteristics of the wing indicate that this fossil fruit is almost identical to that of the extant species, C. paliurus. Conclusions. The specimen reported here is the only reliable fossil of Cyclocarya known from China. The new fossil species helps to fill a significant gap in the fossil record of Cyclocarya, indicating that the genus had reached the western most boundary of its modern distribution by the late Miocene. Western Yunnan had a warm and humid climate during the late Neogene, and the rapid uplift of the Yunnan Plateau began in the Pliocene. Pleistocene glaciations may have forced Cyclocarya to retreat from western Yunnan, and the uplifted mountains and deep river valleys might have posed barriers for reconnection during the interglacials.

XRD, TEM, XPS, and N-2 adsorption/desorption were used to characterize the composition, morphology, and BET surface area of as-prepared sample, respectively. The analysis results indicated that the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles with spinel structure were successfully obtained. The NiCo2O4 sample was prepared into supercapacitors electrode materials. At room temperature, the electrode materials were investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging-discharging in a 6 mol L-1 KOH aqueous electrolyte. Three-electrode systems, in which Hg/HgCl was employed as reference electrode, were used. The NiCo2O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 717.9 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Moreover, the specific capacitance remained 84% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles under the current density of 10 A g(-1).

The Curie surface is compared with regional heat flow, the Moho, and seismicity. The results show that the magnetic anomaly and Curie surface are both consistent with the regional tectonic setting. Tarim craton, Tadjik Basin, and Indian Plate have positive magnetic anomaly and a Curie surface deeper than 36 km, corresponding to low heat flow there. In contrast, orogenic belts such as west Himalayan syntaxis, Tianshan Mountain, Afghanistan, and Tibetan Plateau have negative anomaly and a Curie surface shallower than 32 km, corresponding to high heat flow. The north of the syntaxis presents a positive anomaly on the surface, resulting from Ferghana Basin, while the negative anomaly in large depth is probably associated with the subduction of the slab and the resulting heat. The depth of the Curie surface has an inverse relationship to the Moho depth, which is attributed to temperature and isostatic balance. The distribution of earthquakes with epicenter deeper than 100 km clearly suggests the subduction of the Indian plate deep down to the asthenosphere and the deep earthquakes were caused by shear motion within the subducting slab.

A focusing mistake may produce out-of-focus blur, which seriously degrades the expressive force of the video. In this paper, we propose a patch-based method to remove the out-of-focus blur of a video and build an all-in-focus video. We assume that the out-of-focus blurry region in one frame will be clear in a portion of other frames; thus, the clear corresponding regions can be used to reconstruct the blurry one. We divide each video frame into a grid of patches and track each patch in the surrounding frames. We independently reconstruct each video frame by building a Markov random field model to identify the optimal target patches that are sharp, similar to the original patches, and are coherent with their neighboring patches within the overlapped regions. To recover an all-in-focus video, an iterative framework is utilized, in which the reconstructed video of each iteration is substituted in the next iteration. Finally, we employ the idea of a bilateral filter to temporally smooth the reconstructed video. The experimental results and the comparison with the previous works demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

J	Hong, RC; Li, L; Cai, JJ; Tao, DP; Wang, M; Tian, Q				Hong, Richang; Li, Lei; Cai, Junjie; Tao, Dapeng; Wang, Meng; Tian, Qi			Coherent Semantic-Visual Indexing for Large-Scale Image Retrieval in the Cloud	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Search; hypergraph; attribute-assisted; cloud computing; distributed system		The rapidly increasing number of images on the internet has further increased the need for efficient indexing for digital image searching of large databases. The design of a cloud service that provides high efficiency but compact image indexing remains challenging, partly due to the well-known semantic gap between user queries and the rich semantics of large-scale data sets. In this paper, we construct a novel joint semantic-visual space by leveraging visual descriptors and semantic attributes, which narrows the semantic gap by combining both attributes and indexing into a single framework. Such a joint space embraces the flexibility of coherent semantic-visual indexing, which employs binary codes to boost retrieval speed while maintaining accuracy. To solve the proposed model, we make the following contributions. First, we propose an interactive optimization method to find the joint semantic and visual descriptor space. Second, we prove convergence of our optimization algorithm, which guarantees a good solution after a certain number of iterations. Third, we integrate the semantic-visual joint space system with spectral hashing, which finds an efficient solution to search up to billion-scale data sets. Finally, we design an online cloud service to provide a more efficient online multimedia service. Experiments on two standard retrieval datasets (i.e., Holidays1M, Oxford5K) show that the proposed method is promising compared with the current state-of-the-art and that the cloud system significantly improves performance.

The accurate, reliable and complementary descriptions of the scene in fused images make these techniques be widely used in various fields. In recent years, a large number of fusion methods for IR and VI images have been proposed due to the ever-growing demands and the progress of image representation methods; however, there has not been published an integrated survey paper about this field in last several years. Therefore, we make a survey to report the algorithmic developments of IR and VI image fusion. In this paper, we first characterize the IR and VI image fusion based applications to represent an overview of the research status. Then we present a synthesize survey of the state of the art. Thirdly, the frequently-used image fusion quality measures are introduced. Fourthly, we perform some experiments of typical methods and make corresponding analysis. At last, we summarize the corresponding tendencies and challenges in IR and VI image fusion. This survey concludes that although various IR and VI image fusion methods have been proposed, there still exist further improvements or potential research directions in different applications of IR and VI image fusion.

In this study, we developed a method for scarless and precise modification of large gene clusters by using RecET/RED-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting combined with Gibson assembly. In this strategy, the biosynthetic genes for peptidyl moieties (HPHT) in the nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster were replaced with those for carbamoylpolyoxamic acid (CPOAA) from the polyoxin biosynthetic gene cluster to generate a similar to 40 kb hybrid gene cluster in Escherichia coli with a reusable targeting cassette. The reconstructed cluster was introduced into Streptomyces lividans TK23 for heterologous expression and the expected hybrid antibiotic, polynik A, was obtained and verified. This study provides an efficient strategy for gene cluster reconstruction and modification that could be applied in synthetic biology and combinatory biosynthesis to synthesize novel bioactive metabolites or to improve antibiotic production.

Hence, we chose GeSe monolayer as the object to embellish and modify. Using density functional theory calculations, we have investigated its tunable electronic and magnetic properties via absorbing light non-metallic atom (H, F, CI). From our study, we can see that, in H adatom-decorated system, the electronic property of GeSe monolayer can be effectively manipulated, and keeps the direct band-gap in most situations. H adatom-decorated structures have dilute magnetic states. Most of them cause a bipolar semiconducting behavior, while the rest owns a spin-gapless-semiconducting feature. For most of the F and CI adatom-decorated systems, they own p-type semiconducting feature. Meanwhile, the magnetism appears only in F adatom-decorated D-Se structure. These results demonstrate that the decoration for GeSe is an available approach to tune its electronic and magnetic properties. After the modification, the GeSe monolayer shows desirable potential in the application of spintronics and optoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

NOV.; SOIL; DNA; ACTINOBACTERIUM; HYBRIDIZATION; LIKELIHOOD; SEQUENCES; STRAINS; TREES	A novel strain, 1433(T), was isolated from leaves of Chinese red pepper (Huajiao, Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim) collected from Gansu province in northwestern China, and was characterised by a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain 1433(T) were observed to be Gram-stain positive, aerobic, asporogenous, rod shaped, motile and to have peritrichous flagella. The strain was observed to grow at a range of temperatures and pH, 4-45 A degrees C (optimum 28-32 A degrees C) and 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 6.0-7.0), respectively. Growth was found to occur in the presence of 0-7% (w/v) NaCl [optimum 0-3% (w/v)]. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 41.9 mol% and the cell wall peptidoglycan found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-7 and the major polar lipids as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified polar lipid and three unidentified phospholipids. The major cellular fatty acids were identified as iso-C-15:0 (31.6%), anteiso-C-15:0 (26.9%) and iso-C-14:0 (17.1%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 1433(T) is a member of the genus Bacillus and is closely related to Bacillus aryabhattai DSM 21047(T) (99.4% sequence similarity) and Bacillus megaterium DSM 32(T) (99.2%). DNA-DNA relatedness of the novel strain 1433(T) with B. aryabhattai DSM 21047(T) and B. megaterium DSM 32(T) was 33.8 +/- 2.8% and 28.9 +/- 3.4%, respectively. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence presented, strain 1433(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which we propose the name Bacillus zanthoxyli sp. nov. The type strain is 1433(T) (= CCTCC AB 2016326(T) = KCTC33730(T)).

Merr. is a vulnerable plant from the family Opiliaceae. The complete chloroplast genome (plastome) of Opiliaceae family was sequenced for the first time. The plastome of C. manillana was 147,461 bp in length. It was consisted of a large single copy (LSC) region (83,505 bp) and a small single copy (SSC) region (7,806 bp), which were separated by two inverted repeats (IRs, 28,075 bp). This plastome contained 101 different genes, including 67 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 30 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. The overall GC content was 37.4%. Furthermore, phylogenetics analysis of 4 species in the Santalales was also conducted. The whole chloroplast genome of this species will be useful for the future plant evolutionary, phylogeny and genomic studies in the family Opiliaceae.

J	Cong, PY; Daley, AC; Edgecombe, GD; Hou, XG				Cong, Peiyun; Daley, Allison C.; Edgecombe, Gregory D.; Hou, Xianguang			The functional head of the Cambrian radiodontan (stem-group Euarthropoda) Amplectobelua symbrachiata	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Radiodonta; Amplectobelua; Feeding structures; Functional head; Chengjiang	BURGESS SHALE; ARTHROPOD; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; ANOMALOCARIS; HOMOLOGY; AFFINITY; BRAIN	Background: Segmental composition and homologies of the head of stem-group Euarthropoda have been the foci of recent studies on arthropod origins. An emerging hypothesis suggests that upper-stem group euarthropods possessed a three-segmented head/brain, including an ocular segment (protocerebrum) followed by the deutocerebrum with associated antennae/raptorial limbs and the tritocerebrum, while in the lower stem, head structures of Radiodonta are wholly associated with the protocerebrum and its preceding part. However, this hypothesis is incompletely tested because detailed knowledge on the head components of radiodontans is patchy, and informative articulated specimens are lacking for many taxa. Amplectobelua symbrachiata is the most common radiodontan species in the Chengjiang biota (ca. 520 Ma), normally known as isolated frontal appendages. Here we present detailed descriptions of new articulated specimens that elucidate the morphology and function of its head structures, and discuss their implications for hypotheses about euarthropod cephalic organisation. Results: In addition to a central oval head shield, A. symbrachiata also bears a pair of P-elements connected by an elongated rod. The mouth consists of sets of smooth and tuberculate plates, in contrast to the typical radial oral cones of other radiodontans. Previously identified 'palm-like teeth' are located external to the mouth in the posterior head region, and are interpreted as segmental gnathobase-like structures (GLSs) associated with at least three reduced transitional flaps in a one (pair)-to-one (pair) pattern, consistent with an appendicular nature. Comparisons with other panarthropods show that GLSs are morphologically similar to the mandibles and other gnathobasic mouthparts of euarthropods, as well as to the jaws of onychophorans, indicating their functional integration into the feeding activities of A. symbrachiata. Conclusions: The functional head of A. symbrachiata must include the reduced transitional segments (and their associated structures), which have been identified in several other radiodontans. This functional view supports the idea that the integration of segments (and associated appendages) into the head region, probably driven by feeding, occurred along the euarthropod stem-lineage. However, the number of reduced transitional segments varies between different groups and it remains uncertain whether GLSs represent proximal or distal parts of appendages. Our study is the first description of appendicular structures other than the frontal appendages in the functional head region of radiodontans, revealing novel feeding structures in the morphological transition from the lower-to the upper-stem-group of Euarthropoda.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of inflammation and inflammasome activation are not fully understood which has delayed the discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs of urgent clinic need. Here, we found that the natural compound Teuvincenone F, which was isolated and purified from the stems and leaves of Premna szemaoensis, could significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results showed that Teuvincenone F attenuated K63-linked ubiquitination of NF-kappa B-essential modulator (NEMO, also known as IKK gamma) to suppress LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappa B, and inhibited mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and NLRP3. In addition, we found that decreased NLRP3 expression by Teuvincenone F suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1 beta/IL-18 maturation. In vivo, we revealed that Teuvincenone F treatment relieved LPS-induced inflammation. In conclusion, Teuvincenone F is a highly effective natural compound to suppress LPS-induced inflammation by attenuating K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO, highlighting that Teuvincenone F may be a potential new anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of inflammatory and NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases.

In hypoxic solid tumors, an increased expression of nitroreductase (NTR) is detected, therefore, the development of NTR-targeted fluorescent probes to selectively and efficiently detect hypoxia in vivo is of utmost importance. In this study, a probe (1) has been designed and tested for effective optical detection of NTR in vitro and in vivo. The reduction of probe (1), catalyzed by NTR, resulted in changes of the electron-withdrawn nitrogen group into an electron-donation amino group. In addition, breakage of the O-C bond ensured selective fluorescence enhancement. The in vitro response towards exogenous NTR, from rat liver microsomes, resulted in the optical enhancement during the detection process. In vivo imaging of caerorhabditis elegans (C.elegan) further confirmed the detection of NTR by probe (1). Moreover, probe (1) was successfully used for the detection of hypoxia in both HI5 cells, and a murine tumor model, which demonstrates the potential of probe (1) for application in fluorescence bioimaging studies, and tumor hypoxia diagnosis.

Contrary to intuition, we show that the electron relaxation rate deviates from the Matthiessen's rule in an oscillatory way as a function of interdislocation distance, instead of monotonically. In addition, we show quantitatively that the deviation is larger in a material with lower mass density, higher Poisson ratio and higher elastic moduli. This study could serve as a computational tool to investigate the electronic behavior of a highly-dislocated system at a full quantum field theoretical level.

By screening a library of small chemical compounds, we identified eight compounds that selectively inhibit the PRMT5 enzymatic activity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 6 mu M. Molecular docking simulation and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that identified compounds target the substrate-binding site in PRMT5. Treatment of lung cancer cells with identified inhibitors led to inhibition of the symmetrical arginine methylation of SmD3 and histones and the cellular proliferation. Oral administration of the inhibitor demonstrated antitumor activity in a lung tumor xenograft model. Thus, identified PRMT5-specific small-molecule inhibitors would help elucidate the biological roles of PRMT5 and serve as lead compounds for future drug development.

For this target, we analyze its Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data from 2008 August to 2017 May. Two techniques, i.e., maximum likelihood optimization and exposure-weighted aperture photometry, are used to build the gamma-ray light curves. Then, both the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet Z-transform are applied to the light curves to search for period signals. A quasi-periodicity with a period of 2.1 +/- 0.3 yr appears at the significance level of similar to 5 sigma, although it should be noted that this putative quasi-period variability is seen in a data set that is barely four times longer. We speculate that this gamma-ray quasi-periodic modulation may be evidence of a binary supermassive black hole.

The structure, morphology, surface chemical states and surface area were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, respectively. The as-synthesized pure and Pd functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles were used to fabricate indirect-heating gas sensor, and the gas-sensing characteristics towards butane were investigated. At the optimum temperature, the sensors possess good response, selectivity, response/recovery, repeatability as well as long-term stability. Especially for the high response, the response of 7.5 mol% Pd functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles based sensor reaches 33.93 towards 3000 ppm butane, which is about 9 times higher than that of pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The response and recovery time are 13 and 8 s, respectively. Those values demonstrate the potential of using as-synthesized Pd functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles as butane gas detection, particularly in the dynamic monitoring. Apart from these, a possible mechanism related to the enhanced sensing performance is also investigated.

Thermoelectric transport in temperature-driven two-dimensional topological insulators	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ENERGY-GAP; ALLOY COMPOSITION; DEPENDENCE	We theoretically investigate on the thermoelectric (TE) transport properties of edge and bulk states in a temperature-driven two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator (TI) realized from CdTe/HgTe/CdTe quantum wells (QWs). It is found that the temperature can effectively drive a TI phase in CdTe/HgTe/CdTe QWs. We find that the TE transport properties of 2D TI can be governed by edge states, bulk states, or their interplay, depending on driving temperature and chemical potential of the system. Moreover, we find that the TE figure of merit ZT shows a peak at relatively low temperatures due to the competition between bulk and edge transports. This peak vanishes at relatively high temperatures due to the dominance of bulk states in the TE transport. With decreasing the ribbon width of the temperature-driven 2D TI, the low-temperature ZT exhibits two peaks, among which one occurs due to the bulk-edge competition and the other occurs due to the edge-edge hybridization; while the high-temperature ZT first exhibits the bulk-state behavior and then the edge-state one, which is indicative of a bulk-to-edge transition in the TE transport.

In the present study, we try to explore the diversity of cultivable rare Actinobacteria in Sigangli Cave, Yunnan, China by utilizing a combination of different sample pretreatments and under different culture conditions. Pretreating the samples under different conditions of heat, setting the isolation condition at different pHs, and supplementation of media with different calcium salts were found to be effective for isolation of diverse rare Actinobacteria.

In this paper, a compact and broadband antenna based on a step-shaped metasurface (SMS) at an operating frequency of 4.3 GHz is presented, which is fed by a planar monopole and enabled by selecting an SMS with high selectivity. The SMS consists of an array of metallic step-shaped unit cells underneath the monopole, which provide footprint miniaturization and bandwidth expansion. Numerical results show that the SMS-based antenna with a maximum size of 0.42 lambda(2)(0) (where lambda(0) is the operating wavelength in free space) exhibits a 22.3% impedance bandwidth (S11 < -10 dB) and a high gain of more than 7.15 dBi within the passband. Experimental results at microwave frequencies verify the performance of the proposed antenna, demonstrating substantial consistency with the simulation results. The compact and broadband antenna therefore predicts numerous potential applications within modern wireless communication systems.

Multicomponent plasmons in monolayer MoS2 with circularly polarized optical pumping	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							GRAPHENE PLASMONICS; VALLEY POLARIZATION; LAYER MOS2; TERAHERTZ; POLARIZABILITY	By making use of circularly polarized light and electrostatic gating, monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML - MoS2) can form a platform supporting multiple types of charge carriers. They can be discriminated by their spin, valley index, or whether they are electrons or holes. We investigate the collective properties of those charge carriers and are able to identify distinct plasmon modes. We analyze the corresponding dispersion relation, lifetime, and oscillator strength, and calculate the phase relation between the oscillations in the different components of the plasmon modes. All platforms in ML-MoS2 support a long-wavelength root q plasmon branch at zero kelvins. In addition to this, for an n-component system, n-1 distinct plasmon modes appear as acoustic modes with linear dispersion in the long-wavelength limit. These modes correspond to out-of-phase oscillations in the different fermion liquids and have, although being damped, a relatively long lifetime. Additionally, we also find distinct modes at large wave vectors that are more strongly damped by intraband processes.	[Xiao, Y. M.; Peeters, F.

Here, only two species, S. tenella and S. arieticanis, were found in 79 of 86 sheep (91.9%) in Kunming, China, based on their morphological characteristics. Four genetic markers, i.e., 18S rRNA gene, 28S rRNA gene, mitochondrial cox1 gene, and ITS-1 region, were sequenced and characterized for the two species of Sarcocystis. Sequences of the three former markers for S. tenella shared high identities with those of S. capracanis in goats, i.e., 99.0%, 98.3%, and 93.6%, respectively; the same three marker sequences of S. arieticanis shared high identities with those of S. hircicanis in goats, i.e., 98.5%, 96.5%, and 92.5%, respectively. No sequences in GenBank were found to significantly resemble the ITS-1 regions of S. tenella and S. arieticanis. Identities of the four genetic markers for S. tenella and S. arieticanis were 96.3%, 95.4%, 82.5%, and 66.2%, respectively.

ERICACEAE; ENDANGERED TREE; DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE; CHINA; FLOW; DIFFERENTIATION	Big tree rhododendron (Rhododendron protistum var. giganteum) is an extremely endangered plant with only two remnant populations distributed in the Gaoligong Mountains of northwestern Yunnan Province, China. However, the genetic structure, demographic history, and the population dynamics of this species have been rarely described. In the present study, data from 14 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci were used to assess the levels of genetic diversity, genetic structure, and demographic history of big tree rhododendron remnant populations. Results suggested that renmants maintained a moderate level of genetic diversity (N-E=2.86, A(R)=5.726, H-o=0.510, H-e=0.602, I=1.174) despite their small population. Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analysis indicated that sampled individuals were clustered into two distinct genetic groups. Demographic history analysis revealed high historical and low contemporary gene flow between two remnant populations. BOTTLENECK analysis under a two-phase mutation model showed that the populations could have experienced a recent historical bottleneck. The effective population sizes of the two populations were smaller than 30. Therefore, in situ conservation of this species should be prioritized. Furtheremore, ex situ cultivation of field collected seeds and introduction of saplings into the source site might be considered for the future conservation and restoration of big tree rhododendron.

Near infrared(NIR) luminescence properties in Bi/Yb3+ co-doped germanate glasses were investigated by the absorption spectrum, NIR luminescence spectra, and fluorescence lifetime measurement. MR luminescence of both Yb3+ and Bi ions was observed simultaneously, either under 980 or 808 nm excitation LD. The results show that ET process existed between Bi-related NW emission centre and Yb3+ ions. With the increasing in Yb3+ ions concentration, both ET efficiency from Yb3+ ions to Bi ion and optical basicity of glass matrix are increased. The competitive effects of enhancing by the ET process and weakening by optical basicity on NIR luminescence properties of Bi ions were investigated.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain YIM 79486(T) should be assigned to the genus Laceyella and formed a monophyletic clade with the type strain Laceyella putida KCTC 3666(T) (98.7% similarity). Strain YIM 79486(T) formed white aerial mycelium and brown substrate mycelium. Abundant endospores were produced on short sporophores. Cell-wall peptidoglycan contained mesodiaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9 and MK-8. The genomic DNA G+C content observed for strain YIM 79486(T) was 47.8 mol%. Based on low DNA-DNA hybridization data, chemotaxonomic characteristics and differential physiological properties, strain YIM 79486(T) is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Laceyella, for which the name Laceyella thermophila sp. nov. is proposed.

However, various reproductive barriers block the formation of hybrids and maintain species integrity. Here, we conducted a field survey to examine natural hybridization and reproductive isolation (RI) between sympatric populations of Primula secundiflora and P. poissonii using ten nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Although introgressive hybridization occurred, species boundaries between P. secundiflora and P. poissonii were maintained through nearly complete reproductive isolation. These interfertile species provide an excellent model for studying the RI mechanisms and evolutionary forces that maintain species boundaries.

J	Tian, GL; Li, HQ				Tian, Guo-Liang; Li, Hui-Qiong			A new framework of statistical inferences based on the valid joint sampling distribution of the observed counts in an incomplete contingency table	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bootstrap; confidence interval; incomplete contingency tables; sampling distribution; test statistics	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MISSING DATA; PROPORTIONS; TESTS	Some existing confidence interval methods and hypothesis testing methods in the analysis of a contingency table with incomplete observations in both margins entirely depend on an underlying assumption that the sampling distribution of the observed counts is a product of independent multinomial/binomial distributions for complete and incomplete counts. However, it can be shown that this independency assumption is incorrect and can result in unreliable conclusions because of the under-estimation of the uncertainty. Therefore, the first objective of this paper is to derive the valid joint sampling distribution of the observed counts in a contingency table with incomplete observations in both margins. The second objective is to provide a new framework for analyzing incomplete contingency tables based on the derived joint sampling distribution of the observed counts by developing a Fisher scoring algorithm to calculate maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of interest, the bootstrap confidence interval methods, and the bootstrap testing hypothesis methods. We compare the differences between the valid sampling distribution and the sampling distribution under the independency assumption. Simulation studies showed that average/expected confidence-interval widths of parameters based on the sampling distribution under the independency assumption are shorter than those based on the new sampling distribution, yielding unrealistic results. A real data set is analyzed to illustrate the application of the new sampling distribution for incomplete contingency tables and the analysis results again confirm the conclusions obtained from the simulation studies.

For the system with two communication pairs, when one communication pair achieves its quality of service (QoS) requirement, they can help the transmission of the other communication pair according to the trust degree, which quantifies the trustworthiness between users in the cooperation. For given trust degree, we investigate the user cooperation strategies, which include the power allocation and precoder design for various antenna configurations. For single-input-single-output and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) cases, we provide the optimal power allocation and beamformer design that maximize the expected achievable rates while guaranteeing the QoS requirement. For a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) case, we resort to semidefinite relaxation technique and block coordinate update method to solve the corresponding problem, and guarantee the rank-one solutions at each step. For a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) case, as MIMO is the generalization of MISO and SIMO, the similarities among their problem structures inspire us to combine the methods from MISO and SIMO together to efficiently tackle MIMO case. Simulation results show that the trust degree information has a great effect on the performance of the user cooperation in terms of the expected achievable rate, and the proposed user cooperation strategies achieve high achievable rates for give trust degree.

But little is known about the physiological interactions between DSE and plants under heavy metal stress. In the present study, the growth, Cd content, and physiological response of Zea mays L. to a root-colonized DSE, Exophiala pisciphila, were analyzed under Cd stress (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) in a sand culture experiment. Under high Cd (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) stress, the DSE colonization in roots increased the maize growth, kept more Cd in roots, and decreased Cd content in shoots. The DSE colonization improved the photosynthesis and induced notable changes on phytohormones but had no significant effect on the antioxidant capability in the maize leaves. Moreover, there were significant positive correlations between the gibberellic acid (GA) content and transpiration rate, zeatin riboside (ZR) content, and photosynthetic rate in maize leaves. These results indicated that the DSE's ability to promote plant growth was related to a decrease on Cd content and the regulation on phytohormone balance and photosynthetic activities in maize leaves.

Broad-band, radio spectro-polarimetric study of 100 radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: polarimetric; galaxies: active; galaxies: jet; galaxies: magnetic fields; radio continuum: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; MAGNETIC-FIELD; ROTATION-MEASURE; POLARIZATION PROPERTIES; FARADAY-ROTATION; GALAXIES; DEPOLARIZATION; ACCRETION; LUMINOSITY; REDSHIFT	We present the results from a broad-band (1 to 3 GHz), spectro-polarimetry study of the integrated emission from 100 extragalactic radio sources with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, selected to be highly linearly polarized at 1.4 GHz. We use a general-purpose, polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three distinct polarized emission regions or 'RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in polarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high intrinsic degree of polarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday depolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is a statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization between the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically ordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find a preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic magnetic field structure of jet-mode AGN with respect to the jet direction, while no clear preference is found for the radiative-mode sources.

Some studies have indicated that pollen limitation does not mediate selection on traits associated with either pollinator attraction or self-fertilization. Primula tibetica is an inconspicuous cross-fertilized plant that may suffer from pollen limitation. We conducted a selection analysis on P.tibetica to investigate whether pollen limitation results in selection for an increased floral display in case the evolution of autonomous self-fertilization has been difficult for this plant. The self- and intra-morph incompatibility features, the capacity for autonomous self-fertilization, and the magnitude of pollen limitation were examined through hand-pollination experiments. In 2016, we applied selection analysis on the flowering time, corolla width, stalk height, flower tube length, and flower number in P.tibetica by tagging 76 open-pollinated plants and 37 hand-pollinated plants in the field. Our results demonstrated that P.tibetica was strictly self- and intra-morph incompatible. Moreover, the study population underwent severe pollen limitation during the 2016 flowering season. The selection gradients were found to be significantly positive for flowering time, flower number, and corolla width, and marginally significant for the stalk height. Pollinator-mediated selection was found to be significant on the flower number and corolla width, and marginally significant on stalk height. Our results indicate that the increased floral display may be a vital strategy for small distylous species that have faced difficulty in evolving autonomous self-fertilization.

It was modified with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), which resulted in high adsorption capacity. Its microstructure and surface functional groups were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared. The results showed that CTAB-Ms(x) had a core/shell structure in which the core was a CTAB micelle and the shell was SiO2. The prepared material was applied to adsorb bisphenol A (BPA). Pseudo-first-order kinetics equation, pseudo-second-order kinetics equation, Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, Temkin adsorption isotherm model, and thermodynamic equations were used to fit and analyze the experiment results. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacities calculated according to linear and non-linear forms of the Langmuir isotherm were 370.37 mg.g(-1) and 198.80 mg.g(-1), and the adsorption equilibrium time was 120 min. A mechanism study showed that the high adsorption capacity was attributed to the solubilization effect of the CTAB micelle.

In this paper, an energy-based spectrum sensing method based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and tri-stable stochastic resonance (TSR) is proposed. In this method, TSR was adopted to achieve greater SNR output than bi-stable stochastic resonance (BSR). To overcome the shortage that TSR can only set fixed parameters by experience, QPSO was adopted to adjust parameters of TSR adaptively when the noise power was fixed. Simulation results of SNR and spectrum show that the convergence, the output SNR in convergence status of QPSO-TSR performs better than QPSO-BSR under low input SNR, while QPSO-TSR has a slight delay due to its optimization searching process. The simulation result of receiver operating characteristic curves show that the proposed scheme has an excellent convergence performance and can improve the detection probability.

The discrete cross-correlation function (DCF) method has been employed to investigate the correlation and the possible time lag. A clear correlation has been found in 55 sources (78.6% of the sample sources). It is confirmed that the variations in optical bands lead those in radio bands by several days to several hundred days. In four cases, optical flares are found to occur simultaneously with the radio flares. A jet-in-shock model has been used to explain these results. We estimate that the lag between the radio and optical bands may range from 3 days to 2.4 years. The DCF analysis results are consistent with expectations.	[Zhang, B. K.; Zhao, X.

Here, a new species, Sarcocystis dehongensis, is reported in 51 of 756 (6.7%) water buffaloes in China. By light microscopy, the cysts of S. dehongensis were macroscopic, up to 18.5 mm long and 95 mu m in diameter; 4.9-11.9 mu m villous protrusions extended beyond the sarcocyst wall. Using transmission electron microscopy, the sarcocyst wall had lancet- or leaf-like protrusions in longitudinal section, but the cross section showed that the protrusions appeared as mushroom-like in shape with a core of tightly packed microtubules, similar to "type 24." BLAST searches revealed that S. dehongensis shared the most similarities with the 18S rDNA sequence of S. hardangeri (92.4%) and mitochondrial cox1 gene sequence of S. ovalis (81.0%), whereas no sequences in GenBank were found to be significantly similar to the ITS-1 region of S. dehongensis. A phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA and mitochondrial cox1 gene sequences suggested that S. dehongensis was closely related to Sarcocystis species from cervids that employ corvids as definitive hosts.

It is found that substrate work functions have little impact on the energy level alignments at donor/acceptor heterojunctions. Planar-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells are made to test the relationship between energy offset and open-circuit voltage (V-OC). V-OC is found to increase linearly as a function of EDA. The VOC, however, takes a surprising turn at E-DA = 1.5 eV and starts to decrease as a function of donor-acceptor energy levels. To explain this experimental observation, a theoretical model to quantify the relationship between VOC and EDA is developed. The proposed model well explains the experimental data and, in particular, the reverse trend of VOC on EDA. By grouping several material constants into one variable, a simple universal plot that well describes the experimental data for both planar-heterojunction and bulk-heterojunction cells is generated.

The two hot molecular cores Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N), which are located at the center of the giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2, have been the targets of numerous spectral line surveys, revealing a rich and complex chemistry. Aims. We seek to characterize the physical and chemical structure of the two high-mass star-forming sites Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N) using high-angular resolution observations at millimeter wavelengths, reaching spatial scales of about 4000 au. Methods. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to perform an unbiased spectral line survey of both regions in the ALMA band 6 with a frequency coverage from 211 GHz to 275 GHz. The achieved angular resolution is 0".4, which probes spatial scales of about 4000 au, i.e., able to resolve different cores and fragments. In order to determine the continuum emission in these line-rich sources, we used a new statistical method, STATCONT, which has been applied successfully to this and other ALMA datasets and to synthetic observations. Results. We detect 27 continuum sources in Sgr B2(M) and 20 sources in Sgr B2(N). We study the continuum emission variation across the ALMA band 6 (i.e., spectral index) and compare the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum emission with previous SMA 345 GHz and VLA 40 GHz observations to study the nature of the sources detected. The brightest sources are dominated by (partially optically thick) dust emission, while there is an important degree of contamination from ionized gas free-free emission in weaker sources. While the total mass in Sgr B2(M) is distributed in many fragments, most of the mass in Sgr B2(N) arises from a single object, with filamentary-like structures converging toward the center. There seems to be a lack of low-mass dense cores in both regions. We determine H-2 volume densities for the cores of about 10(7)-10(9) cm(-3) (or 10(5)-10(7) M-circle dot pc(-3)), i.e., one to two orders of magnitude higher than the stellar densities of super star clusters. We perform a statistical study of the chemical content of the identified sources. In general, Sgr B2(N) is chemically richer than Sgr B2(M). The chemically richest sources have about 100 lines per GHz and the fraction of luminosity contained in spectral lines at millimeter wavelengths with respect to the total luminosity is about 20%-40%. There seems to be a correlation between the chemical richness and the mass of the fragments, where more massive clumps are more chemically rich. Both Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) harbor a cluster of hot molecular cores. We compare the continuum images with predictions from a detailed 3D radiative transfer model that reproduces the structure of Sgr B2 from 45 pc down to 100 au. Conclusions. This ALMA dataset, together with other ongoing observational projects in the range 5 GHz to 200 GHz, better constrain the 3D structure of Sgr B2 and allow us to understand its physical and chemical structure.

One particular concern with these conservation actions is whether species with obligate symbiotic relationships will be able to form these associations in the recipient locations. This study takes advantage of a massive conservation translocation of orchids at the Yachang National Nature Reserve in southwestern China. We compared the mycorrhizal associations of four of these targeted species. Two of the species (Cymbidium bicolor Lindl. and Geodorum eulophioides Schltr.) had narrow geographic ranges and were subjected to CI because the movement had placed them out of their natural ranges. While the other two species (Paphiopedilum dicmthum, Tang and Wang, and Pophiopedilum hirsutissimum, (Lindl. ex Hook. f.) Pfitzer) had wide geographic ranges and were not moved outside of them. This movement can be considered a conventional translocation. Using DNA techniques, we identified orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) associated with translocated and natural populations of these species. Our results indicated that translocated populations of both kinds (CI and conventional translocation) were able to establish new relationships with root fungi, including known OMF groups. Wide-ranging species associated with a greater number (24 OTUs) and more diverse groups of fungi (Shannon diversity (H') = 0.93) than narrow range species (15 OTUs, H' = 0.62). However, translocated populations of wide-ranging species shared fewer fungi with their natural populations than those of narrow-ranging species. This research provides the first evaluation of how critical biotic interactions may change following conservation introduction compared to that of conventional translocation, and shed light upon the feasibility of conservation introduction.

NOV.; ACTINOBACTERIUM; SEQUENCES; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION	A novel actinobacterial strain, designated NCCP-696(T), was isolated from the Thal desert in Punjab, Pakistan, and characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomy approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NCCP-696(T) belongs to the genus Nocardioides and showed the highest level of sequence similarity with respect to Nocardioides panacisoli Gsoil 346(T) (98.2 %) and less than 96.4% to the strains of other species of the genus Nocardioides. Cells of strain NCCP-696(T) were Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile rods and formed cream-coloured colonies. The strain was positive for oxidase and catalase. Growth occurred at 20-42 degrees C (optimum 30-37 degrees C) at pH 5.5-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and with 0-4% NaCl (optimum 0-2 %, w/v). Strain NCCP-696(T) contained Iso-C16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c, C-17:1 omega 8c and C-17 : 0 as the predominant fatty acids and was found to have LL-2,6-diaminopimelicacid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and one unknown phospholipid. The major menaquinone was MK-8(H-4) (98.7 %) while a minor amount (1.3 %) of MK-9(H-2) was also detected. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.6 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization value of the isolate against the closely related type strain Nocardioides panacisoli Gsoil 346(T) was 56.3 +/- 1.4. On the basis of the phylogenetic inference, chemotaxonomic characteristics and phenotypic data, strain NCCP-696(T) should be classified as a novel species, for which the name Nocardioides thalensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NCCP-696(T) (= DSM 103833(T) = CCTCC AB 2016296(T)).

The taxonomic position of the novel isolate was investigated by a polyphasic approach. The novel isolate was Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped. Colonies were circular, convex, opaque and yellow. The strain grew at 5070 degrees C (optimum, 60 degrees C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of up to 1.0% NaCl (w/v). Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of YIM 73026(T) and those of other members of the genus Thermus showed sequence similarities ranging from 91.2 to 97.5 %, with YIM 73026(T) showing closest sequence similarity to Thermus scotoductus SE-1(T) (97.5 %). DNA-DNA hybridization results, however, revealed that DNA-DNA reassociation values between YIM 73026(T) and T. scotoductus DSM 8553(T) (37.6 %), Thermus amyloliquefaciens YIM 77409(T) (34.5 %), Thermus antranikianii DSM 12462(T) (30.3 %), Thermus caliditerrae YIM 77925(T) (28.6 %) and Thermus tengchongensis YIM 77924(T) (27.3 %) were well below the 70% limit for species identification. YIM 73026(T) contained MK-8 as the respiratory quinone, and iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0 and anteiso-C-15:0 as the major cellular fatty acids (> 10 %). The polar lipids consisted of one aminophospholipid, one phospholipid and two glycolipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of YIM 73026(T) was 65.4 mol%. On the basis of morphological, chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics, it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Thermus, for which the name Thermus caldifontis sp. nov. is proposed.

Herein, iron oxides particles supported reduced graphene oxide composites (MRGO) were successfully synthesized by in-situ chemical precipitation approach. The MRGO composites which illustrated high saturation magnetization could be likely separated using an external magnet. The experimental data illustrated that U(VI) ions could be interacted with MRGO composites through different interaction mechanisms depending on different environmental conditions. The adsorption kinetic results can be well simulated using the pseudo-second-order pattern. The pH-dependent adsorption behavior illustrated an favorable pH value of 7.5 for removal of U(VI) ions using MRGO composites. Furthermore, the adsorption regeneration of MRGO composites in simulated wastewater disposal systems was tested. Based on above mentioned, it was clear that MRGO composites could be potentially used as adsorbent for removal of actual U(VI)-bearing wastewaters.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Audetat, A; Li, WT				Audetat, Andreas; Li, Wanting			The genesis of Climax-type porphyry Mo deposits: Insights from fluid inclusions and melt inclusions	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Porphyry Mo deposits; Molybdenum; Fluid inclusions; Melt inclusions; LA-ICP-MS	MAGMATIC-HYDROTHERMAL FLUIDS; EASTERN CHINA IMPLICATIONS; COPPER-MOLYBDENUM DEPOSIT; BRECCIA PIPE COMPLEX; GREAT XINGAN RANGE; U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; H-O ISOTOPE; DABIE SHAN; NEW-MEXICO; INTRUSIVE ROCKS	This review aims at summarizing currently available data on fluid inclusions and melt inclusions from Climax-type porphyry Mo deposits. Data are presented from 16 economically mineralized occurrences in North America and China, plus 5 subeconomically Mo-mineralized and 4 barren occurrences in North America, Norway and China. Because melt inclusions preserve original' metal-and volatile contents they are very helpful to reconstruct the abundances and evolution of these constituents in magmas. The available data suggest that the mineralizing silicate melts in Climax-type porphyry Mo systems were highly evolved high-silica rhyolites that were variably enriched in F (0.5-4.0 wt%) and H2O (4-9 wt%) but had rather low Mo contents (2-25 ppm). The latter observation implies that Mo had to be extracted from large volumes of magma (at least several tens of km(3)) to produce a mid-sized deposit. The fluids that exsolved from these magmas were originally single-phase and of relatively low salinity (5-15 wt% NaClequiv), and subsequently condensed a brine phase once the magma solidus was reached. The single-phase fluids contained on the order of 100 ppm Mo and in some places several wt% CO2, whereas pre-mineralization brines contained up to 500 ppm Mo. A comparison between porphyry Momineralized and barren occurrences reveals that the melts and fluids in mineralized systems were not unusually Mo-rich, which suggests that the mineralization potential was controlled by other factors. Likely candidates are the size of the upper crustal magma chamber, and the efficiency by which fluids were extracted from the magma and focused into a smaller rock volume. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of H2S detection is based on the reaction of hydro sulfide anion with a disulfide bond. The resulting product of the reaction of the probe with hydrogen sulfide can be detected in a colorimetric assay as it changes a color of the reaction mixture from green to pink in aqueous solutions. Simultaneously, a 25-fold increase in the fluorescence signal of the probe upon its interaction with hydrogen sulfide gives a unique opportunity for the usage of this probe for in vivo detection of H2S. In addition, the present study demonstrates a potential of the newly developed chemosensor for the detection of increased concentrations of H2S in insect cells and alive C.elegans.

NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; BACTERIA; CHINA; WELLS	Two Gram-negative, moderately thermophilic, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped and motile bacterial strains, designated YIM 75003(T) and YIM 75004(T), were isolated from sediment samples collected from the Tagejia hot spring in Tibet, western China. The taxonomic affiliation of the two strains was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Pairwise comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains YIM 75003(T) and YIM 75004(T) are closely related to Altererythrobacter buctense M0322(T) (97.2 and 97.1% respectively), while sharing 99.9% sequence similarity against each other. Optimum growth of the two strains was observed at 37-45 A degrees C, pH 8.0 and in the presence of 1-6% NaCl (w/v). Their predominant respiratory quinone was found to be ubiquinone 10. The major fatty acids in both the strains were identified as summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c) and summed feature 4 (C-17:1 anteiso B and/or iso I). Their major polar lipid profiles were found to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and sphingoglycolipid. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 75003(T) and YIM 75004(T) were determined to be 61.3 and 60.1 mol%, respectively. The DNA-DNA hybridization values between strains YIM 75003(T) and YIM 75004(T), and between the two strains and their closely related phylogenetic neighbour A. buctense M0322(T) (=CGMCC 1.12871(T)) were less than 70%. Based on the morphological and physiological properties, phylogenetic analyses, chemotaxonomic characteristics and DNA-DNA relatedness values, the two strains can be distinguished from each other and from their phylogenetically closely related strain. Strains YIM 75003(T) and YIM 75004(T) are, therefore, considered to represent two novel species of the genus Altererythrobacter, for which the names Altererythrobacter lauratis sp. nov. (type strain YIM 75003(T) = KCTC 52606(T) = CCTCC AB2016268(T)) and Altererythrobacter palmitatis sp. nov. (type strain YIM 75004(T) = KCTC 52607(T) = CCTCC AB2016270(T)) are proposed.

The study aimed to estimate the external costs of silicon production to inform policy on the sustainable exploitation of solar energy. Specifically, the study estimated the cost of health damage and agricultural loss resulting from the pollution of silicon production. The data was collected from a silicon industrial zone in Southwest China. The cost of agricultural loss was estimated using a production function method, while the cost of health damage was estimated using dose-response functions, in which the air pollutant concentration was estimated based on a Gaussian dispersion model. The results show that the annual external cost of agricultural loss is CNY 0.76-4.13 million and that of health damage is CNY 26.53-44.63 million, or a total external cost is CNY 27.29-48.76 million. The average external cost is CNY 447.35 (CNY 321.1-473.82) per ton of metallurgical silicon. This information has implication for making policies on the control of pollution and the sustainable development of solar energy industry.

When this VOxNTs-Polyaniline was used as cathode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), it displayed much higher specific capacity and better cycling stability compared with the pristine VOxNTs. The improvement of electrochemical performance could be attributed to the effective removal of a large part of organic template without any electrochemical activity by cationic exchange process and the incorporation of polyaniline with good conductivity as well as lithium storage property in itself via chemical oxidative polymerization. Moreover, the polyaniline could also behave as a useful structural buffer, alleviating the strain during repeated Li+ intercalation/deintercalation and contributing to cyclic stability. It is hopeful to further improve its performance through the complete elimination of useless soft-template and increasing the crystallinity of active VOx, making this novel VOxNTs-Polyaniline a promising cathode candidate with high performance for LIBs.

The results indicate slight improvement in the microstructure and density of the films with increasing Fe content. The results of Raman spectroscopy showed variation in the local distortion and cation distribution at octahedral sites with elevated Fe content. The IR optical properties of the films were investigated at room temperature in the wavelength range from 1.5 mu m to 25 mu m. A strong absorption peak corresponding to Reststrahlen band located at 19.5 mu m was observed and its absorption intensity found to improve with increasing Fe content in the films. The maximum absorption coefficient was calculated to be about 18,000 cm(-1). The results bear technological significance for the design and fabrication of devices for IR detection applications.

Many bat species hibernate in winter. A reversible control of cerebral activities is critical for bats to accommodate a repeated torpor-arousal cycle during. hibernation. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal activities in torpid bats. In this study, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bat brain proteins were fractionated, and their abundance in active and torpid states was compared. Results of 2D gel-based proteomics showed that 38% of identified proteins with a significant change in abundance are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and cytoskeletal integrity. Changes in the abundance of proteins related to RNA splicing, proteostasis, redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and energy metabolism were also detected. In addition, the levels of GNAO1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gas subunit), an important modulator of neuronal transmembrane signaling, were significantly increased in the insoluble protein fraction of torpid bats; this may be due to GNAO1 palmitoylation making it insoluble. Our data provide molecular evidence for the maintenance of neuronal activities in torpid bats and suggest that a reversible palmitoylation of the G protein plays a role in the regulation of neuronal activities during bat hibernation.

The analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption-desorption were conducted to characterize the ingredients, microstructure and surface morphology. Ag and ZnO show separate phases due to the reduction of Ag+ and the faster crystallization rate of ZnO. The as-synthesized powders were used as gas sensing materials to fabricate gas sensors. The gas-sensing performance was tested towards 100 ppm formaldehyde at an optimum operating temperature of 240 degrees C and Ag-loaded ZnO (with the different Ag atomic ratio) based gas sensors showed a superior gas-sensing performance comparing with pure ZnO. Especially 1 at% Ag-loaded ZnO has the highest gas response as 170.42. The possible gas-sensing mechanism was discussed in this paper. For example, the influence of surface area, the formation of heterostructure, Ag elements, adsorbed oxygen and so on. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The pertinent combinations of low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of pi N and KN scattering and the corresponding data. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the strong phase shift difference of pi A scattering at the Xi mass, delta(P) - delta(S) = (8.8 0.2) degrees, in agreement with experimental results. We find that the phase shifts in the S-01 (pi Sigma), S-01(K Xi), S-01((K) over barN), and S-11((K) over bar Sigma) waves are so strong that resonances may be generated dynamically in all these channels. We also predict the scattering lengths and make comparisons with the results obtained from the threshold I-matrices in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and the method of covariant infrared regularization. The issue of convergence is also discussed in detail.

Tetracycline resistance is one of the most abundant antibiotic resistances that may transfer among clinical and commensal microorganisms. To investigate tetracycline resistance genes from soil bacteria in different habitats, we performed functional analysis of three metagenomic libraries derived from soil samples collected from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet, respectively, in China. We found efflux transporter genes form all the libraries, including 21 major facilitator superfamily efflux pump genes and one multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter gene. Interestingly, we also identified two tetracycline destructase genes, belonging to a newly described family of tetracycline-inactivating enzymes that scarcely observed in clinical pathogens, from the Tibet library. The inactivation activity of the putative enzyme was confirmed in vitro by biochemical analysis. Our results indicated that efflux pumps distributed predominantly across habitats. Meanwhile, the mechanism of enzymatic inactivation for tetracycline resistance should not be neglected and merits further investigation.

Maltose residue, 1,6-beta-D-diglucose residue, and several triazole-linked disaccharide and trisaccharide residues were coupled to 4 beta-azido-podophyllotoxin derivatives through click glycosylation strategy. The initial click glycosylation products were treated with catalytic amount of NaOCH3 to facilitate global deacylation and epimerization at C-2 position to yield the cis-gamma-lactone moiety in the picropodophyllotoxin glycoconjugates. Most of these picropodophyllotoxin glycoconjugates show weak cytotoxicity (IC50 > 40 mu M) against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, SW480) as indicated by in vitro MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. However, compound 27 that contains a 1,6-beta-D-di-glucose residue displays strong anticancer activity against all cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 7.41 mu M, which is significantly more potent than the control drug etoposide against four of the five cancer cells tested. Structure activity relationship analysis suggests that the 4'-O-methyl group on the E ring of podophyllotoxin scaffold is perhaps important for the anticancer activity of glycosylated picropodophyllotoxin derivatives with a cis-g-lactone moiety.

This edible plant is an important germplasm source with a high economic value in China if propagation were less difficult. Seed dormancy and germination of this species were investigated to improve propagation. Considering seeds have a fully developed embryo and mature and are dispersed in summer, and radicles and epicotyls emerge the following autumn and next spring, respectively, we hypothesized that Y. longistaminea seeds may undergo physiological epicotyl dormancy. Seed moisture content and viability decreased as dehydration occurred. Thus, the seeds may be recalcitrant. The seed germination of this species involves two stages: radicle emergence and epicotyl (shoot) emergence. The optimum temperature was 28 degrees C and 28 degrees C/20 degrees C to radicle emergence. The optimum GA(3) solution for the seeds undergoing shoot emergence was 100 mg L-1. The percentages of shoot emergence in seven and 14 days stratification at 5 degrees C were slightly higher than those in other groups. This study is the first to describe physiological epicotyl dormancy in Y. longistaminea seeds. Under natural conditions, seeds are subjected to Y. longistaminea a autumn -> winter -> spring temperature. Warm moist conditions and cold stratification can improve radicle emergence and alleviate epicotyl dormancy, respectively. The duration of cold stratification also significantly affects the epicotyl dormancy release of Y. longistaminea. Optimal dormancy breakage methods are warm (28 degrees C/20 degrees C) -> cold (5 degrees C) -> GA(3)(100 mg L-1) -> warm (28 degrees C/20 degrees C).

We studied the pollination biology of Roscoea alpina, observed potential floral visitors and determined their foraging behaviour, visitation frequency and pollination efficiency, to seek evidence in support of the pollination syndrome hypothesis. We also measured the floral spectra of R. alpina flowers to evaluate if signals fit with the currently known framework for observed floral visitors. We found that R. alpina have autonomous selfing and pollinator-mediated crossing, but lack apomixis. We observed that a beetle (Mylabris sp.), and a moth (Macroglossum nycteris) visit the flowers of R. alpina for pollen and nectar feeding respectively. Our field observations, the stigmatic pollen count and fruit set data indicated that the visit by the beetle was legitimate, while that of the moth was illegitimate. Emasculated flowers visited by beetles set as many fruits and seeds/fruit as autoselfed and naturally pollinated flowers, while emasculated flowers excluded from beetle visits did not set fruit and seed; indicating that a single visit of a beetle to the flowers of R. alpina can facilitate pollination. We found that flower spectral signal of R. alpina does not fit typical spectra previously reported for beetle or bee-visited flowers. Our results suggest that, to ensure reproductive success in alpine habitat, R. alpina has evolved autonomous selfing as a predominant mode of reproduction, while beetle pollination would promote genetic diversity of this plant species. The visitation of beetles to the flowers of R. alpina, despite floral signal mismatch with the classically associated beetle vision, suggests that a different visual processing may operate in this plant-pollinator interaction at high altitudes.

In this study, 37 transformants of A. oligospora were obtained by REMI (restriction enzyme mediated integration) method and phenotypic properties of nine transformants were analyzed. The nine transformants showed differences in growth, conidiation, trap formation, stress tolerance, and/or pathogenicity among each other and with those of the parental wild-type strain (WT). The insertional sites of the hph cassette were identified in transformants X5 and X13. In X5, the cassette was inserted in the non-coding region between AOL_ s00076g273 (76g273) and AOL_s00076g274 (76g274) and the transcription of 76g274, but not 76g273, was enhanced in X5. 76g274p had two conserved domains and was predicted as a nucleoprotein, which we confirmed by its nuclear localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the green fluorescent protein-fused 76g274p. The transcription of 76g274 was stimulated or inhibited by several environmental factors. The sporulation yields of 76g274-deficient mutants were decreased by 70%, and transcription of several sporulation-related genes was severely diminished compared to the WT during the conidiation. In summary, a method for screening mutants was established in A. oligospora and using the method, we identified a novel C2H2-type transcription factor that positively regulates the conidiation of A. oligospora.

Barcoding utility in a mega-diverse, cross-continental genus: keeping pace with Cyrtodactylus geckos	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SQUAMATA GEKKONIDAE CYRTODACTYLUS; BENT-TOED GECKOS; SOUTHERN VIETNAM; PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; NORTHERN THAILAND; KARST FOREST; DNA; PROVINCE; TAXONOMY; PHYLOGENY	Over the past decade, DNA barcoding has become a staple of low-cost molecular systematic investigations. The availability of universal primers and subsidized sequencing projects (PolarBOL, SharkBOL, SpongeBOL) have driven this popularity, often without appropriate investigation into the utility of barcoding data for the taxonomic group of interest. Here, our primary aim is to determine the phylogenetic value of DNA barcoding (mitochondrial locus COI) within the gecko genus Cyrtodactylus. With > 40 new species described since last systematic investigation, Cyrtodactylus represents one of the most diverse extant squamate genera, and their contemporary distribution spans the Indian subcontinent, eastward through Indochina, and into AustraloPapua. The complex biogeographic history of this group, and morphology-only designation of many species have complicated our phylogenetic understanding of Cyrtodactylus. To highlight the need for continued inclusive molecular assessment, we use Vietnamese Cyrtodactylus as a case study showing the geopolitically paraphyletic nature of their history. We compare COI to the legacy marker ND2, and discuss the value of COI as an interspecific marker, as well as its shortcomings at deeper evolutionary scales. We draw attention back to the Cold Code as a subsidized method for incorporating molecular methods into species descriptions in the effort to maintain accurate phylogenies.

Experimental results showed that the yields of light aromatic hydrocarbons (LAHs) and methane (synthetic natural gas, SNG) could be greatly improved at a given ratio of calcium-iron. Maximum yields of light aromatic hydrocarbons, 3.38 wt% (2.47 wt% of BTX and 0.34 wt% of naphthalene) were achieved using 5% Fe + 1% Ca dual catalysts at the catalyzed hydrogasification conditions of 750 C and 1.0 Mpa. Analyses of coal chars were investigated to explain the promoted catalysis. The calcium promoted the reduction of iron oxide to active metallic iron, the increased dispersion of iron by calcium was found to result from the enhanced iron-calcium interaction, which was monitored through the carbon dissolved into iron to formed Fe3C. The rate of iron-catalyzed hydrogasification increased with time during the isothermal mode, the added calcium accelerated the catalytic activity increase and converted the oxygen, aromatic contents in oil and coal char to the formation of H2O, CO, CO2, BTX, PCXN and CH4.

Effects of variations in thickness of dielectric layer H and structural parameters on the pass-band are surveyed. Simulated results indicate that the sidewall length of the main air hole and the nano-hole mainly define the impedance matching condition. The pass-band can be expanded due to impedance matching condition between the designed structure and air interface is achieved through optimizing the dimensional parameters of the designed structure. Meanwhile, the pass-band can be also expanded by reducing the thickness of dielectric layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prion protein (PrP), encoded by the prion protein gene (PRNP), is fundamental in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. We previously showed that buffaloes express more PrP proteins but lower PRNP mRNA than cattle in several pivotal tissues like the obex. Therefore, we sought to establish whether genetic variability in PRNP 3' UTR, mediated by miRNA down-regulation, causes PrP expression differences between cattle and buffaloes. We annotated the 3' UTR of buffalo PRNP gene by 3' RACE experiment. A total of 92 fixed differences in the complete 3' UTR (similar to 3 kb) were identified between 13 cattle and 13 buffaloes. Resequencing of UTR-C (g. 786-1436) and UTR-B (g. 778-1456) fragments confirmed that all mutations except g. 1022T in cattle are fixed differences between 147 cattle and 146 buffaloes. In addition, analysis of the variation of.G between cattle and buffalo sequences reveals four remarkable differences. Two buffalo-specific insertion sites ( a 28-bp insertion and an AG insertion in buffalo 3' UTR of PRNP g. 970-997 and g. 1088-1089, respectively) and two mutants (g. 1007-1008 TG -> CC) create compatible binding sites for miRNAs in buffalo 3' UTR. This was validated through luciferase reporter assays which demonstrated that miR-125b-5p, miR-1323p, miR- 145- 5p, miR-331-3p, and miR- 338- 3p directly act on the fixed difference sites in buffalo 3'UTR. Additional expressional analyses show that these five miRNAs are coexpressed with PRNP in bovine obex tissues. Our study reveals a miRNAs regulated mechanism explaining the differences in prion expression between cattle and buffalo.

Turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa) has been widely cultivated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for a century as a food crop of worldwide economic significance. These CBL-CIPK complexes have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in plant response to various environmental stresses. However, no report is available on the genome-wide characterization of these two gene families in turnip. In the present study, 19 and 51 members of the BrrCBL and BrrCIPK genes, respectively, are first identified in turnip and phylogenetically grouped into three and two distinct clusters, respectively. The expansion of these two gene families is mainly attributable to segmental duplication. Moreover, the differences in expression patterns in quantitative real-time PCR, as well as interaction profiles in the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggest the functional divergence of paralog genes during long-term evolution in turnip. Overexpressing and complement lines in Arabidopsis reveal that BrrCBL9.2 improves, but BrrCBL9.1 does not affect, salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Thus, the expansion of the BrrCBL and BrrCIPK gene families enables the functional differentiation and evolution of some new gene functions of paralog genes. These paralog genes then play prominent roles in turnip's adaptation to the adverse environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Overall, the study results contribute to our understanding of the functions of the CBL-CIPK complex and provide basis for selecting appropriate genes for the in-depth functional studies of BrrCBL-BrrCIPK in turnip.

It has been found that these new double-side decorated arsenenes, which we call "hydrogen-arsenene-halogen (H-As-X, X is halogen)", are dynamically stable via the phonon dispersion calculations except H-As-F sheets. In particular, all of H-As-X nanosheets are direct band gap semiconductors with a strong dispersion near the Fermi level, which is substantially different from the previous works of double-side decorated arsenenes with zero band gaps. Our results reveal a new route to change the band gap of arsenene from indirect to direct. Furthermore, we also studied bilayer, trilayer, and multilayer H-As-Cl sheets to explore the effects of the layer number. The results indicate that bilayer, trilayer, and multilayer H-As-Cl sheets display novel electronic structure, namely multi-Dirac cones character, and the Dirac character depends sensitively on the layer number. It is noted that the frontier states near the Fermi level are dominantly controlled by the top and bottom layers in trilayer and multilayer H-As-Cl sheets. Our findings may provide the valuable information about the new double-side decorated arsenene sheets in various practical applications in the future.

However, the regulation of their biosynthesis is not fully understood yet. Herein the function of a TetR family regulator GdmRIII, which is located in the biosynthetic gene cluster of geldanamycin, was studied to understand the regulatory mechanism of geldanamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces autolyticus CGMCC0516. The production of geldanamycin decreased substantially in a Delta gdmRIII mutant and the yield of three compounds which were thought to be geldanamycin congeners greatly increased. Surprisingly, the structural elucidation of these compounds showed that they were elaiophylin and its analogues, which implied that GdmRIII not only played a positive regulatory role in the biosynthesis of geldanamycin, but also played a negative role in elaiophylin biosynthesis. GdmRIII affected the expression of multiple genes in both gene clusters, and directly regulated the expression of gdmM, gdmN, and elaF by binding to the promoter regions of these three genes. A conserved non-palindromic sequence was found among the binding sites of elaF. Our findings suggested that the biosynthetic pathways of geldanamycin and elaiophylin were connected through GdmRIII, which might provide a way for Streptomyces to coordinate the biosynthesis of these compounds for better adapting to environment changes.

The efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells has increased rapidly, from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.1% in 2016, with the use of all-solid-state thin-film architecture and by engineering cell structures with mixed-halide perovskites. The emergence of perovskite solar cells has revolutionized the field not only because of their rapidly increased efficiency, but also their flexibility in material growth and architecture. The superior performance of the perovskite solar cells suggested that perovskite materials possess intrinsically unique properties. In this review, we summarize recent theoretical investigations into the structural, electrical, and optical properties of halide perovskite materials in terms of their applications in solar cells. We also discuss some current challenges of using perovskites in solar cells, along with possible theoretical solutions.

The structure, morphology, chemical state and specific surface area of the Pd-SnO2 composite were analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 physisorption, respectively. It is found that the composites consist of large amount of SnO2 microspheres with average diameters up to hundreds of nanometers, and the microspheres are assembled by numerous nanoparticles with average sizes of about 8 nm. To demonstrate their potential application, gas sensors based on the as-synthesized Pd-SnO2 composites were fabricated to test their sensing performances. The 10 mol% Pd-SnO2 composite shows an excellent sensing response towards different concentrations of hydrogen at 200 degrees C. The highest sensing response is up to 315.34 for 3000 ppm hydrogen with a fast response-recovery time (4 s/10 s), which is over 8 times higher than that of pristine SnO2, and the lowest detection limit is down to 10 ppm. More significantly, it presents excellent selectivity and stability for hydrogen. The improved sensing response characteristics of the composite could be attributed to the chemical sensitization and electronic sensitization of Pd catalyst. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we scan the genome-wide SNPs for a large Chinese family with PPD-II/III. We employ the refined IBD algorithm to identify the identity-by-decent (IBD) segments and compare the frequency among the patients and normal relatives. A total of 72 markers of 0.01 percentile of the permutation are identified as the peak signals. Among of them, 57markers locate on chromosome 7q36 which is associated with PPD. Further analyses refine the mapping of candidate region in chromosome 7q36 into two 380 Kb fragments within LMBR1 and SHH respectively. IBD approach is a suitable method for mapping causal gene of human disease. Target-enrichment sequencing as well as functional experiments are required to illustrate the pathogenic mechanisms for PPD in the future.

Genetic diversity and structure of core collection of winter mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) developed by genomic SSR markers	HEREDITAS			English	Article						Core set; Molecular breeding; Molecular marker; Microsatellites	MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; GERMPLASM; CULTIVARS; CHINA; STRATEGIES; POWERCORE; SRAP; SET	Background: A core collection is a subset of an entire collection that represents as much of the genetic diversity of the entire collection as possible. The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management and use of germplasm. However, the establishment of a core collection of mushrooms is still in its infancy, and no established core collection of the economically important species Flammulina velutipes has been reported. Results: We established the first core collection of F. velutipes, containing 32 strains based on 81 genetically different F. veltuipes strains. The allele retention proportion of the core collection for the entire collection was 100%. Moreover, the genetic diversity parameters (the effective number of alleles, Nei's expected heterozygosity, the number of observed heterozygosity, and Shannon's information index) of the core collection showed no significant differences from the entire collection (p > 0.01). Thus, the core collection is representative of the genetic diversity of the entire collection. Genetic structure analyses of the core collection revealed that the 32 strains could be clustered into 6 groups, among which groups 1 to 3 were cultivars and groups 4 to 6 were wild strains. The wild strains from different locations harbor their own specific alleles, and were clustered stringently in accordance with their geographic origins. Genetic diversity analyses of the core collection revealed that the wild strains possessed greater genetic diversity than the cultivars. Conclusion: We established the first core collection of F. velutipes in China, which is an important platform for efficient breeding of this mushroom in the future. In addition, the wild strains in the core collection possess favorable agronomic characters and produce unique bioactive compounds, adding value to the platform. More attention should be paid to wild strains in further strain breeding.

The lactim form of the resonance structure of isatin in protic solvents is the key active dipolarophile that shows chemo- and regioselectivity under experimental and theoretical conditions. This strategy conveniently enabled the assembly of several 1,2,4-oxadiazole[4,5-alpha] indolines with a broad range of functional groups. Compounds 3a and 4b exhibit cytotoxicity in the NCI/ADR-RES, SKOV3, and OVCAR8 cell lines.

J	Li, GQ; Zhang, PF; Sun, JS				Li, Guangquan; Zhang, Pengfei; Sun, Jingshu			A new model describing the interaction between fluid pressure wave in pores and P-wave in rock matrix	GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							LONG-WAVELENGTH PROPAGATION; COMPOSITE ELASTIC MEDIA; LOW-FREQUENCY; INCLUSIONS; RANGE	The interaction between seismic waves in rocks and fluid pressure in pores remains one of the most challenging topics in seismic exploration. A perturbation technique is used to develop a new model to describe the propagation of fluid pressure in pores associated with P-waves in the rock matrix. The basic idea is to approximate classification of waves in saturated rocks into two orders. The first order is a dominant P-wave in the matrix, and the second order is a companion fluid wave induced by the first-order wave. This approach is innovative and advantageous in that the complex interactions of stress between the matrix and fluid are decoupled and the mathematical solutions become easy to seek for. The fluid pressure wave is analyzed by a 1D plane wave ignoring the Poisson's effect. Parameterization of the model using sandstone saturated with water results in the conclusion that the fluid wave has an amplitude one order of magnitude smaller than the matrix wave and the two waves have a very slight phase difference. We have also evaluated the potential application of our model to shale gas and shale oil.

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; HYBRIDIZATION; MEMBER; WELLS	A novel actinobacterium, designated YIM 101593(T), was isolated from the faeces of a primate (Rhinopithecus roxellanae) living in Yunnan Wild Animal Park in Yunnan province, south-west China. The isolate was Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, coccus-shaped, oxidase-negative and motile. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as its diagnostic diamino acid, and mannose, ribose, glucose, galactose and arabinose were detected as the main whole-cell sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-2). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two glycolipids, three unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified lipids. The major fatty acids were C-17:1 omega 8c, C-15:0 and summed feature 4 (anteiso-C-17:1 B and/or iso-C-17:1 I). The DNA G+C content was 69.8 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain YIM 101593(T) and Mobilicoccus pelagius was 97.9 %, and the two strains formed a distinct lineage stably on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. In addition, DNA-DNA relatedness between the two strains was 49.0 +/- 5.1 %. On the basis of chemotaxonomical and physiological characteristics and the phylogenetic analysis, strain YIM 101593(T) should be considered to represent a novel species of the genus Mobilicoccus, for which we propose the name Mobilicoccus caccae sp. nov., with the type strain YIM 101593(T) (=DSM 27611(T) = CCTCC AB 2013229(T)).

NOV.; COMB-NOV; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES	A Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strain, designated YIM X0211(T), was isolated from a soil sample of Shiling County, Yunnan Province, south-west China. The new isolate was characterized taxonomically by using a polyphasic approach. The strain grew optimally at 30 degrees C, at pH 7.0 and with 0-3% (w/v) NaCl. It was positive for catalase and oxidase but negative for H2S production. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain YIM X0211(T) fell within the cluster comprising Sphingobacterium species and clustered with Sphingobacterium mizutaii DSM 11724(T) (97.93% similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 41.2 mol%. The predominant respiratory quinone was menaquinone MK-7. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 2-OH, iso-C-17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16 (:1)omega 6c). The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingolipid, and several unknown phospholipids or lipids. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain YIM X0211(T) and S. mizutaii DSM 11724(T) was 42.3 +/- 0.4 %, which is below the 70% limit for species delineation. These chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain YIM X0211(T) to the genus Sphingobacterium. Based on the recorded phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, it is determined that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM X0211(T) (= KCTC 42696(T) =CGMCC 1.15966(T)).

The solid-state luminescence properties of those Ln-CPs were investigated, realizing the zwitterionic ligand (L) is an excellent antenna chromophore for sensitizing both Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions. We utilized TbL 2 as a representative chemosensor to consider the potential luminescence sensing properties in different solvent suspension, which has the potential to serve as the first case of a luminescent Ln-CP material based on the zwitterionic type of organic ligand for selective and recyclable sensing of acetone in methanol solution.

In this study, a novel isopentyl sulfide (S-201)-impregnated alpha-MnO2 nanorod adsorbent (BISIN) was prepared, characterized, and applied for the selective adsorption and separation of palladium from the leaching liquor of ores. Batch studies were carried out, and the main adsorption parameters were systematically investigated, in addition to the relevant thermodynamic parameters, isotherms, and kinetic models. The thermodynamic parameters reflected the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the adsorption. Moreover, the experimental results indicated that the Langmuir isotherm model fits the palladium adsorption data well and the adsorption was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The main adsorption mechanisms of palladium were elucidated at the molecular level by X-ray crystal structure analysis. Thiourea was found to be an excellent desorption agent, and the palladium-thiourea complex was also confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. The results indicated that almost all of the Pd(II) (>99.0%) is adsorbed on BISIN, whereas less than 2% of the adsorbed Pt(IV), Fe3+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and CO2+ is observed under the optimum conditions. The proposed method can be used for the efficient adsorption and separation of palladium from the leaching liquor of ores.

The results showed that the water solubility and thermal stability of POD were obviously increased in the inclusion complex with HP beta CD. The cytotoxicity of POD/HP beta CD inclusion complex against all the human tumor cell lines investigated still remains. This satisfactory water solubility and high thermal stability of the POD/HP beta CD complex will be potentially useful for their application as herbal medicines or healthcare products.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	EAS age determination from the study of the lateral distribution of charged particles near the shower axis with the ARGO-YBJ experiment	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic rays; Extensive air showers; Shower age; Composition	ENERGY-SPECTRUM; DETECTOR; KNEE	The ARGO-YBJ experiment, a full coverage extensive air shower (EAS) detector located at high altitude (4300 m a.s.I.) in Tibet, China, has smoothly taken data, with very high stability, since November 2007 to the beginning of 2013. The array consisted of a carpet of about 7000 m(2) Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) operated in streamer mode and equipped with both digital and analog readout, providing the measurement of particle densities up to few particles per cm(2). The unique detector features (full coverage, readout granularity, wide dynamic range,..) and location (very high altitude) allowed a detailed study of the lateral density profile of charged particles at ground very close to the shower axis and its description by a proper lateral distribution function (LDF). In particular, the information collected in the first 10 m from the shower axis have been shown to provide a very effective tool for the determination of the shower development stage ("age") in the energy range 50 TeV - 10 PeV. The sensitivity of the age parameter to the mass composition of primary Cosmic Rays is also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

Background: Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth. In the present study, we investigated the endophytic fungal diversity of healthy Panax notoginseng and evaluated its potential antimicrobial activity against five major phytopathogens causing rootrot of P. notoginseng. Methods: A culture-dependent technique, combining morphological and molecular methods, was used to analyze endophytic fungal diversity. A double-layer agar technique was used to challenge the phytopathogens of P. notoginseng. Results: A total of 89 fungi were obtained from the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of P. notoginseng, and 41 isolates representing different morphotypes were selected for taxonomic characterization. The fungal isolates belonged to Ascomycota (96.6%) and Zygomycota (3.4%). All isolates were classified to 23 genera and an unknown taxon belonging to Sordariomycetes. The number of isolates obtained from different tissues ranged from 12 to 42 for leaves and roots, respectively. The selected endophytic fungal isolates were challenged by the root-rot pathogens Alternaria panax, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Phoma herbarum, and Mycocentrospora acerina. Twenty-six of the 41 isolates (63.4%) exhibited activity against at least one of the pathogens tested. Conclusion: Our results suggested that P. notoginseng harbors diversified endophytic fungi that would provide a basis for the identification of new bioactive compounds, and for effective biocontrol of notoginseng root rot.

This biota can be divided into two assemblages on the basis of the biological characteristics, fossil-bearing strata, and their sedimentary environments. Assemblage 1 comprises nonbiomineralized phyllocarids, Sphenothallus, conulariids, complete crinoids and stelleroids, and Burgess Shale-type sponges as well as some uncertain fossils in taxonomy and abundant marine shelly fossils. Assemblage 2 consists of numerous eurypterids, agnathans, chondrichthyes, and a few conulariids, algae, as well as shelly euryhaline fossils. Discoveries of the Fentou biota expand the temporospatial distribution and sedimentary environment of the exceptionally preserved Silurian biota and advances a deeper understanding of the biological assemblage and ecological system in the Llandovery. It also provides new data for studying the biological recovery and radiation under the background of the littoral sea (assemblage 1) and estuary-delta (assemblage 2) environments after the latest Ordovician mass extinction.

Some researchers have proposed NPR methods to simulate different artistic illustrations. However, simulating the new art styles remains extremely challenging. National pyrography is a very famous artistic work in China, and few algorithms have been put forward to illustrate this style. Some exist rendering methods can not demonstrate the main characters of the real pyrography, and the rendering speed is time-consuming using texture synthesis technique. This paper proposes a non-photorealistic rendering technique that automatically generates a gourd pyrography style from a 2D photograph. Similar to the existing exemplar-based methods, an input natural image is regarded as the foreground image, and an input gourd image is taken as the background image. To avoid time-consuming methods like texture synthesis or analogy, this paper simulates character of real pyrography through image abstraction and enhancement from the foreground image. The foreground image will be deformed using equilateral triangle mesh to match the gourd image and mapped to this background image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in producing gourd pyrography stylistic illustrations. Meanwhile, the proposed method is simple, fast, and easy to implement.

Pupil's earthquake evacuation simulation for school building was manipulated in this paper: first, we investigated and analyzed earthquake damage of school building, students' casualties. Second, we established the dynamic model for pedestrian earthquake evacuation; meanwhile, evacuation simulation of 576 school-aged children from grades 1 to 6 who were sitting in classrooms was carried out in the 2014 Ludian earthquake. A range of scenarios (with and without earthquake) was presented where children characteristics (such as size, individual travel speeds for year of different ages), and physical environment characteristics (such as number and size of exits, obstacles including chairs and desks in classroom, walkway and staircase layouts) were investigated. We also considered the building shaking by finite element method during children escaping. The results demonstrated that: total evacuation time for the earthquake scene was longer than that of no earthquake scene, because the floor shaking deferred the evacuation; students cost much more time to escaping from the building which damaged seriously under earthquake; more than 300 students could not evacuate to safe area leading to injuries, which is consistent with the practical situation in the 2014 Ludian earthquake.

The characterizations, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, showed that the crystallinity and morphology of the as-synthesized samples were well-defined beta-MnO2 microrods with the diameters of about 100 nm and lengths of about 2-4 mu m. To explore the optimal degradation conditions, the as-synthesized beta-MnO2 microrods were employed into the degradation of methyl orange dye solution with the concentration of 20 mg/L in the presence of H+ with pH values equalling 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0, respectively. The results indicate that the degradation efficiency could reach 98% after 9 min at the pH value of 1.0 or 2.0. Also, the lower the pH value, the higher the degradation efficiency. Based on these experimental results, a proper mechanism of the degradation process of methyl orange is proposed and the rationality of the mechanism is further investigated through the scientific control tests.

The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared samples were characterized based on XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, UV-vis DRS and PL techniques. The synthesized alpha/beta-Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and 96.9% of EE2 was degraded after only 24 min of visible-light irradiation using alpha/beta-Bi2O3 as photocatalyst. The reaction rate constant over alpha/beta-Bi2O3 photo catalyst was 1.42, 2.23, 9.22 and 54.1 times higher than pure beta-Bi2O3, alpha-Bi2O3+beta-Bi2O3, alpha-Bi2O3 and P25 respectively. Effect of catalyst dosage and pH value was investigated. The possible photocatalytic mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the theoretical calculation and the experimental results. alpha/beta-Bi2O3 was a fairly stable and efficient photocatalyst under the studied experimental conditions, proving that the alpha/beta-Bi2O3 photocatalyst was a promising photocatalyst for the practical application.

The neuroarchitecture of the largest of these modules, the fan-shaped body, is characterized by its stereotypic set of decussating fiber bundles. These are generated during development by axons from four homologous protocerebral lineages which enter the commissural system and subsequently decussate at stereotypic locations across the brain midline. Since the commissural organization prior to fan-shaped body formation has not been previously analyzed in either species, it was not clear how the decussating bundles relate to individual lineages, or if the projection pattern is conserved across species. In this study, we trace the axonal projections from the homologous central complex lineages into the commissural system of the embryonic and larval brains of both the grasshopper and Drosophila. Projections into the primordial commissures of both species are found to be lineage-specific and allow putatively equivalent fascicles to be identified. Comparison of the projection pattern before and after the commencement of axon decussation in both species reveals that equivalent commissural fascicles are involved in generating the columnar neuroarchitecture of the fan-shaped body. Further, the tract-specific columns in both the grasshopper and Drosophila can be shown to contain axons from identical combinations of central complex lineages, suggesting that this columnar neuroarchitecture is also conserved.

Probe 1 selectively recognized UDP in solvant system (DMSO-H2O) over other structurally similar nucleotides. Among all the tested targets, only the addition of UDP resulted in fluorescence enhancement of about 13-fold. Probe 1, the first receptor moiety without metal center, could recognize UDP only by multi H-bonds formed between the organic ligand and the base group in nucleotide. Moreover, probe 1 exhibited excellent cell permeability. The fluorescence imaging of UDP by probe 1 in Hela cells and Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans) demonstrated its potential as a fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of UDP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to epidemiologically divergent subtypes, it shows diverse geographical distributions, which makes it difficult to treat. This disease plays havoc with underdeveloped and developing countries due to scarcity of data and poor awareness among common people. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the geographical distribution of HCV genotypes and RNA viral load along with hemato-biochemical analysis of HCV patients in underdeveloped and neglected areas of Punjab province, Pakistan. Results: Out of 1115 samples, 583 (52.3%) from males and 532 (47.7%) from females were declared as HCV RNA positive samples. In all the three regions, genotype 3 (46.3%) was found to be the most frequent genotype in both genders followed by genotype 2 (28.9%), genotype 1 (12.5%), genotype 4 (2.2%), genotype 5 (1.8%), genotype 6 (1.2%), untypeable genotypes (5.2%), and mixed genotypes (2.41%). Most of the patients had viral load less than 600,000 IU/mL. Conclusions: HCV genotype 3a is the most prevalent genotype in various regions of Punjab. Effective HCV awareness programs and novel therapeutic measures should be enforced to combat against HCV infection. Moreover, geographical distribution and mapping of HCV in Pakistan should be studied to develop better control strategies against HCV infection.

NOV.; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; WATER-QUALITY; ALKALINE; TEMPERATURE; ENZYMES; DENITRIFICATION; TENGCHONG	Chilas and Hunza areas, located in the Main Mantle Thrust and Main Karakoram Thrust of the Himalayas, host a range of geochemically diverse hot springs. This Himalayan geothermal region encompassed hot springs ranging in temperature from 60 to 95 degrees C, in pH from 6.2 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from bicarbonates (Tato Field), sulfates (Tatta Pani) to mixed type (Murtazaabad). Microbial community structures in these geothermal springs remained largely unexplored to date. In this study, we report a comprehensive, culture-independent survey of microbial communities in nine samples from these geothermal fields by employing a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant in all samples from Tato Field, Tatta Pani, and Murtazaabad. The community structures however depended on temperature, pH, and physicochemical parameters of the geothermal sites. The Murtazaabad hot springs with relatively higher temperature (90-95 degrees C) favored the growth of phylum Thermotogae, whereas the Tatta Pani thermal spring site TP-H3-b (60 degrees C) favored the phylum Proteobacteria. At sites with low silica and high temperature, OTUs belonging to phylum Chloroflexi were dominant. Deep water areas of the Murtazaabad hot springs favored the sulfur-reducing bacteria. About 40% of the total OTUs obtained from these samples were unclassified or uncharacterized, suggesting the presence of many undiscovered and unexplored microbiota. This study has provided novel insights into the nature of ecological interactions among important taxa in these communities, which in turn will help in determining future study courses in these sites.

MIT has been successfully applied to analyze; separate and detect macromolecular organic compounds. Furthermore; it has been increasingly applied in assays of biological macromolecules. Owing to its unique features of structure specificity; predictability; recognition and universal application; there has been exploration of the possible application of MIPs in the field of highly selective gas sensors. In this present study; we outline the recent advances in gas sensors based on MIT; classify and introduce the existing molecularly imprinted gas sensors; summarize their advantages and disadvantages; and analyze further research directions.

In this study, the process of co-extracting and separating Pd(II) and Pt(II) over Fe(III), Cu(I), Co(III), and Ni(I) from alkaline cyanide liquors was investigated. RESULTSThe results showed that almost all Pd(II) and Pt(II) (>98.0%) could be simultaneously extracted by phenoxyethyl dimethyl palmitylammonium bromide (PDPB), whereas Fe(III), Cu(I), Co(III), and Ni(I) was below 3.0% under optimum conditions. Furthermore, Pd(CN)(4)(2-) and Pt(CN)(4)(2-) were separated and recovered by the two-step stripping process. First, Pd(CN)(4)(2-) in mixed organic phase was stripped by a 2.0 mol L-1 ammonium thiocyanate solution. The stripping percentage of Pd(CN)(4)(2-) was >98%, whereas the stripped Pt(CN)(4)(2-) was below 1%. Second, more than 97.5% Pt(CN)(4)(2-) in the loaded organic phase could be stripped using 1.0 mol L-1 thiodiglycol solution. Recovery ratios for both Pd(II) and Pt(II) were above 95%. The organic phase could be reused for at least 6 cycles of extraction-stripping processes. The mechanisms of extraction reaction were deduced to be ion-association mechanisms. CONCLUSIONThe process could be applied for extracting and separating palladium and platinum from the cyanide leaching liquor of the flotation concentrate.

The effects of minor perturbations to individual observations, the prior distributions of parameters, and the sampling distribution on the statistical inference are assessed with various perturbation schemes. A Bayesian perturbation manifold is constructed to characterize such perturbation schemes. The first- and second-order influence measures are proposed to quantify the degree of minor perturbations on different aspects of a statistical model via objective functions, such as Bayes factor. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of the Bayesian local influence procedure. An application to a study of bone mineral density is presented.

For applications in electronics and photonics, several distinct functional organic thin films are stacked together to create a variety of devices such as organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells. The energy levels at these thin-film junctions dictate various electronic processes such as the charge transport across these junctions, the exciton dissociation rates at donor-acceptor molecular interfaces, and the charge trapping during exciton formation in a host-dopant system. These electronic processes are vital to a device's performance and functionality. To uncover a general scientific principle in governing the interface energy levels, highest occupied molecular orbitals, and vacuum level dipoles, herein a comprehensive experimental research is conducted on several dozens of organic-organic heterojunctions representative of various device applications. It is found that the experimental data map on interface energy levels, after correcting variables such as molecular orientation-dependent ionization energies, consists of three distinct regions depending on interface fundamental physical parameters such as Fermi energy, work function, highest occupied molecular orbitals, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. This general energy map provides a master guide in selection of new materials for fabricating future generations of organic semiconductor devices.

Previously, a Western ancestry for West African pigs was reported based on loci that are involved in the determination of coat color. We investigated the genetic diversity of Nigerian indigenous pigs (NIP) by simultaneously analyzing variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome sequence and the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene. Results: Median-joining network analysis of mtDNA D-loop sequences from 201 NIP and previously characterized loci clustered NIP with populations from the West (Europe/ North Africa) and East/ Southeast Asia. Analysis of partial sequences of the Y-chromosome in 57 Nigerian boars clustered NIP into lineage HY1. Finally, analysis of MC1R in 90 NIP resulted in seven haplotypes, among which the European wild boar haplotype was carried by one individual and the European dominant black by most of the other individuals (93%). The five remaining unique haplotypes differed by a single synonymous substitution from European wild type, European dominant black and Asian dominant black haplotypes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a European and East/Southeast Asian ancestry for NIP. Analyses of MC1R provide further evidence. Additional genetic analyses and archaeological studies may provide further insights into the history of African pig breeds. Our findings provide a valuable resource for future studies on whole-genome analyses of African pigs.

Here, we report the complete genome sequence of S. autolyticus CGMCC 0516, which consists of a 10,029,028 bp linear chromosome and seven circular plasmids. Fifty-seven putative biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites were found. The geldanamycin, autolytimycin, and reblastatin biosynthetic gene clusters were located on the left arm (2.06-2.15 Mb) of the chromosome, and the elaiophylin gene cluster was located on the right arm (9.45-9.53 Mb). Twenty-one putative gene clusters with high or moderate similarity to important antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters were found, including the antitumor agents echoside, bafilomycin, hygrocin, and toxoflavin; the antibacterial/antifungal agents nigericin, skyllamycin, kanamycin, naphthomycin, eco-02301, and bottromycin A2; the immunosuppressants meridamycin and brasilicardin A; the anti-inflammatory agent cyclooctatin; and the acute iron poisoning medication desferrioxamine B. The genome sequence reported here will enable us to study the biosynthetic mechanism of these important antibiotics and will facilitate the discovery of novel secondary metabolites with potential applications to human health.

This paper presents element geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic records of core CM97 in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and core MD06-3040 on the inner shelf of East China Sea, aiming to reconstruct the Changjiang sediment source to sink transport process and its major controlling mechanism during the Holocene. Driven by the asynchronous evolution of the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon, the provenance of sediments accumulated in the Changjiang Estuary gradually changed from the upper catchment during the late glacial period to the mid lower valley in the early mid Holocene. With the intensive agricultural cultivation and urbanization development in the catchment during the late Holocene, the major source of Changjiang sediment into the sea shifted back to the upper catchment, again. The high-frequency ENSO activity may superimpose the effect of human disturbances on sediment source-to-sink process in the late Holocene. Therefore, the Holocene provenance evolution of Changjiang sediments in the East China Sea witnessed the changes of governing sediment erosion process within a large catchment from monsoon climate-dominated to anthropogenic driving. Our study also suggests the strong effect of hydrodynamics in coastal and shelf environments on sedimentary geochemical compositions, which deserves more attention in further sediment provenance study.

J	Rits, DS; van Balen, RT; Prins, MA; Zheng, HB				Rits, Daniel S.; van Balen, Ronald T.; Prins, Maarten A.; Zheng, Hongbo			Evolution of the alluvial fans of the Luo River in the Weihe Basin, central China, controlled by faulting and climate change - A reevaluation of the paleogeographical setting of Dali Man site	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Luo river; Alluvial fan; Fluvial incision; Weihe basin; Neotectonics; Dali man	TIBETAN PLATEAU; NORTHERN CHINA; ESR/U-SERIES; YELLOW-RIVER; DEPOSITS; MONSOON; UPLIFT; ARCHITECTURE; TIMESCALE; TECTONICS	The Luo River is located in the southern part of the Chinese Loess Plateau and the northern part of the Weihe Basin, in Central China. In the basin it flows proximal to the site of the Luyang Wetland core, which is an important archive of climate change over the past 1 Myr in this region. In this paper, the contribution of the Luo River to the sedimentary record is analyzed by reconstructing the evolution of this river during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. It is argued that an alluvial fan of the Luo River has contributed to the sedimentary archive until approximately 200-240 ka. From this moment onwards, the fan became incised and terraces began to form. The formation of a new alluvial fan further downstream led to the disconnection of the Luo River from the Luyang Wetland core site. We propose that this series of events was caused by the displacement of an intra-basinal fault and the resultant faulting-forced folding, which caused increased relative subsidence, and thus increased sedimentation rates at the core site. Therefore, a complete sediment record in the 'Luyang Wetland' was preserved, despite the disconnection from the Luo River. The chronology of the fans and terraces was established using existing age control (U-series, ESR, OSL, pIRIR(290) and magnetic susceptibility correlation), and through correlation of the loess-paleosol cover to marine isotope stages. Based on sedimentological characteristics of the fluvial sequence, we suggest that incision of the Luo River occurred in two steps. Small incisions took place at transitions to interglacials and the main incision phases occur at the transition from an interglacial to glacial climate. Due to the incision, basal parts of the oldest Luo River alluvial fan are exposed, and it is in one of these exposures that the famous Dali Man skull was retrieved. This study shows that the Dali Man did not live on a river terrace as previously thought, but on an aggrading alluvial fan, during wet, glacial conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

IL-1 beta activates microglia and stimulates glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NMDA receptor expression, thereby disturbing intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca2+ disequilibrium, in turn, may trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, contributing to overall excitotoxicity and neuronal death that evoke AD. However, it is unclear whether IL-1 beta-induced neuronal apoptosis is mediated by the glutamatergic system, ER stress and/or Ca2+ dysfunction. The present study investigated the role of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in ER stress and IL-1 beta-evoked neuronal death by assessing NMDAR-induced Ca2+ overload and NMDA-mediated ER stress. Male Long Evans rats were treated with IL-1 beta (with or without NMDAR antagonist MK801) injected intracerebroventricularly for 8 days. Glutamate concentration was measured by HPLC, and mRNA and protein expression of microglial biomarkers and NMDAR, as well as markers of Ca2+ overload (caplain2) and ER stress (glucose-regulated protein 78, GRP78, and C/EBP homologous protein-10, CHOP), were assessed by real-time PCR and western blot. Apoptosis was also evaluated in the hippocampal neurons using TUNEL Overall, IL-1 beta induced robust neuronal apoptosis, accompanied by upregulated NMDAR, caplain2, GRP78 and CHOP. MK801 pretreatment significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis and NMDA up-regulation, also reducing GRP78 and CHOP expression. In summary, these results suggest that IL-1 beta may disturb intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis via NMDAR-mediated mechanism, thereby triggering neuronal apoptosis by enhancing ER stress.

The rationale is that crop yield losses occur because the physiology of the growing crop is negatively affected by pests and diseases in a dynamic way over time as crop both grows and develops. Metapopulation dynamics can thus be used to model the resultant crop yield losses. The stochastic metapopulation process is described by using the Simplified Incidence Function model (IFM). Compared to the original IFMs, endogenous and exogenous periodicities are considered in the proposed model to handle the cyclical patterns observed in pest infestations, diseases epidemics, and exogenous affecting factors such as temperature and rainfalls. Agricultural loss data in China are used to fit the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Model with endogenous and exogenous periodicities is a better fit; (2) When the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are negatively correlated, EIL or the cost of loss is monotonically increasing; when the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an outbreak of pests and diseases might occur; (3) If the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an optimal patch size can be identified which will greatly weaken the effects of external environmental influence and hence inhibit pest infestations and disease epidemics.

Next-generation sequencing technology has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume of genomic data for pigs. However, the limited amount of variation data provided by dbSNP, and non-congruent criteria used for calling variation, present considerable hindrances to the utility of this data. We used a uniform pipeline, based on GATK, to identify non-redundant, high-quality, whole-genome SNPs from 280 pigs and 6 outgroup species. A total of 64.6 million SNPs were identified in 280 pigs and 36.8 million in the outgroups. We then used LUMPY to identify a total of 7 236 813 structural variations (SVs) in 211 pigs. Positively selected loci were identified through five statistical tests of different evolutionary attributes of the SNPs. Combining the non-redundant variations and the evolutionary selective scores, we built the first pig-specific variation database, PigVar (http://www.ibiomedical.net/pigvar/), which is a web-based open-access resource. PigVar collects parameters of the variations including summary lists of the locations of the variations within protein-coding and long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, whether the SNPs are synonymous or non-synonymous, their ancestral and derived states, geographic sampling locations, as well as breed information. The PigVar database will be kept operational and updated to facilitate medical research using the pig as model and agricultural research including pig breeding.

In this study, Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-101 and NH2-MIL-101, are fabricated through a general facile strategy. Their performance as an adsorbent for phosphate removal is investigated. Experiments are performed to study the effects of various factors on the phosphate adsorption, including adsorbent dosage, contact time and co-existing ions. Both MIL-101(Fe) and NH2-MIL-101(Fe) show highly effective removal of phosphates from aqueous solutions, and the concentration of phosphates decrease sharply from the initial 0.60 mg.L-1 to 0.045 and 0.032 mg.L-1, respectively, within just 30 min of exposure. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms reveal that NH2-MIL-101(Fe) has higher adsorption capacity than MIL-101(Fe) possibly due to the amine group. Furthermore, the Fe-based MOFs also exhibit a high selectivity towards phosphate over other anions such as chloride, bromide, nitrate and sulfate. Particularly, the prepared Fe-based MIL-101 materials are also capable of adsorbing phosphate in an actual eutrophic water sample and display better removal effect.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Search for Gamma-Ray Bursts with the ARGO-YBJ Detector in Shower Mode	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma-ray burst: general	VERY-HIGH-ENERGY; GRB 130427A; BRIGHT GRB; EMISSION; TEV; CONSTRAINTS; SWIFT; AFTERGLOW; DURATION; REDSHIFT	The ARGO-YBJ detector, located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a. s. l., Tibet, China), was a "full coverage" (central carpet with an active area of similar to 93%) air shower array dedicated to gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray studies. The wide field of view (similar to 2 sr) and high duty cycle (> 86%), made ARGO-YBJ suitable to search for short and unexpected gamma-ray emissions like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Between 2007 November 6 and 2013 February 7, 156 satellite-triggered GRBs (24 of them with known redshift) occurred within the ARGO-YBJ field of view (zenith angle theta <= 45 degrees). A search for possible emission associated with. these GRBs has been made in the two energy ranges 10-100 GeV and 10-1000 GeV. No significant excess has been found in time coincidence with the satellite detections nor in a set of different time windows inside the interval of one hour after the bursts. Taking into account the EBL absorption, upper limits to the energy fluence at a 99% confidence level have been evaluated, with values ranging from similar to 10(-5) erg cm(-2) to similar to 10(-1) erg cm(-2). The Fermi-GBM burst GRB 090902B, with a high-energy photon of 33.4 GeV detected by Fermi-LAT, is discussed in detail.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

Using two techniques (i. e., the maximum likelihood optimization and the exposure-weighted aperture photometry), we obtain gamma-ray light curves from Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data covering from 2008 August to 2016 December. We then analyze the light curves with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet Z-transform. A gamma-ray quasi-periodicity with a period of 3.35 +/- 0.68 yr is found at the significance level of. 3.6 s. The optical-UV flux covering from 2005 August to 2013 April provided by the ASI Science Data Center is also analyzed, but no significant quasi-periodicity is found. It should be pointed out that the result of the optical-UV data could be tentative because of the incompleteness of the data. Further long-term multiwavelength monitoring of this FSRQ is needed to confirm its quasi-periodicity.

Current knowledge of primary succession is mainly from studies of vegetation dynamics, whereas information about belowground microbes remains unclear. Here, we combined shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. We investigated fungal succession and community assembly via high-throughput sequencing along a well-established glacier forefront chronosequence that spans 2-188 years of deglaciation. Shannon diversity and evenness peaked at a distance of 370m and declined afterwards. The response of fungal diversity to distance varied in different phyla. Basidiomycota Shannon diversity significantly decreased with distance, while the pattern of Rozellomycota Shannon diversity was unimodal. Abundance of most frequencies OTU2 (Cryptococcus terricola) increased with successional distance, whereas that of OTU65 (Tolypocladium tundrense) decreased. Based on null deviation analyses, composition of the fungal community was initially governed by deterministic processes strongly but later less deterministic processes. Our results revealed that distance, altitude, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and NH4+-N significantly correlated with fungal community composition along the chronosequence. These results suggest that the drivers of fungal community are dynamics in a glacier chronosequence, that may relate to fungal ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem. The information will provide understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of microbial community assembly during ecosystem succession under different scales and scenario.

Traditionally, restoration techniques have been centered on ex situ asymbiotic or symbiotic seed germination techniques that are not cost-effective, have limited genetic potential and often result in low survival rates in the field. Here, we propose a novel in situ advanced restoration-friendly program for the endangered epiphytic orchid species Dendrobium devonianum, in which a series of in situ symbiotic seed germination trials base on conspecific fungal isolates were conducted at two sites in Yunnan Province, China. We found that percentage germination varied among treatments and locations; control treatments ( no inoculum) did not germinate at both sites. We found that the optimal treatment, having the highest in situ seed germination rate (0.94-1.44%) with no significant variation among sites, supported a warm, moist and fixed site that allowed for light penetration. When accounting for seed density, percentage germination was highest (2.78-2.35%) at low densities and did not vary among locations for the treatment that supported optimal conditions. Similarly for the same treatment, seed germination ranged from 0.24 to 5.87% among seasons but also did vary among sites. This study reports on the cultivation and restoration of an endangered epiphytic orchid species by in situ symbiotic seed germination and is likely to have broad application to the horticulture and conservation of the Orchidaceae.

Herein, a palladium(NIXANTPHOS)-based catalyst for the monoarylation of 4-pyridylmethyl 2-aryl ethers to generate diarylated 4-pyridyl methyl ethers is introduced. Furthermore, under similar conditions, the diarylation of 4-pyridyl methyl ethers with aryl bromides has been developed. These methods enable the synthesis of new pyridine derivatives, which are common in medicinally active compounds and have applications in materials science.

A metal-organic compound, cuprous 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (CuTCNQ), is presented as a new kind of cathode material for SIBs. It consists of both cationic (Cu-II <-> Cu-I) and anionic (TCNQ(0)<-> TCNQ(-)<-> TCNQ(2-)) reversible redox reactions, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 255 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 20 mAg(-1). The synergistic effect of both redox-active metal cations and organic anions brings an electrochemical transfer of multiple electrons. The transformation of cupric ions to cuprous ions occurs at near 3.80 V vs. Na+/Na, while the full reduction of TCNQ(0) to TCNQ(-) happens at 3.00-3.30 V. The remarkably high voltage is attributed to the strong inductive effect of the four cyano groups.

However, there is little knowledge on the distribution and identity of DSEs in non-mycorrhizal' plants. In the current study, colonization and diversity of DSEs colonizing the roots of eight typically non-mycorrhizal' families were assessed. In total, 120 root samples of 31 plant species were all colonized by DSEs. Intensity of DSE colonization varied greatly among different plant species, with a range of 0.56-47.56%, 8.13% on average. Cladosporium, Cyphellophora and Phialophora were the dominant genera, with a relative abundance of more than 60% over a total of 90 isolates. Our results showed that diverse DSE species colonized the roots of non-mycorrhizal' plants, especially they were more common in degraded mine tailings than in the undisturbed site, but their integral roles to the functional roots are in need of further experimental demonstration.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction. In arduous tasks of ship detection in multispectral imagery, large amount of multispectral data require real-time processing and analyzing. As a very fast and effective technique for saliency detection, the proposed method is modified and applied to automatic ship detection in multispectral imagery. The robustness of the method against sea clutters is further proved.

It was found that monomethylolurea or N,N'-dimethylolurea can produce the methyleneurea intermediate (-HN-CO-N=CH2) with the catalysis of base. The E1cb (unimolecular elimination of conjugate base) mechanism was identified for the formation of such an intermediate. The potential energy barrier was theoretically predicted to be 59.6 kJ/mol for the E1cb step, which is about half of that of previously proposed S(N)2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism. In the subsequentcondensation reactions, Michael addition reactions that lead to different condensed structures can occur between the methyleneurea intermediate and the anions produced from methylolureas under alkaline conditions. Based on the theoretical calculations on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the selected reactions, the competitive formations of methylene linkages, ether linkages and uron were discussed in combination with our previous experimental observations.

The black PC-cathode consists of a front thin semitransparent metal layer, an organic PC layer, and a rear thick reflective metal layer. To achieve a targeted high contrast over the full visible spectrum, several organic molecules and their binary and ternary compounds were researched to meet optical design requirement. By combining a design in the complex refractive index and in the thickness of the PC layer, it is demonstrated that the optical reflectance of the HC-OLED can be reduced from similar to 80% to below that of the glass substrate (similar to 5%) by using a ternary organic compound as the PC layer. This black PC-cathode produces extremely high optical contrast, and yet it does not alter the current voltage characteristics of the device.

It belongs to a conserved P-loop NTPase superfamily, descending from a common ancestor of Lepidopteran clade. However, the characterization of beta-chain of ATPase in apoptotic cells and its involvement in development remain unknown. Here, the ectopic expression and endogenous FoF1-ATPase beta-chain occurred on S. litura cell membrane: in vivo, at the late stage of apoptotic hemocyte, endogenous FoF1-ATPase beta-chain was stably expressed during M. bicoloratus larva development from 4 to 7 days post-parasitization; in vitro, at an early stage of pre-apoptotic Spli221 cells by infecting with M. bicoloratus bracovirus particles, the proteins were speedily recover expression. Furthermore, endogenous FoF1-ATPase beta-chain was localized on the apoptotic cell membrane. RNA interference (RNAi) of FoF1-ATPase beta-chain led to significantly decreased head capsule width. This suggested that FoF1-ATPase beta-chain positively regulated the development of S. litura. The RNAi effect on the head capsule width was enhanced with parasitism. Our research found that FoF1-ATPase beta-chain was expressed and localized on the cell membrane in the apoptotic cells, and involved in the development of S. litura.

Quantifying hydrological changes in high and remote areas is practically challenging. However, stable isotopes in river water can be seen to vary, dependent upon the combined influence exerted by recharge sources and local climatic conditions; the study of river water stable isotopes can therefore provide a meaningful method for delineating catchment-scale hydrological studies. In this study, we present high-resolution time series of river delta C-18 and d-excess values; additionally, we identify the seasonal dynamics of river recharge sources and major components of the catchment-scale water balance, together with precipitation and groundwater isotopes, and concurrent meteorological data recorded in Magazangbu catchment on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Using isotopic analysis, and within a proportional framework, we partitioned the isotopic fractionation (El) or non-fractionation (E2) from soil evaporation fluxes (E-soil) apparent in different processes, using NDVI (Normal Differential Vegetation Index) data collected by MODIS satellites to calculate the vegetation fractional coverage (VFC), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) records to determine evapotranspiration data (ET). Finally, the contributions made by each ET component (E-soil and plant transpiration) to total catchment ET were computed for the high and remote northwestern TP. Our results show that: (1) river 8180 values were high in summer and low in winter, while d-excess values displayed a contrary seasonal cycle; (2) for the monsoon period, precipitation contributed 60.6% to Magazangbu catchment runoff. Deeper groundwater was the main water source for the winter low base flow, and shallow groundwater or high elevation snowmelt was the principal component of the spring thaw and autumn freezing periods; and (3) a substantial proportion of E-soil (96.4% annually; 92.2% during monsoon) was consumed without isotopic fractionation (E2); plant transpiration (T) constituted less than half of total ET (41% annually, 29% during monsoon) in Magazangbu catchment. This calculation of river recharge sources and partitioning of catchment ET components using isotopic signals and MODIS NDVI data or GLDAS ET data provide new methods for hydrological studies in high and remote areas. These results provide important catchment-scale water-balance information which is very useful to climate models conducted in a high-elevation arid environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial activity in these zones accelerates mineral biogeochemical deterioration and metal release, and our results confirmed that Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Cupriavidus strains accelerate adamite leaching by 10 to 465 times compared to controls. Here, the Pseudomonas chlororaphis ZK-1 bacterial strain in a static 42-day cultivation proved more effective than Rhodococcus and Cupriavidus by leaching over 90% arsenic and 10% zinc from adamite in one-step in vitro. We evaluated adamite with the VESTA visualization system for electronic and structural analysis, and our results enhance understanding of zinc and arsenic biogeochemical cycles and mobilization, and highlight bacteria's beneficial natural and biotechnological application in environmental geochemistry and biohydrometallurgy.

(gla.) S 'K326'), was successfully crossed with N.alata. Despite a high DNA content variability, F-1 hybrids could be classified in two subgroups, a major one encompassing fertile hybrids morphologically similar to their tobacco maternal parent but TSWV sensitive, and a minor one displaying sterile hybrids showing an intermediate phenotype and TSWV resistant. In order to elucidate the unexpected fertility recovery of the fertile F-1 plants, some N.alata fertility restoration ppr genes were cloned and were shown to be differentially expressed between parental lineages as well as between both F-1 subgroups, suggesting that N.alata contains fertility restoring allele able to overcome the CMS of N.tabacum.

By integrating principal component analysis (PCA) with annual seasonal trend analysis (ASTA), this study assessed karst rocky desertification (KRD) within a spatial context. We first produced fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index using a dimidiate pixel model. Then, we generated three main components of the annual FVC data using PCA. Subsequently, we generated the slope image of the annual seasonal trends of FVC using median trend analysis. Finally, we combined the three PCA components and annual seasonal trends of FVC with the incidence of KRD for each type of carbonate rock to classify KRD into one of four categories based on K-means cluster analysis: high, moderate, low, and none. The results of accuracy assessments indicated that this combination approach produced greater accuracy and more reasonable KRD mapping than the average FVC based on the vegetation coverage standard. The KRD map for 2010 indicated that the total area of KRD was 78.76 x 10(3) km(2), which constitutes about 4.06% of the eight southwest provinces of China. The largest KRD areas were found in Yunnan province. The combined PCA and ASTA approach was demonstrated to be an easily implemented, robust, and flexible method for the mapping and assessment of KRD, which can be used to enhance regional KRD management schemes or to address assessment of other environmental issues.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			Contribution of Urban Surface Expansion to Regional Warming in Beijing, China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPERATURE TRENDS; URBANIZATION; CLIMATE; IMPACT; MODEL	The contribution of urban surface expansion to regional warming as detected from meteorological observational station data may vary with considerable uncertainty because of the spatial heterogeneity of such data-a situation that promotes a requirement for numerical model-based investigations. Satellite-based images from 1980 to 2016 that have fine resolution over three city clusters and that display the urban surface expansion in China from rapid economic development and anthropogenic activity were used to perform 37-yr nested dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The urban surface areas in Beijing, China, expressed marked expansion in the last 37 years. The contribution of urban surface expansion to regional warming was approximately 22% of the overall warming in Beijing and was stronger in the plains areas of Beijing (42%). The contributions to land-use grids that changed from nonurban (in 1980) to urban (in 2016; N2U) were much stronger than those to grids that were classified as urban in both time periods (U2U), which were closer to the values of urban areas (including N2U and U2U) because of the intense increase in urban surface areas. Urban-related warming expressed marked annual variation and was greater in the warm seasons and smaller in the cold seasons. The greater increase in surface air temperature (SAT) minimum and the weaker SAT maximum accounted for the decreased diurnal temperature range.

Genome-wide association studies have identified the CDH13 gene as one of the most important candidate genes in influencing plasma adiponectin levels. Several studies recently reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDH13 gene were associated with T2DM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between T2DM and 6 SNPs (rs11646213, rs12596316, rs3865188, rs12444338, rs12051272, and rs7195409) in the CDH13 gene in a Han Chinese population. A total of 674 subjects with T2DM and 588 subjects without T2DM were genotyped using the TaqMan method. Our data showed that there was an association between the SNP-rs12596316 genotype and T2DM (P<.05). Moreover, an overdominant model of inheritance showed that being an rs12596316AG heterozygote increased the risk of T2DM (P=.0041, odds ratio=1.39; 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.73) in comparison with rs12596316AA-GG. The other 5 SNPs did not show associations with T2DM, either in the allele levels or in different inheritance models. The haplotype analysis showed that there were no associations between any haplotypes and T2DM. Our results revealed that genetic variations in the CDH13 gene were associated with T2DM susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. These results highlight the need to study the functional effects of these CDH13 gene variants in relation to the risk of developing T2DM.

The as-prepared chicken egg white stabilized gold nanocluster probe has strong red fluorescence emission, which can be quenched by mercury ions and copper ions sensitively. By using an ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) masking method, mercury ions in the range from 0.60 to 10 mu M can be linearly detected with the limit of detection (LOD, 3 sigma) of 0.510 mu M in the presence of equivalent copper ions. Since the preparation of a chicken egg white stabilized gold nanocluster probe is fast, easy and cheap, this selective analytical method for mercury pollution monitoring in environmental waters may be widely used in daily life by ordinary people.

This teleconnection pattern is characterized by an eastward propagating wave train with a zonal wavenumber of 5-6 between 20A degrees and 40A degrees N, extending from the northwest coast of Africa to East Asia, and thus is referred to as the Africa-Asia multidecadal teleconnection pattern (AAMT). One-point correlation maps show that the teleconnectivity of AAMT is strong and further demonstrate the existence of the AAMT. The AAMT shapes the spatial structure of multidecadal change in atmospheric circulation over the NA-EA region, and in particular the AAMT pattern and associated fields show similar structures to the change occurring around the early 1960s. A strong in-phase relationship is observed between the AAMT and Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) and this connection is mainly due to Rossby wave dynamics. Barotropic modeling results suggest that the upper-level Rossby wave source generated by the AMV can excite the AAMT wave train, and Rossby wave ray tracing analysis further highlights the role of the Asian jet stream in guiding the wave train to East Asia. The AAMT acts as an atmospheric bridge conveying the influence of AMV onto the downstream multidecadal climate variability. The AMV is closely related to the coordinated change in surface and tropospheric air temperatures over Northwest Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Central China, which may result from the adiabatic expansion/compression of air associated with the AAMT.

Genotype by environment (GxE) interactions for grain yield were investigated in 22 perennial rice (Oryza sativa L./Oryza longistaminata) derivatives over four successive growing seasons at three sites in Yunnan in southern China and one site in Lao PDR. The GxE interaction accounted for 25.7% of the total sum of squares, with environment and genotype responsible for 57.4% and 16.9%, respectively. Cluster analysis identified seven environment and six genotype groups, which accounted for 55.6% of the GxE sum of squares. Principal component axes 1, 2 and 3 accounted for 42.3%, 19.1% and 16.5% of the GxE-SS, respectively, with PCA1 indicating yield potential, PCA2 delay in phenology under environmental stress, and PCA3 ratoon percentage. Environment groups differed in mean temperature, whether dry season or wet season, and occurrence of environmental stresses, such as periods of low minimum temperature or periods of rainfall deficit. Genotype groups differed in adaptation to these diverse environments. For genotype groups, G5 (PR23) was highest-yielding and broadly adapted across environments, while G1 (line 188, both 137s, both 139s, both 147s) was low-yielding and poorly adapted. Other genotype groups showed preferential adaptation: G3 (lines 60, 251, 264, Bt69, Bt71) to Simao/Dry Season (E3 and E4), G4 (lines 75, 243, 246, 249, 255) to Menglian/Wet Season (El and E2), G2 (line TZ) to Jing Hong 2013 (E7), and G6 (lines 56, 59, 214) to Jing Hong 2102 and Na Pok (E6 and E5). The results imply that regrowth success and maintenance of spikelet fertility over regrowth cycles are important for adaptation of perennial rice, especially to low minimum temperature at higher altitude and rainfall deficit at lower altitude, and future breeding programmes in perennial rice should address these environmental stresses. The high yield and broad adaptation of PR23 (G5) over environments makes it a prime candidate for release to stabilise fragile lands in the humid and subhumid tropics, while contributing grain and forage in mixed-farming systems.

Herein, its anti-tumor effect on lung cancer correlated with mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was investigated. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that HSP-III induces the apoptosis of H1299 cells; however the proliferation viability of normal lung epithelial cells is not affected. HSP-III treatment collapses the H1299 cell mitochondrial membrane potential, and western blot analysis of cytochrome C, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 further indicates that apoptotic effects induced by HSP-III is through the mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, we found the apoptotic effects of HSP-III are triggered by Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Blue native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) showed the expressions of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-V were also decreased. Taken together, anti-tumor effect of HSP-III is through intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis mechanism pathway and involving ROS increasing. Finally, in vivo nude mice experiment, HSP-III attenuated the growth of tumor compared with control. In contrast, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could restore the cell apoptosis effects induced by HSP-III. These findings suggest that HSP-III induce apoptosis of H1299 cells and attenuated growth of nude mice tumor in vivo through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and stimulating ROS. HSP-III could be a composition for lung cancer treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the current study, mechanical allodynia tests, electroencephalograms, electromyogram recordings and c-Fos expression in neuropathic pain-like model mice of partial sciatic nerve ligation were used to investigate the effect of helicid on neuropathic pain and co-morbid insomnia. Our results showed that helicid at a dose of 100, 200 or 400mgkg(-1) could increase the mechanical threshold by 2.5-, 2.8- and 3.1-fold for 3h after administration, respectively. Helicid at 200 and 400mgkg(-1) given at 07:00hours increased the amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep in a 3-h period by 1.27- and 1.35-fold in partial sciatic nerve ligated mice. However, helicid (400mgkg(-1)) given at 21:00hours did not change the sleep pattern in normal mice. Immunohistochemical study showed that helicid (400mgkg(-1)) administration could reverse the increase of c-Fos expression in the neurons of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and tuberomammillary nucleus, and the decrease of c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic area caused by partial sciatic nerve ligation. These results indicate that helicid is an effective agent for both neuropathic pain and sleep disturbances in partial sciatic nerve ligated mice.

Historically they have been used in many ways by humans, including as ornamental plants, domestic utensils, foods, and in handicrafts. In addition, they have found uses as medicinal herbs. Ferns produce a wide array of secondary metabolites endowed with different bioactivities that could potentially be useful in the treatment of many diseases. However, there is currently relatively little information in the literature on the phytochemicals present in ferns and their pharmacological applications, and the most recent review of the literature on the occurrence, chemotaxonomy and physiological activity of fern secondary metabolites was published over 20 years ago, by Soeder (Bot Rev 51:442-536, 1985). Here, we provide an updated review of this field, covering recent findings concerning the bioactive phytochemicals and pharmacology of fern species.

Hough transform (HT) is one very typical method for road detection, especially for straight line road detection. Although many variants of Hough transform have been reported, it is still a great challenge to develop a low computational complexity and time-saving Hough transform algorithm. In this paper, we propose a generalized Hough transform (i.e., Radon transform) implementation for road detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we present a dictionary learning method to approximate the Radon transform. The proposed approximation method treats a Radon transform as a linear transform, which then facilitates parallel implementation of the Radon transform for multiple images. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on the popular RSSCN7 database for straight road detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to the traditional algorithms in terms of accuracy and computing complexity.

Sentinel-2 MSI provides spectral bands with different resolutions, including RGB and Near-Infra-Red (NIR) bands in 10 m and Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) bands in 20 m, which are closely related to surface water information. It is necessary to define a pan-like band for the Sentinel-2 image sharpening process because of the replacement of the panchromatic band by four high-resolution multi-spectral bands (10 m). This study, which aimed at urban surface water extraction, utilised the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) at 10 m resolution as a high-resolution image to sharpen the 20 m SWIR bands. Then, object-level Modified NDWI (MNDWI) mapping and minimum valley bottom adjustment threshold were applied to extract water maps. The proposed method was compared with the conventional most related band- (between the visible spectrum/NIR and SWIR bands) based and principal component analysis first component-based sharpening. Results show that the proposed NDWI-based MNDWI image exhibits higher separability and is more effective for both classification-level and boundary-level final water maps than traditional approaches.

However, few studies have focused on drought monitoring in this region due to lack of ground observations. The newly released Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) with a long-term record and high resolution has a great potential for drought monitoring. Based on the assessment of CHIRPS for capturing precipitation and monitoring drought, this study aims to evaluate the drought condition in LMB by using satellite-based CHIRPS from January 1981 to July 2016. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at various time scales (1-12-month) is computed to identify and describe drought events. Results suggest that CHIRPS can properly capture the drought characteristics at various time scales with the best performance at three-month time scale. Based on high-resolution long-term CHIRPS, it is found that LMB experienced four severe droughts during the last three decades with the longest one in 1991-1994 for 38 months and the driest one in 2015-2016 with drought affected area up to 75.6%. Droughts tend to occur over the north and south part of LMB with higher frequency, and Mekong Delta seems to experience more long-term and extreme drought events. Severe droughts have significant impacts on vegetation condition.

Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to investigate the thermodynamics and geometry of naringin/cyclodextrin cavity docking. The complexes were investigated by UV, FT-IR, DSC, XRD, SEM, 2D-NOSEY and H-1-NMR analyses. Clearly visible protons belonging to naringin and chemical shift displacements of the H3 and H5 protons in cyclodextrin were anticipated in the formation of an inclusion complex. Naringin solubility increased linearly with increasing cyclodextrin concentration (displaying an A(L) profile). The simulations indicated that the phenyl group of naringin was located deep within the cyclodextrin cavity, while the glycoside group of naringin was on the plane of the wider rim of cyclodextrin. The simulation and molecular modeling results indicate that (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) provided the more stable inclusion complex. This result was also in good concordance with the stability constants that had been determined by the phase solubility method. The consistency of the computational and experimental results indicates their reliability.

In this paper, the authors propose the joint location, scale and skewness models when the data set under consideration involves asymmetric outcomes, and consider the problem of variable selection for our proposed models. Based on an efficient unified penalized likelihood method, the consistency and the oracle property of the penalized estimators are established. The authors develop the variable selection procedure for the proposed joint models, which can efficiently simultaneously estimate and select important variables in location model, scale model and skewness model. Simulation studies and body mass index data analysis are presented to illustrate the proposed methods.

Using a set of 188 RILs population derived from an elite hybrid cross of upland cotton cultivars 'HS46' x 'MARCABUCAG8US-1-88' and their immortal F-2 (IF2) with reciprocal backcrosses BC1F1 and BC2F1 (BC) populations in two environments, the QTLs located on the embryo genome and maternal plant genome for nine amino acids of cottonseed were studied across environments. The QTL Network-CL-2.0-seed software was used to analyze the QTLs and their genetic effects for nine amino acids. A total of 56 QTLs for nine amino acids were detected in both populations, with many having over 5% of phenotypic variation. Ten of the total QTLs could be simultaneously found in the IF2 and BC populations. For most QTLs, the genetic effects from embryo genome were more important than those from maternal plant genome for the performance of nine amino acids. Significant embryo additive main effects and maternal additive main effect with their environment interaction effects from many QTLs were also found in present experiment. Some QTLs with larger phenotypic variation were important for improving the amino-acid contents in cottonseeds.

ROSACEAE; UPLIFT; DIVERSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; CLIMATE; CLASSIFICATION; POLYPLOIDY	Explaining how plants from eastern Asia migrated to other Northern Hemisphere regions is still challenging. The genus Sorbus sensu stricto (including c. 88 species) is considered as a good example to illuminate this scenario, due to the wide distribution in the temperate zone and high diversity in the Himalayas and Hengduan Mountains. Based on four nuclear markers (LEAFY-2, GBSSI-1, SBEI and WD) and one chloroplast marker (rps16-tmK), we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship of Sorbus using 54 taxa (60% of the genus representing all subgenera, sections, or series and geographical areas in the previous classifications), and estimated divergence time and historical biogeography of the genus. Phylogenetic analyses supported that the subgenera Sorbus and Albo-carmesinae, as defined by traditional morphological characters (such as fruit color), are suitable. However, five clades defined by phylogenetic analysis of the genus are not consistent with traditionally defined sections or series. Molecular dating and biogeographic reconstruction showed that the age of the most recent common ancestor was estimated at 41 mya (95% HPD: 49-35 mya) in eastern Asia. Four dispersal events are assumed to explain the wide distribution of Sorbus in the temperate zone and diversification in the edges of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Species dispersed from eastern Asia to the Tianshan Mountains, North America and Europe during the Oligocene and Miocene period. We found that polyploidization occurred multiple times in the subgenus Albo-carmesinae, in the Tianshan Mountains, Himalayas, and H-D Mountains. Finally, we suggest that apomixis, polyploidization, and hybridization may have combined with the multistage uplifting of Himalayas and H-D Mountains (and the subsequent increases in geologic, ecological and climatic heterogeneity) to drive the striking species diversity of Sorbus in this region.

Similar to other nocturnal moths, S. litura females exhibit circadian variations of gland sex pheromone contents, with higher levels during scotophase and lower levels during photophase. The sex pheromone titre in the glands peaks during the first scotophase after eclosion and sharply declines afterwards. Higher pheromone contents during scotophase may facilitate female reproductive activities, and the negative relationship between pheromone titre and female calling is likely the result of pheromone release during female calling. Interestingly, the present study demonstrates that mated S. litura females have significantly higher sex pheromone titre in their pheromone glands (PGs) than virgin females. This finding contrasts with all previous studies of other insect species, in which mating generally reduces the sex pheromone titre in female PGs. In S. litura, mating and male accessory gland fluids can suppress female calling behaviours and re-matings. These results suggest that the suppression of female calling behaviours by mating and male accessory gland fluids may significantly reduce the release of sex pheromones and thus result in higher sex pheromone titre in the PGs of mated females.

Isotopic records will therefore show historical fluctuations. To understand better the factors controlling present day precipitation delta O-18 values on the northwestern TP, we made continuous observations of precipitation isotopes at Ngari station from 2010 to 2013. The drivers of precipitation delta O-18 were investigated using analyses of their statistical relations with temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, and convective activities based on outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data from NOAA satellites, and downward shortwave radiation (DSR) data collected at the Ngari automatic weather station. Atmospheric circulation patterns from NCAR reanalysis, and moisture transport paths of individual events derived from the HYSPLIT model using NCEP data, were also used to trace moisture sources. The results of our study include: (1) The slope and intercept of the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) at Ngari (delta D = 8.51 delta O-18 + 11.57 (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01)) were higher than for the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), indicating drier local climatic conditions; (2) Precipitation delta O-18 values showed a weak "temperature effect" and a weak "precipitation amount effect" at Ngari; and (3) Convection (or temperature patterns) integrated over several days (0-20) preceding each event were determined to be the main driver of precipitation isotopic values in monsoon (or non-monsoon) season. The longer (shorter) periods of tau(m) days when correlation coefficients between precipitation delta O-18 and OLR were at their maxima (minima) indicate deep convective activities (shorter moisture transportation pathways) in August (June, July, and September).

Then based on this general preconditioner P, two preconditioned SSOR methods for solving the linear complementarity problems are proposed. We show that this general preconditioner P accelerates the convergence of two SSOR methods under the assumption that PA is a Z -matrix. In addition, we also give a practically concrete choice for the preconditioner P satisfying aforementioned assumption. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.

This novel VOxNTs can be used as cathode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), but displaying low specific capacity and poor cycling performance owing to the residual of a mass of soft-template (C12H27N) and intrinsic low conductivity of VOx. Cation exchange technique and oxidative polymerization process of pyrrole monomers were conducted to wipe off partial soft-template without electrochemical activity within VOxNTs and simultaneously form polypyrrole coating on VOxNTs, respectively. The resulting polypyrrole/VOxNTs nanocomposite delivers much improved capacity and cyclic stability. Further optimizations, such as complete elimination of organic template and enhancing the crystallinity, can make this unique nanostructure a promising cathode for LIBs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Its growth temperature range is 28-60. degrees C. The genomic sequence of this strain revealed that there are 27 cellulase genes belonging to six glycoside hydrolase families. To understand the strategy that this strain uses to utilize carbon sources such as cellulose at different temperatures, comparative transcriptomics analysis of T. rubra YIM 77501(T) was performed by growing it with cellulose (CMC) and without cellulose (replaced with glucose) at 30, 40, and 50 degrees C, respectively. Transcriptomic analyses showed four cellulase genes (TrBG2, TrBG3, TrBG4, and ThrCel6B) were up-regulated at 30, 40, and 50 degrees C. The rate of gene expression of TrBG2, TrBG3, TrBG4, and ThrCel6B were 50 degrees C > 30 degrees C > 40 degrees C. One cellulase gene (TrBG1) and two cellulase genes (TrBG5 and ThrCel6A) were up-regulated only at 30 and 50 degrees C, respectively. These up-regulated cellulase genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzymatic properties of up-regulated cellulases showed a variety of responses to temperature. Special up-regulated cellulases TrBG1 and ThrCel6A displayed temperature acclimation for each growth condition. These expression patterns revealed that a hybrid strategy was used by T. rubra to utilize carbon sources at different temperatures. This study provides genomic, transcriptomics, and experimental data useful for understanding how microorganisms respond to environmental changes and their application in enhancing cellulose hydrolysis for animal feed and bioenergy production.

Doping GQDs with heteroatoms can further modulate the energy band structure and thus produce unexpected properties. Herein, we obtained fluorine-doped GQDs (F-GQDs) by adopting an effective preparation technique, which includes the treatment of the as-prepared reaction precursor, fluorinated carbon fibers, with ultrasonic liquid phase exfoliation. The proposed method is simple, handy, and low-cost, opening up an alternate approach to prepare F-GQDs. Through multiple characterization techniques, the effective incorporation of fluorine in GQDs was confirmed, and the as-prepared F-GQDs exhibit excellent photoelectrical properties and good ultraviolet absorption performances. Accordingly, we have fabricated a vertical photovoltaic UV detector based on F-GQDs. The unoptimized device has an exceptionally large ratio of photocurrent to dark current of magnitude similar to 10(5), and its detectivity (D*) could stabilize at around 10(12) Jones at room temperature under lambda = 365 nm light irradiation and reverse bias voltage.

A previous study suggested that the gene cluster AOL_s00215 in A. oligospora was involved in the production of arthrosporols. Here, we report that disruption of one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene AOL_s00215g280 in the cluster resulted in significant phenotypic difference and much aerial hyphae. A further bioassay indicated that the mutant showed a dramatic decrease in the conidial formation but developed numerous traps and killed 85% nematodes within 6 h in contact with prey, in sharp contrast to the wild-type strain with no obvious response. Chemical investigation revealed huge accumulation of three new PKS-TPS epoxycyclohexone derivatives with different oxygenated patterns around the epoxycyclohexone moiety and the absence of arthrosporols in the cultural broth of the mutant Delta AOL_s00215g280. These findings suggested-that a study on the biosynthetic pathway for morphological regulatory metabolites in nematode-trapping fungus would provide an efficient way to develop new fungal biocontrol agents.

The CYP17A1 polymorphisms might affect enzyme activity, then leading to a state of mineralocorticoid 11-deoxycorticosterone excess characterized by hypertension, suppressed plasma renin activity, and low aldosterone concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of CYP17A1 polymorphisms in inducing the susceptibility to essential hypertension among the Southwest Han Chinese population. Material/Methods: Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP17A1 were genotyped in a case-control study for samples by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: The polymorphisms rs11191548 and rs4919687 were significantly associated with hypertension risk, which was confirmed by systolic and diastolic blood pressure distribution analyses between different genotype groups, and these two polymorphisms were found in linkage disequilibrium. The rs4919687 polymorphism was estimated to cause the destruction of exonic splicing silencer (ESR and Motif 3) sites and to transform the transcription factor AREB6 binding site, respectively, in the bioinformatics analyses. The haplotypes rs4919686A-rs3740397G-rs4919687C-rs743572C-rs11191548C and rs4919686A-rs3740397G-rs4919687T-rs743572C-rs11191548T were found to be susceptible to essential hypertension. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the CYP17A1 polymorphisms could be a genetic risk factor for essential hypertension among the Yunnan Han Chinese population, which would have implications for the treatment of this complex disorder.

Given a universe U of n users, an exclusive key K-s for an arbitrary subset S subset of U is a long-term key shared by all users in U \ S. Hence we can distribute a new group key GK encrypted under K-s such that all users in U except those in S can decrypt it during group rekeying. This method allows us to exclude S from the group with a rekey message whose length is just one single encrypted key. In this paper, we use this idea to extend the famous Subset-Cover Framework to obtain its exclusive version - Exclusive Subset-Cover Framework. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the security of any stateless group rekeying protocol in this framework. We propose a concrete exclusive subset-cover protocol called exclusive complete subtree protocol. Compared with existing 1-resilient stateless group rekeying protocols, this protocol achieves not only constant communication overhead but also better computational efficiency as well as better collusion resistance. From this protocol, it is easy to obtain a 1-resilient stateful group rekeying protocol which also outperforms the existing 1-resilient stateful protocols. Recent researches have proved some lower bounds on the communication complexity of group rekeying protocols. These bounds suggest that it is impossible to achieve a lower communication overhead without trading off some degree of collusion resistance. However, there are application scenarios which require communication overhead below these bounds. We show that any 1-resilient stateless group rekeying protocol with constant communication overhead can be used in tandem with a Subset-Cover based protocol to construct a hybrid protocol with tunable collusion-bandwidth tradeoffs.

Pumping the microfluid by a continuous wave laser with a wavelength of 532 nm along the fiber axis, the fluorescent spectra from the channel filled with lower refractive index (RI) dye solution are obtained. Due to the fact that the evanescent field of the pump beam is homogeneous around fiber, the fluorescent emission from the rim of fiber is uniform. It is found experimentally that the fluorescent emission intensity decreases with the axial distance of fiber, and the intensity is very sensitive to the RI of the dye solution and the dye concentration. For the dye solution with a large RI, the emitted fluorescent intensity attenuates along the fiber axis more obviously than that of the dye solution with a small RI. For the high dye concentration solution, the emitted fluorescent intensity attenuates along the fiber axis also more significantly than that of the low dye concentration solution. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a uniform fluorescence radiation along the fiber axis by selecting a suitably smaller RI and a lower dye concentration solution. The observed experimental phenomena are well explained based on the mechanism of evanescent wave pumping fluorescent radiation. Based on the features of fluorescent emission in the microfluidic chip, a PDMS chip with three micro-channels is designed and fabricated. After injecting ethanol solutions of rhodamine 640, rhodamine B and rhodamine 6 G separately into the three channels and pumpingthese solutions by evanescent wave along the optical fiber axis, three fluorescence emissions with different wavelength ranges are successfully observed in a single PDMS chip.

Typically, indoor air pollutants are composed of a series of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are generally harmful to the human body, especially VOCs with low molecular weights (less than 100 Da). Moreover, in some situations, more than one type of VOC is present; thus, a device that can detect one or more VOCs simultaneously would be most beneficial. Here, we synthesized a sensor array with 4 units to detect 4 VOCs: acetone (unit 1), benzene (unit 2), methanol (unit 3) and formaldehyde (unit 4) simultaneously. All units were simultaneously exposed to 2.5 ppm of all four VOCs. The sensitivity of unit 1 was 14.67 for acetone and less than 2.54 for the other VOCs. The sensitivities of units 2, 3 and 4 to benzene, methanol and formaldehyde were 2 18.64, 20.98 and 17.26, respectively, and less than 4.01 for the other VOCs. These results indicated that the sensor array exhibited good selectivity and could be used for the real-time monitoring of indoor air quality. Thus, this device will be useful in situations requiring the simultaneous detection of multiple VOCs.

Simulation results show that for DOP located in the space region of D3R to act as a neurotransmitter transmitting toward the outside of cell, the free energy change is 134.6 kJ.mol(-1) along the functional molecular channel of y+ axis within D3R, and 211.5 kJ.mol(-1) along the y- axis towards the intracellular part. Within the structure of D3R, the free energy changes are 65.8, 245.0, 551.4, 172.8 kJ.mol(-1) for DOP to transmit along the x+, x-, z+, z- axes, respectively, towards cell bilayer membrane, indicating that DOP leaves more easily along the x+ axis through the gap between TM5 (the fifth transmembrane helix) and TM6 (the sixth transmembrane helix) from the internal structure of D3R. When free DOP molecules are located in the intercellular spaces, once they start moving along the inverse y+ axis direction under constant pressure and temperature, they spontaneously pass through the functional molecular channel to reach the space region of D3R to act as a neurotransmitter, because the free energy change between DOP and D3R along the inverse y+ axis direction is negative (-134.6 kJ.mol(-1) Therefore, DOP interacting with D3R can easily play the role of a neurotransmitter. After DOP molecules have performed the actions of a neurotransmitter, they leave the internal structure of D3R along the x+ axis of a protective molecular channel through the gap between TM5 and TM6 to avoid excessive function as transmitter. According to dopamine functional and protective molecular channels, we suggest new pathologies and the finding and development of new drugs for Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

Using eDNA to detect the distribution and density of invasive crayfish in the Honghe-Hani rice terrace World Heritage site	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS; WATER; BIODIVERSITY; CAPTURE; SIZE; OCCUPANCY; IMPACT; SAMPLE	The Honghe-Hani landscape in China is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site due to the beauty of its thousands of rice terraces, but these structures are in danger from the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish dig nest holes, which collapse terrace walls and destroy rice production. Under the current control strategy, farmers self-report crayfish and are issued pesticide, but this strategy is not expected to eradicate the crayfish nor to prevent their spread since farmers are not able to detect small numbers of crayfish. Thus, we tested whether environmental DNA (eDNA) from paddy-water samples could provide a sensitive detection method. In an aquarium experiment, Real-time Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) successfully detected crayfish, even at a simulated density of one crayfish per average-sized paddy (with one false negative). In a field test, we tested eDNA and bottle traps against direct counts of crayfish. eDNA successfully detected crayfish in all 25 paddies where crayfish were observed and in none of the 7 paddies where crayfish were absent. Bottle-trapping was successful in only 68% of the crayfish-present paddies. eDNA concentrations also correlated positively with crayfish counts. In sum, these results suggest that single samples of eDNA are able to detect small crayfish populations, but not perfectly. Thus, we conclude that a program of repeated eDNA sampling is now feasible and likely reliable for measuring crayfish geographic range and for detecting new invasion fronts in the Honghe Hani landscape, which would inform regional control efforts and help to prevent the further spread of this invasive crayfish.

Due to the host guest interaction, AO and AP molecules both can enter into the hydrophobic inner cavity of amPA5 that could form a complex of 1:1 guest host with amPA5 according to the size of molecules and the cavity of amPA5, but the AP interacts more strongly with amPA5 than with AO, so it can detect AP by the host-guest competition. The low detection limit of 0.05 mu M (S/N=3) and a linear response range of 0.1-4.0 mu M and 4.0-32 mu M for AP was obtained by using this method. It had lower detection limit and wider linear range than other methods, therefore, it was successfully utilized to detect AP in serum samples, and exhibited a promising application in practice. The molecular docking studies indicated that the major driving forces for the formation of the inclusion complex of AP and amPA5 are hydrogen bonding, pi-pi interactions, and hydrophobic interactions.

Pure cobaltites with the hierarchically porous morphology were obtained directly through the combustion of the precursors under fuel-lean conditions in one-step without further heat treatment. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM/TEM imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry, which indicate that the products possess hierarchical porous structure. A possible forming mechanism was given based on the series of experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

However, there is a gap between the seasonal control of precipitation and long-term isotope record from ice core. Here we present a well-dated ice core isotope record from the middle of the TP (mid-TP). Isotope variations in the past decades from this ice core show strong anti-phase relation with Southern Oscillation Index, confirming unequivocally that the large scale atmospheric circulation through the El Nino Southern Oscillation cycle, rather local climate parameters, controls the interannual signal in ice cores from the mid-TP. Results also show that the cloud top height in the northern Indian Ocean is in association with the interannual variations, confirming the same mechanism controlling the precipitation 8180 in southwest Asia and southeast Asia. The study will improve the understanding of the interannual change of Tibetan Plateau ice core isotope signal, and also the hydrological cycle in the southwest Asian region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, individual organisms are homoplasmic, containing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from a single parent. Here we analyzed the mitochondrial genotypes in Clade I of the gourmet mushroom Thelephora ganbajun from its broad geographic distribution range. A total of 299 isolates from 28 geographic locations were sequenced at three mitochondrial loci: the mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA gene, and the cytochrome c oxidase subunits I (COX1) and III (COX3) genes. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that the strains had about 60-160 copies of mitochondrial genomes per cell. Interestingly, while no evidence of heteroplasmy was found at the 12S rRNA gene, 262 of the 299 isolates had clear evidence of heterogeneity at either the COX1 (261 isolates) or COX3 (12 isolates) gene fragments. The COX1 heteroplasmy was characterized by two types of introns residing at different sites of the same region and at different frequencies among the isolates. Allelic association analyses of the observed mitochondrial polymorphic nucleotide sites suggest that mtDNA recombination is common in natural populations of this fungus. Our results contrast the prevailing view that heteroplasmy, if exists, is only transient in basidiomycete fungi.

The resulting Mn3O4/AC composites were characterized by means of different techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and so on. Morphological studies reveal the hierarchical porous structure of Mn3O4/AC composites. Mn3O4/AC nanocomposite with the activated carbon quality percentage of 10% exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 491.2 F g(-1) at the current density of 2 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte measured from the charge-discharge process. The value is nearly 6 times higher than that of the pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles as an electrode for supercapacitor. The good performance of the as-prepared Mn3O4/AC composites as electrode materials may be attributed to the synergistic effects of the activated carbon and the Mn3O4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The sustainability of livestock production depends on the efficient utilization of locally available resources. Some traditional methods of raising livestock may offer valuable lessons in this regard. This study documented and evaluated local knowledge of wild forage plants in the Dulongjiang area in Southwest China in the context of rearing mithun (Bos frontalis) in order to provide a sound evidence base for tree fodder selection and the establishment of integrated tree-crop-livestock systems. Methods: The snowball technique was used to identify key informants with specific knowledge about the topic. Free listing and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 58 households. Participatory investigation and transit walks were used to investigate potential fodder species. Ethnobotanical information was collected, documented and organized. Results: Overall, 142 wild forage plants from 58 families and 117 genera were identified. Species of the Poaceae, Rosaceae and Urticaceae families were most abundant, with 16, 14 and 11 species respectively identified as fodder plants. Our results indicated that tree/shrub forage plays a major role in the diet of mithun, unlike that of other ruminants. Mithun prefers to browse and move around the forest in search of food, particularly rough and even barbed leaves. Tree species like Debregeasia orientalis, Saurauia polyneura and Rubus species were identified as being important fodder sources. Farmers in this area have traditionally relied on common property resources such as community-managed forests and grasslands to feed their livestock. Farmers have strong incentive to raise mithuns rather than other livestock species due to Dulong people's cultural preferences. Conclusions: The wide variety of plants cited by the informants demonstrate the importance of traditional knowledge in gathering information about forage resources. This diversity also offers the prospect of identifying promising species which could be used as fodder plants. Identifying such species and tree fodder species in particular could help smallholder farmers to integrate trees, livestock and crops as part of a sustainable farming system.

Here, we examined the responses of zooplankton activity and grazing rate to habitat orientation and their consequences on the stability of phytoplankton-zooplankton system in a two-factor factorial experiment involving habitat orientation (three levels; small, medium, and large base area, respectively) and habitat size (64 ml and 512 ml) using two algal-grazer systems (Chlorella pyrenoidosaDaphnia magna and C. pyrenoidosa-Moina micrura). In both systems, grazer density increased with increasing base area for a given chamber volume and with increasing chamber volume for a given orientation in the first 6 days, followed by a dramatic decrease, which corresponded to increasing the amplitude of density fluctuations in both zooplankton and phytoplankton species. Such an algal-grazer dynamics could be accounted for by the greater average swimming ability and grazing rate observed in large-based and large-volumed chambers. Our results demonstrate that habitat orientation affects the zooplankton behavior and population dynamics of both zooplankton and phytoplankton species, which further influences the stability of phytoplankton-zooplankton systems.

Bayesian approach, Heston model and statistical-physical method are considered. Specifically, Heston model and an effective potential are employed to address the dynamic changes of stock price. Bayesian approach has been utilized to estimate the Heston model's unknown parameters. Statistical physical method is used to investigate the occurrence of stock market crash by calculating the mean time-limited crash rate. The real financial data from the Shanghai Composite Index is analyzed with the proposed methods. The mean time-limited crash rate of stock price is used to describe the occurrence of stock market crash in an economy cycle.

Quantum chemical calculation was applied to elucidate the adsorption mode of the inhibitor molecule on steel surface. The results show that TDPB acts as a good inhibitor, and its maximum inhibition efficiency is higher than 90% even at low concentration. The adsorption of TDPB obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. Polarization curves indicate that TDPB behaves as a mixed-type inhibitor in H3PO4. EIS spectra exhibit one capacitive loop which indicates that the corrosion reaction is controlled by charge transfer process. The inhibition action of TDPB could also be evidenced by surface SEM images. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the pyridine ring is the active adsorption center. Depending on the results, the inhibitive mechanism is proposed from the viewpoint of adsorption theory. (c) 2014 King Saud University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

The complex is characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, ESI+-MS, H-1 and C-13 NMR, along with single crystal X-ray diffraction. The ambidentate DMSO ligands are bound to the rhodium center of 1 through their sulfur atoms, which is firstly predicated by its orange color, then confirmed by the observation of an increase in the S-O stretching frequencies, and finally, unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of 1 contains two similar but crystallographically independent molecules. Both molecules contain lantern dirhodium units, joined equatorially by four bidentate hydroxyacetate ligands and two monodentate DMSO axial ligands. Four hydrogen bonds link the molecules together with d(O center dot center dot center dot O) of 2.767(4)-2.824(4) angstrom to form a three dimensional network.

The taxonomic positions of the two isolates were investigated using a polyphasic approach. The novel isolates were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, short-rod-shaped and motile by means of a polar flagellum. They were oxidase-and catalase-positive and were able to grow at 30-55 degrees C (optimum, 37-45 degrees C), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and with NaCl tolerance up to 1% (w/v). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains YIM 73013(T) and YIM 73008 formed a distinct lineage with respect to closely related genera in the family Comamonadaceae and shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequences similarities with Acidovorax caeni R-24608(T) (96.3 and 96.4 %, respectively). The respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8) and the major cellular fatty acids observed were C-17:1 omega 6c, C-16:0 and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c). The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 73013(T) and YIM 73008 were 68.7 and 68.3 mol%, respectively. Based on the morphological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results, the two isolates represent a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Tibeticola sediminis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Tibeticola sediminis is YIM 73013(T) (= DSM 101684(T) = KCTC 42873(T)).

The isolate grew with 10-35% NaCl and did not grow without NaCl. The isolate formed white aerial mycelium and long spore chains, and two spores were separated by sterile mycelium. The spores were non-motile, spherical and rugose-surfaced. The isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and galactose and arabinose as the major whole-cell sugars. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and three unknown phospholipids. Major fatty acids were anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-16:0 and iso-C-15:0. MK-9(H-4) was the predominant menaquinone and the DNA G+C content was 62.8 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain AFM 10258(T) shared low sequence similarity with the closely related representatives of the families Pseudonocardiaceae (below 94.47 %) and Actinopolysporaceae (below 93.76 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AFM 10258(T) formed a robust clade with members of the family Actinopolysporaceae. On the basis of analysis of phenotypic, chemical and molecular characteristics, strain AFM 10258(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Haloactinomyces albus gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive parametric investigation on the electron-cyclotron-maser instability driven by non-thermal ring-beam electrons with intrinsic Alfven waves, which pervade the solar atmosphere and interplanetary space. It is found that both forward propagating and backward propagating waves can be excited in the fast ordinary (O) and extraordinary (X) electromagnetic modes. The growth rates of X1 mode are almost always weakened by Alfven waves. The average pitch-angle phi(0) of electrons is a key parameter for the effect of Alfven waves on the growth rate of modes O1, O2, and X2. For a beam-dominated electron distribution (phi(0) less than or similar to 30 degrees), the growth rates of the maser instability for O1, O2, and X2 modes are enhanced with the increase of the Alfven wave energy density. In other conditions, the growth rates of O1, O2, and X2 modes weakened with the increasing Alfven wave intensity, except that the growth of the O1 mode may also be enhanced by Alfven waves for a ring distribution. The results may be important for us in analyzing the mechanism of radio bursts with various fine structures observed in space and astrophysical plasmas. Published by AIP Publishing.

However, fossil tree axes are commonly decorticated. The development of bark during the evolutionary history of fossil plants thus remains poorly understood. Here, we describe exceptionally well-preserved extraxylary tissues of the Lopingian (Late Permian) conifer Ningxiaites specialis Feng, including vascular cambium and bark, from the Sunjiagou Formation (Changhsingian) of northern China. The vascular cambium bears one or two layers of cambial cells. The bark comprises secondary phloem and periderm. The secondary phloem consists of rays, axial parenchyma and sieve cells. The rays of the secondary phloem are uniseriate and continuous from the rays of the xylem. They are more frequently present in the inner zone of the secondary phloem. Axial parenchyma cells are vertically aligned and appear more regularly distributed in the outer zone of the secondary phloem. Elliptical or subcircular sieve areas are placed on the radial walls of the sieve cells. The periderm located outside the secondary phloem is composed of imbricate flattened cork cells. The cork cells show suberised cell walls and are generally filled with dark contents. Remains of the secondary phloem present between layers of periderm indicate the formation of rhytidome-type bark. This is the first detailed report of the bark anatomy of a conifer from the upper Palaeozoic of Cathaysia, and shed light on the early diversity of bark structure during the evolutionary history of conifers.

Though it is originated in China, it has not been considered as a weed in China. While more and more articles report its destructive effects on the native community throughout the whole country. We conducted an experiment to validate whether kudzu could endanger its native ecosystem and wanted to find the reason of its fast spreading from 2008 to 2010. Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, water content, irradiance, pH, species number and aboveground biomass in the three sub-communities (Kudzu, Mixed and NonKudzu) were analyzed. Meanwhile, light irradiance and coverage of kudzu at 0, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 m distance from the road surface verge were also measured. The results showed that kudzu evidently lowed the species biodiversity and obviously changed the water, light and nutrient cycles in its expanding area. Kudzu's rapid expansion is mainly because it can get full available space and light for growth by reason of anthropogenic disturbances. Our results indicated that Kudzu was a potential weed in China if great land changes from human activities are continuing.

J	Yang, HY; Peng, HC; Hu, JF				Yang, Haiyan; Peng, Hengchu; Hu, Jiafu			The lithospheric structure beneath southeast Tibet revealed by P and S receiver functions	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						P receiver functions; S receiver functions; Southeast Tibet; Lithosphere	UPPER-MANTLE STRUCTURE; ASTHENOSPHERE BOUNDARY; CRUSTAL FLOW; PLATEAU; YUNNAN; TOMOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; PROVINCE; AREA	Yunnan is located at the margin of southeast Tibet, where dramatic tectonic activities occur. In this study, we calculated the P and S receiver functions by the deconvolution of three-component seismic data from 48 permanent broad-band stations deployed in Yunnan region. In order to improve signal-noise ratios of the receiver functions, we move-out corrected receiver functions to a reference epicentral distance of 67 degrees, and then stacked them to one trace for each station. Finally, the stacked traces were converted to the depth domain to obtain the crustal and lithospheric thicknesses beneath each station. In southwestern Yunnan (at the west side of the Jinshajiang-Red River Fault), the crustal thicknesses from the P-wave receiver functions (PRFs) and from the S-wave receiver functions (SRFs) are in the ranges of 30-36 km, and of 33-39 km, respectively. But in northwestern Yunnan, the crustal thicknesses from PRFs and SRFs are from 66 to 69 km and from 63 to 66 km, respectively. Our results show that the crustal thicknesses in Yunnan from PRFs and SRFs are consistent, with a maximum deviation of 3 km; and increase gradually from similar to 30 km in the south to similar to 68 km in the northwest. Besides, the lithospheric thickness from PRFs is also similar to that from SRFs, with the largest difference of 15-20 km in southeastern Yunnan. At the west side of the Jinshajiang-Red River Fault in western Yunnan, it is only about 80-100 km, and increases to 140-150 km regionally in northern and southeastern Yunnan. The thinned lithosphere extends eastward from western Yunnan to eastern Yunnan. We attribute the thinned lithosphere to the upwelling of hot upper mantle materials associated with the eastward subduction of the Indian plate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results show a significant correlation between Earth tides and the occurrence of earthquakes. Six of seven main events occurred when the Earth tide increased the Coulomb failure stress on the source fault. Four main events occurred in a narrow range of phase angle corresponding to the maximum loading rate of tidal stress. Furthermore, the histories of the aftershock sequence as a function of the tidal phases demonstrate clear tidal modulation with a high significance. Thus, we conclude that Earth tides have a clear role in triggering (or modulating) the rupture of the fault systems in the Ning'er area. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, RW; Xie, Z; Cao, J				Yang, Ruowen; Xie, Zhiang; Cao, Jie			A Dynamic Index for the Westward Ridge Point Variability of the Western Pacific Subtropical High during Summer	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; LATE 1970S; EL-NINO; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTABILITY; REANALYSIS; RAINFALL; MODELS; ERA-40	Based on the ridge line of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the theory of gradient wind approximation, a dynamic index for the westward ridge point (WRPI) of the WPSH is defined. Owing to its definition, the new dynamic index can be used to analyze the evolution of the WPSH at various time scales over most isobaric surfaces. The WRPI comprises two dimensions labeled ZWRPI and MWRPI, which depict the zonal and meridional movement, respectively, of the westward ridge point of the WPSH. The rationality and reliability of the dynamic index were validated using reanalysis atmospheric circulation, outgoing long-wave radiation, surface air temperature, and rainfall data. The WRPI series revealed that the westward ridge point of the WPSH generally advances poleward while withdrawing eastward. Furthermore, there were close relationships between the WRPI, atmospheric circulation, outgoing longwave radiation, and precipitation over East Asia and the western Pacific in summer. The significant correlation coefficients indicated that the ZWRPI and the MWRPI can reflect the impact of the zonal and meridional movement of the WPSH on the climate over East Asia and the western Pacific. The ZWRPI has no significant linear trend at the interdecadal time scale, indicating that the WPSH did not significantly extend westward in summer. The slight decrease of the MWRPI suggests that the WPSH moves southward but with an insignificant trend. Compared with indices proposed in previous studies, the WRPI showed advantages in objectivity, reliability, predictability, practicability, and therefore extensive potential for application.

Industrial Cluster Development and its Contribution to Economic Growth in Taiwan - Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park (HSIP)	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Clustering Effect	COMPREHENSIVE ESTIMATION; POLICY; INNOVATION; SECURITY	The development of industrial cluster plays a significant role in the growth of national industries, and the industrial cluster development indeed makes a great impact on the progression of national industries, especially in developing countries. Under the fiercely global trends in competition, industrial cluster has been identified as an important strategy to keep the development of regional industries in a sustainable trajectory, and a good implementation of industrial cluster usually reflects on the cluster region carrying within a large number of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Through the clustering of businesses and industries, the corresponding geographical proximity, and the promotion of mutual support and learning, businesses and industries located in the cluster region can further acquire the advantages of Economy of Scale and those of Economy of Scope. Meanwhile, the successful experience of Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park (HSIP) has become a good model for many countries to learn the development of Science Park, and the most contribution of HSIP is transforming the labour-intensive industries to talent-intensive industries. Also, it directly promotes the development of high-technology industries in a sustainable trajectory. Most important of all, the success of HSIP created the so-called "Taiwan Economic Miracle" in the later twentieth century, and it led Taiwan to be one of "Four Asian Tigers".	[Lee, S.

In this study, we produced a species-level phylogeny of Roscoea using one nuclear ribosomal and two chloroplast DNA fragments based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. We then explored the possible speciation processes using the species-level phylogeny and the heterozygous sites in the nuclear DNA. The incongruence between nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies, and several heterozygous sites in the nuclear DNA, suggested that R. auriculata might have a hybrid origin with R. purpurea and R. alpina being two possible parental progenitors; however, one alternative possibility through incomplete lineage sorting cannot be ruled out. In addition, R. kunmingensis likely originated from R. tibetica Batalin through the process of budding speciation. These results provided a valuable framework to draw testable hypotheses for future in-depth comparative studies to further our understanding of the underpinning speciation and adaptation mechanisms that contribute to ultrahigh biodiversity in the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains.

J	Liu, GQ; Shen, H				Liu, Guoqi; Shen, Hua			A severe negative response of the ionosphere to the intense geomagnetic storm on March 17, 2015 observed at mid- and low-latitude stations in the China zone	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Geomagnetic storm; Ionosphere; TEC; foF2; O/N-2; Spread-F	TOTAL ELECTRON-CONTENT; F-REGION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; AFRICAN SECTOR; EAST-AFRICA; EQUATORIAL; TEC; PERTURBATIONS; EXPLANATION; DISTURBANCE	In this paper, the critical frequency of F2 layer of the ionosphere (foF(2)) and the total electron content (TEC) recorded at mid- and low-latitude observation sites near 120 degrees E in the China zone were used to investigate the response to a severe geomagnetic storm on March 17, 2015 (the minimum Dst-223 nT at 23 UT). The results showed that the strong geomagnetic storm caused a massive effect on the ionosphere. The characteristics of foF2 and TEC did not show obvious perturbation during the main phase. Severe depletion of foF(2) and TEC was observed at all stations during the storm recovery period. The maximum absolute discrepancy in TEC compared with the past 27-day average value was 78 TECU, and the minimum percentage deviations reached -71% at Fuzhou (26.1 degrees N, 119.3 degrees E). The minimum percentage deviations of decrease in foF(2) reached -65% at Sanya (18.1 degrees N, 109.3 degrees E) and Mohe (53.5 degrees N, 122.3 degrees E). This was an infrequent negative effect that foF(2) and TEC sustained throughout the day with extremely low level on March 18. The O/N-2 rate showed a distinct reduction on March 18 in the China zone, which may be mainly responsible for the severe depletion of foF(2) and TEC. The spread-F seemed to be developed at first but was then suppressed to some extent during the main phase. During the recovery phase, the spread-F was suppressed at Sanya, while it developed at Wuhan and Mohe. The disturbance electric fields and thermospheric circulation may contribute to this phenomenon.

Here, we report the essential role of the BEACH (beige and Chediak-Higashi) and WD40 repeat-containing protein WDR81 in eliminating ubiquitinated proteins through autophagy. WDR81 associates with ubiquitin (Ub)-positive protein foci, and its loss causes accumulation of Ub proteins and the autophagy cargo receptor p62. WDR81 interacts with p62, facilitating recognition of Ub proteins by p62. Furthermore, WDR81 interacts with LC3C through canonical LC3-interacting regions in the BEACH domain, promoting LC3C recruitment to ubiquitinated proteins. Inactivation of LC3C or defective autophagy results in accumulation of Ub protein aggregates enriched for WDR81. In mice, WDR81 inactivation causes accumulation of p62 bodies in cortical and striatal neurons in the brain. These data suggest that WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to facilitate autophagic removal of Ub proteins, and provide important insights into CAMRQ2 syndrome, a WDR81-related developmental disorder.

The taxonomic position of the new isolate was determined using a polyphasic approach. Strain T93(T) shared the highest 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Deinococcus deserti VCD115(T) (97.54%). The genomic DNA G+C content of the isolate T93(T) was 61.7 mol%. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8, while the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-16:0, C-15:1 omega 6c, C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 8c and Summed Feature 3 (comprising C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c). The major polar lipid profiles consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic data, strain T93(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Deinococcus, for which the name Deinococcus malanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is T93(T) (= KCTC 33563(T) = JCM 30331(T)).

On the basis of the fact that the water absorption is up to 800 mass% and that the poly(ethylene oxide) molecular chains can be degraded by microorganisms, the bulk-biodegradable mechanism of SSPCMs was put forward and studied. The X-ray diffraction patterns and the polarizing optical microscopy images show the SSPCMs possess the defective crystal and small grain compared with PEG. The differential scanning calorimetry data demonstrate the melting temperature and enthalpy of the synthesized SSPCMs are, respectively, 41 A degrees C and 128 J g(-1). The bulk-biodegradable SSPCMs have the preeminent thermal reliability and the high thermal stability due to the onset thermal degradation temperature above 302 A degrees C, which will give a good insight into bulk-biodegradable PCM system.

The obtained aerogels were characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectrum, and used for the removal of Pb(11) from aqueous solution. The influences of contact time, the initial concentration of Pb(II), and pH of the aqueous solutions on removal efficiencies were also studied. It was found that titanium dioxide aerogel templated by PEG-600 exhibited higher adsorption capacity than those aerogels without template and templated by CTAB and PVP. Its adsorption capacity was 181 mg Pb(H)/g at pH = 6.5 after 1 h. The adsorption process was described by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were also used to simulate the adsorption equilibrium. The results indicate that the latter had a better fit with the experimental data. Titania aerogels templated by PEG-600 had great potential for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solution.

However, it is still not known whether norfloxacin (NOR), a widely used antibiotic, has such effects on plankton systems when released into the environment. Here, we investigated the colony-forming ability of the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda as well as the behavior (hopping frequency and duration of quiescence) and grazing rate of the clado-ceran Daphnia magna, when exposed to different NOR concentrations (0,50,500, 5000 and 50,00 ug L-1), to determine the effects of NOR on the S. quadricauda-D. magna relationship. Colony size was generally unaffected by NOR but significantly increased when subjected to the stress of adding grazers; however, the combined effects of adding grazers and increasing NOR concentrations led to consistently decreased colony size compared to only adding grazers. The hopping frequency and the time spent on swimming of D. magna individuals decreased while their grazing rate increased with increasing NOR concentrations. Thus, NOR seemed to inhibit grazer-induced colony formation in S. quadricauda, resulting in more algal cells being consumed by grazers, despite inhibiting grazers' feeding behavior. Considering that phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction plays an important role in determining ecological process of aquatic ecosystems, ecosystem function might be more affected by NOR contamination than previously recognized.

Two types of cavity configurations were studied to support the stable dual-wavelength operation of the laser. A polarization beam splitter (PBS) was placed in the first type of cavity to split the beams polarizing in two orthogonal directions. At an absorbed pump power of 21.4 W, the cw output power obtained at 903 nm in 7i polarization and 908 nm in a-polarization is 0.43 W and 3.31 W, respectively. Furthermore, in order to balance the gain-to-loss, an uncoated glass plane was inserted in the second type of cavity. By adjusting the inclination of the glass plane relative to the optical axis of the resonator, we realized the stable simultaneous dual wavelength operation. The cw output powers of 1.82 W at 903 nm and of 2.92 W at 908 nm were obtained.

In this study, we focused on the atomic size effect on CH3NH3BI3 (B = Sn, Pb), provided the best atomic size with which CH3NH3BI3 absorbs widest range of different wavelengths of light, by first-principles calculation. We found that the halogen I-p, states are mainly composed of the valence band maximum (VBM) of CH3NH3BI3, and the cation B-p, states are primarily composed of the conduction band minimum (CBM). Besides, the bandgap of CH3NH3BI3 decreases and absorptive capacities of different wavelengths of light expand when we reduced the size of the atom and changed B atom from Pb to Sn during the change of suitable range. From all of the above, it is discovered that when the atomic size is 20% less than the normal size, CH3NH3PbI3 has the best optical properties, and its light-absorption range is the widest among all sizes of CH3NH3BI3 compounds. All these results reveal that the stress and strain on CH3NH3BI3 change the atomic size which leads to alteration of bandgap and optical properties in high-efficiency solar cells among all CH3NH3BI3 compounds, namely we can enhance the efficiency of the inorganic organic perovskite solar cells by setting up suitable pressure on the material in future.

This paper proposes a new joint model for multivariate longitudinal and multivariate survival data by incorporating a nonparametric function into the trajectory function and hazard function and assuming that measurement errors in longitudinal measurement models follow a skew-normal distribution. A Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm together with the penalized-splines technique and the MetropolisHastings algorithm within the Gibbs sampler is developed to estimate parameters and nonparametric functions in the considered joint models. Case deletion diagnostic measures are proposed to identify the potential influential observations, and an extended local influence method is presented to assess local influence ofminor perturbations. Simulation studies and a real example from a clinical trial are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies. Copyright (C) 2017 JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.

An easy and environmentally-friendly approach to superamphiphobicity of aluminum surfaces	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Superamphiphobicity; Al surface; Hierarchical morphology; PFDTS	AC FLASHOVER PERFORMANCE; SUPERHYDROPHOBIC ALUMINUM; FACILE FABRICATION; DEPOSITION PROCESS; ALLOY SURFACES; COATINGS; ROBUST; STEEL; DURABILITY; PROPERTY	Superamphiphobic Al surfaces were achieved via an easy and environmentally-friendly approach. Aqueous mixed solution of 0.7 M CuSO4 and 1 M NaCl was used to etch polished Al surfaces to fabricate a rough morphology distributed with microscale step-like pits. The uniformly distributed nanoscale petals covered on the microscale pits were obtained by subsequent 96 C-omicron hot deionized water bathing for 13 min. Thus, the hierarchical micro/nanometer scale roughness was formed which provided the structural basic of superamphiphobic Al surfaces. By 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-Perfluorodecyl-triethoxysilane (PFDTS) derivatization, desirable superamphiphobic Al surfaces were achieved with the highest static contact angles of 162(omicron) for water, 156(omicron) for peanut oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the sliding angles were lower than 10(omicron) for both water and peanut oil droplets. The as-prepared Al surfaces were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and optical contact angle measurements. The FE-SEM images of as-prepared Al surfaces showed a hierarchical micro/nanometer scale morphology. XPS analyses demonstrated the PFDTS derivitization on Al surfaces. The superamphiphobic Al surfaces presented good mechanical durability and chemical stability which have a wide range of applications in fields such as self-cleaning, anti-icing, anti-corrosion, oil transportation, energy harvesting, microfluidics, and so forth. The approach reported in this paper may easily realize the industrial production of superamphiphobic Al surfaces owing to the advantage of facile, low cost and environmentally-friendly.

Firstly, a tandem addition reaction of acrolein with acetylene in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2 gave 5-bromo-4E-pentenal, which reacted with the ylide prepared from (methoxymethyl) triphenylphodphonium chloride to afford (1E, 5E/Z)-1-bromo-6-methoxyhexadiene. The compound was coupled with Grignard reagent, followed by hydrolysis and reduction to give 5E-decen-1-ol. Esterification of the alcohol afforded 5E-decenyl acetate.

Although the species has a large distribution pattern and is abundant in Yunnan Province, the populations are dramatically declining because of overexploitation and habitat destruction. Studies on the genetic variation and demography of endemic species are necessary to develop effective conservation and management strategies. To generate such knowledge, we used 3 pairs of universal cpDNA markers and 10 pairs of microsatellite markers to assess the genetic diversity, genetic structure, and demographic history of 7 M. yunnanensis populations. We calculated a total of 88 alleles for 10 polymorphic loci and 10 haplotypes for a combined 2,089 bp of cpDNA. M. yunnanensis populations showed high genetic diversity (Ho = 0.551 for nuclear markers and Hd = 0.471 for cpDNA markers) and low genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.058). Geographical structure was not found among M. yunnanensis populations. Genetic distance and geographic distance were not correlated (P > 0.05), which indicated that geographic isolation is not the primary cause of the low genetic differentiation of M. yunnanensis. Additionally, M. yunnanensis populations contracted similar to 20,000-30,000 years ago, and no recent expansion occurred in current populations. Results indicated that the high genetic diversity of the species and within its populations holds promise for effective genetic resource management and sustainable utilization. Thus, we suggest that the conservation and management of M. yunnanensis should address exotic overexploitation and habitat destruction.

However, ultrasound images are inevitably contaminated by noise and speckle during acquisition. Noise and speckle directly impact the physician to interpret the images and decrease the accuracy in clinical diagnosis. Denoising method is an important component to enhance the quality of ultrasound images; however, several limitations discourage the results because current denoising methods can remove noise while ignoring the statistical characteristics of speckle and thus undermining the effectiveness of despeckling, or vice versa. In addition, most existing algorithms do not identify noise, speckle or edge before removing noise or speckle, and thus they reduce noise and speckle while blurring edge details. Therefore, it is a challenging issue for the traditional methods to effectively remove noise and speckle in ultrasound images while preserving edge details. Methods: To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a novel method, called Rayleigh-maximum-likelihood switching bilateral filter (RSBF) is proposed to enhance ultrasound images by two steps: noise, speckle and edge detection followed by filtering. Firstly, a sorted quadrant median vector scheme is utilized to calculate the reference median in a filtering window in comparison with the central pixel to classify the target pixel as noise, speckle or noise-free. Subsequently, the noise is removed by a bilateral filter and the speckle is suppressed by a Rayleigh-maximum-likelihood filter while the noise-free pixels are kept unchanged. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed method, synthetic ultrasound images contaminated by speckle are simulated by using the speckle model that is subjected to Rayleigh distribution. Thereafter, the corrupted synthetic images are generated by the original image multiplied with the Rayleigh distributed speckle of various signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels and added with Gaussian distributed noise. Meanwhile clinical breast ultrasound images are used to visually evaluate the effectiveness of the method. To examine the performance, comparison tests between the proposed RSBF and six state-of-the-art methods for ultrasound speckle removal are performed on simulated ultrasound images with various noise and speckle levels. Results The results of the proposed RSBF are satisfying since the Gaussian noise and the Rayleigh speckle are greatly suppressed. The proposed method can improve the SNRs of the enhanced images to nearly 15 and 13 dB compared with images corrupted by speckle as well as images contaminated by speckle and noise under various SNR levels, respectively. The RSBF is effective in enhancing edge while smoothing the speckle and noise in clinical ultrasound images. In the comparison experiments, the proposed method demonstrates its superiority in accuracy and robustness for denoising and edge preserving under various levels of noise and speckle in terms of visual quality as well as numeric metrics, such as peak signal to noise ratio, SNR and root mean squared error. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for removing the speckle and the background noise in ultrasound images. The main reason is that it performs a "detect and replace" two-step mechanism. The advantages of the proposed RBSF lie in two aspects. Firstly, each central pixel is classified as noise, speckle or noise-free texture according to the absolute difference between the target pixel and the reference median. Subsequently, the Rayleigh-maximum-likelihood filter and the bilateral filter are switched to eliminate speckle and noise, respectively, while the noise-free pixels are unaltered. Therefore, it is implemented with better accuracy and robustness than the traditional methods. Generally, these traits declare that the proposed RSBF would have significant clinical application.

The near infrared (NIR) reflectivity is measured for samples with (001) and (111) lattice orientations. The temperature-induced metal-superconductor transition can be observed, and the superconducting transition temperature can be measured for both samples. We find that the NIR reflection experiment can reflect rightly the basic features of LTO superconductor thin films. Furthermore, the results obtained from this simple optical measurement suggest that the photo-induced electronic localization effect can be present in LTO thin films in a metallic state. Such information cannot be obtained directly from conventional transport and magneto-transport measurements. These interesting and important findings demonstrate that the NIR reflection experiment is a powerful optical technique for contactless characterizations and investigations of superconductor materials.

Many current action recognition methods are limited by being computationally expensive and requiring large-scale training data. Here we propose an effective method for human action recognition using depth sequences captured by depth cameras. A multi-resolution operation, the spatial Laplacian and temporal energy pyramid (SLTEP), decomposes the depth sequences into certain frequency bands in different space and time positions. A spatial aggregating and fusion scheme is applied to cluster the low-level features and concatenate two different feature types extracted from low and high frequency levels, respectively. We evaluate our approach on five public benchmark datasets (MSRAction3D, MSRGesture3D, MSRActionPairs, MSRDailyActivity3D, and NTU RGB+D) and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods and is likely to be highly useful for online applications.

Lack of dependence between intrinsic magnetic damping and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Cu(t(Cu))/[Ni/Co](N) multilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article							CO/NI MULTILAYERS; REVERSAL; DYNAMICS; FILMS	The correlation between magnetic damping and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy has been investigated in Cu(t(Cu))/[Ni/Co](N) multilayers by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant Ku is varied in the range of 3.0-3.6 Merg/cm(3) by tuning either multilayer repetition number N or Cu thickness t(Cu). It is found that the PMA strength Ku increases with the increase of N, while the damping constant alpha(0) keeps nearly a constant of 0.025, implying the intrinsic damping is independent of the K-u tuned by N. In contrast, as t(Cu) increases from 2.5 to 20 nm, the a0 value rises continuously up to 0.040, in spite of the rather weak enhancement in K-u and its non-monotonic variation behavior. We consider the constant alpha(0) with N is due to the unchanged spin-orbit coupling strength at each Co/Ni interface, while the obvious enhancement in alpha(0) with tCu results mainly from the increased degree of spin disordering at the rougher Cu/Ni interface.

Taking this unique advantage, we examined the roles of palaeolake isolation vs. geological processes vs. climate in determining current fish biogeographic pattern. We reviewed available data on fish species and their geographical distribution in the river, as well as palaeolake development, geological and climatic parameters. The 138 fish species recorded in the river could be divided into 8 biogeographic regions, corresponding to the distribution of palaeolakes and respective endemic species. Through variation partitioning analysis, palaeolake isolation was the most influential factor explaining 43.6% of the total variance on the current fish distribution. The Quaternary Ice Age produced a transitional distribution for fishes from the glacier to warm water, especially for the subfamily Schizothoracinae, which showed various degrees of specialisation along altitudes. We suggested that fish biogeography in the Yellow river was basically shaped by palaeolake isolation, and further carved under serials of geologic events and contemporary climate change.

J	Ye, LJ; Miao, AM; Zhang, HW				Ye, Lingjian; Miao, Aimin; Zhang, Hongwei			Real-Time Optimization of Gold Cyanidation Leaching Process in a Two-Layer Control Architecture Integrating Self-Optimizing Control and Modifier Adaptation	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							OPTIMAL MEASUREMENT COMBINATIONS; MODEL	The gold cyanidation leaching process (GCLP) has been prevalent in the hydrometallurgical industry. To better control and optimize the plant operation, mechanistic models have been established which capture the physical behaviors of the GCLP. However, due to various disturbances and uncertainties, an optimized operation based on the nominal model is practically suboptimal. To perform real-time optimization (RTO) of the GCLP, this paper proposes a two-layer control architecture integrating the self-optimizing control (SOC) and modifier adaptation (MA), both of which are useful RTO approaches with distinct advantages. In the lower layer of the proposed control system, the SOC is implemented with measurement combinations as the controlled variables that are tracked at optimally insensitive setpoints to account for parametric disturbances. In the upper layer, the setpoints of self-optimizing controlled variables are further optimized in a tailored MA framework, such that the structural plant model mismatch is also addressed. The superior RTO performance for the GCLP is verified through simulation studies. The results show that the proposed RTO solution achieves a fast optimizing speed for parametric disturbances, and meanwhile, has the capacity for finding the true optimum for structurally unknown uncertainties.

The in situ self-doping enhances the interaction between SnS2 and SnS. The 3D hollow structures of the photocatalyst improve the light efficiency significantly due to effective multiple reflections in the cave. Therefore, this novel material shows a remarkable reduction performance for Cr(VI) and detoxification of cyanide under visible light irradiation. The concentration of Cr(VI) decreases sharply with the irradiation time, and 99.6% of Cr(VI) is degraded within 50 min. Meanwhile, the chromium ions can be adsorbed completely. Moreover, the removal rate for cyanide is as high as 97.2%. Combined with the analysis of in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy technology, the photocatalytic reduction mechanism of Cr(VI) is confirmed as a proton coupled electron transfer process. The improved photocatalytic activity of the Sn4+ self-doped SnS can be attributed to the enhanced photoabsorption properties and effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers. This general strategy provides a novel route for the synthesis of hollow cubic structural materials, which can be used for photocatalysis, energy storage and wastewater purification applications.

High-T-c Superconductivity in FeSe at High Pressure: Dominant Hole Carriers and Enhanced Spin Fluctuations	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							LAYER FESE/SRTIO3 FILMS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; MAGNETIC ORDER; SINGLE-LAYER; TEMPERATURE	The importance of electron-hole interband interactions is widely acknowledged for iron-pnictide superconductors with high transition temperatures (T-c). However, the absence of hole pockets near the Fermi level of the iron-selenide (FeSe) derived high-T-c superconductors raises a fundamental question of whether iron pnictides and chalcogenides have different pairing mechanisms. Here, we study the properties of electronic structure in the high-T-c phase induced by pressure in bulk FeSe from magnetotransport measurements and first-principles calculations. With increasing pressure, the low-T-c superconducting phase transforms into the high-T-c phase, where we find the normal-state Hall resistivity changes sign from negative to positive, demonstrating dominant hole carriers in contrast to other FeSe-derived high-T-c systems. Moreover, the Hall coefficient is enlarged and the magnetoresistance exhibits anomalous scaling behaviors, evidencing strongly enhanced interband spin fluctuations in the high-T-c phase. These results in FeSe highlight similarities with high-T-c phases of iron pnictides, constituting a step toward a unified understanding of iron-based superconductivity.	[Sun, J. P.; Ye, G.

In this study, we examined the activity of Pu-erh tea water extract on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 and clarified its underlying mechanism of action. We found that Pu-erh tea extract inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that Pu-erh tea extract inhibited tumor cell growth within 24 h via accumulation of cells in S phase. Further experiments showed that at 24 h, Pu-erh tea extract up-regulated the expressions of P-p53 (Ser15), p21 and P-JNK and down-regulated the expressions of PCNA, CyclinD1 and CyclinE at the protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells. In particular, the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 restored the induction of P-JNK, P-p53 (Ser15), p21, CyclinD1 and CyclinE by Pu-erh tea extract. Our results indicate that Pu-erh tea water extract inhibits cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells through the induction of apoptosis and the stimulation of cell cycle arrest, which is mediated via activation of the JNK-related pathway.

Despite the increase in phylogeographic studies of temperate plants in East Asia, far less attention has been paid to widely distributed deciduous shrubs that widespread across several floral regions. We sequenced two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments (ndhJ-trnF and trnD-trnT) and one nuclear DNA (Pgk1) of 472 individuals from 51 populations of such a group, the Indigofera bungeana complex. We used population genetic data as well as ecological niche modelling to examine the evolutionary history and glacial refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) of this group. We recovered 133 cpDNA and 68 nuclear haplotypes. The star-phylogeny of the recovered cpDNA and nuclear haplotypes and demographic analyses suggested distinct range expansion of I. bungeana complex have occurred during the early and middle Pleistocene. The climate change of the LGM might have affected little on the distribution of this complex based on the niche modelling. However, these climate changes and geographic isolation probably resulted in fixtures of the private haplotypes and genetic differentiations between regions. Our results suggested that this arid-tolerant species complex may have different responses to the Quaternary climate changes with those climate-sensitive species.

Herein, real-time Li-ion transition behavior and transport dynamics in typical poly(vinyl alcohol)/LiClO4 electrolytes under an external EF have been studied by combining time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with two-dimensional correlation FTIR spectroscopy. Results show that no migration of Li-ions has been detected when the time scale of the EF loading is at nanosecond (less than 200 ns). However, for the first time, Li-ions have been found to significantly transfer along the EF direction as the time scale enhances to microsecond order of magnitude and the migration period is less than 10 microseconds. The Li+ migration in the SPEs under an EF is a complicated process including quasi-periodic dissociation and coordination effects between Li-ion carriers and polymeric chains.

We focused on AK091631, a novel lncRNA, which we named lncRNA-beta-catenin associated transcript 1 (LncRNA-BCAT1). lncRNA-BCAT1 expression was decreased in CRC tissues, and was negatively associated with beta-catenin in both CRC tissues and cell lines. lncRNA-BCAT1 overexpression suppressed CRC cell growth and invasion by downregulating cyclin D1, c-Myc, and MMP-2. These results suggest that lncRNA-BCAT1 overexpression inhibits CRC cell growth and invasion via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway blockade, and that lncRNA-BCAT1 is repressed by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This evidence suggests that lncRNA-BCAT1 is a tumor suppressor and that lncRNA-BCAT1 may be an effective prognostic biomarker in CRC.

Homoiotherms such as mammals increase their energy expenditure to produce heat by activating the cAMP- protein kinase A ( PKA)- hormone- sensitive lipase ( HSL) pathway under cold stress. Although poikilothermic animals do not have the ability to regulate body temperature, whether this pathway is required for cold tolerance remains unknown. We have now achieved this using the genetically tractable model animal Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that cold stress activates PKA signaling, which in turn up- regulates the expression of a hormone- sensitive lipase hosl- 1. The lipase induces fat mobilization, leading to glycerol accumulation, thereby protecting worms against cold stress. Our findings provide an example of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cold tolerance that has persisted in both poikilothermic and homoeothermic animals.

NOV; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; SEQUENCES; ALPHAPROTEOBACTERIUM; CHELATOCOCCUS; BACTERIUM; MICROVIRGA; EVOLUTION	A novel strain, YIM 100770(T), was isolated from Rhinoceros unicornis faeces collected from Yunnan Wild Animal Park, China. The taxonomic status was determined based on the physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics. Strain YIM 100770(T) was observed to be rod-shaped, nonmotile, Gram-stain negative and aerobic. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 68.5 mol%. The cells of strain YIM 100770(T) contain ubiquinone Q-10 as the respiratory quinone. The major fatty acids (>1%) were identified as Summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c; 78.1%), Summed feature 4 (iso-C1(7:1)-I and/or anteiso-C-17:1-B; 12.9%), C-19:0 cyclo omega 8c (2.8%), C-16:0 (2.2%) and C-18:0 (2.2%). Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the strain show high similarities with the members of the genera Psychroglaciecola (94.5%), Methylobacterium (90.5-94.1%) and Microvirga (92.0-93.3%) in the family Methylobacteriaceae. In addition, the strain also showed high similarities with the members of the genera Chelatococcus (93.7-94.0%) and Pseudochelatococcus (93.1-93.7%) in the family Beijerinckiacea, and the genus Bosea (93.1-93.8%) in the family Bradyrhizobiaceae. The phylogenetic analysis, combined with the chemical characteristics, suggest that the strain represents a novel genus in the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria, for which the name Enterovirga rhinocerotis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of E. rhinocerotis is YIM 100770(T) (=DSM 25903(T) = CCTCC AB 2012048(T)).

The adsorption mode of four major compounds (rutin, vientin, isovientin and orientin) on Fe (001) surface was theoretically investigated by molecular dynamics (MD). The results show that DBLE is a good inhibitor, and the maximum inhibition efficiency is higher than 95%. The adsorption of DBLE on CRS surface obeys Langmuir isotherm with exothermic process. DBLE behaves as a mixed inhibitor. AFM results confirm that DBLE could retard the corrosion of CRS in C1(3)CCOOH. The inhibitive action of each flavonoid is lower than DBLE, and follows the order: rutin > vientin > isovientin > orientin. The major flavonoids in DBLE are adsorbed onto Fe (001) surface through FBS (flavones backbone structure) with a nearby flat orientation.(C) 2016 Brazilian Metallurgical, Materials and Mining Association.

When the LiMnPO4/C composite is finally processed by a ball milling treatment, amorphous domains are observed in LiMnPO4, and the resulting composite shows an obvious impedance growth and capacity loss upon cycling. When the localized amorphization of LiMnPO4 is eliminated by a post annealing treatment, the obtained composite shows an improved stability without any impedance growth upon cycling. Our result demonstrates that different processing route causes different crystallinity of LiMnPO4 which has a big impact on the cycling stability of LiMnPO4/C cathode.

One of the bottlenecks of metagenomic studies is lack of large-scale and cloud computing suitable data analysis tools. In this paper, we proposed a Spark-based tool, called MetaSpark, to recruit metagenomic reads to reference genomes. MetaSpark benefits from the distributed data set (RDD) of Spark, which makes it able to cache data set in memory across cluster nodes and scale well with the datasets. Compared with previous metagenomics recruitment tools, MetaSpark recruited significantly more reads than many programs such as SOAP2, BWA and LAST and increased recruited reads by similar to 4% compared with FRHIT when there were 1 million reads and 0.75GB references. Different test cases demonstrate MetaSpark's scalability and overall high performance.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			Inclusion of land use changes in long-term regional climate simulations over East Asia	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						land use changes; albedo; roughness; surface air temperature; precipitation	MODELING SYSTEM; COVER CHANGE; CHINA; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE	Long-term simulations with regional climate models (RCMs) show biases over East Asia that result partly from fix-in-time land use data (EX2001). Using four satellite-based land use images (EX8901) from the past 30 years instead of default values, 34-year integrations were performed to make comparisons (EX8901 minus EX2001) over East Asian land areas. The decreased albedo (-0.019) resulted in weakened upward short-wave flux, contributing to positive surface radiative forcing (2.89Wm(-2)), which then induced enhanced sensible heat fluxes. The near-surface wind speed was weakened (-0.15ms(-1)) in relation to the increased roughness length (0.042 m) and weakened pressure gradient, and induced a decreased precipitation bias of 0.0095mmday(-1). The increased ground temperature and enhanced soil water content promoted strengthened sensible and latent heat fluxes, which induced a decreased surface air temperature bias (-0.24 degrees C). Results show that by including land use changes, model simulations can be improved.

ARGO-YBJ collaboration	Absolute-energy-scale calibration of ARGO-YBJ for light primaries in multi-TeV region with the Moon shadow observation	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic ray; Moon shadow; Energy calibration; Energy spectrum	SPECTRA	In 2011 ARGO-YBJ experiment has reported a work to study the absolute rigidity scale of the primary cosmic ray particles based on the Moon's shadow observation. Given the progress in high energy hadronic interaction models with LHC data, in cosmic ray chemical composition measurement and in experimental data accumulation, more updates can be researched. This paper aims to further disentangle the composition dependence in absolute-energy-scale calibration by using specific moon-shadow data which mainly is comprised of light component cosmic rays. Results show that, 17% energy scale error is estimated from 3 TeV to 50 TeV. To validate the performance of this technique, the light component cosmic ray spectrum in the same energy region is shown.

The spatial co-location pattern mining problem has been investigated extensively in the past due to its broad range of applications. In this paper we study this problem for fuzzy objects. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas, such as the geographical information system and the biomedical image database. In this paper, we propose two new kinds of co-location pattern mining for fuzzy objects, single co-location pattern mining (SCP) and range co-location pattern mining (RCP), to mining co-location patterns at a membership threshold or within a membership range. For efficient SCP mining, we optimize the basic mining algorithm to accelerate the co-location pattern generation. To improve the performance of RCP mining, effective pruning strategies are developed to significantly reduce the search space. The efficiency of our proposed algorithms as well as the optimization techniques are verified with an extensive set of experiments.

Although numerous models for productivity assessment exist, most are cumbersome to use and require substantial parameter inputs. We developed a new empirical soil productivity model based on field investigations of soil erosion, soil physicochemical properties, and crop yields in the dry-hot valleys (DHVs) in China. We found that soil pH, and organic matter and available potassium contents significantly affected crop yields under eroded conditions of the DHVs. Moreover, available potassium content was the key factor affecting soil productivity. We then modified an existing soil productivity model by adding the following parameters: contents of effective water, potassium, organic matter, and clay, soil pH, and root weighting factor. The modified soil productivity model explained 63.5% of the crop yield. We concluded that the new model was simple, realistic, and exhibited strong predictability. In addition to providing an accurate assessment of soil productivity, our model could potentially be applied as a soil module in comprehensive crop models.

Surgical resection and conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy will ultimately fail due to tumor recurrence and resistance. Thus, the development of novel treatment is urgently needed. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is an important and well-established target for BC treatment. In this study, we utilized the free and open-source protein-ligand docking software idock to prospectively identify potential inhibitors of FGFR3 from 3,167 worldwide approved small-molecule drugs using a repositioning strategy. Six high-scoring compounds were purchased and tested in vitro. Among them, the acaricide drug fluazuron exhibited the highest anti-proliferative effect in human BC cell lines RT112 and RT4. We further demonstrated that fluazuron treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis cells, and decreased the phosphorylation level of FGFR3 and its downstream proteins FRS2-alpha, AKT, and ERK. We also investigated the anticancer effect of fluazuron in vivo in BALB/C nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with RT112 cells. Our results showed that oral treatment with fluazuron (80 mg/kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth. These results suggested for the first time that fluazuron is a potential inhibitor of FGFR3 and a candidate anticancer drug for the treatment of BC.

But other four pyrimidine derivatives exhibited poor inhibitive ability. The addition of MP caused both anodic and cathodic curves to low current densities, and was found to significantly strengthen the impedance. Quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamic simulation were performed to theoretically investigate the adsorption mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we report the discovery of seven new IFQs, IFQ A-G (1-7), and three new IIQs, IIQ A-C (8-10), along with the known anthraquinone desoxyerythrolaccin (11), from Streptomyces sp. CB01883, expanding the chemical diversity of this family of natural products. The structures of these natural products were established on the basis of their HRESI-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data. All compounds were assessed for antibacterial activity, with 11 and 1, 5-7 exhibiting moderate and weak activities, respectively, against several Gram-positive bacteria tested. Bioinformatics analysis of the Streptomyces sp. CB01883 genome revealed the ifq gene cluster that showed identical genetic organization, with high-sequence identity, to the ifn gene cluster recently cloned from Streptomyces sp. RI-77 and confirmed to encode the biosynthesis of two IFQs, JBIR-76 and JBIR-77. Co-isolation of IFQs with IIQs from Streptomyces sp. CB01883 and facile chemical transformation of selected IFQs to IIQs, as exemplified by 1 to 9, together with the finding of the ifq cluster that most likely only encodes IFQ biosynthesis, support the proposal that IIQs may be derived nonenzymatically from IFQs in the presence of an amine.

COLI; PROTEIN	The metabolism of the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides is versatile and it can grow under various conditions. Here, we report evidence that the anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism of R. sphaeroides is regulated by protein lysine acetylation. Using a proteomic approach, 59 acetylated peptides were detected. Among them is the global anaerobic transcription factor FnrL, which regulates the biosynthetic pathway of tetrapyrroles and synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus. Lysine 223 of FnrL was identified as acetylated. We show that all three lysines in the DNA binding domain (K223, K213 and K175) of FnrL can be acetylated by acetyl-phosphate in vitro. A bacterial deacetylase homolog, RsCobB can deacetylate FnrL in vitro. The transcription of genes downstream of FnrL decreased when the DNA binding domain of FnrL was acetylated, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and acetylation-mimicking mutagenesis. An increasing number of acetylated lysines resulted in a further decrease in DNA binding ability. These results demonstrate that the lysine acetylation can fine tune the function of the oxygen-sensitive FnrL; thus, it might regulate anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism of R. sphaeroides.

While previous work has shown that the R119G point mutation in the P5CR protein is involved, the structural mechanism behind the pathology remains to be elucidated. In order to probe the role of the R119G mutation in cutis laxa, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, essential dynamics (ED) analysis, and Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy calculations on wild type (WT) and mutant P5CR-NAD complex. These MD simulations and ED analyses suggest that the R119G mutation decreases the flexibility of P5CR, specifically in the substrate binding pocket, which could decrease the kinetics of the cofactor entrance and egress. Furthermore, the MM-PBSA calculations suggest the R119G mutant has a lower cofactor binding affinity for NAD than WT. Our study provides insight into the possible role of the R119G mutation during interactions between P5CR and NAD, thus bettering our understanding of how the mutation promotes cutis laxa.

Since Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has the strong ability to learn parts-based representations, recently, a number of algorithms based on NMF have been proposed for image annotation and have achieved good performance. However, most of the efforts have focused on the representations of images and annotations. The properties of the semantic parts have not been well studied. In this article, we revisit the sparseness-constrained NMF (sNMF) proposed by Hoyer [ 2004]. By endowing the sparseness constraint with a geometric interpretation and sNMF with theoretical analyses of the generalization ability, we show that NMF with such a sparseness constraint has three advantages for image annotation tasks: (i) The sparseness constraint is more l(0)-norm oriented than the l(0)-norm-based sparseness, which significantly enhances the ability of NMF to robustly learn semantic parts. (ii) The sparseness constraint has a large cone interpretation and thus allows the reconstruction error of NMF to be smaller, which means that the learned semantic parts are more powerful to represent images for tagging. (iii) The learned semantic parts are less correlated, which increases the discriminative ability for annotating images. Moreover, we present a new efficient large sparse cone NMF (LsCNMF) algorithm to optimize the sNMF problem by employing the Nesterov's optimal gradient method. We conducted experiments on the PASCAL VOC07 dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of LsCNMF for image annotation.

Up to now, graphene has not been widely used in optoelectronic fields due to the lack of large-area uniform doped graphene (n-doped and p-doped) with smooth surface. Therefore, it is rather desired to develop some effective doping methods to extend graphene to optoelectronics. Here we developed a novel doping method to prepare large-area (> centimeter scale) uniform doped graphene film with a nanoscale roughness(RMS roughness similar to 1.4 nm), the method (nano-metal film doping method) is simple but effective. Using this method electron doping (electron-injection) may be easily realized by the simple thermal deposition of Ag nano-film on a transferred CVD graphene. The doping effectiveness has been proved by Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Importantly, our method sheds light on some potential applications of graphene in optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, LEDs, phototransistors, solar cells, lasers etc. (C) 2017 Author(s).

Hyphae of T. harzianum overlapped with corrosion products on the surface of AZ31 B magnesium alloy were clearly observed. Results showed that the presence of T. harzianum decreased the pH and E-corr vs. SCE. Electrochemical results showed that i(corr) increased while R-t decreased in the presence of T. harzianum obviously compared to the sterile AS, suggesting acceleration of the corrosion by T. harzianum. Cyclic polarization and SEM indicated that T. harzianum decreased the resistance of the localized corrosion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The rhizosphere of macrophytes such as Phragmites sp., Typha sp. serves as an active and dynamic zone for the microbial degradation of organic pollutants. However, it is still not clear how soil bacterial communities respond to macrophytes and pollutants during the process. For this purpose, the seedlings of Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia were planted respectively in the VF CWs added with HCB at a dose of 2 mg/kg. During 96 days of cultivation, we monitored hexachlorobenzene (HCB) removal efficiency by GC/MS and the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in the different VF CWs by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and constructed bacterial clone library based on PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene. As expected, the rhizosphere bacterial communities also remained insensitive to HCB exposure in the wetland soil. The diversity of these microbes presented two stages, from the varied up and down to equilibrium in the entire experimental period. Molecular analysis revealed that the phylum Firmicutes dominated over the bacterial communities. The genera that increased under HCB stress included the well-known HCB-degrading bacteria (Pseudomonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp.) and other common bacteria found in contaminated soil but with lesser known practical functions (Burkholderia sp., Lysinibacillus fusiformis, and Bacillus cereus). Furthermore, there was a certain variance in the relative abundances of the bacterial phyla and HCB removal efficiency among different VF CW treatments. The degradation of HCB in T. angustifolia microcosms was faster than that in P. australis and unvegetated wetlands, and the highest bacterial diversity and richness was found in the VF CWs comprising T. angustifolia.

Since human actions were extracted from Kinect and inertial sensors, they can be characterized by multiple feature representations. By encoding the multiview features into a unified space, it could be optimal for human action recognition. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature fusion method termed multiview Cauchy estimator feature embedding (MCEFE) for human action recognition. By minimizing empirical risk, MCEFE integrates the encoded complementary information in multiple views to find the unified data representation and the projection matrices. To enhance robustness to outliers, the Cauchy estimator is imposed on the reconstruction error. Furthermore, ensemble manifold regularization is enforced on the projection matrices to encode the correlations between different views and avoid overfitting. Experiments are conducted on the new Chinese Academy of Sciences-Yunnan University-multimodal human action database to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MCEFE for human action recognition.

Their structures were elucidated from extensive NMR and MS data. The absolute configurations of the coumarins were assigned using the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism data. Anisucoumaramide (1) represents the first example of a naturally occurring coumarin of which the terpenoidal side chain does not comply with the biosynthesis isoprene rule due to the presence of an unprecedented acetamido motif directly connected with the terpenoidal side chain. The delta-truxinate derivative was isolated from Clausena species for the first time. Compound 1 showed high selectivity for the MAO-B isoenzyme and inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range. Putative biosynthesis pathways toward 1 and 2 are proposed.

However, the breakdown voltage dependence on the ambient temperature results in a gain variation of similar to 3%/degrees C. This severely limits the application of this device in experiments with wide range of operating temperature, especially in space missions. An experimental setup was established to investigate the temperature and bias voltage dependence of gain for the Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC). The gain and breakdown voltage dependence on operating temperature of an MPPC can be approximated by a linear function, which is similar to the behavior of a zener diode. The measured temperature coefficient of the breakdown voltage is (59.4 0.4 mV)/degrees C. According to this fact, an analog power supply based on two zener diodes and an operational amplifier was designed with a positive temperature coefficient. The measured temperature dependence for the designed power supply is between 63.65-64.61 mV/degrees C at different output voltages. The designed power supply can bias the MPPC at an over-voltage with a temperature variation of similar to 5 mV/degrees C. The gain variation of the MPPC biased at over-voltage of 2 V was reduced from 2.8%/degrees C to 0.3%/degrees C when biased the MPPC with the designed power supply for gain control. Detailed design and performance of the analog power supply in the temperature range from similar to 42.7 degrees C to 20.9 degrees C will be discussed in this paper.

J	Yang, XH; Liu, WF; Tao, DP; Cheng, J				Yang, Xinghao; Liu, Weifeng; Tao, Dapeng; Cheng, Jun			Canonical correlation analysis networks for two-view image recognition	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Canonical correlation analysis; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks; Image classification	DEEP	In recent years, deep learning has attracted an increasing amount of attention in machine learning and artificial intelligence areas. Currently, many deep learning network-related architectures such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural network (CNN), wavelet scattering network (ScatNet) and principal component analysis network (PCANet) have been proposed. The most effective network is PCANet, which has achieved promising performance in image classification, such as for face, object and handwritten digit recognition. PCANet can only handle data that are represented by single-view features. In this paper, we present a canonical correlation analysis network (CCANet) to address image classification, in which images are represented by two-view features. The CCANet learns two-view multistage filter banks by a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method and constructs a cascaded convolutional deep network. Then, we incorporate filters with binaryzation and block-wise histogram processes to form the final depth structure. In addition, we introduce a variation of CCANet dubbed RandNet-2-in which the filter banks are randomly generated. Extensive experiments are conducted using the ETH-80, Yale-B, and USPS databases for object classification, face classification and handwritten digits classification, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the CCANet algorithm is more effective than PCANet, RandNet-1 and RandNet-2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We model the jets MWL SEDs in framework of a well accepted single-zone leptonic model including synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton (EC) processes for the jets in a state of equipartition between particle and magnetic field energy densities. In the model the GeV gamma-ray spectrum is modeled by a combination of two different external Compton scattered components: (i) EC scattering of photons coming from disk and broad line region (BLR), and (ii) EC scattering of photons originating from the dust tours (DT) and BLR. We find that the SEDs can be well reproduced by the equipartition model for the most majority of the sources, and the results are in agreement with many recent studies. Our results suggest that the SEDs modelling alone may not provide a significant constraint on the location of the HE emission region if we do not know enough about the physical properties of the external environment.

In this study, we conducted a large-scale phylogenomic survey of subtilase protease genes in 83 whole genome sequenced fungal species in order to identify the evolutionary patterns and subsequent functional divergences of different subtilase families among the main lineages of the fungal kingdom. Our comparative genomic analyses of the subtilase superfamily indicated that extensive gene duplications, losses and functional diversifications have occurred in fungi, and that the four families of subtilase enzymes in fungi, including proteinase K-like, Pyrolisin, kexin and S53, have distinct evolutionary histories which may have facilitated the adaptation of fungi to a broad array of life strategies. Our study provides new insights into the evolution of the subtilase superfamily in fungi and expands our understanding of the evolution of fungi with different lifestyles.

The increasing data show that cancer cells are inclined to produce mRNA isoforms with a shortened 3'UTR undergoing APA. For example, the Dicer1 isoform with a shorter 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) was found to be overexpressed in some cancer cells, which may be used as a potential novel prognostic biomarker for cancer. In the present work, a novel electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive determination of Dicer1 was designed by using gold nanoparticles and p-sulfonated calix[6] arene functionalized reduced graphene oxide (Au@ SCX6-rGO) as nanocarriers. The results showed that the expressions of the shorter 3'UTR (Dicer1-S) both in BT474 and SKBR3 were obviously higher than those of the longer Dicer1 (Dicer1-L) by the constructed biosensor, which agreed well with the result analyzed by the RT-qPCR method. The detection ranges of Dicer1-S and Dicer1-L were 10(-14)-10(-9) M and 10(-15)-10(-10) M. The LODs were 3.5 and 0.53 fM. The specificity of the proposed biosensor was also very high. For the first time, the expressional analysis of different 3' UTRs caused by APA was studied by an electrochemical method. Moreover, the use of a macrocyclic host for constructing an electrochemical/biosensing platform has rarely been reported. The proposed electrochemical sensing strategy is thus expected to provide a new method for determination of novel biomarkers and a novel method for fast and cheap analysis of APA.

Electronic and transport properties of n-type monolayer black phosphorus at low temperatures	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; MOBILITY; GAS	We present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic and transport properties of monolayer black phosphorus (BP). This study is motivated by recent experimental activities in investigating n-type few-layer BP systems. The electron density of states, the screening length, and the low-temperature electron mobility are calculated for monolayer BP (MLBP). In particular, the electron transport mobilities along the armchair and zigzag directions are examined on the basis of the momentum-balance equation derived from a semiclassical Boltzmann equation. The anisotropic electron mobilities in MLBP along different directions are demonstrated where the electron-impurity scattering is considered. Furthermore, we compare the results obtained from two electronic band structures of MLBP and find that the simplified model can describe quite rightly the electronic and transport properties of MLBP. This study is relevant to the application of few-layer BP based electronic systems as advanced electronic devices.	[Han, F. W.; Xu, W.; Li, L.

The interactions between tobacco and P. nicotianae are complex and the outcomes of the interactions depend on the tobacco genotype, P. nicotianae strain, and environmental conditions. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to investigate and compare transcriptional changes in the stems of tobacco upon inoculation with P. nicotianae strain race 0. We used two tobacco varieties: RBST (named from resistance to black shank and tobacco mosaic virus), which was resistant to the P. nicotianae strain race 0, and Honghuadajinyuan (HD), which was susceptible to P. nicotianae race 0. Samples were collected 12 and 72-hour post inoculation (hpi). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significantly enriched GO terms indicated that several basic defense mechanisms were suppressed in both varieties, which included response to wounding (GO: 0009611), and defense response to fungus (GO: 0050832). We also found some genes that may especially be related to mechanisms of resistance in RBST, such as the one encoding a chitinase. These results will provide a valuable resource for understanding the interactions between P. nicotianae and tobacco plants.

Nevertheless, the timing and sources of their introduction into Africa remain enigmatic. Herein, we analyse variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop sequences from 345 Nigerian and 37 Kenyan village dogs plus 1530 published sequences of dogs from other parts of Africa, Europe and West Asia. All Kenyan dogs can be assigned to one of three haplogroups (matrilines; clades): A, B, and C, while Nigerian dogs can be assigned to one of four haplogroups A, B, C, and D. None of the African dogs exhibits a matrilineal contribution from the African wolf (Canis lupus lupaster). The genetic signal of a recent demographic expansion is detected in Nigerian dogs from West Africa. The analyses of mitochondrial genomes reveal a maternal genetic link between modern West African and North European dogs indicated by sub-haplogroup D1 (but not the entire haplogroup D) coalescing around 12,000 years ago. Incorporating molecular anthropological evidence, we propose that sub-haplogroup D1 in West African dogs could be traced back to the late-glacial dispersals, potentially associated with human hunter-gatherer migration from southwestern Europe.

In this study, tadalafil and two macrocycles (beta-CD and SCX6) were selected as the guest and host molecules, respectively. The inclusion complexes of (beta-CD/tadalafil and SCX6/tadalafil were studied by UV spectroscopy and molecular simulation calculations, proving the higher supermolecular recognition capability of SCX6 than beta-CD towards tadalafil. The beta-CD@RGO and SCX6@RGO composites were prepared by a wet-chemical route. The obtained composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, atomic force microscopy, and zeta potential. The SCX6@RGO showed a higher electrochemical response than beta-CD@RGO, which was caused by the higher recognition capability of SCX6 than beta-CD. By combining the merits of SCX6 and the RGO, a sensitive electrochemical sensing platform was developed based on the SCX6@RGO nanohybrids. A linear response range of 0.1-50 mu M and 50-1000 mu M for tadalafil with a low detection limit of 0.045 mu M (S/N=3) was obtained by using this method. The constructed sensing platform was successfully used to determine tadalafil in herbal sexual health products and spiked human serum samples, suggesting its promising analytical applications for the trace level determination of tadalafil.

In this paper, Ag-LaFeO3 fibers, spheres and cages have been prepared. Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, the structure and morphology of the products were characterized. It has been revealed that the as-prepared materials have uniform morphologies and consist of numerous nanocrystals. Sensors based on the Ag-LaFeO3 fibers, spheres and cages all exhibited high responses and good selectivities to formaldehyde gas. Owing to their hollow and porous structure, large surface area and greater number of surface active sites, the Ag-LaFeO3 cages have the lowest operating temperature. The results suggest that the as-prepared Ag-LaFeO3 fibers, spheres and cages, especially the cages, are promising candidates for high performance formaldehyde sensors.

These data indicate the likely presence of C-4 taxa during the earliest part of the record analysed, with C-4 species also prominent during the mid and late Miocene and especially the mid Quaternary. Notably the two records diverge after the mid Quaternary, when PyC data indicate a reduced contribution of C-4 taxa to biomass burning, whereas plant-derived n-alkanes indicate a greater abundance of C-4 plants. This divergence likely reflects differences in the predominant source areas of organic materials accumulating at the coring site, with PyC representing a larger source area that includes material transported in the atmosphere from more temperate (relatively cooler and drier) parts of East Asia. Variations in the relative abundances of C-3 and C-4 taxa appear to be linked to a combination of environmental factors that have varied temporally and geographically and that are unique to East Asia. A major expansion of C-4 biomass in warmer subtropical parts of eastern Asia from similar to 1 Ma and particularly from similar to 0.4 Ma is later than other parts of the world.

In order to describe the TTR, we employ the escape time that the stock price drops from the maximum to minimum value in a data window length (DWL). After theoretical and empirical research on probability density function of return, the results in both 'DJI and CSI300 indicate that: (i) As increasing DWL, the expectation of returns and its stability are weakened. (ii) An optimal TTR is related to a maximum return and minimum risk of stock investment in stock price crashes.

The BP undergoes a topological Lifshitz transition from band semiconductor to a zero-gapDirac semimetal state at a critical pressure P-c, characterized by a weak localization-weak antilocalization transition at low magnetic fields and the emergence of a nontrivial Berry phase of pi detected by SdH magnetooscillations in magnetoresistance curves. In the transition region, we observe a pressure-dependent negative MR only in the B parallel to I configuration. This negative longitudinal MR is attributed to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly (topological E . B term) in the presence of weak antilocalization corrections.

A 31-kb novel nicotine-degrading gene cluster, ndp, in strain TY exhibited a different genetic organization with the vpp cluster in strains Ochrobactrum rhizosphaerae SJY1 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33. Genes in vpp were separated by a 20-kb interval sequence, while genes in ndp were localized together. Half of the homolog genes were in different locus in ndp and vpp. Moreover, there was a gene encoding putative transporter of nicotine or other critical metabolite in ndp. Among the putative nicotine-degrading related genes, the nicotine hydroxylase, 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine oxidase, 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine oxidase, and 6-hydroxy-3-succinyl-pyridine monooxygenase responsible for catalyzing the transformation of nicotine to 2, 5-dihydropyridine in the initial four steps of the VPP were characterized. Hydroxylation at C6 of the pyridine ring and dehydrogenation at the C2-C3 bond of the pyrrolidine ring were the key common reactions in the VPP, pyrrolidine and pyridine pathways. Besides, VPP and pyrrolidine pathway shared the same latter part of metabolic pathway. After analysis of metabolic genes in the pyridine, pyrrolidine, and VPP pathways, we found that both the evolutionary features and metabolic mechanisms of the VPP were more similar to the pyrrolidine pathway. The linked ndpHFEG genes shared by the VPP and pyrrolidine pathways indicated that these two pathways might share the same origin, but variants were observed in some bacteria. And we speculated that the pyridine pathway was distributed in Gram-positive bacteria and the VPP and pyrrolidine pathways were distributed in Gram-negative bacteria by using comprehensive homologs searching and phylogenetic tree construction.

The results regarding the mid-Holocene and the LGM demonstrate that south-central and southwestern China have been long-term stable refugia, and that the current distribution is limited to the prehistoric refugia. Given future distribution under six possible climate scenarios, only some parts of the current range of D. involucrata in the mid-high mountains of south-central and southwestern China would be maintained, while some shift west into higher mountains would occur. Our results show that the predicted suitable area offering high probability (0.5-1) accounts for an average of only 29.2% among the models predicted for the future (2070), making D. involucrata highly vulnerable. We assess and propose priority protected areas in light of climate change. The information provided will also be relevant in planning conservation of other paleoendemic species having ecological traits and distribution ranges comparable to those of D. involucrata.

Our previous studies showed that microRNA-375 was significantly down-regulated in carcinoma tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues, which strongly indicates that microRNA-375 might suppress the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the microRNA-375 regulation in colorectal cancer remains unclear. In this study, we first sorted out jak2, map3k8 and atg7 as microRNA-375 targeted genes from multiple databases, and found that jak2, map3k8 and their downstream genes stat3 and erk were up-regulated in carcinoma tissues. Secondly, we over-expressed microRNA-375 in colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, Caco2 and HT29). Our results showed that in microRNA-375 over-expressing cells, JAK2/STAT3 and MAP3K8/ERK proteins were down-regulated, cell proliferation was inhibited, cell migration rate did not change. There was no significant difference on ATG7 expression between the control group and microRNA-375 over-expressing HT29/ Caco2 cells, whereas microRNA-375 down-regulated ATG7 specifically in HCT116 cells. Finally, we demonstrated that expressing microRNA-375 suppressed tumor formation in nude mice. In conclusion, microRNA-375 might function as a tumor-repressive gene to inhibit cell proliferation, mainly through targeting both JAK2/STAT3 and MAP3K8/ERK signaling pathways in colorectal cancer. These findings suggest miR-375 as a promising diagnostic marker and a therapeutic drug for colorectal cancer.

J	Meng, WD; Xia, Y; Song, FX; Pu, XY				Meng, Weidong; Xia, Yan; Song, Fangxi; Pu, Xiaoyun			Double liquid-core cylindrical lens utilized to measure liquid diffusion coefficient	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							HOLOGRAPHIC-INTERFEROMETRY; OPTICAL TECHNIQUES	We design and fabricate an aplanatic double liquid-core cylindrical lens (DLCL), which is used to measure the binary liquid diffusion coefficient (D). The front lens of the DLCL is used as both a diffusion cell and a key imaging element; the refractive index (RI) of liquid filled in its core can be measured in the way of spatial resolution. The rear lens of the DLCL is used as an aplanatic component, and either the RI position of spherical aberration (SA) or the SA in a range of RI caused by the front lens can be regulated by selecting the liquid, of which RI is pre-prepared and filled in the rear liquid core. Equipped with the aplanatic DLCL, two methods have been applied to measure the D value of 0.33mol/L KCL aqueous solution at temperature 298.15K. The first method derives D value precisely from the drift rate of diffusion image and the measured D is 1.8508 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s. Meanwhile, the second method obtains the D value rapidly by analyzing an instantaneous diffusion image and the measured D is 1.8619 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s. The measured values are in good agreement with the literature value, demonstrating that the designed DLCL works well in measuring liquid diffusion coefficients.

Don (BFC) has been used in China as a folk medicine for the treatment of cough and asthma for more than 2000 years. The antitussive and antiasthmatic effects of BFC have been reported before, nevertheless its toxicity and safety have not been documented. This study investigated the possible effects of BFC on spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitotic fidelity and genomic stability in human NCM460 colon epithelial cells. Methods: Cells were treated with BFC (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mu g/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 h and harvested differently according to the biomarkers observed. Mitotic aberrations were assessed by the biomarkers of chromosome misalignment (CMA), chromosome lagging (CL) and chromatin bridge (CB). Frequencies of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge and nuclear bud (NB) in cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay were used as indicators of genomic instability (GIN). SAC activity was determined by anaphase to metaphase ratio (AMR) and the expression of several SAC genes, including CENP-E, Mps1, Bub1, Mad-1, BubR1 and Mad-2. Results: Compared with the control, cells in BFC treated groups (80 and 160 mu g/ml) showed: 1) increased AMR (p < 0.05), up-regulated expression of Mps1, Bub1 and Mad-1 (p < 0.05) and down-regulated expression of CENP-E, BubR1 and Mad-2 (p < 0.05); 2) increased frequencies of CMA, CL and CB (p < 0.01); 3) increased incidences of MN and NB (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study revealed for the first time that BFC causes mitotic aberrations and GIN in human colon epithelial cells and these effects maybe the result of SAC dysfunction.

Role of the Heat Sink Layer Ta for Ultrafast Spin Dynamic Process in Amorphous TbFeCo Thin Films	SPIN			English	Article						Ultrafast spin dynamics; heat sink layer; TbFeCo films; TRMOKE	MAGNETIZATION DYNAMICS	The ultrafast demagnetization processes (UDP) in Ta (t nm)/TbFeCo (20 nm) films have been studied using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE). With a fixed pump fluence of 2 mJ/cm(2), for the sample without a Ta underlayer (t=0nm), we observed the UDP showing a two-step decay behavior, with a relatively longer decay time (T-2) around 3.0 ps in the second step due to the equilibrium of spin-lattice relaxation following the 4f occupation. As a 10nm Ta layer is deposited, the two-step demagnetization still exists while T-2 decreases to similar to 1.9ps. Nevertheless, the second-step decay (T-2=0ps) disappears as the Ta layer thickness is increased up to 20 nm, only the first-step UDP occurs within 500 fs, followed by a fast recovery process. The rapid magnetization recovery rate strongly depends on the pump fluence. We infer that the Ta layer provides conduction electrons involving the thermal equilibrium of spin-lattice interaction and serves as heat bath taking away energy from spins of TbFeCo alloy film in UDP.

To date, few studies have determined the possible contribution to corrosion of titanium made by biofilm architecture. We investigated the interaction between the oral Streptococcus sanguis biofilm architecture and its influence on titanium corrosion in enriched artificial saliva using electrochemical methods and microscopic study. Patchy biofilms were observed on titanium surface after being immersed in solution containing S. sanguis. The thickness and size of the patchy biofilms increased with an increase of immersion time. The extensive pits were clearly observed by scanning electron microscopy, showing that adsorption of S. sanguis on titanium promoted the localized corrosion. The electrochemical results indicated that the corrosion rates were clearly accelerated in the presence of S. sanguis. The low icorr and high R-t in the first 48 h indicated that a typical passive behavior still remained. Our study showed that the pitting corrosion of titanium was mainly attributed to the formation of a self-catalytic corrosion cell by the co-effect of patchy biofilm and organic acid secreted by S. sanguis.

In this study, a new category of "two-in-one" fluorescent xanthone inhibitors was developed for the systematic evaluation of anticancer activity and the selective imaging of cytoplasm in vitro. These xanthone inhibitors presented high fluorescent brightness, working over a wide pH range enabled by a "switchable reaction" of the heterocyclic backbone. The strength and nature of fluorescence were probed via spectroscopic methods and density functional theory calculations on the molecular level, respectively. Along with the potent anticancer activity, which was demonstrated using MTT and clonogenic assays with high fluorescent brightness in the cytoplasm, SLI 3fd could be established as a modeled self-monitoring drug in cancer therapy.

Discussions are ongoing on how to measure the effectiveness of policy implementation at the local level. But there is no definitive theory of effective policy implementation, and very few frameworks have been found acceptable as the basis of an analysis of the effectiveness of policy implementation, especially on droughts. Based on the 2009-2010 extreme drought in Yunnan, China, this article presents a modified framework to assess the effectiveness of policy implementation by defining policy, practice, and performance, as well as a feedback loop by which to share the lessons learned. Water conservancy projects in Luliang County and the agricultural diversity program in Longyang County in Yunnan Province were analyzed from a farmers' perspective. It was found that farmers are highly dependent on government policies and projects, and the effectiveness of policies is measured by short-term, immediate, and tangible benefits rather than long-term adaptation strategies. The results highlight the urgent need to reduce risks by developing better awareness about climate change and drought and its impacts, increased understanding of drought hazards, and implementation of appropriate measures for long-term adaptation.

The Spatial and Temporal Contribution of Glacier Runoff to Watershed Discharge in the Yarkant River Basin, Northwest China	WATER			English	Article						glacier runoff contribution; distributed hydrological modeling; Yarkant River Basin; soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Karakoram	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TARIM RIVER; TIBETAN PLATEAU; YANGTZE-RIVER; SOURCE REGION; MASS-BALANCE; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; STREAMFLOW; RESOURCES	In this paper, a glacial module based on an enhanced temperature-index approach was successfully introduced into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the glacier runoff and water balance of a glacierized watershed, the mountainous region of the Yarkant River Basin (YRB) in Karakoram. Calibration and validation of the SWAT model were based on comparisons between the simulated and observed discharge with a monthly temporal resolution from 1961 to 2011 for the Kaqun hydrological station. The results reaffirmed the viability of the approach for simulating glacier runoff, as evidenced by a Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) of 0.82-0.86 as well as a percentage bias (PBIAS) of -4.5% to 2.4%, for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Over the last 50 years, the total discharge and glacier runoff both exhibited increasing trends with 0.031 x 10(9) m(3<bold>)a(</bold>-1) and 0.011 x 10(9) m(3<bold>)a(</bold>-1). The annual glacier runoff contribution to the streamflow was between 42.3% and 64.5%, with an average of 51.6%, although the glaciers accounted for only 12.6% of the watershed drainage area in the mountainous YRB. The monthly contribution of the glacier runoff ranged from 11.0% in April to 62.1% in August, and the glacier runoff from June to September accounted for about 86.3% of the annual glacier runoff. Runoff from the mountainous regions above 5000 m a.s.l. accounted for 70.5% of the total discharge, with glacier runoff contributions being approximately 46.4%.

In this article, we establish Bayesian framework of hypothesis testing, and extend the Neyman-Pearson lemma to create the Bayesian most powerful test of general hypotheses, thus providing optimality theory to determine thresholds of Bayes factors. Unlike conventional Bayes tests, the proposed Bayesian test is able to control the type I error. To extend Neyman-Pearson lemma, the Bayesian most powerful test is created for general hypotheses.

Any design flaw in any of these algorithms could lead to attacks on GKD protocols. We show how two recently-proposed stateful GKD protocols based on asymmetric cryptographic primitives suffer from collusion attacks due to security flaws in either secret assignment algorithms or leave rekeying algorithms. A variety of single-user attacks and improvements on stateless group rekeying algorithms of a number of GKD protocols based on Shamir's Secret-Sharing Scheme (SSS) have been put forward. We show the stateless group rekeying algorithms of one improved protocol and its variant (proposed by us) still suffer from attacks. In addition, we prove a lower bound on the size of a user's long-term secret for perfectly secure multi-session stateless GKD protocols. This bound reveals that (i) it is impossible to design an infinite-session stateless GKD protocol that is both perfectly secure and practical; (ii) all the considered SSS-based stateless GKD protocols are bound to be either incorrect or vulnerable to attacks. This work highlights the urgent necessity of adopting the provable security approach in this research field.

Based on two case studies from Yunnan Province, this paper examines the effects of China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform with regard to villagers' participation in their implementation of the reform, their effects on formal tenure rights and the changes to actual tenure rights on the basis of two case studies from Yunnan. The case studies show that higher levels of participation by villagers can lead to changes in formal and actual tenure rights that bring these rights more into line with national objectives. Thus, decentralization may be a critical precondition for successful forest tenure reform in China and beyond.

The phase composition and microstructure of the electrocatalyst are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical performance of H2O2 electroreduction on the Co/Co3O4 petals (Ps) is explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). The Co/Co3O4 Ps exhibits a higher conductivity than single Co3O4, which leads to a better catalytic activity and stability toward H2O2 electroreduction. In a solution of 3 mol NaOH and 0.5 mol L-1 H2O2, the current density of H2O2 electroreduction on Co/Co3O4 Ps is 440 mA cm(-2) at -0.8 V, higher than that on Co3O4, which make the obtained Co/Co3O4 Ps an excellent alternative catalyst for H2O2 fuel cell.

The floral organogenesis of E. cavaleriei has been investigated with the light and scanning electron microscope to clarify its floral characters and its uncertain systematic position. Eurycorymbus cavaleriei possesses several unique characteristics in Sapindaceae. Flowers are unisexual. Sepals initiate in a spiral sequence, followed by five alternating petals which resemble sepals at maturity. The sequential initiation of eight stamens partly overlaps with that of the petals. Three carpellary lobes are simultaneously demarcated and merge gradually to form a tricarpellate ovary. Mature stamens of male flowers have long and smooth filaments, which are folded in buds. In female flowers only one or two ovules per ovary develop into seeds. The extrastaminal nectary forms doubly scalloped lobes. Symmetry changes from oblique monosymmetry at a mid-developmental stage to polysymmetry at maturity. It is suggested that monosymmetry might precede polysymmetry in the evolution of Sapindaceae.

The fundamental experimental variables influencing Ni2+ transport, such as ammonia concentration, carrier concentration, H2SO4 concentration in the stripping solution, stirring speed, and initial Ni2+ concentration were studied. Almost all of Ni2+ was transported from the feed to the stripping phase after 18 h of operation with a permeability coefficient of 9.28 x 10(-6) m s(-1) under optimum conditions: stirring speed of 1000 rpm in both phases, 20 vol.% Acorga M5640 as the carrier, 1.70 mmol L-1 Ni2+ in the feed phase and 0.10 mol L-1 H2SO4 in the stripping phase. The flux value of Ni2+ was 15.82 x 10(-6) mol m(-2) s(-1). Additionally, the influences of temperature and ultrasound on flux were examined, and results indicated that higher temperature and ultrasonic assistance improved transport of Ni2+ through the SLM. Selective separation of nickel from cobalt in an ammonia/ammonium chloride solution was also achieved through SLM. The stability of the SLM was examined on a continuous run mode and satisfactory stability of the nickel permeation was observed for 84 h (7 runs).

To avoid the stringent constraints for parametric methods and low convergence rate for nonparametric methods, many functional dimension reduction methods have received attention in the functional data analysis literature, which, if desired, can be combined with low dimensional nonparametric regression in a later step. However, as far as we know that all of the functional dimension reduction methods are based on the classical estimates of the first and second moments of the data, and therefore sensitive to outliers. In the present paper, we propose a robust functional dimension reduction method by replacing the classical estimates with robust ones in the functional sliced inverse regression (FSIR). This leads to procedures which maintain the clever estimation scheme of the original FSIR method but can cope better with outliers. A comparison with FSIR is also made through simulation studies to show the robustness of the robust functional sliced inverse regression (RFSIR). As applications, the Orange juice data and the Tecator data are analyzed by using the proposed RFSIR method.

The amino acid sequence displayed 78% homology with Microbispora mesophila xylanase (WP_062413927.1). The recombinant xylanase (TrXyn10), with MW 46.1 kDa, could hydrolyse beechwood, birchwood and oatspelt xylan. Based on the sequence, enzymatic properties and tertiary structure of the protein, TrXyn10 belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10). The optimal pH and temperature for the recombinant enzyme were determined to be 7.0 and 55 A degrees C, respectively. TrXyn10 was stable over a wide pH range, and it retained more than 45% of the total activity at pH 6.0-12.0 for 12 h. In addition, the activity was greatly promoted, by approximately 200% of the initial activity, after incubation at pH 6.0 and 7.0 for 12 h. Based on enzymatic properties and product analysis, we showed that TrXyn10 is a neutral endoxylanase.

The high poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) block content introduced will endow the SAS with the ability of working as film-forming materials. The microphase separation and mechanism of wide applicable temperature range were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The static and dynamic mechanical properties, visible light transmittance, water resistance and thermal stability of SAS were also characterized by tensile test, DMA, spectrophotometer, water absorption and thermogravimetric analysis. The tensile strength decreases and elongation at break increases with the PBA block content of SAS increasing from 50 wt.% to 70 wt.%. The maximum elongation at break reaches 707%. The broad thermoplastic elastic region from -40 degrees C to 80 degrees C works well in the surrounding of a big temperature difference due to the PBA block in rubbery state and the PSt block in glassy state. The SAS has high transmittance, low water absorption and favorable thermal stability. This research will provide a reference for film-forming materials with wide applicable temperature range.

Packaged Microstrip Line: A New Quasi-TEM Line for Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Gap waveguide (GW); microstrip line; microwave; millimeter-wave; perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) packaging	DEFECTED GROUND STRUCTURE; ELECTROMAGNETIC BANDGAP; GUIDE TECHNOLOGY; MULTIPLE VIAS; FILTERS; LOSSES; DESIGN; TRANSITION; RADIATION; CIRCUITS	In this paper, a new quasi-transverse electromagnetic (TEM) microstrip line, named as packaged microstrip line, is proposed for microwave and millimeter-wave applications. It is comprised of three dielectric substrates: a base layer to place the metal strip, a top layer to build the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) shielding with periodic plated vias, and a middle layer to separate the PMC layer from the metal strip and the bottom ground plane. With the top PMC shielding, this novel microstrip line no longer suffers from issues of radiation losses, surface waves, or cavity resonances that exist in the classical microstrip line without or with a metallic shielding box. Also, the unwanted higher order mode created in the stripline by any vertical asymmetry between the ground planes will not be generated in the packaged microstrip line. In addition, the fundamental quasi-TEM mode will help this novel line avoid the mode conversion losses when integrated with other quasi-TEM lines, which happen to the substrate-integrated waveguide due to its fundamental TE10 mode. This paper focuses on the effects of the PMC-layer substrate on this line performance. We present how to adopt a proper substrate for each layer of the packaged microstrip line considering both stopband and transmission loss, and how to design the linewidth for a given characteristic impedance. Two different transition schemes of the packaged microstrip line to the standard microstrip line are taken into account. Two prototypes of the proposed packaged microstrip lines using different substrates for the PMC layer are fabricated. The measured and simulated results show good agreement.

KL in the 214-247 GHz frequency band. 41 transitions of HC3N in 7 vibrationally excited states, and 23 transitions of C-13 isotopologues of HC3N in 2 vibrational states are detected. The line images show that vibrationally excited HC3N lines originate mainly from the hot core of Orion and IRc7. The images of HC3N vibrationally excited lines show that the line emission peaks associated with the hot core move from south to northeast as E-u increases. Based on multiple transitions of each vibrationally excited state, we performed local thermodynamic equilibrium calculations in the XCLASS suite toward the hot core and IRc7 positions. Generally, transitions in highly excited states have higher rotational temperatures and lower column densities. The rotational temperatures and column densities of the hot core range from 93 to 321. K, and from 1.0 x 10(14) to 4.9 x 10(16) cm(-2), respectively. Lower rotational temperatures ranging from 88 to 186. K and column densities from 1.0 x 10(14) to 3.2 x 10(16) cm(-2) are obtained toward IRc7. The facts that the hot core emission peaks of vibrationally excited HC3N lines move from south to northeast with increasing Eu, and that higher-energy HC3N lines have higher rotational temperatures and lower column densities, appear to support that the hot core is externally heated. The emission peaks are moving along the major axis of the SiO outflow, which may indicate that higher-energy HC3N transitions are excited by interaction between pre-existing dense medium and shocks generated by SiO outflows.

In this paper, aquatic plant leaves-including reed, water hyacinth, and duckweed-were used as both templates and silicon precursors to successfully synthesize biomorphic TiO2/SiO2 composite with mesoporous structures. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were applied to characterize the microstructures of the samples. The results show that all TiO2/SiO2 composites are mainly composed of an anatase phase with mesoporous structure and possess high specific surface area. Compared with commercial Degussa P25 TiO2, all TiO2/SiO2 samples display intensive light-harvesting efficiency, particularly in the visible light range. The activities were evaluated by using gentian violet as a target for photocatalytic degradation experiments under simulated solar irradiation. The TiO2/SiO2 samples templated by reed and water hyacinth leaves exhibit high activity, while the TiO2/SiO2 samples obtained from duckweed are inferior to P25 in the degradation of gentian violet. A synergistic effect of SiO2 incorporation and structural construction through biotemplating is proposed to be beneficial to photocatalytic activity.

Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), a well-known MOF for its chemical and thermal stabilities, was used to induce a polymerization reaction of saturated alkylsilanes for the first time. The reaction temperature was found to be critical for morphology control of the polymerized ZIF-siloxane composites. The polymerization of alkylsilanes by ZIF-8 at room temperature resulted in siloxane microspheres while rose petal-like microstructures were obtained at higher temperature. The effects of the reaction time on the structures of the polymerization products were also investigated and the polymerization reaction process was proposed. This work expands the field of MOFs' applications and develops a reasonable method for the multidimensional assembly of MOFs building blocks into required structures or platforms for designing new kinds of hierarchical morphologies, which to our knowledge has not been previously investigated.

Condensins are multi-protein complexes that play pivotal roles in chromosome assembly and segregation during mitosis, meiosis and even tumorigenesis. Using tissue microarrays by immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin-eosin staining, we found that non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH) in colon cancerous tissues was higher than that in all corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues. We then characterized the exact function of the NCAPH in CC. We provided evidences showing that NCAPH is highly expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines comparing with normal human colonic epithelial cells, and identified many NCAPH mutations in CC patients. We found that depletion of NCAPH inhibits CC cell proliferation, migration in vitro and xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Furthermore, NCAPH knockdown promotes cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Interestingly, the NCAPH high expression in tumor tissues of colon patients had a significantly better prognosis and survival rate than low-expression patients, suggesting that NCAPH high expression promotes colonic cancerous cell proliferation; on the other hand, it may also sensitize these cells responding to chemo-or radio-therapies. Collectively, these findings reveal an important role of NCAPH in CC, indicating that NCAPH could be used as a new therapeutic target in future.

The X-ray diffraction results showed that the interlayer spacing distances are significantly enlarged after intercalated by phosphorylated cellulose. TEM images showed that LDHs are successfully synthesized and distributed along the cellulose chains. The modified LDH was used as a reinforcement for polyvinyl alcohol. The thermal stability of PVA composites is improved after the addition of PC-LDH. In addition, the flame retardancy of PVA composites were significantly improved with the combination of PC-LDH, peak heat release rate (PHRR) was reduced. Meanwhile, the total heat release (THR) was also decreased. Moreover, the tensile strength of the polyvinyl alcohol was simultaneously improved by the increase of the loading.

However, most of the existingmethods partially consider that all 3D joints of a human skeleton are identical. Actually, these 3D joints exhibit diverse responses to different action classes, and some joint configurations are more discriminative to distinguish a certain action. In this paper, we propose a discriminative multi-instance multitask learning (MIMTL) framework to discover the intrinsic relationship between joint configurations and action classes. First, a set of discriminative and informative joint configurations for the corresponding action class is captured in multi-instance learning model by regarding the action and the joint configurations as a bag and its instances, respectively. Then, a multitask learning modelwith group structure constraints is exploited to further reveal the intrinsic relationship between the joint configurations and different action classes. We conduct extensive evaluations of MIMTL using three benchmark 3D action recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed MIMTL framework performs favorably compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.

Although the cultivation of oyster mushrooms is a very important industry in China, the inconsistent nomenclature of the complex is controversial and has led to much confusion and economic loss in the mushroom industry. In this study, we performed molecular identification of the species complex based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), and two genes that encode subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2). A total of 284 samples with different commercial names gathered from different mushroom spawn preservation centers, companies, and field isolations were investigated via phylogenetic analyses inferred from a single locus or multi-loci. Our analyses indicated that 56% of the strains were labeled with improper scientific names and that all of the strains could be divided into seven lineages, representing one morphological species each, namely P. abieticola, P. eryngii, P. cf. floridanus, P. ostreatus, P. placentodes, P. pulmonarius, and P. tuoliensis. Reference sequences for accurate identification of the taxa were developed or suggested. Meanwhile, we evaluated the suitability of the four candidate segments as DNA barcodes. Our analyses indicated that RPB2 was the most promising candidate segment of DNA barcode for the P. ostreatus species complex, taking into consideration the polymorphisms and other aspects of the four markers.

The polarity functionalization, microphase separation, static and dynamic mechanical properties, water resistance, transparency, and thermal stability of the synthesized polarity-functionalized triblock copolymers, polystyrene-block-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene (SAS), were extensively studied. The poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) middle block higher than 10 wt % has the favorable toughening effect on polystyrene (PSt) two-end block due to the microphase separation in SAS. The glass transition of the continuous plastic phase (mainly composed of PSt block) has a much greater influence on the storage modulus than that of the dispersed rubber phase (mainly composed of PBA block). The polarity-functionalized SAS has good water resistance, high transparency, and robust thermal stability. The polarity-functionalized SAS will have such a potential application broadening as polar adhesive. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The designed structure consists of periodically arranged composite metallic arrays and dielectric layer that exhibits transmission responses composed of two flat pass-bands. The coupling of localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes results in the low-frequency pass-band, while the internal surface plasmon polaritons (ISPPs) between the upper and lower metal layers leads to the high-frequency pass-band. Structural parameters (L and R) are experimentally considered from the viewpoint of exploiting their effects on the pass-bands and resonance frequencies. The bandwidths of these pass-bands both can reach to maximums by optimization of these structural parameters. In addition, the two pass-bands can be modulated to be a single pass-band with a bandwidth of 10.7 THz by optimizing L and R simultaneously.

Based on a set of comprehensive indicators of water system, a decision making approach of multi-objects is developed and applied to quantify water adaptive management for the demands of water sustainable use, water environmental protection and eco-water requirement under the climate change. For this study in China, two key indicators are proposed, namely (1) the water resources vulnerability (V) that was represented by integrated sensitivity (S) and resilience (C) of climate change impact on water resources, and (2) the sustainability of socio-economy and water environment, marked by DD, that is integrated scaler of socio-economic development (EG) based on the amount of GDP and the water environment and relative eco-system quality (LI). To find a reasonable solution for adaptive water management, a multi-objective decision making model of adaptive water management is further developed and the multi-objective model was transformed into an integrated single optimization model through developing an integrated measure function, called as VDD=DD/V. This approach has been applied to adaptive water resources planning and management for case study of China with new policy, called as the strict management of water resources based on three red line controls, i.e., the control of total water use by the total water resources allocation, the control of lower water use efficiency by the water demand management and the control of the total waste water load by water quality management in the Eastern China Monsoon Region that covers major eight big river basins including Yangtze River, Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe River. It is shown that the synthetic representation of water resource vulnerability and socio-economic sustainability by the integrated objective function (VDD) and integrated decision making model are workable and practicable. Adaptive management effect of the criterion compliance rate and water use efficiency are more appreciable through new water policy of the three red line controls, which can reduce 21.3% of the water resources vulnerability (V) and increase 18.4% of the sustainability of socioeconomy and water environment (DD) for the unfavorable scenario of climate change in 2030.

Samples of the prepared NiCrB/ SiO2/ Si and NiCrB/ Cu/ NiCrB/ SiO2/ Si were annealed at temperatures ranging from 500 degrees C to 900 degrees C. The reaction mechanism of the electroless deposition of the NiCrB film, the failure temperature and the failure mechanism of the NiCrB diffusion barrier layer were investigated. The prepared samples were subjected to XRD, XPS, FPP and AFM to determine the phases, composition, sheet resistance and surface morphology of samples before and after annealing. The results of these analyses indicated that the failure temperature of the NiCrB barrier film was 900 degrees C and the failure mechanism led to crystallization and grain growth of the NiCrB barrier layer after high temperature annealing. It was found that this process caused Cu grains to reach Si substrate through the grain boundaries, and then the reaction between Cu and Si resulted in the formation of highly resistive Cu3Si.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.

Electric-and magnetic-field dependence of the electronic and optical properties of phosphorene quantum dots	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						phosphorene quantum dots; electronic and optical properties; electric and magnetic fields	BLACK PHOSPHORUS; OPTOELECTRONICS; NANORIBBONS; MOBILITY	Recently, black phosphorus quantum dots were fabricated experimentally. Motivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the electronic and optical properties of rectangular phosphorene quantum dots (RPQDs) in the presence of an in-plane electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field. The energy spectra and wave functions of RPQDs are obtained numerically using the tight-binding approach. We find edge states within the band gap of the RPQD which are well separated from the bulk states. In an undoped RPQD and for in-plane polarized light, due to the presence of well-defined edge states, we find three types of optical transitions which are between the bulk states, between the edge and bulk states, and between the edge states. The electric and magnetic fields influence the bulk-to-bulk, edge-to-bulk, and edge-to- edge transitions differently due to the different responses of bulk and edge states to these fields.	[Li, L.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the nuclear receptor DAF-12 acts as a dietary and environmental sensor to orchestrate diverse aspects of development, metabolism, and reproduction. Recently, we have reported that DAF-12 together with co-repressor DIN-1S is required for starvation tolerance by promoting fat mobilization. In this report, we found that genetic inactivation of the DAF-12 signaling promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during starvation. ROS mediated systemic necrosis, thereby inducing organismal death. The DAF-12/DIN-1S complex up-regulated the expression of antioxidant genes during starvation. The antioxidant enzyme GST-4 in turn suppressed ROS formation, thereby conferring worm survival. Our findings highlight the importance of antioxidant response in starvation tolerance and provide a novel insight into multiple organisms survive and adapt to periods of nutrient deprivation.

Moreover, the distribution of heavy precipitation in the Yangtze River basin, which covers a large area of South China, is sensitive to changes in monsoon intensity. Thus, the paleo-distribution of heavy precipitation in the Yangtze basin is key in reconstructing the paleo-monsoon intensity. In this study, we established proxies for distinguishing sediments from the northwestern and southeastern parts of the Yangtze River basin, with the goal of using them to reconstruct the paleo-distribution of heavy precipitation in the basin based on changes in the provenance of detrital sediments, as determined using sediment records at the river mouth. The proxies included the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal intensity and the crystallinity index (CI) of quartz in modern riverbed sediments along the mainstream and tributaries of the Yangtze River. The data revealed that the fine-silt fraction of the sediments (which represents suspended particulate matter, SPM) from each major tributary can be distinguished on the basis of ESR signal intensity and CI values. The values for each tributary reflect the age and type of bedrock in the tributary basin and show distinct regional variations according to the distribution of geological blocks within the Yangtze basin. In addition, the analyzed ESR signal intensity and CI values of the fine-silt fraction of riverbed sediments below mainstream-tributary junctions agree well with values calculated according to a simple mixing model of SPM discharged from the tributaries and the mainstream.

The key element in making a high performance tandem device is the connecting materials stack, which plays an important role in electric field distribution, charge generation and charge injection. For a tandem organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with a simple Liq/Al/MoO3 stack, we discovered that there is a significant current lateral spreading causing light emission over an extremely large area outside the OLED pixel when the Al thickness exceeds 2 nm. This spread light emission, caused by an inductive electric field over one of the device unit, limits one's ability to fabricate high performance tandem devices. To resolve this issue, a new connecting materials stack with a C-60 fullerene buffer layer is reported. This new structure permits optimization of the Al metal layer in the connecting stack and thus enables us to fabricate an efficient tandem OLED having a high 155.6 cd/A current efficiency and a low roll-off (or droop) in current efficiency.

By facilely tuning the dopant acid, pH, and apparent weight proportion for aniline (ANI) and halloysite (HA) nanotubes in the synthesis process, PANI with tuned oxidation state, doping extent, and content are in situ growing on halloysite nanotubes. The reaction system's acidity is tuned by dopant acid, such as HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, and H3PO4. The adsorption result shows the fabricated HA@PANI hybrid nanotubes can effectively adsorb Cr(VI) oxyanion and the adsorption ability changes according to the dopant acid, pH, and apparent weight proportion for ANI and HA in the synthesis process. Among them, the HA@PANI fabricated with HCl as dopant acid tuning the pH at 0.5 and 204% apparent weight proportion for ANI and HA (HP/0.5/204%-HCl) shows the highest adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity is in accordance well with the doping extent of PANI in HA@PANI. Furthermore, when HP/0.5/204%-HCl is redoped with HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4, the adsorption capacity declines, implying the dopant acid in the process of redoping exhibits a marked effect on Cr(VI) oxyanion adsorption for the HA@PANI hybrid nanotubes. HP/0.5/204%-HCl and HP/0.5/204%-H3PO4 have demonstrated good regenerability with an above 80% removal ratio after four cycles. Moreover, the HA@PANI adsorbent has better sedimentation ability than that of pure PANI. The adsorption behavior is in good agreement with Langmuir and pseudo second-order equations, indicating the adsorption of HA@ PANI for Cr(VI) oxyanion is chemical adsorption. FT-IR and XPS of HA@PANI after Cr(VI) oxyanion adsorption indicate that the doped amine/imine groups (-NH+/=N+- groups) are the main adsorption sites for the removal of Cr(VI) oxyanion by electrostatic adsorption and reduction of the adsorbed Cr (VI) oxyanion to Cr(III) simultaneously.

Among these various models, the Heston model, as one-factor stochastic volatility mode, is the most popular and easiest to implement. Unfortunately, recent findings indicate that existing Heston modelis not able to characterize all aspects of asset returns, such as persistence, mean reverting, and clustering. Therefore, a modified Heston model is proposed in this paper. Compared with the original Heston model, the mean-reverting Cox Ingersoll and Ross process is modified to include a cosine term with the intention of capturing the periodicity of volatility. The phenomenon that high-volatile period is interchanged with low-volatile periods can thus be better described by adding such a period term to the volatility process. In addition, the geometric Brownian motion is replaced by a random walk in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity proposed by Bonanno et al. By doing so, a financial market with two different dynamical regimes (normal activity and extreme days) can be modeled. Closed-form solution for the modified Heston model is not derived in this paper. Instead, Monte-Carlo simulation is used to generate the probability density function of log-return which is then compared with the historical probability density function of stock return. Parameters are adjusted and estimated so that the square errors can be minimized. Daily returns of all the component stocks of Dow-Jones industrial index for the period from 3 September 2007 to 31 December 2008 are used to test the proposed model, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model works very well. The mean escape time and mean periodic escape rate of the proposed modified Heston model with periodic stochastic volatility are studied in this paper with two different dynamical regimes like financial markets in normal activity and extreme days. Also the theoretical results of mean escape time and mean periodic escape rate can be calculated by numerical simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) larger value of rate of return, smaller long run average of variance and smaller magnitude of periodic volatility will reduce the mean periodic escape rate, and thus stabilize the market; 2) by analyzing the mean escape time, an optimal value can be identified for the magnitude of periodic volatility which will maximize the mean escape time and again stabilize the market. In addition, an optimal rate of relaxation to long-time variance, smaller frequency of the periodic volatility, larger rate of return, and stronger correlation between noises will furtherreduce the mean escape time and enhance the market stability.

The XPS data suggest migration of iodide species from the MAPbI(3) into the MoO3 upon direct contact of these two layers. Chemically, these iodide inclusions cause a significant presence in reduced Mox+ species. Electronically, UPS data show that this reaction induces gap states and reduces the MoO3 workfunction. It is shown that a thin organic interlayer blocks migration of volatile iodide from MAPbI(3) into the MoO3. This organic buffer layer results in significantly better chemical stability, reduced gap state density, and higher MoO3 workfunction. These results highlight the importance of organic buffer layers in separating these two materials during device fabrication. Published by AIP Publishing.

INFORMATION; EARTHQUAKE; LINKING; SCHEME; LIGHT	fusion algorithm based on target extraction for infrared image (IIR) and visible image fusion in the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain is proposed. Commonly, the target information in IIR is important; in order to fully retain the target information in a final fused image, first, use maximum between-class variance method to segment IIR, such that the target regions with salient objects are extracted to produce the background and target images. Next, the visible and background images are decomposed to a series of low-pass and band-pass images by NSCT, respectively. Then, fuse the obtained images to produce the fused background image by different strategies in each band, in which Gaussian fuzzy logic is used to produce the low-pass coefficient; the spatial frequency of each band-pass image is used to determine the linking strength beta value of pulse coupled neural network structure, and the result is used to fuse the band-pass images. Eventually, the fused image is produced combining the target image and the fused background image. The experiments show that this algorithm can retain more background details of the two images and highlight the target in the infrared image more effectively, as well as obviously improve the visual effect of the fusion image. c 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)	[He, Kangjian; Zhou, Dongming; Zhang, Xuejie; Nie, Rencan; Wang, Quan; Jin, Xin] Yunnan Univ, Informat Coll, Kunming, Peoples R China	Zhou, DM (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Informat Coll, Kunming, Peoples R China.	zhoudm@ynu.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61365001, 61463052]	The authors would like to thank all the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive remarks that are very helpful to improve the quality of this paper.

Among these, the Chow Chow is an ancient breed that embodies very distinct morphological and physiological features, such as sturdy build, dense coat, and blue/ purple tongue. Results: Using a Restricted site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approach, we sequenced the genomes of nine Chow Chows from China. Combined with a dataset of 37 canid whole genome sequencing (WGS) from several published works, we found that the Chow Chow is one of the most basal lineages, which originated together with other East Asian breeds, such as the Shar- Pei and Akita. Demographic analysis found that Chow Chows originated from the Chinese indigenous dog about 8300 years ago. The bottleneck leading to Chow Chows was not strong and genetic migration between Chow Chows and other populations is low. Two classes of genes show strong evidence of positive selection along the Chow Chow lineage, namely genes related to metabolism and digestion as well as muscle/heart development and differentiation. Conclusions: Dog breeds from East Asia, including the Chow Chow, originated from Chinese indigenous dogs very early in time. The genetic bottleneck leading to Chow Chows and migrations with other populations are found to be quite mild. Our current study represents an early endeavor to characterize the origin of East Asian dog breeds and establishes an important reference point for understanding the origin of ancient breeds in Asia.

We investigated the necessary factors required to enable a transition towards a more sustainable model for rubber cultivation in Southwest China (i.e. the 'greening' of rubber cultivation), using a framework for the integrative study of multiple aspects in complex land use issues. We present findings from stakeholder interviews and a stakeholder workshop, and discuss their relevance Within and beyond Southwest China, The current focus of researchers and development practitioners tends to be on finding technical solutions to address unsustainable rubber cultivation practices. However, stakeholder consultations revealed that the key barriers were more social: low levers of trust and knowledge exchange between stakeholder groups and fragmented visions about the future of the landscape. It is very important to continue the economic prosperity initially brnught by rubber, but, without improved communication between government and researchers and smallholder farmers, this will be very difficult to achieve. A wider landscape perspective is needed to address issues in rubber cultivation to avoid repeating the same problems of cash crop boom and bust experienced with other crops, most notably bananas. We Conclude that more effort should be put into developing mechanisms that integrate technical knowledge, enhance social relationships, and present a forum for reconciling or at least acknowledging the differing needs, knowledge, and objectives of different groups, and transcending the power dynamics between smallholder farmers and government and researchers.

For this purpose, the binding behaviors of the complex formations of alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins with lycorine were observed by the use of UV, MS, XRD, DSC, TG, H-1, and 2D NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The results displayed that the binding behavior was contrary to the size of the CDs, and the value of binding constant of lycorine/gamma-CD was the smallest, while the value of binding constant of lycorine/alpha-CD was the greatest. In vitro study demonstrated that the lycorine-alpha-CD and lycorine-beta-CD are valuable approaches to enhance lycorine bioavailability. The results deduced that using CDs with moderate cavities (such as alpha-CD or beta-CD) as a cyclodextrin-based delivery system to form the lycorine-type inclusion complex could be more applicable, and further helps to improve the properties of lycorine-type therapeutic agent.

A theoretical model is given to analyze the DWL employed for MZM. In a single-tone test, the suppressions of the second order harmonic distortion (HD2) and third order harmonic distortion (HD3) at the same time are experimentally verified at different bias voltages of the MZM. The measured spurious-free dynamic ranges (SFDRs) with respect to the HD2 and HD3 are improved simultaneously compared to using a single laser. The output P-1 (dB) is also improved by the DWL technique. Moreover, a WiFi signal is transmitted in the RoF system to test the linearization for broadband signal. The result shows that more than 1 dB improvement of the error vector magnitude (EVM) is obtained by the DWL technique.

However, compared to C. albicans, relatively little is known about the patterns of genetic variation in C. tropicalis. This study analyzed the genetic diversity and relationships among isolates of C. tropicalis from the southern Chinese island of Hainan. A total of 116 isolates were obtained from seven geographic regions located across the Island. For each isolate, a total of 2677 bp from six gene loci were sequenced and 79 (2.96%) polymorphic nucleotide sites were found in our sample. Comparisons with strains reported from other parts of the world identified significant novel diversities in Hainan, including an average of six novel sequences (with a range 1 to 14) per locus and 80 novel diploid sequence types. Most of the genetic variation was found within individual strains and there was abundant evidence for gene flow among the seven geographic locations within Hainan. Interestingly, our analyses identified no significant correlation between the diploid sequence types at the six loci and fluconazole susceptibility, consistent with multiple origins of fluconazole resistance in the Hainan population of C. tropicalis.

It has also been verified that the aspiration-based win-stay-lose-learn strategy updating rule promotes the evolution of cooperation. Inspired by this well-known fact, we combine the Win-Stay-Lose-Learn updating rule with voluntary participation: Players maintain their strategies when they are satisfied, or players attempt to imitate the strategy of one randomly chosen neighbor. We find that this mechanism maintains persistent cooperative behavior, even further promotes the evolution of cooperation under certain conditions.

However, the existing preparation technologies usually involve a solvent process, which introduces defects and functional groups into the 3D network. Here, we find the defects and functional groups influence the electrochemical stability of graphene. After an electrochemical process, the current decreases by more than 1 order of magnitude, indicating remarkable etching of graphene. To improve the electrochemical stability, we develop a solvent-free preparation process to produce 3D graphene for the first time. After growth on a 3D microporous copper by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the copper template is removed by a high temperature evaporation process, resulting in 3D graphene network without any solvent process involved. The samples exhibit remarkably improved stability with durable time 2 times, compared with normal CVD samples, and 55 times, compared with reduced graphite oxide, and no obvious etching is observed at 1.6 V versus saturated calomel electrode, showing great potential for application in future 3D graphene-based high stable electrochemical devices.

Although the consistency of the nonparametric MLE is regarded as a standard conclusion, many researchers ignore the precise conditions required on the mixture model. An incorrect claim of consistency can lead to false conclusions even if the mixture model under investigation seems well behaved. Under a finite normal mixture model, for instance, the consistency of the plain MLE is often erroneously assumed in spite of recent research breakthroughs. This paper streamlines the consistency results for the nonparametric MLE in general, and in particular for the penalized MLE under finite normal mixture models.

However, current approaches for calculating T values lack a strong scientific basis, and few practicable methods are available. Many questions remain regarding which parameters, such as planning periods and offset damages, should be included in calculating T values. Here, we developed a new method to calculate soil loss tolerance as a function of the soil productivity index (SPI) for farmland. To achieve sustainable soil productivity in farmland, erosion rates leading to SPI values lower than the lower boundary of soil productivity (SPI0) are not tolerable and must be controlled by soil conservation measures. We applied this method in the Red River Basin of China based on the investigation of typical soil profiles and crop yields. Our results show that the T values in the Red River Basin ranged from 0.91 to 10.24 t ha(-1) a(-1). The SPI0 and the lowest limit of soil loss tolerance (T1) were 0.4 and 0.91 t ha(-1) a(-1), respectively. Here, we demonstrate that, when determining T values in farmland, (1) the soil formation rate and offset damage should not be core items, (2) the "planning period" concept should be replaced by "sustainability", (3) the management objective of T should be the sustainability of the soil resource, and (4) the T values of farmland should be determined according to soil productivity. We provide a reasonable and feasible method to determine T for farmland, which will help maintain the sustainability of soil productivity.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			The Influence of Urban Surface Expansion in China on Regional Climate	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							MODELING SYSTEM RIEMS; LAND-COVER CHANGE; AIR-TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION SIMULATIONS; NUMERICAL-MODEL; HYDROLOGY MODEL; URBANIZATION; IMPACT; SUMMER; CIRCULATION	Incorporating satellite-based urban surface data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s in China, contributions to regional warming, and changes in the precipitation due to urban surface expansion were explored using the nested Fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model version 3.7 (MM5V3.7) with urban effects considered. The impact on surface air temperature at 2 m (SAT) due to urban surface expansion between the 1980s and the 2010s revealed that annual urban-related warming was lower over East Asia (0.031 degrees C) and China (0.075 degrees C) but higher in eastern China (0.14 degrees C), which experienced dramatic urbanization. Greater warming could be detected over urban surface areas in the three city clusters [Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas (YRD and PRD, respectively)], which reached 1.068, 0.848, and 0.92 degrees C, respectively. Urban-related warming was not limited to a single city or city clusters but extended over a SAT-increased belt that covered the eastern coast of China. Further analysis showed that urban-surface-expansion-induced changes in albedo and the total cloud amount contributed to the changes in the radiation budget, which resulted in strong surface radiative forcings in the urban surface (14.5, 11.2, and 11.7 Wm(-2) for BTH, YRD, and PRD, respectively). However, significant differences could be detected for the transition from nonurban to urban land use compared to those that were classified as urban in both time periods because of the varied albedo changes. The urbanization-related warming, especially in the city cluster areas, also had a further effect on the large-scale circulation and precipitation. The precipitation was weakened in northeastern and northern China but intensified in eastern and southern China, which resulted in the strengthened precipitation over China (0.016 mm day(-1), 0.65%) and East Asia (0.011 mm day(-1), 0.28%). Therefore, subregional characteristics with marked seasonal, interannual, and decadal variations were detected for the influence of the urban surface expansion.

The UV-Vis light-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis showed that the absorption region of co-doped TiO2 was shifted to the visible-light region, which was attributed to incorporation of samarium and carbon into the TiO2 lattice during high-temperature reaction. Samarium effectively decreased the anatase-rutile phase transformation. The grain size can be controlled by Sm doping to achieve a large specific surface area useful for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB). The degradation rate of MB over the Sm-C co-doped TiO2 sample was the best. Additionally, first-order apparent rate constants increased by about 4.3 times compared to that of commercial Degusssa P25 under the same experimental conditions. Using different types of scavengers, the results indicated that the electrons, holes, and center dot OH radicals are the main active species for the MB degradation. The high visible-light photocatalytic activity was attributed to low recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes which originated from the synergistic effect of the co-doped ions and the heterostructure.

J	Zha, JL; Wu, J; Zhao, DM				Zha, Jinlin; Wu, Jian; Zhao, Deming			Effects of land use and cover change on the near-surface wind speed over China in the last 30 years	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land use and cover change; near-surface wind speed; observation; the ERA-Interim dataset; China	CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIONAL CLIMATE; ERA-INTERIM; BILINEAR INTERPOLATION; RIVER DELTA; NCEP-CFSR; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; URBANIZATION	The changes of near-surface wind speed (SWS) were induced by the combination effects from anthropogenic activities and natural climate changes, thus the research of the long-term changes and cause of SWS is very important to recognize the effects from natural changes and anthropogenic activities to SWS. Some studies have shown that land use and cover change (LUCC) over China was very distinct in the last 30 years. However, the possible effects of LUCC to the slowdown in SWS are still uncertain. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis from January 1989 onward (to be extended back to January 1979) (ERA-Interim hereafter) dataset includes little information about LUCC, so the effects of LUCC on SWS in China during 1979-2010 have been estimated by using the difference between SWS per the ERA-Interim dataset and that from 492 meteorological stations. The results show the following. (1) The effects of LUCC on the SWS are distinct, and could have caused a decrease in the SWS of 0.12 m s(-1) per decade, which could account for decreases of 0.57 and 0.30 m s(-1) wind speed for large and small cities, respectively. In addition, a decrease of 0.1 m s(-1) in the SWS could be induced by a 10% rise in the urbanization rate. (2) The impacts of LUCC on the SWS in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region, the Yangtze River Delta region and the Pearl River Delta region are more significant than those for the entire region. (3) The bias in the ERA-Interim dataset could cause a 51% error in the estimation for the entire region during the study period, but had a non-significant effect on the decreasing trend in the SWS. The decrease rate of SWS induced by LUCC based on the traditional observation minus reanalysis method had an error of 0.01 m s(-1) decade(-1). (4) The results of different methods to quantify the impacts of LUCC on the SWS are also compared in this study.

The aim of this study is to assess the long-term trends of stroke mortality in China between 1994 and 2013. Methods The mortality data were obtained from the GBD 2013 (Global Burden of Disease Study 2013) and were analyzed with the age-period-cohort framework. Results We found that the net drift was -2.665% (95% confidence interval, -2.854% to -2.474%) per year for men and -4.064% (95% confidence interval, -4.279% to -3.849%) per year for women, and the local drift values were below 0 in all age groups (P<0.05 for all) in both sexes during the period of 1994 to 2013. In the same birth cohort, the risk of death from stroke rose exponentially with age for both sexes after controlling for period deviations. The estimated period and cohort relative risks were found in similar monotonic downward patterns (significantly with P<0.05 for all) for both sexes, with more quickly decreasing for women than for men during the whole period (significantly with P<0.05 for both). Conclusions The decreased mortality rates of stroke in China are likely to be related to improvements in medical care and techniques, spectacular economic growth and fast urbanization, and better early life nutrition conditions of Chinese people. Besides, better education and better awareness of stroke-related knowledge in successive generations could also probably play a role.

Strain YIM DR4008T could grow at temperatures ranging from 10 to 50 degrees C (optimum 28-30 degrees C), at pH 5.0-11.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and in the presence of up to 4% (w/v) NaCl. Sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed that strain YIM DR4008(T) shared highest similarity (95.0 %) with Streptomyces griseoplanus NBRC 12779(T) and <95% similarity with other known members of the genera Streptomyces, Kitasatospora and Streptacidiphilus. The diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid of strain YIM DR4008(T) was found to be LL-diaminopimelic acid. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained a major amount of galactose and mannose along with a small proportion of fucose, glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and three unidentified phospholipids. The respiratory menaquinones were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8), while the major cellular fatty acids (> 10 %) were anteiso-C-15:0, C-16: 0, iso-C-16: 0, iso-C-15: 0 and anteiso-C-17: 0. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 75.3 mol%. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics, strain YIM DR4008(T) is proposed to be recognized as a novel species of a new genus in the family Streptomycetaceae, with the name Allostreptomyces psammosilenae gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of the type species is YIM DR4008(T) (=DSM 42178(T) = CGMCC 4.7247(T)). An emended description of the family Streptomycetaceae is also provided.

However, for many complex diseases and traits, the underlying genetic model for a genetic locus is usually uncertain. So a robust test free of genetic model is appropriate. In this paper, the authors propose a model-embedded trend test by incorporating Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium information and obtain the explicit formula to calculate its statistical significance. Extensive simulation studies show the proposed test is more robust than the existing procedures. Finally, a real application is further analyzed to show the performance of the proposed test.

In the traditional SEM, it is often assumed that random errors and explanatory latent variables follow the normal distribution, and the effect of explanatory latent variables on outcomes can be formulated by a mean regression-type structural equation. But this SEM may be inappropriate in some cases where random errors or latent variables are highly nonnormal. The authors develop a new SEM, called as quantile SEM (QSEM), by allowing for a quantile regression-type structural equation and without distribution assumption of random errors and latent variables. A Bayesian empirical likelihood (BEL) method is developed to simultaneously estimate parameters and latent variables based on the estimating equation method. A hybrid algorithm combining the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented to sample observations required for statistical inference. Latent variables are imputed by the estimated density function and the linear interpolation method. A simulation study and an example are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed methodologies.

The structures of the intermediates and transition states, as well as the potential energy barriers of the involved reactions, were obtained. The hypothesis of quinine methide (QM) formation was theoretically confirmed. Two mechanisms were identified forQMformation, namely E1cb (elimination unimolecular conjugate base) and water-aided intra-molecular water elimination. The latter is energetically more favorable and is proposed for the first time in this work. Based on the QM mechanism, the condensation should be a unimolecular reaction because the following condensation between an ionized species (dissociated phenol or hydroxymethylphenol) with QM is much faster. The previously proposed S(N)2 condensation mechanism was found to be not competitive over the QM mechanism due to a much higher energy barrier. The condensation reaction between neutral phenol or hydroxymethylphenol and QM was also found to be possible. The energy barrier of this reaction is close to or higher than that of QM formation. Therefore, the overall condensation reaction may appear to be bimolecular if such a reaction is incorporated. The theoretical calculations in this work rationalized the discrepant results reported in previous kinetics studies well.

Increased knowledge about the variation of soil moisture in farmed catchments has important implications for the adoption of appropriate tillage measures for agriculture. The purpose of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture as controlled by the environment on a farmed catchment in a typical dry-hot valley (DHV) by integrating geostatistical and redundancy analysis (RDA). We monitored soil moisture in topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) layers at 51 points on eight occasions from July 2012 to March 2014, and determined the environmental factors of soil particle-size distribution, soil organic matter, slope aspect, slope gradient, elevation, and a topographic wetness index (WI) modified for semiarid conditions at each point. The results showed that, under the influence of high evaporation, soil moisture in the topsoil was significantly lower than that of subsoil in the DHV. In this study, we observed a strong temporal variation of soil moisture, which was influenced by the seasonal variation of crop cover and lagged behind that of rainfall. Relatively high soil moisture levels were found on the watershed divide and hillside sites of the catchment, and lower on the valleyside sites. Different from other studies, RDA analysis indicated that the WI was not correlated with soil moisture in the DHV; instead, clay and sand levels were the dominant control factor of soil moisture in the farmed DHV. We proposed that soil erosion in the DHV could lead to such increases of sand and decreases of clay content, thus influencing soil moisture content. Soil and water conservation measures will be especially important for valleyside sites with steep slopes.

However, most existing approaches overlook the intrinsic interdependencies between skeleton joints and action classes, thus suffering from unsatisfactory recognition performance. In this paper, a novel latent max-margin multitask learning model is proposed for 3-D action recognition. Specifically, we exploit skelets as the mid-level granularity of joints to describe actions. We then apply the learning model to capture the correlations between the latent skelets and action classes each of which accounts for a task. By leveraging structured sparsity inducing regularization, the common information belonging to the same class can be discovered from the latent skelets, while the private information across different classes can also be preserved. The proposed model is evaluated on three challenging action data sets captured by depth cameras. Experimental results show that our model consistently achieves superior performance over recent state-of-the-art approaches.

In the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR), Southwestern China and Southeast Asian, the transboundary runoff variations are much more sensitive and complex under the interaction of climate change, "corridor-barrier" functions in LRGR, and dams building. In this paper, based on the long hydrological records (1956-2013) from three mainstream hydrological stations in Nu River, Lancang River, and Red River, the region runoff variations were analyzed. The results show out: i) the regional runoff changes were strongly influenced by the "Corridor-Barrier" functions in LRGR from west to east, the variability extent of annual runoff increased, but tended to decrease after 2009 and the reduced extents also increased; ii) the annual runoff change in the three rivers had high concentration degrees; iii) there were periodicities of 33 years of runoff change in Nu River and Lancang River, and 30 years in Red River, and the lower flow period would continue for 8-9 years in Nu River and Lancang River but only for 4 years in Red River; iv) since 2010, as the two mega dams of Xiaowan and Nuozhadu built in Lancang River mainstream, their variations of annual runoff were quite different. The research results could offer a scientific base for sustainable utilization, conservation, and management of the regional water resources.

Cibotium barometz is an endangered tree fern, used both as ornamental plant and traditional Chinese medicinal plant. In this study, an effective in vitro propagation protocol was obtained through formation of green globular bodies (GGBs) from in vitro juvenile sporophytes. The effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on GGB induction and multiplication, as well as mineral salt concentration and active charcoal (AC) on plantlet regeneration from GGBs was evaluated. Thidiazuron (TDZ; 1-phenyl-3-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl) urea) had a significant effect on GGB induction and multiplication (P < 0.001), while a-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) did not (P > 0.05). GGB induction rate was above 80 % on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with TDZ (1.0 mg L- 1) and NAA (0.1, 0.3 or 0.5 mg L- 1). The same media were also optimal for GGB multiplication. GGBs cultured on 1/4 MS media supplemented with 0.1 or 0.2 % (w/v) AC showed a high rate of GGB development into plantlets above 90 %. 1/2 MS media supplemented with 0.1 or 0.2 % AC were the most effective for plantlet growth. Regenerated plantlets were successfully acclimatized (80 %) in greenhouse conditions. Morphological and histological analysis revealed that C. barometz GGBs was a yellow-green globular structure composed of the single GGB with meristems and hair-like structures, and new single GGBs were initiated from the epidermal cells of meristem zone.

Here we describe Sarcocystis menglaensis n. sp., infecting two of 14 (14.3%) Williamson's mouse deer from south-western China. By light microscopy, sarcocysts of S. menglaensis are microscopic, up to 2,170 mu m in length, and have a striated sarcocyst wall with 1.5-3.6 mu m long palisade-like protrusions. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that sarcocyst wall is of "type 10f", and has numerous villar protrusions folded over the cyst wall. The villar protrusions contained microtubules dispersed throughout the protrusions. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA and mitochondrial cox1 gene sequences indicated that S. menglaensis shared a close affinity with species of Sarcocystis Lankester, 1982 from ruminants, which utilise felids as definitive hosts.

In this study, AlHOG1, a yeast HOG1 homolog, was isolated from tobacco pathogenic fungus Alternaria longipes and its disrupted mutants were generated using homologous recombination. Compared with the wild-type strain, the mutants grew slower under Minimal-Media, produced less conidia on Potato-Dextrose-Agar and showed a retardation phenotype in conidial germination rate. Colony color observation indicated that AlHOG1 most likely negatively regulated melanin production under nutrients-deficient or osmotic stress. The same action mode of AlHOG1 on hyphal growth in response to certain carbon or nitrogen sources was speculated. Additionally, the disrupted strains were sensitive to osmotic and oxidative stress, and showed increased resistance to dicarboximide, phenylpyrrole and carbendazim fungicides. Meanwhile, results from the comparative analysis between the AlHOG1- and the AlHK1 ( encoding a group III histidine kinase)-disrupted mutants showed that AlHOG1 mediated-pathway was partly regulated by the upstream AlHK1 kinase for cellular resistance to salts osmotic stress and that AlHK1 was a primary regulator for cellular sugar and fungicides stress adaptation and likely modulated both AlHOG1mediated pathway and other unknown mechanisms. Noteworthily, AlHOG1 but not AlHK1 was confirmed to be associated with high concentration glycerol adaptation, which is the first report to our knowledge. Overall, our results indicated that AlHOG1 was involved in multiple physiological processes in A. longipes, including mycelial and conidial development, melanin production, nutrients sensing and multistress responses.

The current patterns, processes and consequences of invasion have been intensively studied globally, but studies reporting the long-term dynamics of invasions over large areas are rare. Here, we measured how the temporal changes in fish assemblage composition in a Chinese highland isolated-lake landscape drive taxonomic dissimilarity and its turnover component over three successive time periods spanning the last 75 years. Location Yun-Gui Plateau, 15 isolated lakes. Methods The Sorensen and Simpson indices were used to quantify changes in taxonomic dissimilarity and its turnover component over 1940-2015. Results We report a decline of taxonomic dissimilarity between lakes through time, mainly due to a decrease in species turnover. Such a homogenization process was due to the combined effects of the invasion of the same non-native species in most lakes and of extirpation of narrow endemic species. The strong decline in species dissimilarity and turnover was triggered by a high historical level of dissimilarity among assemblages. At a regional scale, the combined effect of introductions and extirpations modified the distance decay of taxonomic similarity between lakes. Surprisingly, this beta-diversity gradient is currently no longer supported by biogeographic and evolutionary processes, but by the human-mediated introduction of distinct exotic species in some lakes. Moreover, an extinction debt process was evident as extirpations sometimes occurred many years after the introduction of non-native species. Main conclusions Our study highlights that high historical differentiation of fishes in isolated lakes has turned to homogenization with dramatic loss of endemic species due to intensive introductions. This provides a striking example of human domination over an extended lake landscape and its associated irreparable biodiversity damages on isolated systems historically dominated by narrow endemic species.

The targeted compound was efficiently obtained by filtration without further post-treatment. In the one-pot two step reaction, C-C and C=N bonds were constructed, while at the same time one C-O bond was cleaved. This protocol represents a valuable route to obtain highly functional bicyclic pyridinium derivatives in a concise, rapid, and practical manner. The reaction is particularly attractive due to features such as low cost, mild conditions, atom economy, high yield, using biocompatible solvent, and potential biological activity of the product.

These fungi produce diverse trapping devices (traps) to capture, kill, and digest nematodes as food sources. Most NTF can live as both saprophytes and parasites. Traps are not only the weapons that NTF use to capture and infect nematodes, but also an important indicator of their switch from a saprophytic to a predacious lifestyle. Formation of traps and their numbers are closely related to the nematicidal activity of NTF, so the mechanisms governing trap formation have become a focus of research on NTF. Recently, much progress has been made in our understanding of trap formation, evolution, and the genome, proteome and transcriptome of NTF. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in research on traps of NTF. Various inducers of trap formation, trap development, structural properties and evolution of traps are summarized and discussed. We specifically discuss the latest studies of NTF based on genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses.

The detailed electronic properties of two primary representatives of 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB) and 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) were studied. It is discovered that, as compared with DCB, the large aromatic pi conjugation in DCA leads to better electron conductivity and more stable reduced states of DCA(-) and DCA(2-). The Li-ion batteries with DCA electrode are shown to have highly reversible operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gene loss is a pervasive source of genetic reduction, and (exogenous and endogenous) gene gain is the main driver of genetic expansion. To understand the genetic innovation and speciation of the family Corynebacteriaceae, which cause a wide range of serious infections in humans and animals, we analyzed the pangenome of this family, and reconstructed its phylogeny using a phylogenomics approach. Genetic variations have occurred throughout the whole evolutionary history of the Corynebacteriaceae. Gene loss has been the primary force causing genetic changes, not only in terms of the number of protein families affected, but also because of its continuity on the time series. The variation in metabolism caused by these genetic changes mainly occurred for membrane transporters, two component systems, and metabolism related to amino acids and carbohydrates. Interestingly, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) not only caused changes related to pathogenicity, but also triggered the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance. The Darwinian theory of evolution did not adequately explain the effects of dispersive HGT and/or gene loss in the evolution of the Corynebacteriaceae. These findings provide new insight into the evolution and speciation of Corynebacteriaceae and advance our understanding of the genetic innovation in Microbial populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, when images are polluted by noise in the transmission process, the recognition rate will decline significantly. Furthermore, after adopting feature representation schemes, the dimensionality of concatenated features that are extracted from the RGB image and depth image pair is very high. Therefore, a new dimensional reduction algorithm called Cauchy estimator discriminant learning (CEDL) is presented in this paper. CEDL simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) to decrease negative influences to some extent when there is noise in the input samples; (2) to preserve the local and global geometry structure of the input samples. Experiments with the frequently used NYU Depth V1 dataset suggest the effectiveness of CEDL compared with other state-of-the-art scene classification methods.

The morphology and microstructure of samples are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical properties of the MWCNTs, the pure CeO2, and the CeO2/MWCNTs nanocomposites electrodes are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GDC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The CeO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite (at the mole ratio of 1:1) electrode exhibits much larger specific capacitance compared with both the MWCNTs electrode and the pure CeO2 electrode and significantly improves cycling stability compared to the pure CeO2 electrode. The CeO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite (at the mole ratio of 1:1) achieves a specific capacitance of 455.6 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 Ag-1. Therefore, the as prepared CeO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for high-performance super capacitors.

The as-synthesized SnO2 microspheres are composed of large amount of small spheres with average diameters of about 250 nm, and every small sphere consists of numerous primary nanocrystallites with average sizes of about 8 nm. The resultant product was used as sensing material for gas sensor to detect the formaldehyde (HCHO) gas. The gas response, response and recovery time, selectivity and stability were carefully studied. It was found that the response value of the sensor to 100 ppm HCHO was 38.3 at the operating temperature of 200 degrees C. The gas sensor based on SnO2 micro spheres has excellent gas response, good response-recovery properties, linear dependence, repeatability and selectivity, making it to be a promising candidate for practical detectors for HCHO.

The structure, morphology, surface chemical states and specific surface area were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, respectively. The as-synthesized products are anatase-TiO2 with small grain size (about 12.27 nm) and high surface area (147.17 m(2) g(-1)). The as-synthesized porous TiO2 powder was used to fabricate indirect-heating gas sensor whose gas-sensing characteristics toward acetone were investigated. At its optimal operation temperature, the sensor possesses a good sensitivity, selectivity, linear dependence, low detection limitation, and response/recovery, repeatability as well as long-term stability. Especially for the high sensitivity and fast response/recovery, its response reaches 25.97 for 500 ppm acetone, which is several times higher that of the reported TiO2-based sensors. The response and recovery times are only 13 and 8 s, respectively. Those values demonstrate the potential of using as-synthesized TiO2 for acetone gas detection, particularly in the dynamic monitoring. Apart from these, the mechanism related to the advanced properties was also investigated and presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This model used two polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes both loaded with 20 vol.% Acorga M5640 in kerosene. The effects of H2SO4 concentrations in two stripping phases on the transport of copper, nickel, and cobalt were evaluated. Experimental results indicated that copper and nickel were transported through the first membrane into the central compartment which contained 5.0 g/L H2SO4, while cobalt remained in the first feed compartment. Then copper continued to penetrate through the second membrane into the third compartment which contained 50.0 g/L H2SO4, while nickel remained in the second compartment. More than 99.5% of cobalt, 98.0% of nickel, and 98.9% of copper were separated into the three different compartments from a mixed feed solution containing 100 mg/L each of these three species with a transport time of 36 h. A maximum copper flux of 1.59 x 10(-6) mol/m(2).s was obtained. The results establish that copper, nickel, and cobalt in ammonia solution can be efficiently separated by this novel type of sandwich SLM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, M; Xu, CY; Cao, KF				Xu Ming; Xu Chuan-Yun; Cao Ke-Fei			Effect of degree correlations on controllability of undirected networks	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						complex network; undirected network; controllability; degree correlation	NODES	The controllability analysis of complex networks is of great importance for modern network science and engineering. Existing research shows that the controllability of a complex network is affected not only by the degree distribution of the network, but also by the degree correlation. Although the effect of degree correlations on the network controllability is well studied for directed networks, it is not yet very clear for the case of undirected networks. To explore the impact of degree correlations on the controllability of undirected networks and their corresponding generalized (bidirectional and directed) networks, in this paper, we use the simulated annealing algorithm to change the network degree correlation coefficients by link rewiring. First, the undirected Erdos-Renyi random network and the modified scale-free network are taken as example models to be investigated. Numerical simulations show that the controllability measure (density of driver nodes) of undirected networks decreases monotonically with the increase of the degree correlation coefficient under a constant degree distribution. Specifically, when the degree correlation coefficient changes from -1 to 0, the controllability measure decreases rapidly; while the decrease in the controllability measure is not obvious when the degree correlation coefficient changes from 0 to 1. Next, the bidirectional networks and some directed networks are considered; in these networks, the in-degree of each node is equal to its out-degree, thus link rewiring results in the simultaneous changes of various degree correlations (i.e., in-in, in-out, out-in, and out-out degree correlations). Further investigations show that these bidirectional and directed networks also follow the above rule, which is verified by the two real networks. The increase of the degree correlation coefficient in undirected networks also implies the increases of various degree correlation coefficients in the corresponding directed networks. Although the effect of a single degree correlation on the controllability of directed networks is clear, the comprehensive effect of the simultaneous changes in various degree correlations on the network controllability cannot be additively and therefore directly estimated by the relevant results in the corresponding directed networks; namely, the effect of the degree correlation on the controllability in an undirected network has its special rule. Some explanations are given for this phenomenon. Moreover, for a large sparse network without self-loops, no matter how assortative or disassortative it is, its structural controllability and exact controllability are verified to be almost the same. These studies will deepen the understanding of the relationship between the network controllability and the network structure.

Panax notoginseng saponines (PNS) have recently been reported to protect liver against hepatocyte injury induced by ethanol or high fat diet (HFD) in rats. Compound K and ginsenoside Rh1 are the main metabolites of PNS. In this study, we evaluated the effects of CK and Rh1 on NAFLD. Rats fed HFD showed significant elevations in liver function markers, lipids, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Treatment with CK or Rh1 either alone or in combination dramatically ameliorated the liver function impairment induced by HFD. Histologically, CK and Rh1 significantly reversed HFD-induced hepatocyte injury and liver fibrosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that treatment with CK or Rh1 alone or in combination markedly induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation and activation in HSC-T6 cells. Additionally, CK and Rh1, either alone or in combination, also repressed the expression of fibrotic factors TIMP-1, PC-I, and PC-III. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CK and Rh1 have positive effects on NAFLD via the anti-fibrotic and hepatoprotective activity.

However, successful selection of species adapted to local conditions requires specific knowledge which is often lacking, especially in developing countries. In order to scale up forest restoration, experimental data on the responses of native species to propagation and restoration treatments across a range of local conditions are required. In this study, the restoration potential of 34 native tree species was evaluated based on nursery research and field planting experiments at a highly degraded site in a subtropical area of southwest China. We examined species performance in terms of germination rates as well as survival rates and growth over 2 years after planting. Of the 34 species examined, 25 had a germination percentage greater than 50%. Survivorship ranged from 0 to 97% across species and was greater than 50% for 20 species. Mean monthly growth increments varied between species. Pioneer species performed well, and 14 mid-and late-successional species performed reasonably well to very well in this study. However, the remaining 16 mid-and late-successional species performed poorly. These results indicate that carefully selected mid-and late-successional species can be effectively incorporated into mixed species plantings. This data can be used to inform restoration planning, helping to identify suitable species and so enhance the biodiversity and resilience of restored forests.

The sample was collected on a salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay, New York, in April 2015 and the root was cross-sectioned with 10 mu m resolution. Synchrotron X-ray nanofluorescence was applied to map the trace element distributions in selected areas of the root epidermis and endodermis. The sampling resolution was 60 nm to increase the measurement accuracy and reduce the uncertainty. The results indicate that the elemental concentrations in the epidermis, outer endodermis and inner endodermis are significantly (p < 0.01) different. The root endodermis has relatively higher concentrations of these elements than the root epidermis. Furthermore, this high resolution measurement indicates that the elemental concentrations in the outer endodermis are significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the inner endodermis. These results suggest that the Casparian strip may play a role in governing the aplastic transport of these elements. Pearson correlation analysis on the average concentrations of each element in the selected areas shows that most of the elements are significantly (p < 0.05) correlated, which suggests that these elements may share the same transport pathways.

It is shown that the existing experimental data on heavy quarkonium production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be described in the framework of the NRQCD formalism, and the phenomenological values of matrix elements for color-singlet and color-octet components give the main contribution. The numerical results of photoproduction processes and fragmentation processes for the heavy quarkonium production become prominent in p-p collisions and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies.

The results indicated that the SS-beta-CD/dimethomorph was more stable than beta-CD/dimethomorph, which is ascribed to the fact that the disulfide chain plays an important role in stabilizing the appropriate dual-CD conformation and also promoting the inclusion of the host and guest. In addition, a robust fluorescence method for dimethomorph sensing has been developed based on competitive host-guest interaction by selecting safranine T (ST) as optical indicator and SS-beta-CD functionalized reduced graphene oxide (SS-beta-CD-RGO) as the receptor. Upon the presence of dimethomorph to the pre-formed SS-beta-CD-RGO.ST complex, the ST molecule is displaced by dimethomorph, leading to a "switch-on" fluorescence response. That is due to the fact that the binding constant of the dimethomorph/SS-beta-CD complex was more than 5 times greater than that of ST/SS-beta-CD. The fluorescence intensity of SS-beta-CD-RGO.ST complex increased linearly with increasing concentration of dimethomorph ranging from 0.50 to 20.0 mu M. The proposed method showed a detection limit of 0.11 mu M for dimethomorph, and was successfully applied for the determination of dimethomorph residues in vegetables (cabbage, spinach) and environmental samples (water, soil) with good precision and recoveries from 96.5% to 104%.

Dectin-1 is a beta-glucan (including LNT) receptor that regulates immune functions in many immune cell types. Cumulative evidence has suggested that the glutamatergic system seems to play an important role in the treatment of depression. Here, we studied the antidepressant-like effects of LNT and its therapeutical target in regulating the functions of AMPA receptors. We found that 60 min treatment with LNT leads to a significant antidepressant-like effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The antidepressant-like effects of LNT in TST and FST remained after 1 day or 5 days of injections. Additionally, LNT did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. Dectin-1 receptor levels were increased after LNT treatment for 5 days and the specific Dectin-1 inhibitor laminarin was able to block the antidepressant-like effects of LNT. After 5 days of treatment, LNT enhanced p-GluR1 (S845) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the total GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 expression levels remained unchanged. We also found that the AMPA-specific blocker GYKI 52466 was able to block the antidepressant-like effects of LNT. This study identified LNT as a novel antidepressant with clinical potential and a new antidepressant mechanism for regulating prefrontal Dectin-1/AMPA receptor signaling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In numerical modeling, the parameterization of a turbulent flux is usually based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). According to this theory, it is necessary to simultaneously calculate the empirical similarity parameters beta(m), beta(h), gamma(m), and gamma(h), the aerodynamic roughness (z(om)) and the thermal roughness (z(T)). However, it is difficult to solve a simultaneous set of nonlinear equations for these six parameters. In this study, a new method was introduced to solving this problem. Using measurements from Maqu Station in the source region of the Yellow River, this study employed the artificial intelligence particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to calibrate the parameters relating to the turbulent flux in the surface layer. We concluded that the differences in the sensible heat and momentum fluxes between the calculations that used the calibrated parameters and the measurements were rather small and that their correlation coefficients were relatively high. The results suggested that PSO algorithm is a feasible approach which can be applied in MOST parameter estimation. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we quantified Daphnia magna (Crustacea, Cladocera) responses in mortality rate at lethal NOR concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg L-1), and in heartbeat rate, swimming behavior and feeding rate (on the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa) at sublethal NOR concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg L-1) to determine the effects of this antibiotic in plankton systems. In 96-h-long lethal experiment, mortality rates of D. magna increased significantly with increasing NOR concentration and exposure time. In sublethal experiments, heartbeat rate decreased, while time ratio of vertical to horizontal swimming (TVH) and the duration of quiescence increased in D. magna individuals exposed to increasing NOR concentrations after 4 and 12 h of exposure. These collectively led to decreases in both average swimming ability and feeding rate, consistent with the positive relationship between average swimming ability and feeding rate. Overall, results indicate that, by affecting zooplankton heartbeat rate and behavior, NOR decreased feeding efficiency of D. magna even at low doses, therefore, it might seriously compromise ecosystem health and function.

Exciton states in a circular graphene quantum dot: Magnetic field induced intravalley to intervalley transition	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							BOTTOM-UP FABRICATION; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; NANORIBBONS; PHOTONICS	The magnetic-field dependence of the energy spectrum, wave function, binding energy, and oscillator strength of exciton states confined in a circular graphene quantum dot (CGQD) is obtained within the configuration interaction method. We predict that (i) excitonic effects are very significant in the CGQD as a consequence of a combination of geometric confinement, magnetic confinement, and reduced screening; (ii) two types of excitons (intravalley and intervalley) are present in the CGQD because of the valley degree of freedom in graphene; (iii) the intravalley and intervalley exciton states display different magnetic-field dependencies due to the different electron-hole symmetries of the single-particle energy spectra; (iv) with increasing magnetic field, the exciton ground state in the CGQD undergoes an intravalley to intervalley transition accompanied by a change of angular momentum; (v) the exciton binding energy does not increase monotonically with the magnetic field due to the competition between geometric and magnetic confinements; and (vi) the optical transitions of the intervalley and intravalley excitons can be tuned by the magnetic field, and valley-dependent excitonic transitions can be realized in a CGQD.

In consideration of the SNR origin of Galactic cosmic rays and physics related to particle acceleration and radiative processes, we use a simple one-zone model to fit the nonthermal emission spectra of three shell-type SNRs located within 2 degrees on the sky: RX J1713.7-3946, CTB 37B, and CTB 37A. Although radio images of these three sources all show a shell (or half-shell) structure, their radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra are quite different, offering an ideal case to explore evolution of energetic particle distribution in SNRs. Our spectral fitting shows that (1) the particle distribution becomes harder with aging of these SNRs, implying a continuous acceleration process, and the particle distributions of CTB 37A and CTB 37B in the GeV range are harder than the hardest distribution that can be produced at a shock via the linear diffusive shock particle acceleration process, so spatial transport may play a role; (2) the energy loss timescale of electrons at the high-energy cutoff due to synchrotron radiation appears to be always a bit (within a factor of a few) shorter than the age of the corresponding remnant, which also requires continuous particle acceleration; (3) double power-law distributions are needed to fit the spectra of CTB 37B and CTB 37A, which may be attributed to shock interaction with molecular clouds.

The morphology and the microstructure of samples were characterized by transition electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. ZnO nanoparticles with several nanometers in size decorated on the surface of the carbon sphere and formed a core-shell structure. Electrochemical performances of the CS@ZnO core-shell nanocomposites electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GDC). The CS@ZnO core-shell nanocomposite electrodes exhibit much larger specific capacitance and cycling stability is improved significantly compared with pure ZnO electrode. The CS@ZnO core-shell nanocomposite with mole ratio of 1: 1 achieves a specific capacitance of 630 F g(-1) at the current density of 2 A g(-1). Present work might provide a new route for fabricating carbon sphere and transition metal oxides composite materials as electrodes for the application in supercapacitors.

User similarities not only depend on the topological structure but also the dependence degrees between users. In this paper, we adopt Bayesian network (BN), an important and popular probabilistic graphical model, as the underling framework and propose a data-intensive approach for discovering user similarities. First, upon the massive social behavioral interactions, we give the method for measuring direct similarities between users and the MapReduce-based algorithm for constructing a BN to describe these similarities, called user Bayesian network and abbreviated as UBN. We also give the idea for storing large-scale UBNs in a distributed file system. Then, to measure indirect similarities between users, we give the method for measuring the closeness of user connections in terms of the properties of UBN's. graphical structure. Further, we give the MapReduce-based algorithm for measuring the dependence degrees by means of UBN's probabilistic inferences. By combining the above two perspectives of measures, the indirect similarity degree between users can be achieved, while guaranteeing the applicability theoretically. Finally, we give experimental results and show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

In our result, the assumption for boundedness in Song and Zhao (2016) [25] on the complex-valued activation functions is removed and the matrix form of the square terms in Li et al. (2009) [23] and Yang and Li (2015) [24] is replaced with a new matrix form, the complex-valued matrix inequalities in Song and Zhao (2016) [25] and Chen and Song (2013) [26] are replaced with some new matrix inequalities which are derived from two new algebraic inequalities. Hence, our result on global stability is less conservative than those obtained in Song and Zhao (2016) [25] and more novel than those obtained in Li et al.

The isolate grew at a temperature range of 18-40 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum 7.0) and with 0-6 % NaCl (optimum 2 % NaCl (w/v)). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain NCCP-1331(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces and is closely related to Streptomyces brevispora BK160(T) with 97.9 % nucleotide similarity, followed by Streptomyces drosdowiczii NRRL B-24297(T) with 97.8 % nucleotide similarity. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain NCCP-1331(T) with S. brevispora KACC 21093(T) and S. drosdowiczii CBMAI 0498(T) were 42.7 and 34.7 %, respectively. LL-DAP was detected as diagnostic amino acid along with alanine, glycine, leucine and glutamic acid. The isolate contained MK-9(H-8) as the predominant menaquinone. Major polar lipids detected in NCCP-1331(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and unidentified phospholipids. Major fatty acids were iso-C-16: 0, summed feature 8 (18:1 omega 7c/18:1 omega 6c), anteiso-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G + C content was 69.8 mol %. On the basis of phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis, it is concluded that strain NCCP-1331(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces caldifontis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NCCP-1331(T) (=KCTC 39537(T) = CPCC 204147(T)).

Excessive utilization of the plant for extraction of dragon's blood had resulted in the destruction of the important niche. During a study to provide a sustainable way of utilizing the resources, the endophytic Actinobacteria associated with the plant were explored for potential utilization of their medicinal properties. Three hundred and four endophytic Actinobacteria belonging to the genera Streptomyces, Nocardiopsis, Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, Tsukamurella, Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Kocuria, Nocardioides, and Pseudonocardia were isolated from different tissues of D. cochinchinensis Lour. Of these, 17 strains having antimicrobial and anthracyclines-producing activities were further selected for screening of antifungal and cytotoxic activities against two human cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and Hep G2. Ten of these selected endophytic Actinobacteria showed antifungal activities against at least one of the fungal pathogens, of which three strains exhibited cytotoxic activities with IC50-values ranging between 3 and 33 mu g.mL(-1). Frequencies for the presence of biosynthetic genes, polyketide synthase-(PKS-) I, PKS-II, and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) among these 17 selected bioactive Actinobacteria were 29.4%, 70.6%, and 23.5%, respectively. The results indicated that the medicinal plant D. cochinchinensis Lour. is a good niche of biologically important metabolites-producing Actinobacteria.

Through the theoretical analysis and finite-element method simulations, it is conceptually demonstrated that the band of the RTE can be dynamically tuned in a range of similar to 0.06 THz. Furthermore, the SFGG can also be optically switched between a device for the RTE and a waveguide for releasing the trapped waves. The results obtained here may imply applications for the tunable THz plasmonic devices, such as on-chip optical buffers, broad band slow-light systems, and integrated optical filters.

The role and extent of allelopathic effects of blooming freshwater cyanobacteria on other phytoplankton species in eutrophied waters, however, are still unknown. We examined the allelopathic effect of Microcystis aeruginosa on two common green algae (Scenedesmus quadricauda, Chlorella pyrenoidosa) and a diatom (Cyclotella meneghiniana) by adding exudates from different growth phases and in co-culture tests. Exudates of M. aeruginosa from the exponential growth phase and the stationary phase significantly inhibited the growth of S. quadricauda, C pyrenoidosa and C meneghiniana, whereas those from the decline phase increased their growth. The presence of M. aeruginosa extremely inhibited the growth of all tested species in co-cultures within 24 h. Our results indicate that under the tested environmental conditions (25 degrees C, light 80 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), manual shaking twice a day), allelopathic effects of M. aeruginosa on other phytoplankton species can significantly contribute to their competitive success.

The visual content of these images contains rich knowledge for many uses, such as social categorization and recommendation. Mobile image labeling has, therefore, been proposed to understand the visual content and received intensive attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel mobile image labeling scheme on the cloud, in which mobile images are first and efficiently transmitted to the cloud by Hamming compressed sensing, such that the heavy computation for image understanding is transferred to the cloud for quick response to the queries of the users. On the cloud, we design a sparse correntropy framework for robustly learning the semantic content of mobile images, based on which the relevant tags are assigned to the query images. The proposed framework (called maximum correntropy-based mobile image labeling) is very insensitive to the noise and the outliers, and is optimized by a half-quadratic optimization technique. We theoretically show that our image labeling approach is more robust than the squared loss, absolute loss, Cauchy loss, and many other robust loss function-based sparse coding methods. To further understand the proposed algorithm, we also derive its robustness and generalization error bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments on the PASCAL VOC' 07 data set and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust sparse coding method for mobile image labeling.

PA-44 and its mesophilic homologue, proteinase K (PRK), have been performed for 20ns at four different temperatures (300, 373, 473, and 573K). The comparative analyses of MD trajectories reveal that at almost all temperatures, VPR exhibits greater structural fluctuations/deviations, more unstable regular secondary structural elements, and higher global flexibility than PRK. Although these two proteases follow similar unfolding pathways at high temperatures, VPR initiates unfolding at a lower temperature and unfolds faster at the same high temperatures than PRK. These observations collectively indicate that VPR is less stable and more heat-labile than PRK. Analyses of the structural/geometrical properties reveal that, when compared to PRK, VPR has larger radius of gyration (Rg), less intramolecular contacts and hydrogen bonds (HBs), more protein-solvent HBs, and smaller burial of nonpolar area and larger exposure of polar area. These suggest that the increased flexibility of VPR would be most likely caused by its reduced intramolecular interactions and more favourable protein-solvent interactions arising from the larger exposure of the polar area, whereas the enhanced stability of PRK could be ascribed to its increased intramolecular interactions arising from the better optimized hydrophobicity. The factors responsible for the significant differences in local flexibility between these two proteases were also analyzed and ascertained. This study provides insights into molecular basis of thermostability of homologous serine proteases adapted to different temperatures.

Oxidative stress and immune response are associated with acute renal failure (ARF). Ophiocordyceps lanpingensis (OL) might be an antioxidant and immunopotentiator. In this study, we explored the protective effects of OL on glycerol-induced ARF. Methods. Male mice were randomly divided into four groups, specifically, glycerol-induced ARF model group, low-dose OL-treated group (1.0 g/kg/d), high-dose OL-treated group (2.0 g/kg/d), and control group. Renal conditions were evaluated using kidney index, serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and histological analysis. Rhabdomyolysis was monitored using creatine kinase (CK) level. Oxidative stress was determined using kidney tissue glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Immune status was evaluated using immune organ indices and immunoglobulin G (IgG) level. Results. OL could relieve renal pathological injury and decrease the abnormal levels of kidney index, serum Cr, CK, BUN, and MDA, as well as increase the immune organ indices and the levels of IgG, GSH, and SOD. Treatment with a high dose of OL had more positive therapeutic effects on ARF than using a low dose of OL. Conclusion. OL could ameliorate renal dysfunction in glycerol-induced ARF in mice by inhibiting oxidative stress and enhancing immune response.

The incident angle and the multiple reflection beams in the substrate with finite thickness are taken into consideration. The model can be applied to predict the optical responses of graphene/substrate systems or to extract the real part of the optical conductance of graphene from the experimental measurement. As an example, we calculate the relative transmittance of graphene/quartz and graphene/sapphire systemsby using MRM and provide an experimental verification in the near-infrared range. The measured results show good agreement with the calculated ones. Our method can be easily extended to accurately and non-invasively identify the layer numbers of other 2D materials, and assess the quality of them.

The ontogenetic series shows protarthrous development with some, but likely not all, early holaspid instars expressing additional pygidial segments, gradual rearward migration of the location of the longest pleural spines on the trunk segments, and striking positive allometry of the genal spines. It also reveals Parazhangshania sichuanensis Li and Zhang, 1990 to be the holaspid stage 3 of Z. typica, and therefore its junior synonym. This new find in the Hongjingshao Formation provides species-based regional correlation across the South China block and Z. typica may provide an important biostratigraphic marker for the base of the traditional Tsanglangpuan Stage.

The morphology and microstructure of as-synthesized samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), respectively. The observations revealed the formation of a single phase of the hexagonal brucite-like beta-Co(OH)(2), which had an irregular hexagonal disk with angles of adjacent edges of 120 degrees, edge lengths ranging from 200 to 300 nm, and thicknesses of 20-40 nm. When investigated as catalyst for CO oxidation, the beta-Co(OH)(2) nanoplatelets exhibited good catalytic activity for CO. Among beta-Co(OH)(2) nanoplatelets, the sample prepared at 100 degrees C for 8 h performed the best, giving the T-100% (the temperature required for achieving a CO of 100%) of 120 degrees C for the oxidation of CO. There are good correlations of Co3+/Co2+, the absorbed O-x(-) ions and surface OH group with catalytic activity of the samples for CO oxidation.

J	Chen, YF; Ji, X				Chen, Yunfang; Ji, Xuan			The evaluation of the synergetic degree of ecology economy society system of China forestry during the last decade	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY			English	Article						Forestry complex system; ordered degree of subsystem; synergistic degree of system		Ecological ravages, environmental pollution, and the developmental problems of regional ecology, economy, and society are not geographical restrictions. The synergistic development of the ecology-economy-society system in forestry was quantitatively assessed by system theory and synergistic dynamic models, illustration of the metering principle and corresponding theory, assessing and quantizing synergistic development status of ecology-economy-society system, and the orderliness of the subsystem of the last decade. The orderliness of the ecology and ecological subsystems developed unstably with an increasing trend. The eco-environment construction and eco-conservation achievement of forestry in China are effective and need to be maintained. The industry structure should be improved to promote the growth of the forestry economy. The society subsystem development is increasing but is not at a high level, which indicates that the public demand to ecological service was not satisfied. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples show that the development of the forestry system has a good development state. The synergy changes of forestry system in the 0 to 0.951 range, which is in the intermediate degree of synergy during this period. It still needs much improvement on efficiency of synergy. The orderliness and the relationship among the subsystems of forestry should be improved in future.

The Fe3O4/CD samples were applied in the removal of radionuclides and heavy metal ions contaminations from aqueous solutions. The synthesized Fe3O4/CD nanocomposite which showed high saturation magnetization could be likely separated by using an external magnet. The adsorption performance and underlying mechanism of Fe3O4/CD nanocomposite toward nickel ions were studied using batch technique. The adsorption kinetic of nickel ions on Fe3O4/CD surfaces could be obtained within the time period of 8 h. The surface conjugated CD can obviously improve adsorption performance towards Ni(II) ions. The Fe3O4/CD samples show propitious adsorption property toward Ni(II) ions from wastewater. The experimental findings showed that Fe3O4/CD nanocomposite could be used as a highly effective adsorbent for the removal of Ni(II) ions from large volumes of aqueous solution.

First of all, using constructed function methods, a new Jensen-like inequality is introduced to obtain less conservative results. Second, a new class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed according to the characteristic of the considered systems. Third, combining with the new inequality and reciprocal convex approach and some other inequality techniques, the new less conservative robust stability criteria are shown in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, three examples demonstrate the feasibility and the superiority of our methods.

The taxonomic status and species composition of the three groups remain controversial due to conflicting phenotypic analyses and insufficient phylogenetic reconstruction; likewise, the position of the monotypic Borneophrys remains uncertain with respect to the horned toads. Further, the diversity of the horned toads remains poorly understood, especially for widespread species. Herein, we evaluate species-level diversity based on 45 of the 57 described species from throughout southern China, Southeast Asia and the Himalayas using Bayesian inference trees and the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) approach. We estimate the phylogeny using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. Analyses reveal statistically significant mito-nuclear discordance. All analyses resolve paraphyly for horned toads involving multiple strongly supported clades. These clades correspond with geography. We resurrect the genera Atympanophrys and Xenophrys from the synonymy of Megophrys to eliminate paraphyly of Megophrys s.l. and to account for the morphological, molecular and biogeographic differences among these groups, but we also provide an alternative option. Our study suggests that Borneophrys is junior synonym of Megophrys sensu stricto. We provide an estimation of timeframe for the horned toads. The mitochondrial and nuclear trees indicate the presence of many putative undescribed species. Widespread species, such as Xenophrys major and X. minor, likely have dramatically underestimated diversity. The integration of morphological and molecular evidence can validate this discovery. Montane forest dynamics appear to play a significant role in driving diversification of horned toads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the molecular mechanism by which alpha-ZAL prevents neuron damage remains unclear. Growing evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis in AD; in addition, our published data indicated that alpha-ZAL possessed the potential ability to stabilize ER function. We therefore hypothesized that ER-stress mechanism maybe involved in the antiapoptotic effect of alpha-ZAL in this study. METHODS: Primary rat hippocampal neurons have been cultured and subsequently followed exposed to beta-peptide fragment 25-35(A beta(25-35)) with or without alpha-ZAL pre-treatment, and then western blot and flow cytometry techniques has been used to evaluate the intracellular calcium balance, ER stress and apoptotic cell death. RESULTS: The results showed that A beta(25-35) treatment for 24h induced dramatic neuronal apoptosis, accompanied by an increase in calpain2 expression, a marker of intracellular calcium overload. On the other hand, ER stress sensitive hallmarks, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER-resident kinase (PERK) and C/EBP homologous protein-10 (CHOP10) expressions were up-regulated after A beta(25-35) administration. Importantly, alpha-ZAL pre-treatment effectively attenuated above changes. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that alpha-ZAL protects cells against AD-like apoptosis and the effects at least partially by attenuating severely ER stress.

Previous findings indicated that miRNA-320a may involve in the cancer development. In this study, we explored the roles of miR-320a by targeting c-Myc in the tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of miR-320a in 50 HCC tissues and four HCC cells. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the direct downstream target of miR-320a in HEK-293 cells. The effect of miR-320a on endogenous c-Myc expression was investigated by transfecting miR-320a mimics into HepG2 and QGY-7703 cell lines. The c-Myc and miR-320a expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qRT-PCR in the same HCC tissues. Furthermore, the biological functional correlation of miR-320a with c-Myc was determined by studying the effect of miR-320a mimics or c-Myc small interfering RNA (siRNA) on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Results: The expression of miR-320a was downregulated in 50 HCC tissues and 4 HCC cells. Luciferase assay revealed that c-Myc is a direct target of miR-320a. IHC and Western blot analysis showed that the c-Myc expression was inhibited by miR-320a in HCC tissues and cell lines. Upregulation of miR- 320a suppressed the HCC cell proliferation and invasion capacity induced by inhibiting c-Myc, and the results were consistent with the effects of c-Myc siRNA on tumor suppression. These results revealed that miRNA-320a inhibits tumor proliferation and invasion by targeting c-Myc in HCC cells. Conclusion: Our results showed that miR-320a functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC. By targeting c-Myc directly, miR-320a inhibits the HCC cell growth. Our studies provide evidence of miR-320a as a potentially target for HCC treatment.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on self-determination theory, three important contextual factors of QQ knowledge-communication groups were selected as exogenous variables and three typical autonomous motivations as mediating variables to construct a knowledge-sharing model. Internet questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS. Findings - Reciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. Autonomy support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations. Originality/value - This study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of autonomy. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed.

The structure, stability, and electronic properties are mainly discussed by PBE + SOC method and the hybrid functional HSE06 method is used to further revise the band gap. The optimized b-bismuthene is determined to be dynamically and thermally stable with an indirect band gap. In particular, there is a peculiar Rashba spin-splitting emerging in the valence band maximum (VBM) states. Interestingly, the Rashba energy could be effectively modulated by in-layer biaxial strain. By applying in-layer biaxial strain, one can find that b-bismuthene has indirect-direct band gap and semiconductor-semimetal transitions. Moreover, we also study the electronic structure of bilayer b-bismuthene that is sensitively dependent on the interlayer distance. We demonstrate that the electric field (E-field) leads to a breaking of the Rashba-type splitting near the VBM of single b-bismuthene. More importantly, there is a synergistic effect when both strain and electric field are applied at the same time. The E-field induced band splitting character could be modified by the strain strength. Thus, this study indicates that b-bismuthene may be a potential material in both electronic and spintronic devices.

PL646, an alkaline cuticle-degrading serine protease derived from the nematophagous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus, has been shown to have a high nematicidal activity. Although the crystal structure of PL646 provides a solid basis for investigating its structure-function relationship, the detailed aspects of the dynamics involving the substrate binding, orientation, catalysis, product release, and how these processes are regulated, remain unstudied. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and metadynamics simulations of PL646 with and without the peptide substrate AAPV were performed to investigate the changes in structure, molecular motions, and free energy landscape (FEL) of PL646 upon substrate binding. The results indicate that during simulations, the substrate-bound PL646 adopts a more stable and compact conformation than the substrate-free form. However, a few regions located opposite the substrate binding pockets or connected to the catalytic residue show increased flexibility upon substrate binding. Combined essential dynamics (ED) analysis reveals that, upon substrate binding, the noticeable displacements occur not only in the substrate binding pockets/sites, but also in the surface-exposed loops. The dynamic pockets caused by the large concerted motions are proposed to be linked to the substrate recognition, binding, orientation, catalysis, and product release of PL646. The constructed FELs reveal that the substrate-free PL646 has a more rugged and wider free energy surface, and a higher minimum free energy level than the proteinase in complex with its substrate, indicating that the substrate binding reduces the conformational flexibility while increasing the stability of PL646. The results presented in this work will facilitate a better understanding of the structure-dynamics-function relationship of the cuticle-degrading serine protease PL646.

Borrelidin, produced by several actinomycete bacteria of Streptomycin sp. exhibited diversiform activities including anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-angiogenic, and anti-tumor. However, the effect of borrelidin on HCC cells has not been characterized. The present study demonstrated borrelidin exhibited great potential to inhibit the growth of HCC cells, HepG2 and SMMC7721 in vitro. Western blot and real-time qPCR analysis revealed that borrelidin decreased the expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and increased the expression of p21, thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, borrelidin down-regulated expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated expression of Bax and increased cleavages of caspase-9 and caspase-3 to activate caspasedependent apoptosis in HCC cells. Borrelidin inhibited migration and invasion through suppressing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HCC cells. Further investigation indicated that the anti-tumor effect of borrelidin was mediated by MAPKs signaling pathway. In addition, an in vivo experiment revealed that borrelidin suppressed tumor growth in SMMC7721 xenograft model mice with few side effects. Cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis were also observed in tumor tissues of model mice treated with borrelidin.

In a neutral aqueous condition, the fluorescence of poly(thymine)-templated copper nanoparticles could be quenched by cysteine in 10min effectively coexisting with common biological small molecules. Under the optimal experimental condition, the present assay allowed for the selective determination of cysteine in the range of 12.5-100 mu M, with a detection limit of 7.3 mu M.

An existence theorem of this kind of weak subgradient is established. In terms of Lagrange multiplier, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are established for set-valued optimization problems with constraint sets being determined by a geometric set and a cone-convex set-valued mapping. In particular, the necessary optimality conditions do not require any convexity of the objective mapping and the geometric set.

The mechanism behind the antenna is theoretically analyzed and further validated by numerical simulation and physical measurement. The results show that the spiral-based antenna is able to reliably generate the OAM carrying beams in an ultra-wide frequency band. Of particular interest is the fact that the mode number of radiated beams is reconfigurable with a change in operating frequency. Prototypes of a single-arm spiral antenna (SASA), a multi-arm spiral antenna (MASA), and a compact multi-arm spiral antenna (CMASA) are investigated and demonstrated to support our arguments. The proposed approach provides an effective and competitive way to generate OAM carrying beams in radio and microwave bands, which may have potential in wireless communication applications due to its characteristics of simplicity, broadband capacity and reconfiguration opportunities.

We considered the color-singlet (CS) and color-octet (CO) components within the framework of Nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) in the production of heavy quarkonium. Tlie phenomenological values of the matrix elements for the color-singlet and color-octet components give the main contribution to the production of heavy quarkonium from the gluon-gluon interaction caused by the emission of additional gluon in the initial state. The numerical results indicate that the contribution of photoproduction processes cannot be negligible for midrapidity in p-p and Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.

J	Li, YK; Meng, XF				Li, Yongkun; Meng, Xiaofang			Existence and Global Exponential Stability of Pseudo Almost Periodic Solutions for Neutral Type Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks with Delays in the Leakage Term on Time Scales	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; DYNAMIC EQUATIONS; MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS; VARYING DELAYS	We propose a class of neutral type quaternion-valued neural networks with delays in the leakage termon time scales that can unify the discrete-time and the continuous-time neural networks. In order to avoid the difficulty brought by the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication, we first decompose the quaternion-valued system into four real-valued systems. Then, by applying the exponential dichotomic theory of linear dynamic equations on time scales, Banach's fixed point theorem, the theory of calculus on time scales, and inequality techniques, we obtain some sufficient conditions on the existence and global exponential stability of pseudo almost periodic solutions for this class of neural networks. Our results are completely new even for both the case of the neural networks governed by differential equations and the case of the neural networks governed by difference equations and show that, under a simple condition, the continuous-time quaternion-valued network and its corresponding discrete-time quaternion-valued network have the same dynamical behavior for the pseudo almost periodicity. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our results.

Telson morphology of Leanchoiliidae (Arthropoda: Megacheira) highlighted by a new Leanchoilia from the Cambrian Chengjiang biota. Alcheringa 41, 581-589. ISSN 0311-5518.Despite being a dominant group in both the Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang biota, diversity of the family Leanchoiliidae mostly consists of monotypic genera, with one genus, Leanchoilia, however, being represented by multiple species from several Cambrian Konservat-Lagerstatten. Here we distinguish a new species of this genus from hundreds of specimens formerly assigned to the Chengjiang species Leanchoilia illecebrosa, and establish its affinity within Leanchoilia by morphology of the telson (distally pointed and fringed with spines), a widely used diagnostic character at the generic level in Leanchoiliidae. The new species, Leanchoilia obesa sp. nov., is distinguished from other species of Leanchoilia by an oval outline of the dorsal exoskeleton and a telson with a long basal region and long spines. The new species is also distinguishable from other species of Leanchoilia by sharing some distinct characters of other leanchoiliid genera such as the wide body shape of Oestokerkus and Yawunik, and tiny serrations on the spinose projection of the great appendages of Yawunik. The mosaic combination of characters at the generic and specific levels prompted a re-evaluation of telson morphology as a diagnostic character in Leanchoiliidae. A new descriptive model of the leanchoiliid telson is based on the development of Leanchoilia obesa, inferred by comparing larval, juvenile and adult specimens. The result reveals that the leanchoiliid telson is a complex morphological unit and a source of diagnostic characters at both the generic and specific levels.

Secondly, we study some basic properties of almost automorphic functions on the quantum time scale. Then, we introduce a transformation between functions defined on the quantum time scale and functions defined on the set of generalized integer numbers; by using this transformation we give equivalent definitions of almost automorphic functions on the quantum time scale; following the idea of the transformation, we also give a concept of almost automorphic functions on more general time scales that can unify the concepts of almost automorphic functions on almost periodic time scales and on the quantum time scale. Finally, as an application of our results, we establish the existence of almost automorphic solutions of linear and semilinear dynamic equations on the quantum time scale.

Jing-8 and the structure was determined as alternariol 1'-hydroxy-9-methyl ether (1), together with twelve known compounds. The structures were elucidated on the basis of their 1D, 2D NMR spectra and mass spectrometric data. Compounds 1, 8 and 9 indicated inhibitions against germination of the seeds of cabbage with MICs < 3 mu g/mL. The compound 1 showed the antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs at 64 mu g/mL.

In this article, we propose a group-specific method to use dependency information from users and items which share similar characteristics under the singular value decomposition framework. The new approach is effective for the "cold-start" problem, where, in the testing set, majority responses are obtained from new users or for new items, and their preference information is not available from the training set. One advantage of the proposed model is that we are able to incorporate information from the missing mechanism and group-specific features through clustering based on the numbers of ratings from each user and other variables associated with missing patterns. In addition, since this type of data involves large-scale customer records, traditional algorithms are not computationally scalable. To implement the proposed method, we propose a new algorithm that embeds a back-fitting algorithm into alternating least squares, which avoids large matrices operation and big memory storage, and therefore makes it feasible to achieve scalable computing. Our simulation studies and MovieLens data analysis both indicate that the proposed group-specific method improves prediction accuracy significantly compared to existing competitive recommender system approaches.

J	Jiang, Q; Jin, X; Lee, SJ; Yao, SW				Jiang, Qian; Jin, Xin; Lee, Shin-Jye; Yao, Shaowen			A Novel Multi-Focus Image Fusion Method Based on Stationary Wavelet Transform and Local Features of Fuzzy Sets	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Multi-sensor information fusion; multi-focus image fusion; Stationary wavelet transform; fuzzy set; spatial frequency	CONTOURLET TRANSFORM	The key issue of multi-sensor image fusion is how to accurately extract and fuse the high-quality pixels or coefficients of source images. Nevertheless, the so-called high-quality is an uncertain or fuzzy definition, which is very suitable for fuzzy theory to address this problem. By the integration of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and fuzzy sets, this paper proposes a new multi-focus image fusion scheme, which can merge the important features of different source images into a fused image. First, the source images are decomposed by SWT to get a set of sub-images with different detailed features. Second, the Gaussian membership function (GMF) is utilized to get the fuzzy sets of sub-images data. Third, the local spatial frequency (LSF) is employed to extract the local features of the sub-images by the generated fuzzy sets. At last, the fusion rule is designed based on consistency verification to fuse the sub-images according to the LSF of fuzzy sets, and then inverse SWT (ISWT) is implemented to reconstruct the fused image. The experimental and contrastive results of different image sets show that the proposed method is an effective multi-focus image fusion scheme which can achieve better fusion effect than other methods.

This paper gives a solution to the construction and rendering of multiresolution representation for massive meshes. Our approach provides a dual hierarchy: a cluster hierarchy for coarse-grained selective refinement and a vertex hierarchy for progressive meshes contained in the cluster for fine-grained local refinement. In order to promote the speed of the construction and rendering of multiresolution representation for massive meshes, we implement parallel half edge collapse to build the vertex hierarchy in the clusters and view-dependent refinement for vertex hierarchy in parallel with GPU. To prevent data transmission delay to stall the rendering, a separate CPU thread is used to prefetch clusters data into main memory. Our construction process is faster than a corresponding sequential implementation and the rendering results are of comparable quality.

The separation of electron-hole pairs generated in QDs are enhanced due to the photogating effects in the composites, and then the electrons or holes are rapidly transferred to the surface of the graphene sheets, resulting in excellent optical gain, making them promising materials for applications in optoelectronic and light harvesting devices. In this review, recent research progress on QDs/GR composites is reviewed and discussed, including preparation methods and applications. Numerous self-assembly synthetic methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, atomic layer deposition, ion beam sputtering deposition, and other typical synthetic methods like drop-casting, spin-coating, layer by layer, ultrasonication, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) aid transfer and electrochemical methods are summarized and discussed. In addition, the applications of QDs/GR composites such as in photodetectors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, photocatalysis, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensors and supercapacitors are described in detail. Finally, the prospects of QDs/GR composites are discussed.

All the compounds were fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and magnetic studies. The single crystal X-ray analyses show that the 1D chains of [M(COO-)(2)](n) (M = MnII, 1, CoII, 2 and NiII, 3) are further joined by tetrazolyl spacers to form a 3D network. Based on the topological perspective, the complexes can be simplified into a (3,6)-connected 2-nodal net with (4(2).6)(2)(4(4).6(2).8(8).10) "ant" topology. The magnetic measurements reveal different magnetic exchange-coupling interactions: antiferromagnetic for 1 and ferromagnetic for 2 and 3. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements confirm that spin glass behaviour occurs in 3 but not in 2.

The development of large-scale cryopreservation techniques, such as vitrification, for MSCs is a prerequisite for clinical therapies. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol (EG) are two types of cryoprotectants widely used for cell vitrification. However, the effects of DMSO and EG on the biological characteristics and transcriptome profiles of MSCs after cryopreservation remain unknown. In the present study, the viability, immunophenotype of cell surface markers, proliferation, differentiation potency, and global gene expression of rhesus macaque bone marrow-derived MSCs vitrified using DMSO and EG were studied. The results showed that vitrification did not affect the morphology, surface markers, and differentiation of the MSCs, and compared to DMSO, EG better protected cell viability and proliferation. Most importantly, vitrification resulted in changes in a large number of transcripts of MSCs either preserved using DMSO or EG. This report is the first to examine the effects of DMSO and EG on global gene expression in stem cells. These results will be beneficial to understanding the biological process involved in MSC vitrification and will contribute to improving cryopreservation protocols that maintain transcriptomic identity with high cryosurvival for preclinical research and clinical long-term storage.

This paper presents an assessment of physical meanings of parameter and goodness of fit for homodyned K (HK) distribution modeling ultrasonic speckles from scatterer distributions with wide- varying spatial organizations. Methods. A set of 3D scatterer phantoms based on gamma distributions is built to be implemented from the clustered to random to uniform scatterer distributions continuously. The model parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from statistical histograms of the ultrasonic envelope data and then compared with those by the optimally fitting models chosen from three single distributions. Results show that the parameters of the HK distribution still present their respective physical meanings of independent contributions in the scatterer distributions. Moreover, the HK distribution presents better goodness of fit with a maximum relative MLE difference of 6.23% for random or clustered scatterers with a well-organized periodic structure. Experiments based on ultrasonic envelope data from common carotid arterial B-mode images of human subjects validate the modeling performance of HK distribution. Conclusion. We conclude that the HK model for ultrasonic speckles is a better choice for characterizing tissue with a wide variety of spatial organizations, especially the emphasis on the goodness of fit for the tissue in practical applications.

Pyridin-2-ones 3 were synthesised via the regioselective reaction of N, N'-disubstituted 1,1-ene diamines 1a-1w with mercaptals 2a-2c in acetonitrile promoted by Cs2CO3 under refluxing conditions. Fortunately, pyrimidin-4-ones 4 were obtained when the N-monosubstituted 1,1-ene diamines 1x-1b', used as substrate, by accident, reacted with mercaptals 2 under similar conditions. As a result, two kinds of novel heterocycles were synthesised by this protocol. The reactions have some advantages, such as excellent yield, inexpensive raw materials and convenient final treatment. The antitumor bioactivity screening showed that certain compounds had potent antitumor activity. Especially, compounds 3r, which showed the most potent activity with IC50 values lower than 12.3 mu mol L-1 against four human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP). In addition, a preliminary assessment of the structure-selectivity relationship of the compounds was also performed.

Based on the homoclinic breather wave solution, rational homoclinic breather wave solution is generated by homoclinic breather limit method, rogue wave in the form of the rational homoclinic solution is derived when the period of homoclinic breather wave goes to infinite. This is a new way for generating rogue wave which is different from direct constructing method, Darboux dressing technique and ansatz with complexity of parameter. This result shows the homoclinic rogue wave can be generated from homoclinic breather wave, and it is useful for explaining some related nonlinear phenomenon. (C) 2017 All rights reserved.

Two novel menthane-type monoterpenoid dimers, dimericilligerates E (1) and F (2) were isolated from the fermented material. Their structures were identified by 1D/2D NMR, electric circular dichroism, derivatization, and Mosher's method. A novel elimination reaction that formed a benzene ring from a menthane moiety afforded derivative 1a, which possesses more resolved NMR signals than the dimeric monoterpenoid, dimericilligerate E (1). The determination of 1a verified the estimation of 1. Compounds 1 and 2 showed potent cytotoxic activities; especially, 1 possessed significant activities against the liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SMMC-7721) with an IC50 value of 3.89 +/- 0.23 mu M. Three novel precursors, dimericilligerates A-C (3-5), were identified by HPLC-MS and isolated from the original I. aromatica. This paper presents a novel class of monoterpenoid dimers and suggests that C. rogersoniana-fermented I. aromatica is effective to produce cytotoxic dimeric monoterpenoids from inactive original materials.

Batch sorption studies were carried out, and the main adsorption parameters were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the relevant thermodynamic parameters, isotherms, and kinetic models were also evaluated. Results revealed a high adsorption capacity of 278.5 mg g(-1) for Pd(II). Separation factors beta(Pd/Pt) and beta(Pd/Rh) were 4.3 x 10(3) and 5.3 x 10(3), respectively. Results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated that the sorption of Pd(II) occurs mainly by chelation between Pd(II) and -NH-/-N=/-COOH/-OCH3 and is accompanied by a redox mechanism involving the reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0). The new PANI-AMB adsorbent showed efficient adsorption and separation of palladium from the leaching liquor of spent automotive catalysts, as well as good stability and reusability.

By applying the methods of literature review and logical reasoning, this paper analyzed the development process of China's ethnic and religious art and existing problems, and found that the ethnic and religious art has experienced three stages. With the development of each stage, ethnic and religious art reduced its influence on secular art. Currently, the overall development of China's national religious art lacks incompetence. Then, the author gave his thoughts on the development of contemporary Chinese ethnic and religious art, so as to effectively preserve ethnic and religious art culture, strengthen the regulation and specification on the art creation and combine the art research and creation in an organic way.

Si1 has an important relationship with tumors. Autophagy and apoptosis are two types of cell death. However, there are few studies regarding the association between Si1 and autophagy, or apoptosis in tumors. In this, we investigated the effect of Si1 on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells and its influence on autophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Methods: To investigate these functions of Si1 in tumor cells, we firstly constructed a pEGFP-Si1 overexpression vector and a pSilencer-Si1 interference vector, and we subsequently tested the proliferation and cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells using the MTT assay and flow cytometry, and we then detected autophagy by western blotting and MDC (Monodansylcadaverine) staining as well as apoptosis by western blotting and Hoechst 33258 staining. Results: We found that the Si1 gene can significantly inhibit the viability of MCF-7 cells and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Si1 can induce autophagy through upregulation of LC3-. and Beclin1, it can induce apoptosis through cleavage of PARP in MCF-7 cells. Conclusion: Altogether, our study indicated that Si1 can inhibit cell proliferation of MCF-7, and also induces autophagy and apoptosis. This study firstly investigated the effect of Si1 on autophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, it also improves the current understanding of the mechanisms related to the effect of Si1 on tumor cells and also provides a foundation for gene-targeted therapy.

However, whether adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing has functions in nuclear genes involved in mitochondria remains elusive. Here, we retrieved 707,246 A-to-I RNA editing sites in Macaca mulatta leveraging massive transcriptomes of 30 different tissues and genomes of nine tissues, together with the reported data, and found that A-to-I RNA editing occurred frequently in nuclear genes that have functions in mitochondria. The mitochondrial structure, the level of ATP production, and the expression of some key genes involved in mitochondrial function were dysregulated after knocking down the expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2, the key genes encoding the enzyme responsible for RNA editing. When investigating dynamic changes of RNA editing during brain development, an amino-acid-changing RNA editing site (I234/V) in MFN1, a mediator of mitochondrial fusion, was identified to be significantly correlated with age, and could influence the function of MFN1. When studying transcriptomes of brain disorder, we found that dysregulated RNA editing sites in autism were also enriched within genes having mitochondrial functions. These data indicated that RNA editing had a significant function in mitochondria via their influence on nuclear genes. (C) 2017 Science China Press.

This paper proposes a new estimation procedure based on composite quantile regression (CQR) for linear regression models with nonignorable missing data, that is applicable even with high-dimensional covariates. A parametric model is assumed for modelling response probability, which is estimated by the empirical likelihood approach. Local identifiability of the proposed strategy is guaranteed on the basis of an instrumental variable approach. A set of data-based adaptive weights constructed via an empirical likelihood method is used to weight CQR functions. The proposed method is resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response. An adaptive penalisation method for variable selection is proposed to achieve sparsity with high-dimensional covariates. Limiting distributions of the proposed estimators are derived. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies. An application to the ACTG 175 data is analysed.

Here, we developed a new method, Cross-Value Association Analysis (CVAA), which overcomes the limitation and is more robust to heterogeneous data than the other methods. Applying CVAA to a more complex pan-cancer dataset containing 5,540 transcriptomes discovered numerous new DEGs and many previously rarely explored pathways/processes; some of them were validated, both in vitro and in vivo, to be crucial in tumorigenesis, e.g., alcohol metabolism (ADH1B), chromosome remodeling (NCAPH) and complement system (Adipsin). Together, we present a sharper tool to navigate large-scale expression data and gain new mechanistic insights into tumorigenesis.

Our data indicate that morphological differences between ostracods increase with their taxonomic distance. Cluster analyses of ostracod specimens based on Canberra dissimilarity are able to discriminate different species and concur with existing classifications. We suggest that the dimensions of body structures are taxonomically valuable, and that ostracod species identification can be assisted based on the dimensional data of body structures. Species discrimination with such a method does not rely on explicit morphological hiatuses, such as the presence/absence of particular setae, but instead utilizes measurable morphological differences. Our numerical methods also show good potential for studying phenotypic diversity. Analyses on ostracod populations from isolated temporary pools and those from permanent but geographically distant habitats indicate that dispersal improbability is responsible for the observed morphological differentiation.

In this study, the official Chinese statistical data on inland capture fisheries and aquaculture from the earliest available year of 1949 to the latest year of 2013 were first summarized. Chinese inland fisheries in current status were evaluated by maximum net primary productivity, and their future development was projected from a scientific point of view. As a result, Chinese inland fisheries are already unsustainable and overexploited, and some species have been extirpated or are facing extirpation. Because of the unbalanced, geographic distributions of water resources and human density, inland aquaculture is oversaturated in eastern China, which also suffers from water pollution, species invasions, and fauna reconstruction. To continue to provide freshwater aquatic food for the increasing human population, a precautionary plan, as well as new techniques, are needed, along with an awareness of possible ecological after-effects.

The current view is that psychrophilic enzymes are often characterized by enhanced flexibility at low temperature to obtain higher catalytic efficiency, but the determinant behind this phenomenon is less well known. To shed light on the physicochemical bases for enzyme cold-adaptation, we conducted comparative molecular dynamics simulations on mesophilic proteinase K and its homologous psychrophilic counterpart. Results revealed that psychrophilic proteinase K had increased flexibility in regions near or opposite to active site or substrate-binding pocket. Comparison between the large concerted motions derived from essential dynamics (ED) analyses indicated that the degree of motion and direction of some regions in psychrophilic proteinase K could enlarge the substrate-binding pocket, thereby favoring catalytic efficiency and cold-adaptation. Free-energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations revealed a more "rugged" and complex free-energy landscape (FEL) for psychrophilic proteinase K than that for mesophilic proteinase K, implying that the former had richer conformational diversity. Comparison between the structural properties of the mesophilic and psychrophilic forms of proteinase K during MD simulations showed that the increased flexibility of the psychrophilic form resulted most probably from the reduced number of inter-atomic interactions and increased number of dynamic hydrogen bonds. A refined model of FEL was proposed to explain the effect of water molecules in facilitation of enzyme cold-adaptation.

Diurnal temperature ranges were set at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C with the same daily mean temperature and accumulated growing degree days (GDDa). All measured traits showed obvious DIF and varietal differences except the length of fiber bundle (LFB) and the inter-fiber bundle distance (IFBD). Significant interactions of DIF and cultivar were observed to affect the width of fiber bundle (WFB), the size of fiber cell (SFC), the size of fiber cell cavity (SFCC) and the thickness of fiber cell wall (TFCW). Compared with other DIFs, the number of fiber cells per bundle (NFCB) and WFB increased, but IFBD decreased under DIF 5. However, WFB, TFCW and NFCB all decreased under DIF 10. Under DIF 15 condition, both SFC and SFCC increased. For 'Ariane', IFBD was short under DIF 5, but SFC and SFCC were both large under DIF 10. For ` Argos', IFBD was also short under DIF 5. Under DIF 10, WFB, SFC and TFCW were all small, but IFBD was long. For ` Viking', TFCW was small under DIF 10 but large under DIF 15. All these results suggested a definite influence of DIF on the development of fiber cells in flax, and DIF set at 5 degrees C benefited the number of fiber cells in a bundle but DIF 15 was optimal for the size of fiber cells.

In clinic, SAT is used to treat a variety of diseases; meanwhile, it has dependence and addiction. In order to investigate the pharmacology and addiction mechanisms of SAT as a medicine, in this paper, we have studied the structure of D3R complex protein with SAT, and based on which, using potential mean force with umbrella samplings and the simulated phospholipid bilayer membrane (or POPC bilayer membrane), the molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain free energy changes upon the trajectories for SAT moving along the molecular channels within D3R. The free energy change for SAT transmitting toward the outside of cell along the functional molecular channel within D3R is 83.5kJmol(-1). The change of free energy for SAT to permeate into the POPC bilayer membrane along the protective molecular channel within D3R is 87.7kJmol(-1). Our previous work gave that the free energy for Levo-Benzedrine (RAT) transmitting toward the outside of cell along the functional molecular channel within D3R is 91.4kJmol(-1), while it is 117.7kJmol(-1) for RAT to permeate into the POPC bilayer membrane along the protective molecular channel within D3R. The values of free energy suggest that SAT relatively prefers likely to pass through the functional molecular channel within D3R for increasing the release of dopamine molecules resulting in a variety of functional effects for SAT. The obtained results show that the pharmacology and addiction mechanisms of SAT as a drug are closely related to the molecular dynamics and mechanism for SAT transmitting along molecular channels within D3R.

Soil samples from 12 micro-sites containing a monoculture of A. adenophora plants, mixtures of A. adenophora and different native plant species, and native species alone were studied. We found that the invasion of this weed resulted in a selection of bacteria belonging to phyla Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and the lack of bacteria belonging to phyla Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes, but did not affect significantly the percentage abundances of members of other phyla. A similar bacterial population selection was also observed at genus or subgroup levels. The NO3--N level was an important factor affecting soil bacterial communities and contributed to the dominance of A. adenophora. However, the numbers of total bacterial species, and the diversity and structure of soil bacterial microbiome did not ( P > 0.05) change significantly following invasion by this weed.

In this paper, we relax the normality assumption of random effects in SPRDMM and use a truncated and centred Dirichlet process prior to specify random effects, and present the Bayesian P-spline to approximate the smoothing unknown function. A hybrid algorithm combining the block Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is implemented to sample observations from the posterior distribution. Also, we develop Bayesian case deletion influence measure for SPRDMM based on the phi-divergence and present those computationally feasible formulas. Several simulation studies and a real example are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

The analytical expressions for the average intensity of DHGHs propagation are derived in turbulence atmosphere. As a numerical example, the propagation characteristics of DHGHs in turbulence have been demonstrated graphically. The normalized intensity distributions at different propagation distances are examined in detail. The influences of refractive index structure constant, beams order, wavelength on the propagation of DHGHs in turbulent atmosphere are also studied. It is found that diffraction effects are more obvious when refractive index structure constant and wavelength became larger or beams order and beams radius became smaller. We could keep the propagation distance within which the hollow region will preserve longer through the increase of the beams order n and beams radius a(1).	[Cao, W. G.; Duan, J.; Liu, Y. T.; Yang, H.

In this model, a spherically symmetric system is assumed and the dynamical evolution of the PWN is included. The processes of convection, diffusion, adiabatic loss, radiative loss, and photon-photon pair production are taken into account in the electron's evolution equation, and the processes of synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron self-absorption, and. pair production are included for the. photon's evolution equation. Both coupled equations are simultaneously solved.. The model is applied to explain observed results of the PWN in MSH 15-52. Our results show that the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of both electrons and photons are all a function of distance. The observed photon SED of MSH 15-52 can be well reproduced in this model. With the parameters obtained by fitting the observed SED, the spatial variations of photon index and surface brightness observed in the X-ray band can also be well. reproduced. Moreover, it can be derived that the present-day diffusion coefficient of MSH 15-52 at the termination shock is k(0) = 6.6 x 10(24) cm(2) s(-1), the spatial average has a value of (k) over bar = 1.4 x 10(25) cm(2) s(-1), and the present-day magnetic field at the termination shock has a value of B-0 = 26.6 mu G and the spatial averaged magnetic field is (B) over bar = 14.9 mu G. The spatial changes of the spectral index and surface brightness at different bands are predicted.

In this work, we report a ratiometric fluorescent probe for Zn2+ based on CPNs, which were prepared from AIE fluorophore HDBB molecules with metal ions. The CPNs are composed of HDBB molecules with Tb3+ (named Tb-HDBB-CPNs) which displayed a matrix coordination-induced emission peak at a wavelength of 590 nm, while CPNs formed by HDBB molecules and Zn2+ (named Zn-HDBB-CPNs) showed a distinctive fluorescent property with a blue emission peak wavelength of 470 nm. Based on the cation exchange process of Tb-HDBB-CPNs with Zn2+, a highly selective ratiometric fluorescent probe for the determination of Zn2+ in aqueous solution was developed with a linear range from 0.1 to 60 mu M and a detection limit of 50 nM. Our approach using AIE molecules as organic ligands for the construction of CPNs paves a way toward AIE functionalized materials with ratiometric fluorescence response and will find wide applications in chemical sensing.

Analysis of morphological and physiological traits was performed by measuring the plant callus and fungal growth, plant cells viability, degree of cell oxidation and the scale of contact or its absence as reaction of the fungal endophyte to the presence of the plant callus. Accordingly, endophytic fungal strains (EFS) were classified on scale of invasion into categories (strong - medium - weak invasive), as well as the contact between the two partners (grow into - grow onto - contact - no contact) and the grape cell oxidation degree (normal (no oxidation) - light - moderate - serious).

The problem of protein function prediction can be considered as a multi-label classification problem resulting in protein functional annotations. Nevertheless, biologists prefer to discover the correlations between protein attributes and functions. We introduce a multi-label supervised topic model into protein function prediction and investigate the advantages of this approach. This topic model can not only work out the function probability distributions over protein instances effectively, but also directly provide the words probability distributions over functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to apply a multi-label supervised topic model to the protein function prediction. In this paper, we model a protein as a document and a function label as a topic. First, a set of protein sequences is formalized into a bag of words. Then, we perform inference and estimate the model parameters to predict protein functions. Experimental results on yeast and human datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-label supervised topic model on protein function prediction. Meanwhile, the experiments also show that this multi-label supervised topic model delivers superior results over the compared algorithms. In summary, the method discussed in this paper provides a new efficient approach to protein function prediction and reveals more information about functions.

We tested the hypothesis that Bcl-2 regulates S phase entry through mitochondrial pathways. Existing evidence indicates mitochondrial adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signals in cell survival and cell death, however, the molecular details of how these 2 processes are linked remain unknown. In this study, 2 cell lines stably expressing Bcl-2, 3T3Bcl-2 and C3HBcl-2, and vector-alone PB controls were arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase by serum starvation and contact inhibition, and ATP and ROS were measured during re-stimulation of cell cycle entry. Both ATP and ROS levels were decreased in G(0)/G(1) arrested cells compared with normal growing cells. In addition, ROS levels were significant lower in synchronized Bcl-2 cells than those in PB controls. After re-stimulation, ATP levels increased with time, reaching peak value 1-3hours ahead of S phase entry for both Bcl-2 cells and PB controls. Consistent with 2hours of S phase delay, Bcl-2 cells reached ATP peaks 2hours later than PB control, which suggests a rise in ATP levels is required for S phase entry. To examine the role of ATP and ROS in cell cycle regulation, ATP and ROS level were changed. We observed that elevation of ATP accelerated cell cycle progression in both PB and Bcl-2 cells, and decrease of ATP and ROS to the level equivalent to Bcl-2 cells delayed S phase entry in PB cells. Our results support the hypothesis that Bcl-2 protein regulates mitochondrial metabolism to produce less ATP and ROS, which contributes to S phase entry delay in Bcl-2 cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanistic basis for understanding the link between mitochondrial metabolism and tumor-suppressive function of Bcl-2.

The physical system employed contains a friction coefficient that is speed-dependent. Within the tailored parameter regime, the absolute negative mobility, in which a particle can travel in the direction opposite to a constant applied force, is observed. This behavior is robust and can be maximized at two regimes upon variation of the characteristic factor of friction coefficient. Further analysis reveals that this uphill motion is subdiffusion in terms of localization (diffusion coefficient with the form D (t) similar to t(-1) at long times). We also have observed the non-trivially anomalous subdiffusion which is significantly deviated from the localization; whereas most of the downhill motion evolves chaotically, with the normal diffusion.

This genus is distributed exclusively in the Old World, and is rich in species in the tropical and subtropical areas of the Oriental, Australasian, and Afrotropical regions. In this paper, a new species group, the trilobita group, is established for six new species discovered from the Oriental region. The delimitation of these species is firstly performed in light of morphology and further with the aid of DNA sequences of the mitochondrial COI and COII ( cytochrome c oxydase, subunits I and II, respectively) genes, considering also their respective geographical origins. Then, the new species ( trilobita Yang & Gao, sp.n., heterochroma Yang & Gao, sp.n., flatosternata Yang & Gao, sp. n., borneoensis Yang & Gao, sp. n., javaensis Yang & Gao, sp. n., and sumatraensis Yang & Gao, sp. n.) are described, and a key, based on not only morphological but also molecular information, is provided.

DISCERNING THE GAMMA-RAY-EMITTING REGION IN THE FLAT SPECTRUM RADIO QUASARS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						galaxies: jets; quasars: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	SPACE-TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LARGE-AREA TELESCOPE; BROAD-LINE REGION; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; HOST-GALAXY STARLIGHT; HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; AGN DUSTY TORI; 3C 454.3; LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP	A model-dependent method is proposed to determine the location of the gamma-ray-emitting region for a given flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In the model, the extra-relativistic electrons are injected at the base of the jet and non-thermal photons are produced by both synchrotron radiation and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering in the energy dissipation region. The target photons dominating IC scattering originate from both synchrotron photons and external ambient photon fields, and the energy density of external radiation field is a function of the distance between the position of the dissipation region and a central supermassive black hole, and their spectra are seen in the comoving frame. Moreover, the energy dissipation region could be determined by the model parameter through reproducing the gamma-ray spectra. Such a model is applied to reproduce the quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength observed data for 36 FSRQs. In order to define the width of the broad-line region (BLR) shell and dusty molecular torus (MT) shell, a simple numerical constraint is used to determine the outer boundary of the BLR and dusty MT. Our results show that (1) the gamma-ray-emitting regions are located at the range from 0.1 to 10 pc; (2) the gamma-ray-emitting regions are located outside the BLRs and within the dusty molecular tori; and (3) the gamma-ray-emitting regions are located closer to the dusty MT ranges than the BLRs. Therefore, it may be concluded that direct evidence for the far site scenario could be obtained on the basis of the model results.	[Zheng, Y.

However, root rot hampers the sustainable development of planting for P. notoginseng. Root rot always occurs in the presence of pathogenic microbes. Endophytic microorganisms, residing in the living tissues of the host plant and forming complex relationships with the host, are found in every plant on the earth. The chemical investigation focused on Aspergillus has led to the diverse classes of active compounds. This research was a part of our ongoing search for naturally occurring anti-phytopathogen products from endophytic fungi associated with P. notoginseng. Methods: The fermentation broth and mycelia were extracted with EtOAc and MeOH to give crude residues. The extracts were subjected to column chromatography over macroporous resin, silica gel, and Sephadex LH-20 to produce 7 compounds. The structures were determined based on a combination of 1 D and 2 D NMR and mass spectral data. Results: Three acyclic isoprenoids (1-3) together with other compounds were isolated from Aspergillus sp., and their structures were determined as (R)-4,8-dimethylnon-3E-en-1,7,8-triol (1), (R)-10,11-dihydroxyfarnesol (2), canangalias A (3), ergosterol peroxide (4), microperfuranone (5), veratic acid (6), and sterigmatocystin (7). The acyclic isoprenoid was rarely found in the metabolites of Aspergillus. Compound 1 was a new compound, 2 was isolated from the natural source for the first time. Anti-phytopathogenic activities of these compounds were also evaluated. Conclusion: One new isoprenoid, a first isolate, and five known constituents were found in this fungus. Some compounds showed anti-phytopathogenic activities.

While most available clinical approaches, such as chemical and radiation therapies, will kill the majority of cancer cells, they do not kill them all. Some resisting cells, like CSCs, are able to survive due to their excellent self-maintaining capabilities, even in challenging environments. In the present study, we investigated the mRNA level of DNA repair genes of colon CSCs from the HT29 cell line in response to single-strand damage and double-strand breaks, as well as the evident upregulation of key genes in base excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous end-joining, and homologous recombination pathways in these cells. Digital gene expression analysis identified upregulated genes in CD44(+) HT29 cells that may play important roles in DNA repair. Our results reveal that colon CSCs bear efficient DNA repair abilities, which might explain the survival of colon CSCs after repeated chemical and radiation therapy.

Using Bayesian penalized splines to approximate the unspecified baseline hazard function and combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we propose a Bayesian Lasso (BLasso) method to simultaneously estimate unknown parameters and select important covariates in SJMLS. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed techniques. An example from the International BreastCancer Study Group (IBCSG) is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

Each BSCW microcosm involved a treatment zone and another post-treatment zone with a surface area ratio of 2:1. Evenly mixed straws of carnation and rose (w/w: 1/1), two common ornamental flowers, were supplemented as an organic carbon source into the treatment zone through a hydrolysis zone (CW 1), decentralized vertically installed perforated pipes (CW 2), and centralized pipes (CW 3 in the figures), except the blank system. Removals and transformations of nitrogen and sulfate as well as carbon release in the BSCWs were investigated and comparatively assessed. Results showed that the supplements of flower straws could greatly enhance both the nitrate and sulfate removals, and good performance was achieved during the beginning operation period of 30 days, followed by decline due to insufficient organic carbon supply. Nitrate removal efficiency was significantly higher and more stable compared to sulfate. The highest removal rates of nitrate and sulfate were achieved in the CW 3, with a mean value of 4.33 g NO3 (-)-N center dot m(-2) d(-1) and 2.74 g SO4 (2-)-S center dot m(-2) d(-1), respectively, although the differences among the experimental microcosms were not statistically significant. However, almost the same TN removal rate (3.40-3.47 g N center dot m(-2) d(-1)) was obtained due to the productions of NO2 (-)-N and NH4 (+)-N and leaching of organic N from the straws. High contents of organic carbon and colored substance were leached from the straws during the initial 10 days, but dropped rapidly to low levels, and could hardly determined after 30 days operation. The post-treatment zone could further eliminate various contaminants, but the capability was limited. Inorganic carbon (IC) concentration was detected to be a highly good indicator for the estimation of nitrate and sulfate removal efficiencies of the BSCWs, particularly for nitrate.

Parameter estimation in QR with missing data is one of the most challenging issues in statistics. Regression quantiles can be substantially biased when observations are subject to missingness. We study several inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators for parameters in QR when covariates or responses are subject to missing not at random. Maximum likelihood and semiparametric likelihood methods are employed to estimate the respondent probability function. To achieve nice efficiency properties, we develop an empirical likelihood (EL) approach to QR with the auxiliary information from the calibration constraints. The proposed methods are less sensitive to misspecified missing mechanisms. Asymptotic properties of the proposed IPW estimators are shown under general settings. The efficiency gain of EL-based IPW estimator is quantified theoretically. Simulation studies and a data set on the work limitation of injured workers from Canada are used to illustrated our proposed methodologies.

With the changing of metal centers, these complexes show distinct structures: a mononuclear 2D 4(4)-sql network for 1, a 3D 6,6-connected-type topology for 2 and a novel dinuclear 2D layer for 3. These diverse architectures prove that coordination geometry of metal ions, coordination modes of carboxylate groups and the rotationally flexible CH2 linker played significant roles in the construction of CPs; moreover, they also indicated that H(3)CbdcpCl is an ideal organic candidate for the building of novel structures. The solid-state luminescent properties of complexes 1-3 were investigated, respectively. In addition, the magnetic properties of 2 and 3 were studied and both of them exhibit antiferromagnetic behaviors.

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain KC 266(T) represented a novel lineage within the genus Kibdelosporangium and showed highest 16S rRNA gene similarities to Kibdelosporangium philippinense (98.5 %), Kibdelosporangium aridum subsp. largum (98.2 %), Kibdelosporangium aridum subsp. aridum (98.2 %) and Kibdelosporangium phytohabitans (98.0 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain KC 266(T) and the four species of the genus Kibdelosporangium was less than 60 %. The DNA G+C content of strain KC 266(T) was 67.9 mol%. The quinone system consisted of major amounts of MK-9(H-4) and MK-9(H-2), minor amounts of MK-8(H-2) and traces of MK-10(H-4). The diamino acid of the peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, two unknown phospholipids and one unidentified aminophospholipid. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-16 : 0, C-17 : 1 omega 6c, iso-C-15 : 0 and iso-C-14 : 0. Physiological traits as well as unique traits of the polar lipid profile and the fatty acid pattern distinguished strain KC 266(T) from the most closely related species. All these results indicate that strain KC 266(T) represents a novel species of the genus Kibdelosporangium, for which the name Kibdelosporangium metalli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KC 266(T) (= KCTC 39719(T) = CCTCC AA 2016002(T)).

To further study the sensitivity of FPSO to the control parameters, this paper proposed a specialmodel of FPSO and analyzed the convergence of FPSO theoretically. This model offered a new view to research the particle trajectory and divided the position sequence of particle into the even and odd subsequences. Bymathematical analysis, the condition of two subsequences convergence was obtained and the related convergent theories and corollaries were proved. Simulations for benchmark functions showed that the convergence behavior of model and experimental results provided a valuable guideline for selecting control parameters.

J	Fang, J; Yu, H; Zhang, L				Fang, Jun; Yu, Huan; Zhang, Li			Numerically modelling the Cygnus Loop as a remnant evolved in an anisotropic cavity	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrodynamics; methods: numerical; ISM: individual objects: Cygnus Loop; ISM: supernova remnants	SUPERNOVA REMNANT; X-RAY; NONTHERMAL EMISSION; ORIGIN; SIMULATION; EXPLOSION; PLASMA; PLUTO; CODE	The morphology of the middle-aged supernova remnant, Cygnus Loop, seen in X-rays, is peculiar, with a blowout in the south region and other irregular features, such as a bump in the west, a limb with a planar morphology in the east and asymmetry between the east and the west shock profiles of the blowout. The detailed process of the formation of the peculiar profile of the shock is still unclear. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for the remnant to revisit its evolution. In the simulations, the progenitor ejects an anisotropic, latitude-dependent wind, and travels in a direction that is not aligned with the symmetry axis of the wind. As a result, a cavity with a fringed structure is produced. The remnant has evolved in the cavity for about 10(4) yr. In the north-east, the shock has first encountered the bow shock, and this part corresponds to the bright north-eastern region. The south blowout is formed due to the shock travelling into the undisturbed wind, and the interaction of the shock with the cavity leads to the other peculiar features of the shock structure. The resulting profile of the remnant is consistent with that indicated in X-rays. It can be concluded that the supernova explosion occurred in the cavity produced by an anisotropic stellar wind experiencing two main phases with different wind velocities.

J	Luo, X; Jedlicka, S; Jellison, K				Luo, Xia; Jedlicka, Sabrina; Jellison, Kristen			Pseudo-Second-Order Calcium-Mediated Cryptosporidium parvum Oocyst Attachment to Environmental Biofilms	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						attachment; biofilms; calcium; Cryptosporidium	BACTERIAL ADHESION; WATERBORNE CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS; EXOPOLYMERIC SUBSTANCES; OUTBREAK; LIGHT; INFECTIONS; GIARDIASIS; DEPOSITION; RETENTION; KINETICS	Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are able to infect a wide range of mammals, including humans, via fecal-oral transmission. The remobilization of biofilm-associated C. parvum oocysts back into the water column by biofilm sloughing or bulk erosion poses a threat to public health and may be responsible for waterborne outbreaks; thus, the investigation of C. parvum attachment mechanisms to biofilms, particularly the physical and chemical factors controlling oocyst attachment to biofilms, is essential to predict the behavior of oocysts in the environment. In our study, biofilms were grown in rotating annular bioreactors using prefiltered stream water (0.2-mu m retention) and rock biofilms (6-mu m retention) until the mean biofilm thickness reached steady state. Oocyst deposition followed a calcium-mediated pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Kinetic parameters (i.e., initial oocyst deposition rate constant and total number of oocysts adhered to biofilms at equilibrium) from the model were then used to evaluate the impact of water conductivity on the attachment of oocysts to biofilms. Oocyst deposition was independent of solution ionic strength; instead, the presence of calcium enhanced oocyst attachment, as demonstrated by deposition tests. Calcium was identified as the predominant factor that bridges the carboxylic functional groups on biofilm and oocyst surfaces to cause attachment. The pseudo-second-order kinetic profile fit all experimental conditions, regardless of water chemistry and/or lighting conditions. IMPORTANCE The cation bridging model in our study provides new insights into the impact of calcium on the attachment of C. parvum oocysts to environmental biofilms. The kinetic parameters derived from the model could be further analyzed to elucidate the behavior of oocysts in commonly encountered complex aquatic systems, which will enable future innovations in parasite detection and treatment technologies to protect public health.

A number of influencing parameters on the Cu(II) transport and separation of Cu(II) from Ni(II) were studied. The results indicate that the mixture of both carriers (TRPO + Acorga M5640) induces antagonistic effects in the SLM system on the transport of Cu(II) and especially the Ni(II). The difference in strength of the antagonistic effect allows the selective separation of copper over nickel from ammoniacal solutions. The metal ions, Cu(II) and Ni(II), were efficiently separated with a factor 16.0 when the following conditions are employed: stirring speed of 1000 rpm in both phases, carrier concentration of (10 vol.% TRPO + 20 vol.% Acorga M5640) in a kerosene based diluent, metal concentrations of 100 mg/L for each of the copper and nickel dissolved in 2.0 mol/L total ammoniacal feed solution, and 50 g/L H2SO4 as a stripping solution. Under the optimal conditions, up to 98.4% of the Cu(II) is transported from the feed phase to the stripping phase within a period of 12 h with a permeation coefficient of 1.21 x 10(-5) m/s. At the same time, less than 6.1% of nickel is transported, suggesting a substantial selectivity in the transport phenomena of both metals. The membrane stability of the SLM system was also evaluated and shown to be satisfactory for at least fourteen runs (7 days of continuous operation). (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Control of maternal RNA translation during oocyte maturation has been extensively investigated and its regulatory mechanisms are well documented. However, translational regulation of maternal RNA in early oogenesis is largely unexplored. In this study, we generated zebrafish zar1 mutants that result in early oocyte apoptosis and fully penetrant male development. Loss of p53 suppresses the apoptosis in zar1 mutants and restores oocyte development. zar1 immature ovaries show upregulation of proteins implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). More importantly, loss of Zar1 causes marked upregulation of zona pellucida (ZP) family proteins, while overexpression of ZP proteins in oocytes causes upregulation of stress-related activating transcription factor 3 (atf3), arguing that tightly controlled translation of ZP proteins is essential for ER homeostasis during early oogenesis. Furthermore, Zar1 binds to ZP gene mRNAs and represses their translation. Together, our results indicate that regulation of translational repression and de-repression are essential for precisely controlling protein expression during early oogenesis.

In the model, a steady gamma-ray injection rate in the source is assumed and the non-linear time-dependent kinematic equations describing the evolution of both electrons and photons are then acquired; these self-consistently involve photon-photon interaction, synchrotron radiation of electron/positron pairs, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron self-absorption. The model is applied to reproduce the multiwavelength spectrum of PKS 1424+240; our results indicate that the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of PKS 1424+240 can be reproduced well in the case of both electron injection and photon injection. The injected electrons mainly influence the SED over radio, optical and X-ray bands and the SED in the high-energy gamma-ray band is determined mainly by automatic photon quenching; in particular, the break form of the spectrum in the energy range >= a few GeV is caused by this. It should be noted that the observed SED from X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be reproduced only through quenching, provided the observed data in the optical band are produced through some other mechanism, e.g. electron synchrotron radiation.

The results of the enzyme recognitions of nine acyl donors evidently demonstrated that the position and number of the C-C double bond in acyl chains profoundly influenced the behavior of the enzyme, which could be attributable to the resonance effect between the double bond and carbonyl group. Further investigations showed that introducing various acyl groups into the polydatin apparently enhanced its pH stability and 1-octanol-water partition coefficient (log P). With regard to the human cervical cancer siHa cell apoptosis by a flow cytometry assay, the lipophilic 6 ''-O-sorboyl-polydatin exhibited improved apoptosis-inducing capability than the parent drug. The presence of the more lipophilic sorboyl chain in the acylated derivative could account for this. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The integration of beta-CD and RGO was responsible for the formation of the monodispersed 2.0 nm Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters. Inspired by the monodisperse, ultrasmall, and pristine properties of the Pd-Pt clusters, the Pd-Pt@beta-CD-RGO nanohybrid displayed enhanced activity for methanol and ethanol oxidation in alkaline media in comparison with the commercial Pd/C catalysts. This facile and simple method is of significance for the preparation of bimetallic nanocatalysts with high catalytic activity on suitable supporting materials.

Magnetic damping and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Pd- buffered [Co/Ni](5) and [Ni/Co](5) multilayers	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							FILMS; DYNAMICS; REVERSAL; DOMAIN	We systematically studied the influence of Pd underlayer on the magnetic properties of perpendicular [Co/Ni](5) and [Ni/Co](5) multilayers by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. We found that the saturated magnetic damping constant alpha(0) increases continuously with increasing the Pd thickness t(Pd), showing no linear correlation with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy constant K-u for both series of samples. As compared to the Co/Ni sample with the same tPd, the Ni/Co film shows lower saturation magnetization, weaker K-u but larger alpha(0), which can be ascribed to the presence of more paramagnetic spins at the Pd/Ni interface due to the weak exchange coupling stiffness between Ni atoms. By analyzing extrinsic damping contributions from magnetic inhomogeneities, two-magnon scattering and spin pumping effects, the intrinsic damping of perpendicular [Ni/Co](5) is quantitatively determined to be 0.023. This study should provide deep understanding and effective control of magnetic damping for designing high performance magnetic memory devices.	[Tang, Minghong; Zhang, Zongzhi; Jin, Q.

Following the injury of hyphae, it can quickly seal the septal pores to reduce the loss of cytoplasm and promote hyphal healing. The Woronin body is also considered a significant factor in efficient pathogenesis in many fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified AoHex1, a homologue of Neurospora crassa Hex1, a main component of the Woronin body in the genome of the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. To study the biological function of the AoHex1 gene, the gene was deleted and its phenotypes assessed. Inactivation of this gene led to the loss of the Woronin body. The Delta AoHex1 strain showed compromised growth rate, conidiation, and anti-stress abilities. Moreover, trap formation was completely absent in the mutant strain, which could no longer capture nematodes. Our results suggest that the Woronin body plays an important role in growth, conidiation, anti-stress, trap formation, and virulence against nematodes in A. oligospora.

We used a combination of AFLP genotyping and farmer surveys to understand the extent, distribution and management of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) diversity in its center of origin in Yunnan Province, China. We found genetic evidence of gene flow in tartary buckwheat throughout the study area, with small but statistically significant regional and village-level components. We also found genetic differentiation by seed color. Although most farmers reported exchanging seed in localized kinship networks, our results imply homogenizing gene flow is occurring. Yi ethnic farmers tend to plant more buckwheat than non-Yi farmers, and we found that in some communities, Yi farmers serve as seed sources for farmers of other ethnicities. Different tartary buckwheat varieties did not have different end uses; rather farmers maintained varietal diversity in order to protect crop yield and quality. Individual farmers' seed exchange practices reflect their ideas about components of seed quality, as well as priorities in protecting buckwheat yield. From the standpoint of genetic resources conservation, the presence of a culturally rich farmer exchange network and hierarchical structuring of tartary buckwheat genetic diversity demonstrates the importance of maintaining an interlinked community of tartary buckwheat farmers in Yunnan.

In this article, we propose a nonparametric imputation method based on the propensity score in a general class of semi parametric models for nonignorable missing data. Compared with the existing imputation methods, the proposed imputation method is more flexible as it does not require any model specification for the propensity score but rather a general parametric model involving an unknown parameter which can be estimated consistently. To obtain a consistent estimator of the parametric propensity score, two approaches are proposed. One is based on a validation sample. The other is a semi-empirical likelihood (SEL) method. By incorporating auxiliary information from some calibration conditions under the MNAR assumption, we gain significant efficiency with the SEL-based estimator. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators based on either known or estimated propensity scores. Our empirical studies show that that the resultant estimator is robust against the misspecified response model. Simulation studies and data analysis are provided to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.

J	Wu, J; Zha, JL; Zhao, DM				Wu, Jian; Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming			Evaluating the effects of land use and cover change on the decrease of surface wind speed over China in recent 30 years using a statistical downscaling method	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Surface wind speed; Statistical downscaling method; Pressure-gradient force; LUCC	ASIAN WINTER MONSOON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GCM OUTPUT; BILINEAR INTERPOLATION; FORECAST SKILL; TRENDS; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; SENSITIVITY	The long-term decrease of surface wind speed (SWS) has been revealed by previous studies in China in recent decades, but the reasons for the SWS decrease remain uncertain. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of land use and cover change (LUCC) on the SWS decrease during 1980-2011 over the Eastern China Plain (ECP) region using a combined method of statistical downscaling and observation minus reanalysis data, which was used to improve the climate prediction of general circulation models and to evaluate the influence of LUCC on climate change. To exclude the potential influence of LUCC on SWS observation, a statistical downscaling model (SDM) was established during 1980-1992 because a lower extent of LUCC occurred during this period than in later periods. The skill of the SDM was checked by comparing the results of different predictor combinations. Then, SDM was used to improve the wind speed data at 10 m above the surface in the ERA-Interim reanalysis data (V10m-ERA) during 1993-2011, which decreased the error in the reanalysis wind speed as far as possible. Then, the difference between the station observed SWS (V10m-OBV) and the downscaled SWS (V10m-SDM) during 1993-2011 (SWSD) was considered the quantitative estimation of the influence of the LUCC on SWS in this period. The V10m-SDM can capture both the large-scale and local characteristics in the observation, and their patterns are very similar. V10m-SDM has better performance in the spatial-temporal changes than does V10m-ERA with respect to V10m-OBV. The impact of LUCC on the SWS was pronounced, the SWSD was -0.24 m s(-1) in 1993, and the SWSD reached -0.56 m s(-1) in 2011. LUCC could induce a 0.17 m s(-1) wind speed decrease per 10 year in the ECP region during 1993-2011. Furthermore, each 10 % rise of the urbanization rate could cause an approximately 0.12 m s(-1) decrease in wind speed. Additionally, pressure-gradient force was eliminated as the primary cause of the observed long-term decrease of SWS in ECP by composite analysis and temporal serial analysis, and the rise of the surface drag force caused by LUCC was identified as an important factor inducing the SWS decrease during 1993-2011 in ECP region. Moreover, the results from different time lengths used to construct SDM were compared, and the uncertainties in SWSD were evaluated by different SDMs established by different time periods.

Nanostructure studies and electrochemical performances of the as-prepared samples were systematically investigated. The crystalline structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical properties of the CeO2 electrode, the GO electrode, and the nanocomposites electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated GO (at the mole ratio of CeO2/GO = 1:4) electrode exhibited excellent supercapacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 382.94 F/g at the current density of 3.0 A/g. These superior electrochemical features demonstrate that the CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated GO is a promising material for next-generation supercapacitor systems.

We provide several simple practical criteria for identifying strong -tensors. These criteria only depend on the elements of the tensors; therefore, they are easy to be verified. Meanwhile, a sufficient and necessary condition of strong -tensors is obtained. We also propose an algorithm for identifying the strong -tensors based on these criterions.

Gray (Meripilaceae) (GF) is a medical mushroom, and its regulation of the immune system is of interest for the treatment of mood disorders. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole- propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are the central mediator for the treatment of depression. Objective: This study examines the antidepressant effects of GF and the role of AMPA in these antidepressant effects. Materials and methods: The CD-1 mice were fed with GF- or Pleurotus ostreatus [(Jacq.: Fr) Kumm (Pleurotaceae)] (PO)-containing food for 1 day or 5 days. The antidepressant effects was determined in the tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST), and open field test (OFT). The involvement of AMPA receptors was determined by the application of the AMPA-specific blocker GYKI 52466. Results: Treatments with 20%, 33% or 50% of GF-containing food significantly decreased the immobility time (63.6, 56.9, and 52.0% in TST; and 50.8, 43.2, and 38.2% in FST) after 1 day and (62.3, 51.8, and 52.8% in TST; and 49.5, 45.1, and 40.3% in FST) after 5 days. GF-containing food did not cause hyperactive effects in the OFT. The antidepressant effects of the 33% of GF-containing food (down-to 51.3% in 1-day TST and 46.8% in 5-day FST) were significantly stronger than that of the 33% of PO-containing food (down-to 85.5% in 1-day TST and 82.0% in 5-day FST). AMPA-specific blocker GYKI 52466 was able to block the antidepressant effects of the GF-containing food. Conclusion: GF demonstrated the potential as a safe medical food supplement for the patient with depression.

With an appropriate selection of the tuning parameters, we establish the consistency and the oracle property of the regularized estimators.

It is well known that the resulting Bayesian estimations and tests may be sensitive to these assumptions and observations. To this end, a Bayesian local influence procedure is proposed to assess the effect of various perturbations to the individual observations, priors, estimating equations (EEs) and missing data mechanism in general EEs with nonignorable missing data. A perturbation model is introduced to simultaneously characterize various perturbations, and a Bayesian perturbation manifold is constructed to characterize the intrinsic structure of these perturbations. The first- and second-order adjusted local influence measures are developed to quantify the effect of various perturbations. The proposed methods are adopted to systematically investigate the tenability of nonignorable missing mechanism assumption, the sensitivity of the choice of the nonresponse instrumental variable and the sensitivity of EEs assumption, and goodness-of-fit statistics are presented to assess the plausibility of the posited EEs. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methodologies. An example is analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Winter tillage impacts on soil organic carbon, aggregation and CO2 emission in a rainfed vegetable cropping system of the mid-Yunnan plateau, China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Soil organic carbon; Aggregate stability; Soil CO2 emission; Winter tillage	PLASTIC MULCH; MATTER; FRACTIONS; NITROGEN; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; POOLS; OHIO	The mid-Yunnan plateau is one of the major regions for the production of vegetables in China, but intense management practices have led to soil degradation and amplified greenhouse-gas emissions. Understanding management effects on soil organic carbon dynamics and structural stability can aid to improve vegetable cropping systems sustainability in this region. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of seasonal tillage alterations (non-winter-tillage [NWT] and winter-tillage [WT]) on soil (0-10 cm) organic carbon (SOC) retention, soil aggregate stability, aggregate-associated C concentrations and CO2 emission in a clay loam soil. Results indicated after 2 years that the plots under NWT had nearly 4% higher total SOC content and 9% higher proportion of large macro-aggregates (>2 mm) compared with WT plots in the 0-5 cm layer. Greater SOC and labile C within large macro-aggregates in the plots under NWT compared with WT were also observed in the surface layer only. Soil CO2 emission rates were significantly greater in the WT plots than in the NWT plots during the dry season, but did not differ significantly between the WT and NWT plots during the rainy season. Our results demonstrated that the adoption of NWT should be a more sustainable management option than the traditional winter tillage for the maintenance of soil C and reduction of carbon dioxide emission in the rainfed vegetable cropping system of the mid-Yunnan plateau.
