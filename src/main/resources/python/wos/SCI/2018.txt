The research of protein functions is of great significance in decoding the secret of life. In recent years, researchers have introduced multi-label supervised topic model such as Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Labeled-LDA) into protein function prediction, which can obtain more accurate and explanatory prediction. However, the topic-label corresponding way of Labeled-LDA is associating each label (GO term) with a corresponding topic directly, which makes the latent topics to be completely degenerated, and ignores the differences between labels and latent topics.ResultTo achieve more accurate probabilistic modeling of function label, we propose a Partially Function-to-Topic Prediction (PFTP) model for introducing the local topics subset corresponding to each function label. Meanwhile, PFTP not only supports latent topics subset within a given function label but also a background topic corresponding to a fake' function label, which represents common semantic of protein function. Related definitions and the topic modeling process of PFTP are described in this paper. In a 5-fold cross validation experiment on yeast and human datasets, PFTP significantly outperforms five widely adopted methods for protein function prediction. Meanwhile, the impact of model parameters on prediction performance and the latent topics discovered by PFTP are also discussed in this paper.ConclusionAll of the experimental results provide evidence that PFTP is effective and have potential value for predicting protein function. Based on its ability of discovering more-refined latent sub-structure of function label, we can anticipate that PFTP is a potential method to reveal a deeper biological explanation for protein functions.

Here we present an intercontinental survey of Y-chromosome diversity and a comprehensive reconstruction of male-lineage zebu cattle history and diversity patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the zebu Y-chromosome haplotypes in our dataset group within three different lineages: Y3(A), the most predominant and cosmopolitan lineage; Y3(B), only observed in West Africa; and Y3(C), predominant in South and Northeast India. The divergence times estimated for these three Zebu-specific lineages predate domestication. Coalescent demographic models support either de novo domestication of genetically divergent paternal lineages or more complex process including gene flow between wild and domestic animals. Our data suggest export of varied zebu lineages from domestication centres through time. The almost exclusive presence of Y3(A) haplotypes in East Africa is consistent with recent cattle restocking in this area. The cryptic presence of Y3(B) haplotypes in West Africa, found nowhere else, suggests that these haplotypes might represent the oldest zebu lineage introduced to Africa ca. 3,000 B.P. and subsequently replaced in most of the world. The informative ability of Interspersed Multilocus Microsatellites and Y-specific microsatellites to identify genetic structuring in cattle populations is confirmed.

Genome Mining of Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 Isolated From Lichen Affords New Thiopeptide Antibiotic	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						new Streptomyces sp. from lichen; antibacterial activity; genome mining; new thiopeptide antibiotic; berninamycins	TERMINAL AMIDE FORMATION; GENE-CLUSTER; TRONDHEIM FJORD; BERNINAMYCIN; BIOSYNTHESIS; ACTIVATION; METABOLITES; DISCOVERY; SEQUENCE; BINDING	Streptomyces bacteria are recognized as an important source for antibiotics with broad applications in human medicine and animal health. Here, we report the isolation of a new lichen-associating Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 from the tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, China), which displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis. The draft genome sequence of this isolate strain revealed 18 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, which is an unusually low number compared to a typical streptomycete. Inactivation of a (antibiotic dehydrogenase-encoding gene from the BGC presumed to govern biosynthesis of a thiopeptide resulted in the loss of bioactivity. Using comparative HPLC analysis, two peaks in the chromatogram were identified in the extract from the wild-type strain, which were missing in the extract from the mutant. The compounds corresponding to the identified peaks were purified, and structure of one compound was elucidated using NMR. The compound, designated geninthiocin B, showed high similarity to several 35-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides geninthiocin, Val-geninthiocin and berninamycin A. Bioinformatics analysis of the geninthiocin B BGC revealed its close homology to that of berninamycins.

J	Tang, NS; Wang, SJ; Ye, G				Tang, Niansheng; Wang, Songjian; Ye, Gen			A nonparametric Bayesian continual reassessment method in single-agent dose-finding studies	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm; Continual reassessment method; Dirichlet process prior; Dose-finding design; Gibbs sampler; Maximum tolerated dose	DESIGN; INFERENCE	BackgroundThe main purpose of dose-finding studies in Phase I trial is to estimate maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is the maximum test dose that can be assigned with an acceptable level of toxicity. Existing methods developed for single-agent dose-finding assume that the dose-toxicity relationship follows a specific parametric potency curve. This assumption may lead to bias and unsafe dose escalations due to the misspecification of parametric curve.MethodsThis paper relaxes the parametric assumption of dose-toxicity relationship by imposing a Dirichlet process prior on unknown dose-toxicity curve. A hybrid algorithm combining the Gibbs sampler and adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (ARMS) algorithm is developed to estimate the dose-toxicity curve, and a two-stage Bayesian nonparametric adaptive design is presented to estimate MTD.ResultsFor comparison, we consider two classical continual reassessment methods (CRMs) (i.e., logistic and power models). Numerical results show the flexibility of the proposed method for single-agent dose-finding trials, and the proposed method behaves better than two classical CRMs under our considered scenarios.ConclusionsThe proposed dose-finding procedure is model-free and robust, and behaves satisfactorily even in small sample cases.

J	Wang, J; Peng, B; Zhang, XJ				Wang, Jin; Peng, Bo; Zhang, Xuejie			Using a stacked residual LSTM model for sentiment intensity prediction	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Sentiment intensity prediction; Stacked residual LSTM; Neural network; Sentiment analysis	VALENCE; AROUSAL	The sentiment intensity of a text indicates the strength of its association with positive sentiment, which is a continuous real-value between 0 and 1. Compared to polarity classification, predicting sentiment intensities for texts can achieve more fine-grained sentiment analyses. By introducing word embedding techniques, recent studies that use deep neural models have outperformed existing lexicon- and regression-based methods for sentiment intensity prediction. For better performance, a common way of a neural network is to add more layers in order to learn high-level features. However, when the depth increases, the network degrades and becomes more difficult to train. Since the errors between layers will be accumulated, and gradients will be vanished. To address this problem, this paper proposes a stacked residual LSTM model to predict sentiment intensity for a given text. By investigating the performances of shallow and deep architectures, we introduce a residual connection to every few LSTM layers to construct an 8-layer neural network. The residual connection can center layer gradients and propagated errors. Thus it makes the deeper network easier to optimize. This approach enables us to stack more layers of LSTM successfully for this task, which can improve the prediction accuracy of existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-, regression-, and conventional NN-based methods proposed in previous studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Improved Freeze-Thaw Process of a Climate-Vegetation Model: Calibration and Validation Tests in the Source Region of the Yellow River	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						freeze-thaw process; the AVIM model; particle swarm optimization (PSO) method; calibration; validation; source region of the Yellow River	FROZEN SOIL PARAMETERIZATION; LAND-SURFACE MODEL; SIMULTANEOUS HEAT; MASS-TRANSFER; WATER; MOISTURE; SIMULATION; PERMAFROST; COLD; SNOW	The freeze-thaw process significantly impacts land surface processes in permafrost and influences the regional climate. In this study, the freeze-thaw process in the atmosphere-vegetation interaction model (AVIM) was improved by utilizing the universal soil hydrothermal coupling equations, and by introducing the freezing depression point-based freeze-thaw parameterization scheme to form a model known as the AVIM frozen soil model (AVIM_FSM). Then, the seasonal frozen soil observational data at Maqu station, located in the Yellow River source region, were used to calibrate the freeze-thaw-related parameters with an artificial intelligence particle swarm optimization method, and the model was validated. The results indicated that by improving the freeze-thaw process, the temporal variations in soil temperature and liquid water content simulated by the AVIM_FSM model agreed well with the observations. By calibrating the parameters, the deviations between the observations and corresponding simulations were reduced compared with those in the AVIM. Based on the AVIM_FSM, the physical mechanism of the freeze-thaw process was discussed, the different freeze-thaw parameterization schemes were compared, the related freeze-thaw process parameters were quantitatively evaluated, and the following was indicated: (1) the freeze-thaw process was mainly determined by radiation, sensible heat flux, and ice change in frozen soil; (2) the freezing depression point-based freeze-thaw parameterization scheme was superior to the empirical scheme, which can reasonably describe the freezing and thawing start dates with lower deviations; and (3) the particle swarm optimization algorithm can efficiently calibrate the freeze-thaw-related parameters and improve the simulation accuracy.

Conservation tillage can reduce soil evaporation and conserve more soil water in fields, but long-term, mono-conservation tillage may lead to low crop yields. The rotation of conventional tillage with conservation tillage may offset some of the defects generated by the mono-tillage practices of either conventional or conservation tillage, improve crop yields and provide better soil conditions. A long-term tillage rotation experiment (2007-2016) was established to assess the effects of rotating conservation tillage with conventional tillage on soil water and crop productivity in a winter wheat-spring maize rotation field in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, a typical semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau, China. Four tillage treatments were applied over ten years, as follows: ST/CT (subsoiling was performed during the first year then rotated with conventional tillage in the second year), CT/NT (conventional tillage during the first year and then rotated with no-tillage in the second year), NT (no tillage applied in any year) and CT (conventional tillage applied annually). Compared with CT and NT, the CT/NT rotation significantly decreased the soil bulk density and increased the soil porosity in the 0-60 cm soil layer after ten years (P < 0.05). The CT/NT and ST/CT rotations increased the minimum soil temperature during the wheat growth season and decreased the maximum soil temperature during the maize growth season. In fallow periods, the mean soil water storage and soil water content values for the CT/NT rotation were 8.7% and 4.8-10.1% higher than those of the CT treatment, respectively. The CT/NT rotation consumed more soil water during the winter wheat growth season and less soil water during the spring maize growth season compared to the NT and CT treatments. Over ten years, the ST/CT rotation produced higher crop yields (winter wheat: 5231 kg ha(-1), spring maize: 8388 kg ha(-1)), while the CT/NT rotation had a higher WUE (winter wheat: 15.5 kg ha(-1) ST/CT: 20.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) than either NT or CT alone. The CT/NT rotation also had an increased straw yield (mean value: 9952 kg ha(-1)) and economic profit (6776 yuan ha(-1)). Moreover, the CT/NT and ST/CT rotations provided an optimal SOC distribution in the 0-60 cm soil layer. With respect to comprehensive productivity, the CT/NT rotation provided relatively better soil conditions and crop yields during the winter wheat-spring maize rotations. We recommend using the CT/NT rotation as the optimal tillage system for the sustainable production of crops under conditions of semi-arid agricultural production in the Loess Plateau of China.

In their bulk states, only one ester compound with the longest alkyl chains can self-assemble into p6mm columnar phase, all the other compounds are nonmesogens. These polycatenars can form organogels with much more ordered morphologies in polar solvents than in apolar or less polar solvents. in DMF solvent, gels with spherical flower-like morphologies are formed by ester compounds, while gels with nanosheet morphologies are formed by amide compounds. The amide polycatenars can also act as chemosensors for detecting metal ions with high selectivity. The results showed that both the polarities of the linkages and the polarities of the solvents dramatically influenced the creation of supramolecular nanostructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we report three new soil-inhabiting species in Trichoderma, named as T kunmingense, T speciosum and T zeloharzianum. Their colony and mycelia] morphology, including features of asexual states, were described. For each species, their DNA sequences were obtained from three loci, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal DNA, the translation elongation factor 1-alpha encoding gene (tefl) and the gene encoding the second largest nuclear RNA polymerase subunit (rpb2). Our analyses indicated that the three new species showed consistent divergence amongst each other and from other known and closely related species. Amongst the three, T speciosum and T kunmingense belong to the Viride Clade. Specifically, T speciosum is related to three species - T hispanicum, T samuelsii and T junci and is characterised by tree-like conidiophores, generally paired branches, curved terminal branches, spindly to fusiform phialides and subglobose to globose conidia. In contrast, T kunmingense morphologically resembles T asperellum and T yunnanense and is distinguished by its pyramidal conidiophores, ampulliform to tapered phialides, discrete branches and ovoidal, occasionally ellipsoid, smooth-walled conidia.

We have exploited a new catalytic polymerization process and developed the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling enabled synthesis of cross conjugated polymers with readily accessible N-tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. A broad scope of cross-conjugated polymers with good processability and thermal stability has been prepared in high yields using dialkylbiarylphospine-Pd precatalysts. Owing to their unique vinyl structures, these polymers could be easily modified in postpolymerization fashions to impart high degrees of structural complexities. Moreover, these materials were shown to have interesting and tunable optical and conductive properties, featuring their great potentials in a variety of applications.

The geometric and electronic properties of five BDT-M2+ complexes (M = Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Co) have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level with the GAUSSIAN 09 package program. The results show that BDT ligand exhibits alternative behaviors to different metal ions with the binding affinity in the order of Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Pb2+ > Hg2+ > Co2+. After adding the BDT-M2+ complex into the GSH solution, the new S S bonds can be formed, resulting with benzimidazole-metal ions (MBI-M2+) falling off into the GSH solution. Furthermore, the weak interaction between the new glutathione derivative (GSHD) and MBI-M2+ were found. However, the strong chelation was detected between GSHD and MBI-M2+ (M = Cu, Pb, Hg, Co) to hinder the adsorbed Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+, Co2+ completely falling into the GSH solution, which suggests porous silicon composite modified by BDT has a certain selective pre-enrichment of Cd2+ ion.

To address this question, we observed the G9.62+0.19 complex in 850 mu m continuum with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2 polarimeter. An ordered magnetic field has been discovered in its youngest clump, the G9.62 clump. The magnetic field strength is determined to be similar to 1 mG. Magnetic field plays a larger role than turbulence in supporting the clump. However, the G9.62 clump is still unstable against gravitational collapse even if thermal, turbulent, and magnetic field support are taken into account together. The magnetic field segments in the outskirts of the G9.62 clump seem to point toward the clump center, resembling a dragged-in morphology, indicating that the clump is likely undergoing magnetically regulated global collapse. However, the magnetic field in its central region is aligned with the shells of the photodissociation regions and is approximately parallel to the ionization (or shock) front, indicating that the magnetic field therein is likely compressed by the expanding H II regions that formed in the same complex.

An optimal CO2 adsorption capacity was achieved as a lithium nitrate solution with a moderate concentration was used as the doping agent in the modified HKUST-1. The chemical and crystalline structures of the modified HKUST-1 were characterized in detail. It was found that the crystalline structures and morphologies of HKUST-1 were well preserved after lithium doping. Also, the lithium doping did not deteriorate the thermal stability of HKUST-1. Based on the experimental results of CO2 adsorption by in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, a possible mechanism of CO2 adsorption in the lithium doped HKUST-1 was proposed. It is believed that the incorporation of lithium has enhanced the interaction between CO2 molecules and the metal-organic frameworks. As a result, the CO2 adsorption capacity greatly increased. These findings and insights are helpful to the development of high-performance materials for CO2 adsorption in the future.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of infection with Sarcocystis infection in sheep from China.ResultsIn total, 52.51% (335/638) of tissue samples from domestic sheep contained sarcocysts through examination by light microscopy. The organisms were identified as S. tenella and S. arieticanis by molecular assays. Macroscopic S. gigantea and S. medusiformis were not found. The average sarcocysts loading was 18.0729.87 per square centimeter in the myocardium of domestic sheep. Furthermore, two specimens of argali (Ovis ammon) were examined and sarcocysts were found in the myocardium of one animal. According to the sequence of the cox1 gene of sarcocysts from argali, it was speculated as S. tenella.Conclusions We found a high prevalence and parasite load of Sarcocystis in sheep from both central and northwest China. This report is the first to indicate that argali may be a natural intermediate host for S. tenella.

The key problem of multi-focus image fusion is how to determine the focused regions of the source images. As an effective and excellent fusion algorithm, the focused regions in the source images should be preserved as much as possible into the fused image. To accomplish this goal, a novel multi-focus image fusion method based on a focused regions boundary finding and multi-scale transform (MST) is proposed in this paper. The Meanshift algorithm is used to determine the focused regions first. Then, an edge detection method and morphological method are used to find the boundaries of the focused regions in the source images. For the focused boundary regions, the combination of pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) and Gaussian fuzzy method is used to produce the fused boundary region in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. Finally, the fused boundary region and the focused region of the source images are fused directly. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately determine the focused regions, and at the same time, a better fused boundary region can be obtained; this algorithm is superior to conventional methods with respect to both objective quality evaluations and visual inspection.

In this study, we demonstrated that two members of Arabidopsis glutamate-like receptors, AtGLR1.2 and AtGLR1.3, play positive roles in the plant response to cold stress. Genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that exogenous jasmonate could attenuate the cold sensitivity of gir1.2 and glr1.3 mutants, and the overexpression of GLR1.2 or GLR1.3 enhanced cold tolerance by increasing endogenous jasmonate levels under cold stress. In addition, the expression of genes in the CBF/DREB1 signaling pathway was decreased in the glr1.2 and glr1.3 mutants, but was promoted in GLR1.2-OE and GLR1.3-OE transgenic plants compared with the wild-type during cold treatment Further investigation revealed that AtGLR1.2 and AtGLR1.3 independently drove similar functions without directly interacting. Together, our findings suggest that AtGLR1.2 and 1.3 positively enhance cold tolerance in Arabidopsis by activating endogenous jasmonate accumulation and subsequently promoting the downstream CBF/DREBI cold response pathway during cold stress.

However, high climate variability and extreme topography pose a challenge. In such regions, rigorous validation is necessary when using SPPs for hydrological applications. We evaluated the accuracy of three recent SPPs over the upper catchment of the Red River Basin, which is a mountain gorge region of southwest China that experiences a subtropical monsoon climate. The SPPs included the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Algorithm (CMORPH), the Bias-corrected product (CMORPH_CRT), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Climate Data Record (PERSIANN_CDR) products. SPPs were compared with gauge rainfall from 1998 to 2010 at multiple temporal (daily, monthly) and spatial scales (grid, basin). The TRMM 3B42 product showed the best consistency with gauge observations, followed by CMORPH_CRT, and then PERSIANN_CDR. All three SPPs performed poorly when detecting the frequency of non-rain and light rain events (<1 mm); furthermore, they tended to overestimate moderate rainfall (1-25 mm) and underestimate heavy and hard rainfall (>25 mm). GR (Genie Rural) hydrological models were used to evaluate the utility of the three SPPs for daily and monthly streamflow simulation. Under Scenario I (gauge-calibrated parameters), CMORPH_CRT presented the best consistency with observed daily (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, orNSE = 0.73) and monthly (NSE = 0.82) streamflow. Under Scenario II (individual-calibrated parameters), SPP-driven simulations yielded satisfactory performances (NSE >0.63 for daily, NSE >0.79 for monthly); among them, TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT performed better than PERSIANN_CDR. SPP-forced simulations underestimated high flow (18.1-28.0%) and overestimated low flow (18.9-49.4%). TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT show potential for use in hydrological applications over poorly gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins of Southwest China, particularly for monthly time intervals suitable for water resource management.

However, phylogenetic relationships within the genus Panax have remained unclear. In this study, we sequenced the complete plastome of P. stipuleanatus and included previously reported Panax plastomes to better understand the relationships between species and plastome evolution within the genus Panax. The plastome of P. stipuleanatus is 156,069 base pairs (bp) in length, consisting of a pair of inverted repeats (IRs, each 25,887 bp) that divide the plastome into a large single copy region (LSC, 86,126 bp) and a small single copy region (SSC, 8169 bp). The plastome contains 114 unigenes (80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes). Comparative analyses indicated that the plastome gene content and order, as well as the expansion/contraction of the IR regions, are all highly conserved within Panax. No significant positive selection in the plastid protein-coding genes was observed across the eight Panax species, suggesting the Panax plastomes may have undergone a strong purifying selection. Our phylogenomic analyses resulted in a phylogeny with high resolution and supports for Panax. Nine proteincoding genes and 10 non-coding regions presented high sequence divergence, which could be useful for identifying different Panax species.

The existence of distylous species at different elevations can help us investigate their adaptation to high altitudes, the evolution of their morphological characteristics, as well as their responses to limited resources. Here, 17 populations of Primula nivalis at different elevations were evaluated regarding variations in plant morphological characteristics, biomass allocation, and morphological plasticity in a heterogeneous environment. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous environments can affect plant morphological characteristics and resource allocation in each sexual morph of these plants. Moreover, environmental variations reduced morphological plasticity in the two plant morphs, and the plasticity of long style (LS) plants was greater than that of short style (SS) plants. There were significant negative correlations between morphological characteristics and elevation, rainfall, temperature, and sunshine, and these are the main variables that affect morphological characteristics and resource allocation of both morphs of P. nivalis plants in heterogeneous environments. The morphological characteristics of P. nivalis plants transplanted from high to lower elevations were not significantly different in either population. LS plants had greater morphological plasticity and adaptability in heterogeneous environments than SS plants. Elevational gradients and heterogeneous environments differentiated both morphs of P. nivalis plants with regards to morphology as well as adaptations. LS plants showed a higher level of adaptability than SS plants. Copyright (c) 2018 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this study, we used MSAP (methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism) to examine epigenetic variation in Alternanthera philoxeroides, a clonal invasive species, in response to salinity stress. We found that salinity stress could significantly increase the level of epigenetic diversity within a population. This effect increased with increasing stress duration and was specific to particular genotypes. In addition, the epigenetic modification of young plants seems less sensitive to salinity than that of mature plants. This elevated epigenetic diversity in response to environmental stress may compensate for genetic impoverishment and contribute to evolutionary potential in clonal species.

As expected for non-photosynthetic plants, this species has a small plastid genomes of about 74 kb that lacks most of the genes related to photosynthesis. The small single-copy region and inverted repeat regions were contracted into about 4 and 9 kb respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of a data set of five cp genomes indicated that M. sciaphilum is closely related to other species in the family Ericaceae.

The results show that RTZ acts as an effective inhibitor for the corrosion of CRS in 7.0 mol.L-1 H2SO4, and the maximum inhibition efficiency is higher than 95% with a RTZ concentration of 2.0 mmol.L-1. The adsorption of RTZ on CRS surface follows Langmuir isotherm. RTZ effectively retards both cathodic and anodic reactions, and acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. EIS exhibits two capacitive loops, and their resistances increase drastically in the presence of RTZ. SEM and AFM confirm that the addition of RTZ could significantly retard the corrosion of CRS surface. A series of characterizations like FTIR, RS, XRD and XPS reveal that the corrosion CRS surface is composed of the corrosion products of iron sulfates, iron oxides and iron hydroxide, as well as inhibitor. Theoretical results of quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) indicate that the adsorption center of RTZ(+) (organic cationic part of RTZ) mainly relies on its tetrazole ring, and the adsorption of RTZ(+) on Fe (001) surface is in a nearly flat orientation mode.

The structure of the CSP was characterized by IR, SEM, and element analysis. This new material was tested for its potential as a CSP for HPLC under normal phase conditions, especially for conjugated compounds. Six solutes were chosen to evaluate the chiral separation ability of the novel CSP. The effects of the mobile phase and temperature on enantioseparation were studied, and the chiral recognition mechanism was also discussed. The results showed that the space adaptability and pi-pi stacking between the solutes and the CSP affected the retention and enantioseparation. The Van't Hoff curve indicated that under the experimental conditions, the separation mechanism of six solutes did not change, which were all enthalpy driven.

Recursive formulation of Madelung continuity equation leads to propagation equation	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SUGGESTED INTERPRETATION; QUANTUM-THEORY; TERMS	We apply a recursive approach to the continuity equation of the Madelung fluid resulting in a propagation equation for particle probability densities. This propagation equation can be used to propagate particle distributions in the presence of a Madelung pressure field. We show that the derived propagation equation goes over into the guidance equation of the de Broglie-Bohm theory in the limit of well located single particles. As an example, we propagate particles that enter the lower slit of a double-slit experiment, while the Madelung fluid enters both slits. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Heim, D.

Herein, we experimentally investigated how WER (three levels: exchange 0%, 20%, and 40% of total water per day) affects water and sediment properties, and the consequences that these variations have on the individual responses of two submerged macrophytes, Hydrilla verticillata and Myriophyllum aquaticum which were planted in two different sediment types (sand and clay). In the experiment without ramets, it was found that turbidity, pH value, and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration of the system water were statistically unaffected by WER, while water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and sediment oxidation-reduction potential (ORP, in both sediments) consistently increased with increasing WER, regardless of experimental time. In the experiment containing ramets, biomass accumulation and relative growth rate (RGR) of both species gradually increased with increasing WER regardless of sediment type. The mechanisms were related to (a) increased oxygen availability, as indicated by gradually increased water DO concentration and sediment ORP; and (b) enhanced phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) absorbing abilities associated with stimulated root growth, reflected in increased mean root length, specific root length, and the root/above-ground biomass ratio, with increasing WER. Additionally, in the experiments containing ramets, significant linear relationships were consistently detected between sediment ORP and root parameters, root parameters and plant nutrients (N and P), and plant nutrients and plant growth conditions (biomass accumulation and RGR). These results demonstrate that WER plays an important role in determining oxygen availability and thus impacts the growth of submerged macrophytes by altering the ability of roots to absorb nutrients, indicating that ecosystem functions are more sensitive to WER than previously recognized.

The structures of these new compounds were characterized by NMR, HRESIMS, quantum chemical computation, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Compound 1 features a 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-ene core, representing the first example of germacrane-type sesquiterpene dimer fused via a spiro ring system. Compound 2 is a novel sesquiterpene with a completely new carbon skeleton, which is characteristic of an additional carbon attaching to the cadinane backbone via a carbon-carbon bond. Additionally, compounds 2 and 4 exert acceptable cytotoxicity toward normal cells and high selectivity in cancer cells, especially in HepG2 cells.

However, the redox history of the oceans during the following Cryogenian Period (similar to 720-635 Ma) remains poorly constrained. Here, we present a biogeochemical study based on Mo-isotope (this study) and Fe, C, Mo abundance data (previously reported data) for black shales of the similar to 660-Ma Datangpo Formation in the Minle section of the Nanhua Basin, South China. Iron speciation data indicate that the study samples were most likely deposited under euxinic conditions. The studied samples yield two clusters of delta Mo-98 data: +0.98 parts per thousand to +1.14 parts per thousand [+1.06 +/- 0.06 (SD) parts per thousand] and -0.13 parts per thousand to +0.68 parts per thousand ( + 0.65 +/- 0.31 parts per thousand), respectively, with the higher values found mostly in the lowermost black shales. The variably lower delta Mo-98 values probably do not reflect contemporaneous open-ocean seawater composition owing to lower aqueous H2S concentrations caused by substantial watermass restriction (as evidenced by Mo-TOC covariation patterns), whereas the high delta Mo-98 values may record contemporaneous Cryogenian seawater values. The seawater 898Mo values from our study at similar to 660 Ma are similar to previously reported seawater delta Mo-98 values at similar to 750 Ma (+1.11 parts per thousand) and similar to 640Ma (+1.15 parts per thousand), implying the existence of widespread oceanic anoxia throughout the Cryogenian. Because the subsequent Ediacaran Period shows evidence of greater oceanic oxygenation based on multiple geochemical proxies, our findings suggest that the process of oceanic oxygenation proceeded slowly during the Cryogenian Period. This may have been an important factor in delaying the first appearance of metazoans until the late Cryogenian and their diversification until the Ediacaran.\	[Cheng, Meng; Li, Chao; Algeo, Thomas J.; Jin, Cheng-Sheng] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi; Ling, Hong-Fei] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Mineral Deposits Res, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lian; Algeo, Thomas J.] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Algeo, Thomas J.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Feng, Lian-Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Jin, Cheng-Sheng] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China	Li, C (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.	chaoli@cug.edu.cn	Cheng, Meng/J-8404-2017; Cheng, Meng/P-9651-2019; feng, lj/AAJ-4495-2020; Feng, Lianjun/E-4570-2014	Cheng, Meng/0000-0001-7285-2307; Cheng, Meng/0000-0001-7285-2307; Feng, Lianjun/0000-0002-0325-3789	NKRD Program of China [2016YFA0601100]; NSFC-RCUK_NERC Program [41661134048]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (CUG-Wuhan) [1610491T01, G1323531767]; GPMR program [GPMR201705]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41072145, 41703008]	We thank Zi-Hu Zhang, Li-Dan Lei, Na Li, Hai-Yang Wang, Wei Shi, Ting Zhang, Zhi-Fang Hu and Shi-Da Tang for laboratory assistance.

Conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) are two widely used approaches employed in environmental DNA (eDNA) detection, though lack of a comprehensive comparison of them impedes method selection. Here we test detection capacity and false negative rate of both approaches using samples with different expected complexities. We compared cPCR and qPCR to detect invasive, biofouling golden mussels (Limnoperna fortunei), in samples from laboratory aquaria and irrigation channels where this mussel was known to occur in central China. Where applicable, the limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantification (LoQ), detection rate, and false negative rate of each PCR method were tested. Quantitative PCR achieved a lower LoD than cPCR (1 x 10(-7) vs. 10(-6) ng/mu l) and had a higher detection rate for both laboratory (100% vs. 87.9%) and field (68.6% vs. 47.1%) samples. Field water samples could only be quantified at a higher concentration than laboratory aquaria and total genomic DNA, indicating inhibition with environmental samples. The false negative rate was inversely related to the number of sample replicates. Target eDNA concentration was negatively related to distance from sampling sites to the water (and animal) source. Detection capacity difference between cPCR and qPCR for genomic DNA and laboratory aquaria can be translated to field water samples, and the latter should be prioritized in rare species detection. Field environmental samples may involve more complexities-such as inhibitors-than laboratory aquaria samples, requiring more target DNA. Extensive sampling is critical in field applications using either approach to reduce false negatives.

J	Ji, X; Chen, YF; Luo, X; Li, YG				Ji Xuan; Chen Yun-fang; Luo Xian; Li Yun-gang			Study on the Identification Method of Glacier in Mountain Shadows Based on Landsat 8 OLI Image	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						Glacier; Landsat8 OLI; Plateau mountainous area; shadow region	RAYLEIGH-SCATTERING; INVENTORY	Glaciers are extremely sensitive to climate change. And glacier changes have great impacts on the regional climate, ecology, water resources and so on. Remote sensing images are often used to study glacial changes. For plateau mountainous areas, the images usually have a larger area of the mountain shadows. Shadows cause loss or distraction of the information reflected by the ground target, making remote sensing image difficult to understand. Therefore, the identification of glaciers in the mountain shadow area based on remote sensing images becomes a technical difficulty. In this study, a large mountain glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was chosen as experimental subject. Based on Landsat 8 OLI data, this study first analyzed the reflection characteristics of different bands for glacier and non-glacier in shadow area. The results showed that due to the fact that direct light is blocked and target objects in a shadow area are mainly irradiated by the scattered light, the blue band which has shorter wavelength and higher intensity of the scattered light is preferred band for glacier identification in shaded area. For longer wavelength band, the reflectance of ground target in the entire shadow region is very low, and it is difficult to distinguish between glaciers or non-glacial regions. On this basis, a shaded glacier information enhanced index is proposed. Compared with the conventional glacier information extraction methods, the proposed method can give a result to identify the segmentation threshold more clearly in the histogram; and get the best result both in accuracy of the extracted boundary and the total area. For largescale glacier extractionin the plateau mountainous area, it is recommended to use the proposed method which can be helpful in improving the overall work efficiency.

To remove the anisotropic property, a layered structure is developed based on effective medium theory. Simulation results show that with sufficient layers, the performance of the layered transparent device is nearly as perfect as an ideal device, and it is able to protect an antenna without sacrificing its performance. The feasibility of designing a transparent device by using natural isotropic materials instead of metamaterials would dramatically reduce the difficulty of fabrication and further promote the practicality of the device.

In this article, we propose an innovative method, namely the recommendation engine of multilayers (REM), for tensor recommender systems. The proposed method utilizes the structure of a tensor response to integrate information from multiple modes, and creates an additional layer of nested latent factors to accommodate between-subjects dependency. One major advantage is that the proposed method is able to address the "cold-start" issue in the absence of information from new customers, new products or new contexts. Specifically, it provides more effective recommendations through sub-group information. To achieve scalable computation, we develop a new algorithm for the proposed method, which incorporates a maximum block improvement strategy into the cyclic blockwise-coordinate-descent algorithm. In theory, we investigate algorithmic properties for convergence from an arbitrary initial point and local convergence, along with the asymptotic consistency of estimated parameters. Finally, the proposed method is applied in simulations and IRI marketing data with 116 million observations of product sales. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing competitors in the literature.

NOV.; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MENAQUINONES; GEOBACILLUS; TEPIDAMANS; SEQUENCES; DATABASE; MEMBER; ACID	A Gram-stain positive, moderately thermophilic, aerobic, spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterium, designated YIM 73012(T), was isolated from a sediment sample collected from a hot spring located in Tibet, China, and was characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomy approach. The strain is oxidase positive and catalase negative. Growth occurred at 37-65 degrees C (optimum, 45-50 degrees C), at pH 6.0-8.5 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and with 0.5-3.5% NaCl (optimum, 0.5-1.0%, w/v). The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 and C-16:0. The major polar lipids comprised of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The respiratory quinone was MK-7. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 43.6mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain YIM 73012(T) forms a distinct lineage with respect to the genus Anoxybacillus in the family Bacillaceae. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identities the closely related phylogenetic neighbours are Anoxybacillus caldiproteolyticus DSM 15730(T) (96.7%) and Saccharococcus thermophilus DSM 4749(T) (96.6%). Strain YIM 73012(T) was distinguishable from the closely related reference strains by the differences in phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics, and represents a novel species of the genus Anoxybacillus, for which the name Anoxybacillus sp. nov. is proposed. The type species is Anoxybacillus sediminis sp. nov., with the type strain YIM 73012(T) (=KCTC 33884(T)=DSM 103835(T)).

The taxonomic position of the strain YIM CF22(T) is described based on a polyphasic approach. Strain YIM CF22(T) was found to form irregular sporangia on agar media. It contains meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. The major menaquinone was identified as MK-9(H-4); the polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified glycolipids. The whole cell sugars were found to be ribose, mannose, galactose, glucose and xylose. The major cellular fatty acids were found to be (>5%) iso-C-16:0 (43.5%), anteiso-C-17:0 (10.2%), iso-C-15:0 (7.1%), C(17:1)8c (6.3%) and iso H-C-16:1 (5.9%). The G+C content was determined to be 70.8%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain YIM CF22(T) showed high similarity (97.0%) to Actinoplanes rishiriensis NBRC 108556(T). The strain also showed high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Verrucosispora sediminis CGMCC 4.3550(T) (96.9%) and Micromonospora tulbaghiae DSM 45142(T) (96.8%). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM CF22(T) clusters with A. rishiriensis NBRC 108556(T), Actinoplanes globisporus JCM 3186(T) and Actinoplanes rhizophilus NEAU-A-2(T). Based on the differential phenotypic characteristics and the results of DNA-DNA relatedness and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain YIM CF22(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinoplanes, for which the name Actinoplanes deserti sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM CF22(T) (=KCTC 39543(T)=CCTCC AB2018113(T)).

In order to obtain more efficient d-mannitol producer, this study has screened out a stable mutant Penicillium sp. T2-M10 that was isolated from the initial d-mannitol-produced strain Penicillium sp.T2-8 via UV irradiation as well as nitrosoguanidine (NTG) induction. The mutant had a considerable enhancement in yield of d-mannitol based on optimizing fermentation. The production condition was optimized as the PDB medium with 24g/L glucose for 9days. The results showed that the production of d-mannitol from the mutant strain T2-M10 increased 125% in contrast with the parental strain. Meanwhile, the fact that d-mannitol is the main product in the mutant simplified the process of purification. Our finding revealed the potential value of the mutant strain Penicillium sp. T2-M10 to be a d-mannitol-producing strain.

In this Letter, we report the quasi-periodic fast magnetoacoustic waves propagating away from the reconnection region upward across the higher-lying open loops during the reconnection process. On 2012 January 19, reconnection between the higher-lying open loops and lower-lying closed loops took place, and two sets of newly reconnected loops formed. Thereafter, cooling and condensations of coronal plasma occurred in the magnetic dip region of higher-lying open loops. During the reconnection process, disturbances originating from the reconnection region propagate upward across the magnetic dip region of higher-lying loops with the mean speed and mean speed amplitude of 200 and 30 km s(-1), respectively. The mean speed of the propagating disturbances decreases from similar to 230 km s(-1) to similar to 150 km s(-1) during the coronal condensation process, and then increases to similar to 220 km s(-1). This temporal evolution of the mean speed anti-correlates with the light curves of the AIA 131 and 304 A. channels that show the cooling and condensation process of coronal plasma. Furthermore, the propagating disturbances appear quasi-periodically with a peak period of 4 minutes. Our results suggest that the disturbances represent the quasi-periodic fast propagating magnetoacoustic (QFPM) waves originating from the magnetic reconnection between coronal loops.

However, some salt-tolerant bacteria improve the health of plants under saline stress. In this study, 305 bacteria were isolated from paddy soil in Taoyuan, China. Among these, 162 strains were tested for salt-tolerance; 67.3%, 28.4%, and 9.3% of the strains could grow in media with NaCl concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 g/L, respectively. The phylogenic analysis of 74 of these 162 strains indicates that these bacteria belong to Bacillales (72%), Actinomycetales (22%), Rhizobiales (1%), and Oceanospirillales (4%). Among 162 strains, 30 salt-tolerant strains were screened for their plant-growth-promoting activities under axenic conditions at 3, 6, 9, and 12 g/L NaCl; 43%-97% of the strains could improve rice germination energy or germination capacity, while 63%-87% of the strains could increase shoot and root lengths. Among various plant-growth-promoting bacteria, TY0307 was the most effective strain for promoting the growth of rice, even at high salt stress. Its promotor effects were associated with its production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxycarboxylate deaminase, indole acetic acid, and siderophores; induction of proline accumulation; and reduction of the salt-induced malondialdehyde content. These results suggest that several strains isolated from paddy soil could improve rice salt tolerance and may be used in the development of biofertilizer.

The Bi2O3/Bi2O4 photocatalysts were characterized by the various measurements and their photocatalytic performance was assessed by degradation of 17-ethinyl estradiol (EE2). The Bi2O3/Bi2O4 photocatalysts have wider visible light absorption and lower fluorescence emission intensity than the commercial Bi2O3. So, they displayed superior performance in the degradation of EE2. After the adsorption equilibrium of EE2 was reached, the degradation efficiency of Bi2O3/Bi2O4 for EE2 can reach a maximum value of 100% in 12min under the visible-light illumination. Degradation analysis results indicated that both holes (h(+)) and superoxide radical (O-2(-)) can affect the degradation efficiency of EE2.

Therefore, a study on systematic conservation planning for climatic diversity that explicitly or implicitly hypothesizes that regions with higher climatic diversity support greater biodiversity is needed. However, little is known about the extent and generality of this hypothesis. We used the case of Yunnan, southwest China, to quantitatively classify climatic units and modeled 4 climatic diversity indicators, including the variety (VCU), rarity (RCU), endemism (ECU) of climatic units, and a composite index of climatic diversity (CICD). We used 5 schemes that reliably identify priority conservation areas (PCAs) to identify areas with high biodiversity conservation value. We then investigated the spatial relationships between the 4 climatic diversity indicators and the results of the 5 PCA schemes and assessed the representation of climatic diversity within the existing nature reserves. The CICD was the best indicator of areas with high conservation value, followed by ECU and RCU. Contrary to conventional knowledge, VCU was not positively associated with biodiversity conservation value. The rarer or more endemic climatic units tended to have higher reserve coverage than the more common units. However, only 28 units, covering 10.5% of the land in Yunnan, had >17% of their areas protected. In addition to climatic factors, topography and human disturbances also significantly affected the relationship between climatic diversity and biodiversity conservation value. Our results suggest that climatic diversity can be an effective surrogate for establishing a more robust reserve network under climate change in Yunnan. Our study improves understanding of the relationship between climatic diversity and biodiversity and helps build an evidence-based foundation for systematic conservation planning that targets climatic diversity in response to climate change.

Inserting a simple phenyl bridge into the light blue TADF emitter of (6-(trifluoromethyl)benzene-1,2,3,4,5-pentayl)pentakis(9H-carbazole) (5CzPhCF(3)) to dilute the electron-withdrawing capability and reduce D-A interactions, significantly hypsochromicly shifted emission by 48 and 64 nm is observed in 5CzDPhCF(3) with deep blue emission peak at 435 and 431 nm in CH2Cl2 and film, respectively. 5CzDPhCF3 exhibits transient lifetime of 6.9 ns and 0.14 mu s, comparative HOMO of similar to-5.55 eV, whereas higher LUMO of similar to 2.25 eV than similar to 2.56 eV of the control 5CzPhCF(3). The triplet energy and singlet triplet energy gap (Delta E-ST) for 5CzDPhCF(3) is 2.95 and 0.23 eV respectively, higher than 2.80 and 0.02 eV of 5CzPhCF(3). And the photoluminescence quantum yield measured for 5CzDPhCF(3) and 5CzPhCF(3) is 22/27% and 24/43% in toluene at ambient/N-2 atmosphere, respectively. Due to the larger Delta E-ST for less efficient reverse intersystem crossing in 5CzDPhCF(3) for TADF emission, a trade-off between the color purity and electro-luminescent (EL) efficiency can be found. A maximum external quantum efficiency of 2.0 and 9.5% is achieved in the vacuum-deposited TADF devices based on 5CzDPhCF(3) and 5CzPhCF(3) emitter, respectively. And the phenyl-bridged 5CzDPhCF(3) containing device displays pure deep blue EL emission with satisfactory CIE of (0.157, 0.066), while 5CzPhCF(3) only shows light blue emission with CIE of (0.175, 0.327). To the best of our knowledge, the CIE of 5CzDPhCF(3) is among the only few examples on deep blue TADF emission with CIE(y) values < 0.07.

Water extract of indoor dust induces tight junction disruption in normal human corneal epithelial cells	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Corneal epithelial barrier function; Cytotoxicity; Heavy metals; TEER; Human eyes; ZO-1 proteins	BARRIER FUNCTION; HOUSE-DUST; OCULAR SURFACE; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; FLAME RETARDANTS; HUMAN EXPOSURE; RELATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY; POTENTIAL CYTOTOXICITY; INDUCED TOXICITY; AIR-POLLUTION	In corneal epithelium, tight junctions play a vital role in its barrier function. Human cornea is highly susceptible to damage by dust. Continued daily exposure to dust has been associated with increased risks of corneal injury. Studies demonstrated that water extract of dust induced cytotoxicity in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs); however, its effects on corneal epithelial barrier function are unknown. In this study, we determined the concentrations of heavy metals in water extracts of dust, with office dust having higher concentrations of heavy metals than housedust, and Cu and Zn being highest among metals for both dust. Changes in barrier function and its associated mechanism after exposing HCECs to water extracts of dust at 48 mu g/100 mu L for 7 d were evaluated. Water extracts of both dust caused decrease of TEER value (39-73%), down-regulation of gene expression related to tight junction and mucin (0.2-0.8 fold), and loss of ZO-1 immunoreactivity from cellular borders, with office dust having greater potential than housedust to disrupt corneal epithelial barrier function. Our data implied the importance to reduce heavy metals in dust to reduce their adverse impacts on human eyes. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the functional role of DSEs in host plants growing in metal-stressed environments remains to be elucidated. In this study, two DSE strains of Phialophora mustea Neerg. (K36 and Z48) were separately inoculated in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller) seedlings under metal stress conditions (0, 5, 10 mg kg(-1) Cd or 0, 300, 600 mg kg(-1) Zn) to evaluate the effects of DSE inoculation on tomato seedlings in pot cultures. The results showed that DSE colonization increased tomato seedling biomass whether or not there was metal addition. DSE-inoculated tomatoes had a lower Cd and Zn accumulation in both the shoots and roots compared with their respective non-inoculated controls. Under metal stress conditions, DSE inoculation significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), thus relieving the membrane lipid peroxidation damage caused by metal stress, and reduced the leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations more than that of the non-inoculated treatments. The results revealed that DSE enhanced metal tolerance and improved tomato plant growth, both by the reduced metal uptake into root and shoot accumulation and by the enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress induced by excessive metals.

Therefore, identifying the relative strength of these floral visitors driving floral evolution within the population is an important step in predicting the evolutionary trajectory of floral traits. Using supplemental hand pollination and nectar-robbing exclusion treatments, we experimentally identified the relative strengths of legitimate pollinators (that visit flowers through the corolla tube entrance) and nectar robbers (that visit flowers by biting a hole in the corolla tube or using an existing hole) driving floral evolution within the Primula secundiflora population. We also estimated legitimate pollinator- and nectar robber-mediated selection separately for pin and thrum flowers. Both legitimate pollinators and nectar robbers mediated selection on pollination efficiency traits in P. secundiflora population. Legitimate pollinators mediated selection for wider corolla tubes, whereas nectar robbers mediated selection for longer corolla tubes. In addition, nectar robber-mediated selection on corolla tube length marginally varied between the pin and thrum flowers. Nectar robber mediated selection for longer corolla tube length in the pin flowers not in the thrum flowers. These results indicate that legitimate pollinators and nectar robbers within a population can drive differential evolutionary trajectories of floral traits.

This complex was administered intragastrically to alloxan-diabetic mice 3 weeks. In vivo tests showed that the complex significantly lowered serum glucose levels in alloxan-diabetic mice at doses of 77 mg V kg(-1). Meanwhile, this complex was investigated as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The compound exhibit moderate inhibition against DPP-IV and possessed an IC50 value of 30 mu M. Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the inhibition kinetics data demonstrated that it was a noncompetitive inhibitor of DPP-IV and Ki value was 136.3 mu M. Moreover, molecular modeling studies suggested that the complex could fit well within the active-site cleft of DPP-IV. An acute toxicity study showed that animals treated intragastically with complex 1 at a dose of 5.0 g/kg did not show any significantly abnormal signs. These preliminary results suggest that the manganese Schiff base complex can induce a hypoglycemic effect in alloxan-diabetic mice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

Oxygen and water were used as green oxidant and solvent, respectively. The catalysts were characterized in depth by XRD, H-2-TPR, O-2-TPD, UV-Vis DRS, XPS and TEM, to reveal materials properties from bulk to surface. The influence of Mn/Ce molar ratios in support materials and reaction parameters (i.e., HMF/Ru ratio, O-2 pressure, reaction temperature and time) was systematically studied and optimized. The reaction route and rate-determining step for oxidation of HMF to FDCA over the Ru/Mn(x)Ce(1)Oy catalysts were investigated by kinetic analysis. Well-dispersed metallic Ru nanoparticles with a mean size of 4.4 nm deposited on the support were found essential to activate and oxidize the HMF molecule. The Mn/Ce molar ratio was found to affect not only conversion of HMF but also distribution of products. The Ru/Mn6Ce1Oy catalyst demonstrated an exceptional yield (>= 99%) of FDCA, which corresponds in our conditions to one of the best productivity (5.3 mol(FDCA).mol(Ru)(-1.)h(-1)) ever reported in literature. The superior activity of the Ru/Mn6Ce1Oy catalyst was mainly associated with (i) the strong metal-support interaction and (ii) the synergistic effect between manganese and cerium oxides. This catalyst showed the highest surface concentrations in Me and Ce3+ among the series, which, as a consequence, enhanced the availability and mobility of active oxygen species.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach to modeling trustworthiness requirement-oriented software processes. First, based on the aspect-oriented modeling techniques, separation of concerns is used to separate the crosscutting activities and the core activities according to the different trustworthiness requirements and functional requirements. A goal-oriented modeling and reasoning method for trustworthiness requirements to find the crosscutting activities that satisfy multiple trustworthiness requirements is presented. Then, base processes are modeled for functional requirements. The crosscutting activities for trustworthiness requirements are decomposed into processes or tasks and encapsulated in aspects that are woven into the base processes. In the weaving procedure, correct weaving methods between multiple aspects and between aspects and base processes are designed. Errors or mistakes of aspect-oriented process modeling are prevented. Finally, trustworthy third-party certification authority software is studied systematically in a case study, and performance evaluations are conducted to show the cost and effect of the approach.

Herein, we analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) alternations in the testes of the sterile triploid fish produced by crossing the tetraploid fish with the diploid fish, compared with those of tetraploids and diploids used as the controls. A total of 136, 134, and 142 conserved miRNAs and 105, 112, and 119 novel miRNAs were identified in the diploid, triploid, and tetraploid fish, respectively. The genes targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified and were enriched in the GO term cell surface receptor signaling pathway, cellular process, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, and metabolic process. KEGG pathway enrichment was also assessed to evaluate the target genes with differentially expressed miRNAs and these genes were enriched in four pathways (synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, cyanoamino acid metabolic process, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism). Nine differentially expressed miRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qPCR). The upregulated miRNAs in triploids, including miR-101a, miR-199-5p, miR-214, miR-222, and miR-193a, showed the same results with high-throughput sequencing. Among the selected downregulated miRNAs, miR-7b and miR-153b had significantly lower expression levels in triploids. Dnah3 and Tekt1 genes targeted by miR-199-5p showed lower expression in triploids by qPCR. These verified differentially expressed miRNAs may participate in testicular development and sperm activity by targeting functional genes, which were identified with differential expression in the triploid. This evidence provides insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of sterility in triploid cyprinids.

Through Krasnosel'skii's fixed point theorem, some sufficient conditions for the existence of local-periodic solutions for FDEID are established for the first time. This research indicates that one can extract a local-periodic solution for dynamic equations on an arbitrary time scale with a bounded graininess function mu through some index function.

Computational modelling and in-situ ultraviolet-visible spectra confirm that Cu cathode experiences a two-electrons redox reaction: Cu <-> Cu2+ + 2e. during charge/discharge process. By using onedimensional (1D) nano-structure design and surface modification strategy, the Cu cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 635 mAh/gCu with a high output voltage of 3.61 V and affords a superior rate capability. With Li4Ti5O12 as anode, a Cu/Li4Ti5O12 full cell exhibits a discharge capacity of 601 mAh/g(Cu) and an energy density of 1202 Wh/kg(Cu). The strategy of using metallic Cu as cathode in lithium-ion batteries is quite simple and broadly applicable, which may provide new opportunities for many other non-aqueous rechargeable batteries.

Although the impacts of polyploidization on photosynthesis have been examined in several genera, comparatively little is known about the photosynthetic responses to polyploidy in Lilium. In this study, diploid and colchicine-induced tetraploid Lilium FO hybrids were used to study the effects of polyploidization on cellular, photochemical and photosynthetic characteristics in Miura. Polyploidization caused a significant change in leaf anatomical structure, chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic pigment contents. Thicker epidermal and spongy tissue, more and thicker thylakoid lamellae and higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were observed in the tetraploid than in the diploid. More regularly and tightly arranged thylakoids were closely associated with more efficient light-harvesting machinery. And the tetraploid plants showed a higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pm.) than the diploid plants, under both natural conditions and gradients of light intensity/CO2 concentration. In addition, the tetraploid had a significantly higher light saturation point (LSP), but a lower light compensation point (LCP) than the diploid, indicating that tetraploid plants acquired light energy more efficiently. These results suggested that cellular and photochemical alterations caused by polyploidization improve the capacity for light absorption and conversion and further enhanced the photosynthetic performance in Lilium FO hybrids.

To understand the cellular effect of lysosome damage, we screened natural small-molecule compounds that induce lysosomal abnormality using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model system. A group of vobasinyl-ibogan type bisindole alkaloids (ervachinines A-D) were identified that caused lysosome enlargement in C. elegans macrophage-like cells. Intriguingly, these compounds triggered cell death in the germ line independently of the canonical apoptosis pathway. In mammalian cells, ervachinines A-D induced lysosomal enlargement and damage, leading to leakage of cathepsin proteases, inhibition of autophagosome degradation and necrotic cell death. Further analysis revealed that this ervachinine-induced lysosome damage and lysosomal cell death depended on STAT3 signaling, but not RIP1 or RIP3 signaling. These findings suggest that lysosome-damaging compounds are promising reagents for dissecting signaling mechanisms underlying lysosome homeostasis and lysosome-related human disorders.

However, although it is known that this Neolithic civilization collapsed at around 4.2 cal. kyr BP, the reason behind the collapse remains controversial. A sedimentary core (MD06-3040) collected from the inner shelf of the East China Sea, off the southeast coast of China, provides an excellent insight into estimate the Holocene regional paleoenvironment, including the alkenone based sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric temperature (AT), and paleoproductivity. Extraordinarily severe abrupt cold episodes (i.e., 3-4 degrees C drop in SST) occurred frequently in the Yangtze delta region during 4.4-3.8 cal. kyr BR These episodes could have been related to the global climatic transition called the "4.2 ka event", when the East Asian monsoon hydrological regime might have been altered.

Such changes would affect the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetic products, which would subsequently affect the yield during hybrid rice seed production. In this study, photosynthetic physiological characteristics and the distribution of photosynthetic products were evaluated in a field experiment. The transport of panicle photosynthetic products to grain was demonstrated using a C-14 isotope tracer technique. The contribution ratios of the panicle and leaf to yield in the hybrid rice seed production were 32.3 and 42.1%, respectively. Through isotope tracing technology, it was determined that about 90% of the photosynthetic products of the panicle and 50% of those of the leaf were delivered to the panicle. During the filling period, the contribution of panicle to yield was concentrated in the early period (0-10 days after pollination), and the contribution of leaf to yield was more significant in the late period (10 days after pollination to maturity). These results suggest that the panicle makes an important photosynthetic contribution (equivalent to that of the flag leaf) during the process of grain filling, especially at 0-5 days after the heading stage.

All these ore-bearing porphyries share many geochemical characteristics of adakite such as depletion in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), enrichment in Sr and Ba, absence of negative Eu anomalies, high SiO2, Al2O3, Sr/Y, La/Yb and low Y, Yb contents. They also exhibit affinities of potassic rocks, e.g., alkali-rich, high K2O/Na2O ratios and enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs). Their Sr-Nd isotopic ratios are similar to coeval shoshonitic lamprophyres. Geochemical data indicate that they were probably produced by partial melting of newly underplated potassic rocks sourced from a modified and enriched lithospheric mantle. These underplated rocks have elevated oxygen fugacity, water and copper contents, with high metallogenic potential. We propose that all the studied potassic rocks were emplaced in a post-collisional setting, associated with the local removal of lithospheric mantle.

Here, we used a cryo-EM analysis to reveal the near-native morphology of two nucleocapsid-containing model bracoviruses: Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV) and Microplitis mediator bracovirus (MmBV). MbBV and MmBV nucleocapsids have discernable cap structures in two distal regions with relatively high electron density. Adjacent to the end-cap structures are two electron-lucent rings. Some nucleocapsids were uniformly electron-dense and had a distinctive helix-tail-like structure. Cryo-EM revealed inconsistent nucleocapsid diameters of 34-69.9nm in MbBV and 46-69.9nm in MmBV, and the largest observed cylindrical area length was expanded to 126nm.

The estimator of the intercept potentially has a slower than root n convergence rate, which can result in a large estimation error in practice. This paper imposes additional tail restrictions which guarantee the regular identification of the intercept and thus the root n-consistency of its estimator. We then propose an estimator that achieves the root n rate. Last, we extend our tail restrictions to a full-blown model with endogenous regressors.

Spatial-seasonal patterns reveal large-scale atmospheric controls on Asian Monsoon precipitation water isotope ratios	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						oxygen isotope; precipitation; seasonal variation; moisture source; convection; Asian monsoon	SUMMER MONSOON; MOISTURE SOURCES; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; STABLE-ISOTOPES; ICE CORES; DELTA-D; REGION; CHINA; CONVECTION; RESOLUTION	Correlated seasonal variation in precipitation amount and its oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) has long been observed and frequently invoked in the interpretation of paleo-delta O-18 records from the Asian Monsoon (AM) region. However, the underlying cause of the observed seasonal delta O-18 variation is still under debate. Precipitation delta O-18 values show a single, consistent seasonal pattern across the region, with high values in pre-monsoon (late-spring to early-summer) and low values in the monsoon mature (mid- to late summer) periods. We tested three hypotheses that may give rise to the measured precipitation 3180 pattern, involving variation in: 1) local precipitation, 2) moisture sources, and 3) convection in moisture source regions. We show that seasonal precipitation amounts across the AM region exhibit two pattern types: pre-monsoon peak or monsoon mature peak, and thus do not provide a consistent explanation for the isotopic pattern. We test the hypotheses that changing moisture sources or moisture source isotope ratios drive the seasonal isotopic pattern using a combination of Lagrangian moisture source attribution and output from an isotope-enabled General Circulation Model (LMDZ4), but find little seasonal variation in moisture sources; that which does exist is not consistent with the observed isotopic change. Instead, we show that the precipitation delta O-18 transition from pre-monsoon to monsoon mature stage is correlated with intensification of convective activity in moisture source regions, which is the result of monsoon establishment and northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We propose that light water vapor, transferred to the lower-troposphere through downdrafts and evaporation of rain in the vicinity of intense convection, is advected to the AM region and labels precipitation during the monsoon mature period. These results demonstrate that precipitation delta O-18 in the AM region more strongly reflect large-scale atmospheric dynamics than local precipitation amount or moisture source, guiding the interpretation of paleo-isotope data from this region.

In this study, the Mg: Ag binary phase diagram is used to establish an electrode materials selection guide for both bottom- and top-emitting OLEDs. To achieve low turn-on voltage and high efficiency in bottom- emitting OLEDs, it is found that Mg: Ag cathodes must be selected from AgMg3-Mg phase region which provides the best figure of merits in low work function and high optical reflectance. For top-emitting OLEDs, however, Mg: Ag cathodes in the AgMg3-Mg region show large imaginary refractive index, and thus a stacked Mg:Ag/Ag is found essential to achieve optimal device performance. Furthermore, insertion of a thin LiF layer is found to create an effective charge injection cathode. In order to theoretically compute the devices' optical characteristics, a database of complex optical constants of various materials including the metals is obtained by using a spectroscopic ellipsometer. This new database is found essential for accurate device optical design and engineering.

It gives a conservative form extension of the Euler equations without external forces. This paper is concerned with the pressureless flow of the Cargo-LeRoux model. By using a flux perturbation, the solutions with three kinds of structures of the Riemann problem are constructed. The new type of structure simultaneously including delta-shock and vacuum state appears in solution. The Riemann solutions also give an interesting extension of those to the pressureless Euler equations without external forces.

This work proposes a new scheme to fuse computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) images into a single image. A novel two-stage medical image fusion scheme, which is based on non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) and simplified pulse coupled neural networks (S-PCNNs), is proposed in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. Firstly, CT and MRI images are decomposed into a set of low and high frequency coefficients by NSST, PET images are transformed into the HSV color space, and then the V component of PET image in the HSV color space. Secondly, intersecting cortical models (ICMs) are utilized to extract the edges and outlines in a larger area from the high frequency coefficients, and S-PCNNs are employed to describe the subtly detailed information in a smaller area. Thirdly, different fusion rules are designed to fuse the corresponding low and high frequency coefficients.

Different from CaO-CuO-TiO2 system, the co-existence of hexagonal and orthorhombic CdTiO3 phases is observed in the line between CdTiO3 and CuO. Basing on the obtained phase diagram, three typical ceramics with Cu-equal (CdCu3Ti4O12), Cu-rich (Cd0.930Cu3.070Ti4O12), and Cu-poor (Cd1.137Cu2.863Ti4O12), showing high dielectric constant, are chosen as target samples to investigate the role of Cu valence and segregation in dielectric behaviors. Cu3+ ions, rather than Cu+ ones as reported previously, forms in the grain to act as the hopping charge carriers as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and High-energy X-ray absorption Near Edge Structure. This work would give a hint in tuning the stoichiometry for achieving more fascinating structures and properties in new ceramic material design.

J	Zhang, JX; Xie, N; Zhang, XJ; Li, WD				Zhang, Jixian; Xie, Ning; Zhang, Xuejie; Li, Weidong			An online auction mechanism for cloud computing resource allocation and pricing based on user evaluation and cost	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Cloud computing; User evaluation; Truthful online auction mechanism; Multi-requirements; Resource allocation; Dynamic pricing	COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS; WINNER DETERMINATION; FRAMEWORK; DEMANDS	Auction-based virtual resource allocation is a major problem for cloud computing. However, previous studies have typically equated virtual resources with ordinary items and designs corresponding to specific auction mechanisms, which cannot truly reflect the characteristics of the virtual resource. This inability to reflect the virtual resource characteristics arises because the users have only the right to use resources without ownership, the use of virtual resources has significant impacts on the social welfare and revenue of the resource provider, and the virtual resource usage will generate operating costs. Considering the above issues, this work proposes a truthful online auction mechanism based on user evaluation and cost and applies it to the allocation and pricing of cloud computing virtual resources. Based on a pay-as-you-go model, users can submit multiple requirements at any time, but only one requirement can be satisfied, which is known as a multi-requirement, single-minded scenario. We prove that the resource providers can obtain increased social welfare and guarantee that the mechanism is truthful. For the resource allocation problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain the allocation result quickly and to maximize the social welfare of the cloud resource provider. The payment algorithm accounts for the interests of both the users and resource provider based on the dichotomy. We experimentally analyze the solution in terms of social welfare, execution time, resource utilization and users served. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although anatomic and polygenetic evidence suggests that tree shrews are primate-like species, understanding of the structure and function of tree shrew chemokines has only just commenced. In this study, we cloned tree shrew chemokine CXCL8 and its cognate receptors. Predicted three-dimensional (3D) structures showed that binding domains in CXCL8 and CXCR1/2 were highly conserved between tree shrews and humans. We found that the human CXCL8 (hCXCL8) protein induced migration of tree shrew peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed by CXCR1/2 (tsCXCR1/2). Blocking interaction between hCXCL8 and tsCXCR1/2 with allosteric antagonists (reparixin and SB265610) significantly decreased tree shrew PBMC transmigration. Over -expressing tree shrew CXCR1 in human HEK 293 T cells further enhanced cellular in vitro transmigration. Similar to primate species, our findings suggest that CXCL8 and CXCR1/2 constitute a structurally- and functionally-conserved chemotaxis responsible for tree shrew immune activities.

The Serpens filament at the onset of slightly supercritical collapse	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; radio lines: ISM; line: profiles; ISM: kinematics and dynamics	STAR-FORMATION; DARK; CLOUDS; MASS; HERSCHEL; CORES; FRAGMENTATION; PERSEUS; HCN; SIMULATIONS	The Serpens filament, as one of the nearest infrared dark clouds, is regarded as a pristine filament at a very early evolutionary stage of star formation. In order to study its molecular content and dynamical state, we mapped this filament in seven species: (CO)-O-18, HCO+, HNC, HCN, N2H+, CS, and CH3OH. Among them, HCO+, HNC, HCN, and CS show self-absorption, while (CO)-O-18 is most sensitive to the filamentary structure. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that this filament forms a velocity-coherent (trans) sonic structure, a large part of which is one of the most quiescent regions in the Serpens cloud. Widespread (CO)-O-18 depletion is found throughout the Serpens filament. Based on the Herschel dust-derived H-2 column density map, the line mass of the filament is 36-41 M-circle dot pc(-1), and its full width at half maximum is 0.17 +/- 0.01 pc, while its length is approximate to 1.6 pc. The inner radial column density profile of this filament can be well fitted with a Plummer profile with an exponent of 2.2 +/- 0.1, a scale radius of 0.018 +/- 0.003 pc, and a central density of (4.0 +/- 0.8) x 10(4) cm(-3). The Serpens filament appears to be slightly supercritical. The widespread blue-skewed HNC and CS line profiles and HCN hyperfine line anomalies across this filament indicate radial infall in parts of the Serpens filament. (CO)-O-18 velocity gradients also indicate accretion flows along the filament. The velocity and density structures suggest that such accretion flows are likely due to a longitudinal collapse parallel to the filament's long axis. Both the radial infall rate (similar to 72 M-circle dot Myr(-1), inferred from HNC and CS blue-skewed profiles) and the longitudinal accretion rate (similar to 10 M-circle dot Myr(-1), inferred from (CO)-O-18 velocity gradients) along the Serpens filament are lower than all previously reported values in other filaments. This indicates that the Serpens filament lies at an early evolutionary stage when collapse has just begun, or that thermal and nonthermal support are effective in providing support against gravity.

Tomicus beetles are secondary pests in temperate regions and the aggressiveness of the beetles in SW China is considered to be due to the warm subtropical climates as well as the beetles' virulent fungal associates. Here, we assessed the virulence of three blue-stain fungi (Leptographium wushanense, L. sinense and Ophiostoma canum) associated with pine shoot beetles to Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis) in SW China. Following fungal inoculation, we measured necrotic lesion lengths, antioxidant enzyme activities and monoterpene concentrations in the stem phloem of Yunnan pine. Leptographium wushanense induced twice as long lesions as L. sinense and O. canum, and all three fungi induced significantly longer lesions than sterile agar control inoculations. The activity of three tested antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and superoxide dismutase) increased after both fungal inoculation and control inoculation. However, L. wushanense and L. sinense generally caused a greater increase in enzyme activities than O. canum and the control treatment. Fungal inoculation induced stronger increases in six major monoterpenes than the control treatment, but the difference was significant only for some fungus-monoterpene combinations. Overall, our results show that L. wushanense and L. sinense elicit stronger defense responses and thus are more virulent to Yunnan pine than O. canum. The two Leptographium species may thus contribute to the aggressiveness of their beetle vectors and could damage Yunnan pine across SW China if they spread from the restricted geographical area they have been found in so far.

It is found that after inserting a thin IL, the saturated magnetic damping factor alpha(s) drops considerably due to the reduced spin pumping effect. By fitting the curves of alpha(s) versus IL thickness, spin diffusion lengths of Ta and Ru are determined to be 3.07 and 3.59 nm, respectively. Interestingly, for the CoFeB samples with different capping layers of Pt, Ta/Pt, or Ru/Pt, the alpha(s) values exhibit an identical non-monotonic variation tendency alpha(s) annealing temperature (T-a) increases. It first rises to a maximum at Ta similar to 100 degrees C and then decreases, reaching a minimum value (alpha(s) = 0.021-0.011) at T-a similar to 300 degrees C. After that, alpha(s) starts to increase again. Such a complicated variation behavior is attributed to two-magnon scattering contribution, which originates from the change in the CoFeB surface roughness and interfacial atomic intermixing induced by thermal annealing. This study provides a deep understanding and effective control of magnetic damping for practical design of high performance spintronic devices. Published by AIP Publishing.

Four examples including rotating concentrator, rotating amplifying device, rotating shrinking device and rotating transparent device are reported. All of them have bi-functional effects, i.e., they possess concentrating, amplifying, shrinking and transparent effects respectively while have the fields been rotated an angle of pi/N simultaneously in common, where N is the sides number of polygon. All these devices have potential applications, such as energy accumulation or controlling, military camouflage, wireless communication system and radar/antenna protection. Furthermore, alternating isotropic layered structure based on effective medium theory is utilized to remove the anisotropic property of these devices. Simulation results show that the layered structure device behaves almost as perfect as the ideal one when it has sufficient divided layers. The feasibility of designing multifunctional device by natural isotropic materials instead of metamaterials with complicated artificial composite structure would dramatically reduce the fabrication difficulty and move the device a step further towards the practical application.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly deleterious and can substantially impair genome integrity. Homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA DSB repair plays dominant roles in safeguarding oocyte quantity and quality. However, little is known regarding the key players of the HR repair pathway in oocytes. Here, we identified oocyte-specific gene Ooep as a novel key component of the HR repair pathway in mouse oocytes. OOEP was required for efficient ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activation and Rad51 recombinase (RAD51) focal accumulation at DNA DSBs. Ooep null oocytes were defective in DNA DSB repair and prone to apoptosis upon exogenous DNA damage insults. Moreover, Ooep null oocytes exhibited delayed meiotic maturation. Therefore, OOEP played roles in preserving oocyte quantity and quality by maintaining genome stability. Ooep expression decreased with the advance of maternal age, suggesting its involvement in maternal aging.

Despite having high amino acid identity, KRAS and HRAS have very different codon usage biases: the HRAS gene contains many common codons, and KRAS is enriched for rare codons. Rare codons in KRAS suppress its protein expression, which has been shown to affect both normal and cancer biology in mammals. Here, using HRAS or KRAS expression in different human cell lines and in vitro transcription and translation assays, we show that KRAS rare codons inhibit both translation efficiency and transcription and that the contribution of these two processes varies among different cell lines. We observed that codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency such that WT KRAS mRNA is poorly translated. On the other hand, common codons increased transcriptional rates by promoting activating histone modifications and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Finally, we found that codon usage also influences KRAS protein conformation, likely because of its effect on co-translational protein folding. Together, our results reveal that codon usage has multidimensional effects on protein expression, ranging from effects on transcription to protein folding in human cells.

Various organic halides including chlorides can produce good to excellent yields with phenyl-boronic acid and a catalytic amount of Pd(II)@PCA-beta-CD. This hydro-soluble catalyst was capable of being reused for at least eight runs with only a slight loss of catalytic activity. A putative mechanism of the Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle was also explored and calculated by ab initio QM/MM methods.

In this study, a multi-metal-resistant bacterium showing strong Hg(II) volatilization ability, Pseudomonas sp. DC-B1, was isolated from heavy metal-contaminated soils. DC-B1 volatilized 81.1%, 79.2% and 74.3% of the initial Hg(2+)from culture solutions with initial Hg(2+)concentrations of 5.1, 10.4, and 15.7 mg/L, respectively, within 24 h. Microcosm experiments were performed to investigate the remediation of Hg(II)-spiked soils inoculated with DC-B1 coupled with sawdust biochar amendment. The efficiency of Hg removal from two types of soil samples with different properties and an initial Hg(II) content of approximately 100 mg/kg was enhanced 5.7-13.1% by bio-augmentation with inoculation of the bacterial strain DC-B1, 5.4-10.7% by amendment of 4% (w/w) biochar, and 10.7-23.2% by the combination of DC-B1 and biochar amendments over an incubation period of 24 d over the efficiency in the control treatment under flooded conditions. Longer root lengths were observed in lettuce grown in the treated soils than in lettuce from the control soil, confirming the bioremediation efficacy of the two bioagents for soil Hg contamination.

The distribution of microplastics in soil aggregate fractions in southwestern China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Microplastic; Soil aggregate fractions; Plastic-greenhouse; Vegetable soil; Buffer soil	AGRICULTURAL SOILS; SEDIMENTS; PARTICLES; POLLUTION; TRIBUTARIES; ENVIRONMENT; TRANSPORT; LAKES; AREA	Plastic particle accumulation in arable soils is a growing contaminant of concern with unknown consequences for soil productivity and quality. This study aimed to investigate abundance and distribution of plastic particles among soil aggregate fractions in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest buffer zone at Dian Lake, southwestern China. Plastic particles (10-0.05 mm) from fifty soil samples were extracted and then sorted by size, counted, and categorized. Plastic particles were found in all soil samples. The concentration of plastic particles ranges from 7100 to 42,960 particles kg(-1) (mean 18,760 particles kg(-1)). 95% of the sampled plastic particles are in the microplastic size (1-0.05 mm) range. The predominant form is plastic fibers, making up on average 92% of each sample followed by fragments and films that contributed with to 8%. Results of this study also show that 72% of plastic particles are associated with soil aggregates, and 28% of plastic particles are dispersed. The abundance of aggregate-associated plastic fibers is significantly greater in the micro-aggregate than that in the macro-aggregate, whereas the less concentrations of plastic films and fragments are found in the microaggregate. Compared to the adjacent vegetable soil, the less concentration of plastic particles in the buffer soil implicates that application of soil amendments and irrigation with wastewater must be controlled to reduce accumulation of microplastic in agricultural soils. While the implications of microplastic on ecological and human health are poorly understood, the staggering number of microplastic in agricultural soils should be continually concerned in the future.

We recently collected and studied this taxon at its locus classicus in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province in China. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and morphological observation of H. laterepens and related species clearly indicate that this is a distinct taxonomic entity worthy of species rank. Phylogenetically, H. laterepens is closely related to H. apogamum and may be involved in the reticulate evolution of the H. apogamum complex, which is comprised of several taxa with different levels of ploidy. Morphologically, H. laterepens is distinguished by the combination of its triangular laminae, large pinnae with acute apices and deeply serrated margins, and ca. 117 chromosomes at meiosis I and 32 spores in each sporangium. This work provides a complete species description and comparison to related species within the genus Hymenasplenium, particularly to other relatives of the "H. unilaterale" group. Hymenasplenium laterepens is described here with diagnosis and type designation.

Atomic scale study for the structural transformation of single layered MoS2	CRYSTENGCOMM			English	Article							ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; MOIRE PATTERNS; NANOSHEETS; TRANSITION; EXFOLIATION; CHEMISTRY; DYNAMICS; GRAPHENE	The structural transformation of single and few layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) from 2H to 1T phase was studied at the atomic scale. Single layered MoS2 was prepared via ultrasonication of an ethanolic dispersion. Bulk MoS2 was in the 2H phase, which was confirmed via XRD. The reduction of the difference between the characteristic peaks of MoS2 was observed through Raman spectroscopy for the exfoliated MoS2. Without adding any other atoms, a phase transformation of MoS2 was observed. The transformation of the 2H phase MoS2 to the 1T phase was studied under a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The characteristic honeycomb structure together with the specific pattern of the back-folded edge of MoS2 confirm the structural transformation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed to ascertain the chemical composition of MoS2.

Many high-elevation adaptations (HEAs) are thought to have arisen in situ as populations rose with growing mountains. In contrast, most highelevation lineages of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau appear to have colonized from low-elevation areas. These lineages provide an opportunity for studying recent HEAs and comparing them with ancestral low-elevation alternatives. Herein, we compare four frogs (three species of Nanorana and a close lowland relative) and four lizards (Phrynocephalus) that inhabit a range of elevations on or along the slopes of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The sequential cladogenesis of these species across an elevational gradient allows us to examine the gradual accumulation of HEA at increasing elevations. Many adaptations to high elevations appear to arise gradually and evolve continuously with increasing elevational distributions. Numerous related functions, especially DNA repair and energy metabolism pathways, exhibit rapid change and continuous positive selection with increasing elevations. Although the two studied genera are distantly related, they exhibit numerous convergent evolutionary changes, especially at the functional level. This functional convergence appears to be more extensive than convergence at the individual gene level, although we found 32 homologous genes undergoing positive selection for change in both high-elevation groups. We argue that species groups distributed along a broad elevational gradient provide a more powerful system for testing adaptations to high-elevation environments compared with studies that compare only pairs of high-elevation versus low-elevation species.

J	Liu, HL; Hu, ZH; Xia, J; Lu, YF				Liu Hui-Long; Hu Zong-Hua; Xia Jing; Lu Yan-Fei			Generation and applications of non-diffraction beam	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Review						non-diffraction beam; Bessel beam; Mathieu beam; Airy beam	ORBITAL ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; AIRY BEAMS; BESSEL BEAMS; SELF-RECONSTRUCTION; HOLOGRAPHIC GENERATION; ACCELERATING AIRY; GAUSS BEAMS; MANIPULATION; PROPERTY; PARTICLE	In recent years, with the development of laser technology, various non-diffraction beams each with a central spot unchanged after a long distance propagation, have been generated, they being the Bessel beam, higher Bessel beam, Mathieu beam, higher Mathieu beam, cosine beam, parabolic beam, and Airy beam. Diffraction-free beams are widely used in laser drilling, laser precision alignment, optical precision control, optical micromanipulation, optical communication, plasma guidance, light bullet, synthesis of autofocusing beam, nonlinear optics, etc. In this paper, the expressions, generation methods and corresponding experimental results of the various non-diffraction beams are presented. There are many ways to generate the Bessel beam, they being circular slit, computed hologram, spherical aberration lens, resonant cavity, axicon, and metasurface. The main methods of generating the non-diffraction beams are summarized, and each method is analyzed in depth from the cost of the system, and then some suggestions for improving and perfecting are made. For the generation of non-diffraction beams, the passive methods are used most to convert other beams into corresponding non-diffraction beams by optical components. Due to the low damage threshold and high cost of optical components, the power, energy and beam quality of a non-diffracting beam will be limited. How to generate a high-power, high-beam quality non-diffracting beam will be a hot research spot. Diffractionless beams have attracted a great deal of interest due to their unique non-diffraction, transverse-accelerating (or self-bending) and self-healing property. Transverse-accelerating property refers to that non-diffraction beams propagate along a parabola trajectory. The diffractionless beams' propagation trajectory control method implemented by changing system parameters is simple and easily successful, but cannot reverse acceleration direction, and its controlling range is limited. The self-healing property means that the non-diffraction beam tends to reform during propagation in spite of severe perturbations imposed. Both the Airy beam and the Bessel beam exhibit self-healing properties during propagation. And non-diffraction beams have potential applications in many fields. In atmosphere, such as in optical communication, non-diffracting beam exhibits more resilience against perturbations. Finally, brief summary and outlook of non-diffraction beams playing important roles in future study, and their application prospects are presented. In addition to Airy beam and Bessel beam, for other non-diffraction beams due to the complexity of the beams themselves, by comparison, their applications are investigated very little, so the applications in Mathieu beam, cosine beam, and parabolic beam will be a hot research spot.

Interspecific Gene Flow Shaped the Evolution of the Genus Canis	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENERATION SEQUENCING DATA; GENOME SEQUENCE; DOMESTIC DOG; HISTORY; ADMIXTURE; ALIGNMENT; ANCIENT; PLEISTOCENE; PHYLOGENIES; FRAMEWORK	The evolutionary history of the wolf-like canids of the genus Canis has been heavily debated, especially regarding the number of distinct species and their relationships at the population and species level [16]. We assembled a dataset of 48 resequenced genomes spanning all members of the genus Canis except the black-backed and side-striped jackals, encompassing the global diversity of seven extant canid lineages. This includes eight new genomes, including the first resequenced Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), one dhole (Cuon alpinus), two East African hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus), two Eurasian golden jackals (Canis aureus), and two Middle Eastern gray wolves (Canis lupus). The relationships between the Ethiopian wolf, African golden wolf, and golden jackal were resolved. We highlight the role of inter- specific hybridization in the evolution of this charismatic group. Specifically, we find gene flow between the ancestors of the dhole and African hunting dog and admixture between the gray wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), golden jackal, and African golden wolf. Additionally, we report gene flow from gray and Ethiopian wolves to the African golden wolf, suggesting that the African golden wolf originated through hybridization between these species. Finally, we hypothesize that coyotes and gray wolves carry genetic material derived from a "ghost" basal canid lineage.

However, the genomic information of this species remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we used RNAseq technology to characterize and annotate the C. chago transcriptome and identify candidate genes involved in special metabolic pathways and gene-associated simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A total of 129,097 unigenes, with a mean length of 667 bp and an N50 length of 1,062 bp, were assembled. Among these genes, 56,887 (44.07%) unigenes were successfully annotated using at least one database. Furthermore, 47 and 46 candidate genes were identified in terpenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively. A total of 22 candidate genes participated in at least one abiotic stress response of C. chago. Additionally, a total of 25,654 SSRs and 640 SNPs were also identified. Based on these potential loci, 55 novel expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR primers were successfully developed. This work provides comprehensive transcriptomic data that can be used to establish a valuable information platform for gene prediction, signaling pathway investigation, and molecular marker development for C. chago and other related species. Such a platform can facilitate further studies on germplasm conservation and utilization of Lauraceae species.

A new type of distributed nonlinear controller for each robot is designed. Some corresponding sufficient conditions are derived by using algebraic graph theory, matrix analysis and fixed-time stability theory. In addition, an upper bound of the settling time for the multi-robot systems is also explicitly given. It is shown that the obtained upper bound of settling time is regardless of initial errors of systems, which implies that it can facilitate the pre-design of the convergence time off-line. Numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the present theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditional methods for PARM focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing the types of identifiable activity subjects complete and improving recognition accuracy and system robustness by means of novel body-worn sensors or advanced learning algorithms. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to open and connected uncontrolled environments by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps. Little is currently known about whether traditional PARM technologies can tackle the new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand the use of IoT technologies in PARM studies, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a typical IoT layer-based perspective. It will firstly summarize the state-of-the-art in traditional PARM methodologies as used in the healthcare domain, including sensory, feature extraction and recognition techniques. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of PARM studies in the IoT environments, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them. Finally, this paper consider some of the successful case studies in the area and look at the possible future industrial applications of PARM in smart healthcare.

And different from other multiscale decomposition methods in infrared and visible image fusion field, a hybrid l(0)-l(1) layer decomposition model, which combines the superiority of l(0) sparsity term and l(1) sparsity term, is carried out to decompose the image into the base layer and the detail layer. Thus, a CNN model and visual saliency-based methods are utilized to fuse the detail layer and the base layer, respectively.

However, many approaches in texture synthesis are based on the presence of broken features at the overlap of adjacent patches. Due to inaccurate similarity measures, several optimization schemes for patch mergence may fail if these schemes cannot find satisfactory candidates from input samples. Self-similarity of candidate patches was proposed, and an algorithm was developed to perform distance error matching and alignment via the sum of self-similarity. First, when the matching window moves in the texture samples along the scan line, the sum of self-similarity replaces the sum-of-squared difference to decrease broken features or texels of outputs. Next, the synthesis speed was accelerated by eliminating redundancy calculation during matching window sliding. Finally, the proposed method enlarges the search range of the suture from one patch to all patches in the horizontal direction, and the broken features of overlaps are eliminated in the outputs. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, the obtained synthesis results were compared with other conventional synthesis methods. In all cases, experimental results demonstrate that the self-similarity matching-based method can decrease the number of feature discontinuities and accelerate synthesis time.

To this end, an A-site doubling tailoring strategy is explored in high-T-c superconducting perovskite to endow enhanced structural bidimensionality in terms of decoupling between 2D superconducting planes. High-quality (La1.6-xNd0.4)BaxCuO4 (LNBCO; x = 0.125-0.20) epitaxial films with A-site Ba/Nd doping are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition method. The LNBCO films exhibit ultrahigh laser-induced voltages (LIVs), especially the superior LIVs of higher than 50 V for x = 0.15 and 0.175 and show fast rising time (<85 ns) and long response time (>100 ns). Such a high LIV is several orders/folds larger than that of the existing high-T-c superconductors and other materials reported to date. Systematic influences are investigated in terms of laser irradiation conditions, tilting angle, Seebeck coefficient, etc., suggesting the high LIVs are correlated to charge transport. Simultaneous tailoring over A-site Ba and Nd in LNBCO causes weaken coupling between the CuO2 planes because the La/Ba/Nd-O bonds are elongated and charges are localized within Cu or CuO2 plane. This enables accelerating the charge transport anisotropically, a consequence of enhanced bidimensionality.

The Himalayan region, frequently referred to as the third pole of the Earth, has experienced large-scale climatic oscillations in the past and bears unique geographic, topographic, and climatic areas. The influences of the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and present-day geographical barriers such as rivers in shaping the demographic history and population genetic structure of organisms in the Nepal Himalaya have not yet been documented. Hence, we examined the effects of late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles and riverine barriers on the genetic composition of Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus), a colobine primate with a wide range of altitudinal distribution across the Nepalese Himalaya, using the mitochondrial DNA control region (CR, 1090bp) and cytochrome B (CYTB, 1140bp) sequences combined with paleodistribution modeling.ResultsDNA sequences were successfully retrieved from 67 non-invasively collected fecal samples belonging to 18 wild Hanuman langur troops covering the entire distribution range of the species in Nepal. We identified 37 haplotypes from the concatenated CR+CYTB (2230bp) sequences, with haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.9580.015 and 0.0237 +/- 0.0008, respectively. The troops were clustered into six major clades corresponding to their river-isolated spatial distribution, with the significantly high genetic variation among these clades confirming the barrier effects of the snow-fed Himalayan rivers on genetic structuring. Analysis of demographic history projected a decrease in population size with the onset of the last glacial maximum (LGM); and, in accordance with the molecular analyses, paleodistribution modeling revealed a range shift in its suitable habitat downward/southward during the LGM. The complex genetic structure among the populations of central Nepal, and the stable optimal habitat through the last interglacial period to the present suggest that the central mid-hills of Nepal served as glacial refugia for the Hanuman langur.ConclusionsHanuman langurs of the Nepal Himalaya region exhibit high genetic diversity, with their population genetic structure is strongly shaped by riverine barrier effects beyond isolation by distance; hence, this species demands detailed future phylogenetic study.

Our goal was to introduce the use of a hierarchical modelling framework in the context of coordinated biodiversity monitoring to compare species richness and occupancy by integrating camera trap data from multiple study areas. Location: Southwest China. Methods: We used hierarchical occupancy models to integrate camera trap data for elusive mammal and pheasant communities from three study areas representing different habitat types: alpine and subalpine zones, dry-hot valleys and subtropical montane forests. We evaluate the responses of species occurrence to human influence and habitat parameters based on a Bayesian approach. Results: We captured photographs of 23 mammal and 7 pheasant species over 10,095 trap nights. The model revealed that the alpine and subalpine zones supported the highest species richness of the target communities among the three habitat types. Surprisingly, dry-hot valleys supported similar levels of species richness to subtropical montane forest. Species richness showed a similar bell-shaped relationship with elevation, with the richness curve peaking at intermediate elevations at about 3500m above sea level (asl). Posterior distributions for community-level hyper-parameters indicated the consistent and negative effects of human disturbance on species occupancy. The community model also revealed a strong quadratic relationship between elevation and occupancy, with the highest occupancy occurring at about 3700m asl. Main conclusion: Using hierarchical occupancy models for integrating camera trap data from multiple study areas, we show that alpine/subalpine zone and dry-hot valleys have the highest richness and should be given more priority for conservation of biodiversity in southwest China. We recommend broader application of the hierarchical occupancy modelling approach to camera trap data to obtain more comprehensive insights relevant to regional biodiversity conservation.

Uncertainty in United States coastal wetland greenhouse gas inventorying	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						coastal wetland; carbon cycle; tidal wetland; saltmarsh; mangrove; tidal freshwater forest; greenhouse gas inventory	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; SEA-LEVEL RISE; METHANE EMISSIONS; NATURAL WETLANDS; TIDAL WETLANDS; LIDAR; MARSHES; CLIMATE; TERRESTRIAL; ELEVATION	Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO(2)e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO(2)e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO(2)e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

Here, we compare attribution results from two UK Met Office Hadley Centre models, HadGEM3-GA6 and weather@home (HadAM3P driving 50 km HadRM3P). Within HadGEM3-GA6 July 2017-like heatwaves were unequaled in the ensemble representing the world without human influences. Such heatwaves became approximately a 1 in 50 year event and increased by a factor of 4.8 (5%-95% range of 3.1 to 8.0) in weather@home as a result of human activity. Considering the risk ratio (RR) for the full range of return periods shows a discrepancy at all return times between the two model results. Within weather@home a range of different counterfactual sea surface temperature (SST) patterns were used, whereas HadGEM3-GA6 used a single estimate. The global mean difference in SST (between factual and counterfactual simulations) is shown to be related to the generalised extreme value (GEV) location parameter and consequently the RR, especially for return periods of less than 50 years. It is suggested that a suitable range of SST patterns are used for future attribution studies to ensure that this source of uncertainty is represented within the simulations and subsequent attribution results. It is shown that the risk change between factual and counterfactual simulations is not purely a simple shift in the distribution (i.e. change in GEV location parameter). For return periods greater than 50 years, the GEV shape parameter is found to strongly influence the RR determined with the GEV scale parameter affecting only the most severe events.

Unfortunately, little is known about how AgNPs' toxicity affects the mechanisms of metabolite shift in aquatic organisms. The aim of this work is thus to study systematically the cellular metabolism of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa upon exposure to AgNPs by using metabolomics based on non-targeted liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results reveal that a total of 97 biochemical metabolites and 16 specific metabolic pathways are significantly altered by exposure to AgNPs, many of which are associated with cellular stress response. Importantly, a metabolic analysis identified some novel metabolic pathways that are specifically regulated by AgNPs, including arginine and proline metabolism, indole alkaloid biosynthesis, and phospholipid metabolism (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Further examination revealed that exposure to AgNPs elevates superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde generation, damages the thylakoids, and interrupts the endocytosis process in algae cells. Together, the manifestation of differential metabolic profiles combined with the perturbation of physiological indicators upon AgNP exposure is taken as evidence of damage to photosynthesis and membranes. These results provide holistic information about complex disturbances in metabolite profiles of M. aeruginosa upon exposure to AgNPs and provide new insights into the mechanisms of AgNPs' toxicity in the aquatic environment.

Eichhornia produces N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine (PNA), a compound which can inhibit algae. However, the impact of PNA on allelopathic effects of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa on other phytoplankton species is not clear. In this study, we tested whether PNA can influence the allelopathic effect of M. aeruginosa on the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda. S. quadricauda was more sensitive to PNA than M. aeruginosa, with 72 h-EC50 values of 0.42 and 3.66 mg L-1, respectively. In addition, PNA significantly enhanced allelopathy by M. aeruginosa on S. quadricauda. Consequently, PNA had a greater impact on the green algae when Microcystis was present. In complex ecosystems with multiple species that release allelopathic substances, unintended interspecific interactions may occur, where allelopathy plays an important role under artificial or even natural contexts. It is hard to predict the competition outcomes among allelopathic organisms in these complex ecosystems, therefore a precautionary approach is required for biological control of algae.

Without much more Internet knowledge, elderlies usually seek the third-party to assist them to get healthcare services from Web or APPs, it consequently results in an unexpected situation that scalpers could grab all healthcare services booking by unrighteous means in order to resell to elderlies for a much higher price. Moreover, it is hard for physicians to identify the scalpers due to the complexity, ad-hoc, and multiscenario nature of healthcare processes. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the identification and creation of user groups of scalpers in mobile healthcare services. The approach utilizes and extends state of the art data analysis approaches in the event-logs of the mobile system to identify user groups. Based on the user groups, user profiles are extracted by identifying representative eventcases from hierarchical user-event clusters. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted in a selected test-set from the event-logs of a mobile healthcare APP. The result shows its accuracy and effectiveness in scalper detection in mobile healthcare APP. Further, a complete case study is deployed in a real word hospital to ensure its utility, efficacy, and reliability.

J	Hu, HR; Liu, H; Liu, FH				Hu Huaran; Liu Hao; Liu Feihu			Seed germination of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cultivars responds differently to the stress of salt type and concentration	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						Cannabis sativa; Germination; Salt tolerance; Three-way ANOVA	SALINITY; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; ACCUMULATION; NACL	Industrial hemp is worldwide, but the effects of salt stress on hemp growth remain unknown, especially the tolerance of different varietal to salt stress during germination. Two important hemp cultivars in China, Yunma 5 (YM5, fiber hemp) and Bamahuoma (BM, seed hemp), were germinated under the conditions with four kinds of salts (NaCI, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaHCO3) at 0-300 mM for seven days to test the seed germination responses to salt stress. The germination indexes decreased with the increase of salt concentration for each salt, especially in 300 mM Na2CO3, showing the most toxic effect on germination. However, a low concentration (50 mM) of neutral salt stimulated seed germination, showing a higher germination rate and longer radicles and hypocotyls than the control. The growth of radical and hypocotyl was more salt-sensitive than seed germination. Upon transfer to distilled water, the non-germinated seeds restored germination ability and the recovery percentage increased with the increase of salt concentration. YM5 showed stronger salt tolerance than BM, with higher threshold salinity of 150 mM NaCI and Na2SO4 (100 mM NaCI and 50 mM Na2SO4 for BM), and higher critical salinity of 150 mM Na2CO3 and 250 mM NaHCO3 (100 mM Na2CO3 and 200 mM NaHCO3 for BM) for germination rate. In conclusion, the inhibition of salt stress to hemp seed germination varied with the salt type, salt concentration, and tested cultivars, and both hemp cultivars were more sensitive to alkaline salt stress.

The results show that there is an excellent synergistic effect between iodide ion and MV for carbon steel corrosion inhibition in 1.0 mol/L H3PO4. The electrochemical studies reveal that single iodide ion or combination of iodide ion and MV acts as a mixed-type inhibitor and the corrosion reaction is controlled by charge transfer process. Adsorption of iodide ion on the steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm in the absence or presence of MV. The values of K-ads, Delta G(ads)degrees, Delta H-a, Delta S-a and E-a were obtained and discussed. The adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the steel surface is a spontaneous process containing a mixed physical and chemical adsorption mechanism.

In this paper, silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and silicon inverted pyramid arrays (SiIPs) were introduced on surface of Gr-Si solar cell through silver and copper-catalyzed chemical etching, respectively. The effects of SiNWs and SiIPs on carrier lifetime, optical properties and efficiency of Gr-SiNWs and Gr-SiIPs solar cells were systematically analyzed. The results show that the inverted pyramid arrays have more excellent ability for balancing antireflectance loss and surface area enlargement. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) and carrier lifetime of Gr-SiIPs devices respectively increase by 62% and 34% by comparing with that of Gr-SiNWs solar cells. Finally, the Gr-SiIPs cell with PCE of 5.63% was successfully achieved through nitric acid doping. This work proposes a new strategy to introduce the inverted pyramid arrays for improving the performance of Gr-Si solar cells.

In this study, Ag-LaFeO(3 )was modified with molecular imprinting technique, in which methacrylic acid and hydroxyethyl methylacrylate are used as functional monomers, respectively. Based on XRD, EDS, XPS, SEM, TEM, BET nitrogen adsorption observations, the structure and morphology of the samples are characterized. The as-prepared molecularly imprinted nano-particles with methacrylic acid as functional monomer exhibit high selectivity and response to xylene gas, and the response is dependent on the type and content of the functional monomer. To 5 ppm xylene, the optimal response is 36.2 at the operating temperature of 99 degrees C. In addition, low cross-responses to the other test gases were observed. The remarkable enhancement in the gas-sensing properties of the samples is attributed to their high specific surface area and molecular imprinting structure.

As confirmed by observing of transmission electron microscopy images and analysis of plasmon resonance spectrum transformations, we found that silver triangular nanoplates (TNPs) without further modification could be face-to-face assembled by citrate. The face-to-face assembly of silver TNPs could be disassembled quickly by heating at a wide temperature range from 30 to 80 degrees C. In this process, an obvious localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak shift and a color change of solution from pink to purple could be observed. Moreover, the disassembled silver TNPs suspension is very stable that no significant peak shift of silver TNPs spectrum was observed in 8 h after removing of silver TNPs from a hearing area. Therefore, we fabricated an irreversible temperature indicator by measuring the relationship between the shift of LSPR peak and heating temperature, and by watching the color change of the solution in a certain environment. The irreversible temperature indicator has potential to develop a temperature label for revealing temperature history of a thermosensitive product which cannot expose to excessive temperature.

To achieve this, we have carried out a major observational campaign using two long-slit spectrographs: the OMR mounted on the National Astronomy Observatory of China (NAOC) 2.16-m telescope and the Yunnan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (YFOSC) mounted on the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO) 2.4-m telescope. The original sample is based on the MILES library, supplemented by 918 stars selected from the PASTEL data base. In total, 822 OMR and 1324 YFOSC spectra have been collected and reduced, covering the wavelength ranges lambda lambda 3800-5180 and lambda lambda 5150-9000, respectively. The spectra have a mean resolution full width at halfmaximum of similar to 3.3 angstrom and are wavelength- and flux-calibrated to an accuracy of similar to 20 km s(-1) and similar to 5 per cent, respectively. The spectra are further corrected for systematic errors in the wavelength calibration to an accuracy of similar to 4 km s(-1) by cross-correlating with the theoretical spectra. Almost all the spectra have an average signal-to-noise ratio better than 100 per pixel. Combined with the MILES spectra, there are now 1731, 1542, 1324 and 1273 stars with spectra covering lambda lambda 3800-5180, lambda lambda 3800-7500, lambda lambda 5150-9000 and lambda lambda 3800-9000, respectively. In this paper, we describe our template star selection, the observation and data reduction, and we present the reduced spectra collected hitherto.

It was found that pure TiO2 aerogel nanocomposite did not exhibit any meaningful activity for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). However, the photocatalytic reduction activity was greatly improved by the RCP inserted TiO2 aerogel nanocomposites under visible-light irradiation, which was approximately 2- and 12.3-fold higher than that of TiO2 aerogel conventionally photosensitized by RCP and pure TiO2 aerogel nanocomposites, respectively. It also exhibited good stability and could be reused at least three times without losing a significant amount of its activity.

The purpose of this study was to find a multidimensional transcriptome signature to predict clinical outcomes in bladder cancer. Using Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis and the random survival forest algorithm, we mined the expression profile data of 239 bladder cancer patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database. A signature comprised of two PCGs (ACADS and C1QTNF9B), two lncRNAs (RP11-60L3.1 and CTD-3195I5.3) and two microRNAs (has-miR-3913-1 and has-miR-891a) with highest accuracy prediction (AUC= 0.79 in the training dataset and 0.64 in the test dataset) was selected. The signature had an ability to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival rates (median 16.9 vs. 54.9 months, log-rank test P<0.001) in the training dataset, and its performance was validated for risk stratification in the test dataset (median 18.2 vs. 58.9 months, log-rank test P=0.002). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA). A comparison of tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage and the signature indicated that the signature had better survival prediction power (AUC(signature)=0.79/0.64 vs. AUC(TNM)= 0.67/0. 60, P< 0. 05). Functional analyses indicated that these prognostic genes from the signature may be involved in tumourigenesis-related biological processes and pathways. In conclusion, the multidimensional PCG-lncRNA-microRNA signature can be a novel prognostic marker to predict the survival of bladder cancer patients.

SP.; SPP.; IDENTIFICATION	The presence of Sarcocystis cysts in the muscle tissue of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), which normally serve as definitive hosts, is unusual and infrequent. Here, S. caninum sarcocysts were identified for the first time in two of 37 dogs (2.7%) from China. Examination using light microscopy found that the S. caninum sarcocysts were up to 1520 mu m long and up to 147 mu m wide and contained numerous 1.5-3.3 mu m wedge-like villar protrusions (vp). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the sarcocysts had plcomorphic vp that closely resembled those of "type 9c." Five loci, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, mitochondria(cox1, ITS1 and ropB, were sequenced and characterized in S. caninum sarcocysts. The sequences of the five loci shared similarities of 99.9-100%, 99.0-100%, 99.4-100%, 99.6-100%, and 99.7-100%, respectively, with those of S. arctica. Phylogenctic analysis based on the sequences of 28S rDNA and mitochondrial cox1 indicated that S. caninum and S. arctica are closely related to Sarcocystis species that use a raptorial bird as their definitive host.

And the construction of efficient enzyme mimetics for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins still represents a major technical challenge due to the high stability of peptide bonds and the importance of proteases in biology and industry. Herein, it is described for the first time that Cu2O-decorated carbon quantum dots (CQDs/Cu2O) possess an intrinsic protease-mimic activity to hydrolyze proteins including bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein under physiological conditions. CQDs/Cu2O also features a desirable stability and good reusability. CQDs/Cu2O has a much higher affinity for BSA than trypsin. To the best of knowledge, this is the first example of protein hydrolysis by stable composite nanomaterials under physiological conditions which may open this catalytic system for a multitude of potential applications in biological systems.

In this paper, AgI/N-Bi2O3 composites with the different mass ratio of AgI were used to remove E2 in water. The results showed that 40% AgI/N-Bi2O3 composite could degrade E2 by adsorption and photocatalysis synergism: 89% of E2 was adsorbed after 30min in the dark, and E2 was completely degraded after only 10min under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the adsorption process of E2 can be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model well described the E2 adsorption on the 40% AgI/N-Bi2O3 composite. Finally, the photocatalytic degradation dates were fitted to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation was proposed through the capture experiments of active species and theoretical calculations.

However, the bicycle-sharing markets still face unbalanced development problems, i.e., initial rapid expansion in most areas, and a recent disappearance in some local areas. Thus, the economic features and rules of this market need further exploration to introduce better management measures. Based on agent-based modeling, the current paper stimulated the interactions between supply and demand with two models to illuminate the supply characteristics of the bicycle-sharing market. The main findings included the following: (1) the bicycle-sharing market is governed by a set of objective laws which naturally require an oversupply, meaning that the attainment of a high level of user satisfaction depends on high supply; (2) based on each customer's tolerance level, there is a supply density threshold that determines the existence and disappearance of the market; and (3) the width and elasticity of the supply density threshold are influenced by the tolerance of the customers, which, in turn, reflects their values and attitudes. The current research is a preliminary exploration of the interactive characteristics of supply and demand in the bicycle-sharing market. We believe that the current paper provides insights and implications to illuminate the law of existence in the bicycle-sharing market. It also includes a discussion on the sustainable development of the bicycle-sharing market in China.

However, built-up land may be derived from other types of land use. With the expansion of built-up area as a result of urbanization, the yield and equivalence factors of built-up land are becoming increasingly important in the EF calculation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of this assumption on EF calculation. In this study, the proportions of different land types converted into built-up land were evaluated based on actual land-use conversion in two urbanized areas of Yunnan Province and Kunming City from 1980 to 2010 in the ArcGIS platform. Then, the parameters of built-up land were calculated by an area-weighting approach with the proportions. The results showed the following: (1) In both cases, the EF of Yunnan Province and Kunming City were greater than their biocapacities (BC), indicating that they were in unsustainable states. (2) The EF and BC of the two studied cases were reduced to varying degrees because the yield and equivalence factors of built-up land from land-use conversion are less than cropland factors. As the proportion of the built-up land area in Kunming City was larger than that in Yunnan Province, the reduced proportion of the EF and BC of Kunming City is greater than that of Yunnan Province. (3) The proportion of built-up land converted from cropland has a significantly positive correlation with EF and BC. Therefore, it is of great significance to revise the yield and equivalence factors of built-up land using actual land-use conversions in highly urbanized areas.

Because of its high-quality environment, numerous inns have appeared around Erhai Lake, which has become the inn sector leader in China. Declining water quality of the lake contrasts sharply with the increasing number of inns, thus a policy that balances economic development and water protection is needed desperately. The Erhai Lake Resource Protection Fee (ELRPF) is a form of PES, constructed on the basis of the contingent value method (CVM) involving the relationship between perceived benefits, institutional trust, awareness, and supportive attitude. Using relevant data obtained from a survey questionnaire, SmartPls 3.0 software was used to analyze the factors influencing inn operators' WTP. The results of the analysis of 307 questionnaires showed that institutional trust, PES cognition, and attitudes toward support significantly affected inn operators' WTP, while perceived benefit did not. This result differs from results of research on other tourism stakeholders. The reasons for this difference might be the specific identity of operators, their cultural and place identity, ability and professional education, and complexities of the broker of ecosystem services.

Based on land-use data, household surveys and social economic data in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, this study adopted the Binary Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) to analyze the driving factors of land-use spatio-temporal change in a large artificial forest area in the Ximeng County, Yunnan province, in Southwest China. Seventeen factors were used to reflect the socio-economic and natural environment conditions in the study area. The results show a land use pattern composed of forestland, dry cropland, and rubber plantation in Ximeng County. Over the past fifteen years, the area of artificial forests increased rapidly due to the Grain for Green policy, which has led to increases in rubber plantations, tea gardens, eucalyptus forests, etc. In contrast, the area of natural forest and dry cropland decreased due to reclamations for farming and constructions. The BLRM approach helped to identify the main driving factors of land-use spatio-temporal change, which includes land-use policies (protection of basic farmlands and natural reserves), topography (elevation and slope), accessibility (distance to the human settlements), and potential productivity (fertility and irrigation). The study revealed the relationship between land-use spatio-temporal change and its driving factors in mountainous Southwest China, providing a decision-making basis for rational land-use management and optimal allocation of land resources.

NOV.; EXTREME THERMOPHILE; OSHIMAI; YUNNAN; DNA; TENGCHONG; REDUCTION; DATABASE	Two closely related, thermophilic bacteria, designated strains YIM 76954(T) and YIM 76947, were isolated from the Rehai Geothermal Field, Tengchong, Yunnan province, south-west China. Polyphasic approach and whole genome sequencing were used to determine the taxonomy status and genomic profiles of the novel strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two isolates were closely related to Thermus scotoductus SE-1(T) (97.1% sequence similarity), and T. amyloliquefaciens YIM 77409(T) (96.6%). The strains could be differentiated from most recognized Thermus species by their whitish to slight reddish colony color, distinct DNA fingerprinting profiles and low ANI values. Cells stained Gram-negative, rod-shaped of diameter 0.2-0.5 mu m and length 1.5-5.0 mu m. Growth occurred at 50-75 degrees C, pH 6.0-9.0 and in the presence of up to 1.0% (w/v) NaCl concentration. Thiosulfate was found to enhance cell growth, besides improving the intensity of its colony color. Oxygen, nitrate, sulfur, and Fe(III) could be used as terminal electron acceptors for growth. MK-8 was the major respiratory menaquinone. Major fatty acids were iso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C 17:0, and anteiso-C-15:0. The genome size was 2.26 Mbp with 65.5% average GC content. A total of 2374 genes was predicted, comprising 2322 protein-coding and 52 RNA genes. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence presented, it is proposed that strain YIM 76954(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermus, for which the name Thermus tenuipuniceus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 76954(T) (=JCM 30350(T) =KCTC 4677(T)). (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

During the weighting, the weighting cost can influence the performance of context modeling entropy coding. However, the context weighting rely on corresponding counting vectors which are joined in weighting. Meanwhile, the equivalence between context weighting and the weighting of description length implies that the weights can be optimized. The corresponding methods are discussed in details in our paper. At last, the proposed approach is used to compress these simple genome sequences. A large number of experiment results indicate that the corresponding compression results is better than the results of other existing algorithms.

The red panda is a global conservation icon, but holistic conservation management has been hampered by research being restricted to certain locations and population clusters. Building a comprehensive potential habitat map for the red panda is imperative to advance the conservation effort and ensure coordinated management across international boundaries. Here, we use occurrence records of both subspecies of red pandas from across their entire range to build a habitat model using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.3.3k) and the least correlated bioclimatic variables. We found that the subspecies have separate climatic spaces dominated by temperature-associated variables in the eastern geographic distribution limit and precipitation-associated variables in the western distribution limit. Annual precipitation (BIO12) and maximum temperature in the warmest months (BIO5) were major predictors of habitat suitability for A. f. fulgens and A. f. styani, respectively. Our model predicted 134,975 km(2) of red panda habitat based on 10 percentile thresholds in China (62% of total predicted habitat), Nepal (15%), Myanmar (9%), Bhutan (9%), and India (5%). Existing protected areas (PAs) encompass 28% of red panda habitat, meaning the PA network is currently insufficient and alternative conservation mechanisms are needed to protect the habitat. Bhutan's PAs provide good coverage for the red panda habitat. Furthermore, large areas of habitat were predicted in cross-broader areas, and transboundary conservation will be necessary.

Here we describe a new genus of Radiodonta, Ramskoeldia gen. nov., that also bears GLSs. Its two new species, Ramskoeldia platyacantha sp. nov. and R.consimilis sp. nov., are distinguished based on the morphology of their frontal appendages. The presence of three pairs of GLSs associated with reduced segments posterior to the head and the detailed morphological similarities of the GLSs suggest that Ramskoeldia is closely related to Amplectobelua Hou etal., and they are classified together in the revised Family Amplectobeluidae. Other diagnostic characters of this family include the lack of a radially-arranged oral cone, instead sharing mouthparts composed of smooth and tuberculate plates, and a frontal appendage with three podomeres in the shaft and prominent larger endites on podomeres 4 and 8. Due to its lack of GLSs and the different morphology of its mouthparts, membership of Lyrarapax Cong etal., in Amplectobeluidae cannot be confirmed. Appraisal of available evidence indicates that the morphology of the feeding structures, including frontal appendages, the mouth apparatus, and GLSs, serves as a fundamental source of characters in the classification of radiodonts.

J	Yan, DH; Zhou, JN; Zhang, PF; Zhu, QQ; Wang, JC				Yan, Dahai; Zhou, Jianeng; Zhang, Pengfei; Zhu, Qianqian; Wang, Jiancheng			Testing Relativistic Boost as the Cause of Gamma-Ray Quasi-periodic Oscillation in a Blazar	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: jets; gamma rays: galaxies; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	X-RAY; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; LIGHT CURVES; HELICAL JETS; PG 1553+113; EMISSION; GALAXIES; PRECESSION	The mechanism for producing gamma-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in blazars is unknown. One possibility is the geometric model, in which without the need for intrinsic quasi-periodic variation, the relativistic Doppler factor changes periodically, resulting in observed gamma-ray QPO. We propose a method to test this geometric model. We analyze the Fermi-LAT data of PG 1553+113 spanning from 2008 August until 2018 February. According to 29 four-month average spectral energy distributions in the energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, we split the Fermi-LAT energy range into three bands: 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and 10-300 GeV. The spectrum in each energy range can be successfully fitted by a power law. The light curves and photon indices in the three energy ranges are obtained. Then, light curves in three narrow energy ranges, i.e., 0.2-0.5 GeV, 2-5 GeV, and 20-40 GeV, are constructed, and the relative variability amplitudes in the three narrow energy ranges are calculated. A discrete-correlation analysis is performed for the light curves. Our results indicate that (i) the light curves in the different energy ranges follow the same pattern showed in the light curve above 0.1 GeV; (ii) the three groups of photon indices in the energy ranges of 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and 10-300 GeV keep nearly constant; and (iii) the ratio between relative variability amplitudes in different narrow energy ranges are equal (within their errors) to the prediction by the Doppler effect. Our results support the scenario of the relativistic boost producing the gamma-ray QPO for PG 1553+113.

Merr.] is one of the most important crops in the world. It is a major source of vegetable oil for consumption and protein meal for animal feeds and has also been widely used in human food industries because of its nutritive and health benefits. To provide useful information for soybean quality improvement, seed individual sugars, total sugar, protein, oil, and dietary fiber were genetically analyzed in replicated trials with 323 germplasm lines grown in South Dakota and 137 cultivars and breeding lines grown in Virginia. The results indicated significant differences among the genotypes for all traits investigated. Environment effect and genotype x environment interaction were also significant in most cases. Heritability estimates were high (94.45-97.79%) for all traits n the germplasm population, and higher in the population of breeding lines for most traits. High genotypic correlation existed between sucrose and total sugar, which helps improvement of digestible sugars and sweetness in soybean food. However, attention should be paid to the lines with higher sucrose but lower oligosaccharides, since stachyose was positively associated with total sugar. Genotypic correlations between seed sugars and protein were insignificant or very low in most cases, implying that alteration of seed sugars might not necessarily affect protein. In some cases, however, there might be negative correlations between seed sugars and oil or dietary fiber in soybean. This study also identified some unique germplasm lines with a desired level of a specific seed composition: one with high sucrose, five with low raffinose, 15 with high total sugar, seven with high protein, and four high in both sucrose and total sugar.

It has been demonstrated that Ang II upregulates the expression of cyclophilin A (CypA), which is a potential myocardial hypertrophy factor. However, the mechanisms by which Ang II induces the expression of CypA in cardiomyocytes remain unclear. In the present study, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by fluorescence microscopy, and western blot analysis and ELISA were used to measure CypA expression. It was identified that Ang II enhanced the production of ROS in rat cardiomyocytes. ROS, in turn, promoted CypA expression and secretion. Notably, the action of Ang II was primarily dependent on the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT(2)R), not the type 1 receptor. These results provided an insight into the role of the AT(2)R signaling pathway in Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy.

J	Li, J; Yang, Y; Wang, XL; Zhao, ZM; Li, T				Li, Jin; Yang, Yun; Wang, Xiaoling; Zhao, Zhiming; Li, Tong			A novel parallel distance metric-based approach for diversified ranking on large graphs	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Graph algorithms; Diversified ranking; Distance metric; Parallel computing; MapReduce	TEMPORAL DATA; ENSEMBLE	Diversified ranking on graphs (DRG) is an important and challenging issue in researching graph data mining. Traditionally, this problem is modeled by a submodular optimization objective, and solved by applying a cardinality constrained monotone submodular maximization. However, the existing submodular objectives do not directly capture the dis-similarity over pairs of nodes, while most of algorithms cannot easily take full advantage of the power of a distributed cluster computing platform, such as Spark, to significantly promote the efficiency of algorithms. To overcome the deficiencies of existing approaches, in this paper, a generalized distance metric based on a subadditive set function over the symmetry difference of neighbors of pairs of nodes is introduced to capture the pairwise dis-similarity over pairs of nodes. In our approach, DRG is formulated as a Max-Sum k-dispersion problem with metrical edge weights, which is NP-hard, in association with the proposed distance metric, a centralized linear time 2-approximation algorithm GA is then developed to significantly solve the problem of DRG. Moreover, we develop a highly parallelizable algorithm for DRG, which can be easily implemented in MapReduce style parallel computation models using GA as a basic reducer. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real network datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most existing work impose the missing at random assumption, which is not realistic in practice. Two Bayesian approaches for testing the non-inferiority of incomplete paired data under non-ignorable missing mechanism are presented. In addition, Bayesian credible intervals and highest posterior density intervals for the risk difference are constructed. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the two Bayesian testing procedures and the credible intervals. Two datasets are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

The theranostic AzP1 was found to be stable within a biologically relevant pH scale and was chemically inert towards other competitive biological analytes. However, upon treatment with rat-liver microsomes, AzP1 showed a self-calibrated fluorescence enhancement at lambda(em) = 560 nm. The cytotoxicity profile of AzP1 was tested in various cancer lines. Under hypoxic conditions, prodrug AzP1 exhibited activation to release the parent drug (SN-38) and enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells with concomitant fluorescence enhancement at 560 nm, which served to monitor both the drug activation and tracing purposes. The therapeutic potential of AzP1 for both tumor-specific activation and suppression of tumor weights was validated in xenograft mouse model. Collectively, the synthetic ease and hypoxia-sensitive activation along with promising therapeutic properties highlight the potential of theranostic AzPI in future cancer treatment programs.

Their properties were investigated using POM, DSC, XRD, SEM, IR, UV-vis spectra and photoluminescence measurements. Such polycatenars can self-assemble into different columnar liquid crystalline phases ranging from p4mm via p2mm to p6mm in their bulk states and into organogels with nanobelt or porous morphologies in different solvents. These polycatenars can exhibit highly fluorescent emission with large Stokes shifts (90-118 nm) in solution and as films. Most interestingly, the photodimerization in both LC and non-LC phases led to the formation of absolutely hexagonal columnar LC phases, while photodimerization in gel states led to the formation of flowerlike or 3D porous morphologies. Either columnar phases or gels with flowerlike or ordered porous morphologies were first observed in coumarin based derivatives.

The ecological and climatic conditions suitable for these relict species have not been identified. Here, we map the abundance and distribution patterns of relict species, showing high abundance in the humid subtropical/warm-temperate forest regions. We further use Ecological Niche Modeling to show that these patterns align with maps of climate refugia, and we predict species' chances of persistence given the future climatic changes expected for East Asia. By 2070, potentially suitable areas with high richness of relict species will decrease, although the areas as a whole will probably expand. We identify areas in southwestern China and northern Vietnam as long-term climatically stable refugia likely to preserve ancient lineages, highlighting areas that could be prioritized for conservation of such species.

Its major components are dicentrine (1) and sinomenine (2). In the present study, a rapid, accurate, and precise method for simultaneous quantitation of dicentrine (1) and sinomenine (2) in S. epigeae using H-1 NMR spectra was developed. The deuterated solvent of DMSO-d(6) enabled satisfactory separation of the signals to be integrated in (1) H NMR spectrum and dimethyl terephthalate was selected as an internal standard. The feature signals of delta 7.57 and 5.70 were selected for quantifying the dicentrine (1) and sinomenine (2), respectively. Validation of the quantitative method was performed in terms of specificity, accuracy, precision, and stability. This work implied that quantitative H-1 NMR represents a feasible alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography-based methods for quantitation of dicentrine (1) and sinomenine (2) in S. epigeae and is suitable for the quality control of S. epigeae.

These compounds can display smectic C and hexagonal columnar mesophases in their bulk states, and aggregate into organogels as well as cubic or needle crystals in organic solvents. These cubic or needle crystals exhibit optical waveguide behavior. Additionally, these compounds can exhibit broad absorption up to 625 nm with a narrow band gap of 1.79 eV. The fluorescence emission of these compounds in CHCl3 can be quenched upon addition of C-70. Furthermore, these compounds can detect Cu2+ among a series of cations.

Assessing the relative potential ecological impacts and invasion risks of emerging and future invasive alien species	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						ecological impacts; functional response; invasive alien species; numerical response; pet propagule pressure; relative impact potential; relative invasion risk; risk assessment	MESOPREDATOR RELEASE; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES; PROPAGULE PRESSURE; BALLAST WATER; POND TURTLE; TEMPERATURE; AQUARIUM; TRADE; STRATEGIES; FECUNDITY	Invasive alien species (IAS) cause myriad negative impacts, such as ecosystem disruption, human, animal and plant health issues, economic damage and species extinctions. There are many sources of emerging and future IAS, such as the poorly regulated international pet trade. However, we lack methodologies to predict the likely ecological impacts and invasion risks of such IAS which have little or no informative invasion history. This study develops the Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric, a new measure of ecological impact that incorporates per capita functional responses (FRs) and proxies for numerical responses (NRs) associated with emerging invaders. Further, as propagule pressure is a determinant of invasion risk, we combine the new measure of Pet Propagule Pressure (PPP) with RIP to arrive at a second novel metric, Relative Invasion Risk (RIR). We present methods to calculate these metrics and to display the outputs on intuitive bi- and triplots. We apply RIP/RIR to assess the potential ecological impacts and invasion risks of four commonly traded pet turtles that represent emerging IAS: Thachemys scripta scripta, the yellow-bellied slider; T. s. troostii, the Cumberland slider; Sternotherus odoratus, the common musk turtle; and Kinosternon subrubrum, the Eastern mud turtle. The high maximum feeding rate and high attack rate of T. s. scripta, combined with its numerical response proxies of lifespan and fecundity, gave it the highest impact potential. It was also the second most readily available according to our UK surveys, indicating a high invasion risk. Despite having the lowest maximum feeding rate and attack rate, S. odoratus has a high invasion risk due to high availability and we highlight this species as requiring monitoring. The RIP/RIR metrics offer two universally applicable methods to assess potential impacts and risks associated with emerging and future invaders in the pet trade and other sources of future IAS. These metrics highlight T. s. scripta as having high impact and invasion risk, corroborating its position on the EU list of 49 IAS of Union Concern. This suggests our methodology and metrics have great potential to direct future IAS policy decisions and management. This, however, relies on collation and generation of new data on alien species functional responses, numerical responses and their proxies, and imaginative measures of propagule pressure.

Thermally activated amorphous-to-crystal transition provides effective growth of poly or monocrystalline TiO2, while an in-depth understanding of different crystallization pathways at the solid state is still lacking. Herein, we report a close correlation between mechanical strength of the TiO2 precursors and their different crystallization pathways. Two different morphologies, i.e., well-defined anatase TiO2 single nanocrystals and anatase polycrystalline nanotubes are obtained via rapid heating of two amorphous TiO2 precursors with distinctive mechanical strengths. The mechanical-strength-dependent crystallization from amorphous solid-state precursors provides additional control on the crystallization pathway and thus the desirable properties of the resultant nanostructures. In this study, the well-defined anatase nanocrystals with controlled morphology show higher storage capacity of sodium ion than that of polycrystalline ones in sodium ion batteries.

The synthetic method was optimized, and a proposed reaction mechanism was also presented. The compounds containing the 5-bromo-pyrimidine moiety exhibited moderate antibacterial potencies against Gram-positive strains. Furthermore, the newly prepared compounds displayed selectively antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines.

In this study, thermal catastrophic failure, a process involving temperature-induced abrupt device breakdown, is found to have a high degree of Correlation to the glass transition process of the organic molecules. It is also found that C-60-organic nano-composites can be used effectively to increase the glass transition temperature of the organic small molecular thin-films leading to the improvement of the thermal stability of OLEDs. In addition, a universal mathematical formula with only one variable, concentration, is discovered to quantify well the glass transition temperatures of all C-60 nano-composites. The thermal catastrophic failure temperahire of OLEDs with C-60 nano-composites as a hole transport layer is found to be proportional to the glass transition temperature of C-60 nano-composites.

The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results indicate that the Co2+/Co3+ entered Fe2O3 by replacing Fe3+ which formed Co-Fe2O3, and constituted p-n heterojunction with SmFeO3. The methanol gas sensing properties of Co-Fe2O3/SmFeO3 were investigated. The formation of Co-Fe2O3/SmFeO3 with MIT exhibited ultrahigh response, quick sensitivity and significant selectivity. The sensor based on Co-Fe2O3/SmFeO3 with MIT to 5 ppm methanol gas at 155 degrees C was 19.7 while the response to other test gases lower than 9. The superior sensing performance of composites attributes to the different Fermi levels of CoFe2O3 and SmFeO3 so that the electron delivered across the Co-Fe2O3/SmFeO3 interfaces through band. The results reveal that Co-Fe2O3/SmFeO3 would be a promising methanol gas sensing materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, a directed graph is used to describe the interaction topology of the addressed multi-agent system and a stochastic variable obeying the Bernoulli distributed white sequences is incorporated to represent the randomness of delay. By utilizing the Lyapunov's direct method and some matrix operations, a sufficient condition for mean-square asymptotic consensus of the addressed system is derived. Subsequently, the explicit characterization of the resilient control gain is obtained by means of linear matrix inequalities that can be effectively solved by using the ideas of convex optimization. An academic example is eventually presented to illustrate the significance and potency of the proposed control design strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sensor was obtained by modifying SPE successively with carboxylic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNs-COOH) as signal amplifying element and Eu(III) ion-imprinted membrane (Eu(III)-IIM) as specific recognition material. To avoid damaging SPE by thermal initiation, the Eu(III)-IIM was prepared via radical photopolymerization at 380 nm using azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. Differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was used for determination of Eu3+ by the obtained sensor. After the detection condition was optimized in detail, the sensor showed a linear response to Eu3+ in the concentration range of 1.0 x 10(-7)-1.0 x 10(-3)molL(-1) with the detection limit of 4.0 x 10(-8)molL(-1). The obtained sensor possesses of good regeneration, stability and practicability, it can maintain more than 95% of its original response after used more than 30 times or stored in the water for two months. The satisfactory results with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.5% (n = 5) were obtained for the determination of europium in water samples by the novel sensor.

However, the ecological signal provided by the fossils captured in this deposit may not reflect accurately the in-life community, with transport and decay of carcasses being the principal processes responsible for potential modification. The principal fossil-bearing interval (Maotianshan Shale Member, Yu'anshan Formation) is comprised of claystones of two distinct depositional origins: the "background" beds represent slow hemipelagic deposition into deep waters, while the "event" beds represent distal turbidites or storm-generated beds. Each bed type has a distinct fossil assemblage and preservation mode underscoring the importance of interpreting the palaeoenvironment of each bed type. Here, we interpret palaeo-redox conditions for both the background beds and the event beds by conducting a systematic geochemical study using iron speciation, delta S-34(py), delta C-13(carb), delta(13)G(TOC) and molybdenum abundance. These data are from the most complete core recovered from the Chengjiang fossiliferous units and allow us to distinguish redox conditions where the animals lived, and where they were buried and exceptionally preserved. Our results demonstrate that background beds were dominated by dysoxic conditions; here, a diverse sponge community tolerant of low-oxygen conditions lived. In contrast, the shallower shelf and offshore-transitional environments, where event beds were sourced, were almost persistently oxic, and it was here where the diverse Chengjiang Biota flourished. Thus, the Chengjiang sediments record two distinct palaeocommunities within the background and the event beds. The contrasting redox conditions in close spatial proximity likely facilitated the soft-bodied fossil preservation. Our findings provide a valuable case study in the necessity to understand ecological composition and exceptional preservation informed by environmental context.

With the growth of proxy records for decades, however, both its nature and its spatial pattern have become controversial. Here we examined multi-proxy data of the grain-size distribution, ostracode assemblage, pollen assemblage, and the pollen-reconstructed mean annual precipitation from a sediment core at Hulun Lake in northeastern Inner Mongolia spanning the period between 5000 and 3000 cal. yr BP to identify the nature and the associated mechanism of the 4.2 ka BP event occurring in the monsoonal region of eastern Asia. Higher sand fraction contents, littoral ostracode abundances, and Chenopodiaceae pollen percentages together with lower mean annual precipitation reveal a significant dry event at the interval of 4210-3840 cal. yr BP that could be a regional manifestation of the 4.2 ka BP event in the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). We suggest that the drought would be caused by a decline in the intensity of the EASM on millennial-to-centennial scales that could be physically related to persistent cooling of surface waters in the western tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic. The cooling of western tropical Pacific surface waters could reduce moisture production over the source area of the EASM, while the cooling of North Atlantic surface waters could suppress northward migrations of the EASM rain belt, both leading to a weakened EASM and thus decreased rainfall in the northern margin of the EASM.

The L-cysteine can offer the amine groups and meanwhile anchor on the surface of g-C3N4 during solvothermal reaction and thus contributes greatly to the enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption capability. This Z-scheme photocatalytic reduction mechanism of Aupg-C3N4/SnS performs valuable functions in the reaction, leading to CH4 generation much earlier and higher concentration than that of Aupg-C3N4. Meanwhile, the unique yolk-shell structure can make the light bounce back and forth in the cavity and thus enhances the availability ratio of light. The application of small amount of noble metal cocatalysts and the large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas are also benefited for the enhanced photocatalytic activities. Hence, this novel material exhibits a distinguished reduction performance for CO2 reduction under visible light. The highest yields of CH4 (3.8 mu mol g(-1)), CH3OH (5.3 mu mol g(-1)), and CO (17.1 mu mol g(-1)) can be obtained for the sample of Aupg-C3N4/SnS (SnS 41.5%), which is higher than other latest reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction including coupled with semiconductors and noble metal cocatalysts. This strategy might represent a novel way for the effective transition of CO2 to clean fuels and can also be enormous feasible utilization in the photocatalytic field.

Phonon fingerprints of CsPb2Br5	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						lead halides; Raman spectroscopy; lattice dynamics	HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; LEAD BROMIDE; SOLAR-CELLS; CSPBBR3; GROWTH	CsPb2Br5 is a stable, water-resistant, material derived from CsPbBr3 perovskite and featuring two-dimensional Pb-Br framework separated by Cs layers. Both compounds can coexist at nano-length scale, which often produces conflicting optical spectroscopy results. We present a complete set of polarized Raman spectra of non-luminescent CsPb2Br5 single crystals that reveals the symmetry and frequency of non-degenerate Raman active phonons accessible from the basal (001) plane. The experimental results are in good agreement with density functional perturbation theory simulations, which suggests that the calculated frequencies of yet unobserved double degenerate Raman and infrared phonons are also reliable. Unlike CsPbBr3, the lattice dynamics of CsPb2Br5 is stable as evidenced by the calculated phonon dispersion. The sharp Raman lines and lack of a dynamic-disorder-induced central peak in the spectra at room temperature indicate that the coupling of Cs anharmonic motion to Br atoms, known to cause the dynamic disorder in CsPbBr3, is absent in CsPb2Br5.

In our simulations, the turbulent component of background plasma is taken into account by introducing a 3D Kolmogorov-like power spectrum. The simulation results indicate (i) the different orientations of the interstellar magnetic field around SNRs and lines of sight could produce different polarized radio emission shells, (ii) the fraction of polarization may be decreased through integrating the synchrotron emissivities along the line of sight, which is mainly due to the emission from the strong turbulent and disordered region of the magnetic field, and (iii) the total intensity is strong in some regions where the polarization degree is low.

However, one bottleneck of the anode materials for LIBs is the poor cycling performance caused by the fact that the anodes cannot maintain their integrity over several charge-discharge cycles. In this article, a zinc-based two-dimensional coordination polymer [Zn(bcbpy)(0.5)(PTA)(H2O)] (Zn-BCP) has been synthesized (H(2)bcbpy2Cl = 1,1-bis(3-carboxylatobenzyl)-(4,4-bipyridinium) dichloride, PTA = terephthalic acid), which was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Because of the presence of electron-deficient bipyridinium moieties, Zn-BCP can easily undergo photoinduced electron transfer and eye-detectable photochromic behavior. Moreover, its luminescence can be switched by UV-Vis light irradiation. When Zn-BCP acts as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, it can deliver a high reversible capacity of 386.2 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles and a high capacity retention of 93.1% after 1000 cycles at a high rate of 200 mA g(-1), which is supposed to be due to the flexible structure characteristic of the proposed anode. The high capacity may be mainly ascribed to rich insertion sites arising from the aromatic ligands and all of the aromatic ligands are taking part in lithium storage.

This paper presents the preparation and the corrosive and bioactive characterizations of (Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-HA (hydroxyapatite) composites with the synergistic effects of excellent mechanical properties of Ti-13Nb13Zr alloy and bioactivity of HA ceramic. (Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-HA composites possessed matrix of beta-Ti phase, residual of alpha-Ti phase and ceramic phases (TCP, CaZrO3, CaO and Ti5P(3)). With the increase of HA concentration, the increase of ceramic phases and the hindering effect of alpha to beta phase were observed. Results of electrochemical tests revealed that composites containing 0-10 wt.% HA exhibited higher corrosion resistance. Increasing HA concentrations (15-20 wt.%) deteriorated corrosion resistance by reasons of porosity and defects induced by reactions between alloy powders and HA ceramic. Bioactivity tests showed surface of composites after soaking in simulated body fluid spontaneously nucleated and precipitated bone-like apatite layers. Biological analysis revealed that presence of spindle-like morphology with multiple filopodia-like intercellular connections from bone mesenchymal stem cells possessed good behaviours and enhanced cell viabilities attested the good biocompatibility and bioactivity of (Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-HA composites.

J	He, J; Yang, B; Dong, M; Wang, YS				He, Jun; Yang, Bin; Dong, Min; Wang, Yunshang			Crossing the roof of the world: Trade in medicinal plants from Nepal to China	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Access; Extra-legal; Global value chain; Sustainability; Himalaya; Tibet	TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; FUNGUS OPHIOCORDYCEPS-SINENSIS; AROMATIC PLANTS; CONSERVATION; LIVELIHOODS; MANAGEMENT; COLLECTION; BUSINESS; INCOME	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Trade in medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) between Nepal and China has taken place for centuries along the Tibetan border. While there is anecdotal evidence that economic development in China over the past decades, coupled with regional infrastructure development and increasing market integration, has substantially changed this trade, there are no current published studies investigating this, e.g. in terms of species and market structure. This knowledge gap impedes the development of public interventions, e.g. in support of sustainable trade. Aim of this study: The primary objective of this study is to provide the first informative insights into the Nepal China trade in MAPs, with particular emphasis on the value chain in Tibet. Methods and materials: Data was collected from December 2015 to August 2016 in Nepal and Tibet. The data collection included standardized questionnaires to understand and map the value chain of MAPs, including the actors involved and key governance issues. Data was collected from Katmandu-based MAPs wholesalers exporting from Nepal to China, (n = 6) and with regional wholesalers (n = 40) based in Tibet. The questionnaires contained quantitative and qualitative components focusing on key elements of the MAPs value chain, e.g. the traded species and their values. This was augmented with qualitative interviews with Lhasa-based processors (n = 4) and government officials (n = 12) working in border controls, customs, and/or drug administration. We also collected official statistics on the Nepal-China MAPs trade and conducted a workshop in Lhasa with traders and government officials to discuss the nature of the Nepal-China MAPs trade. Results: The Nepal-China MAPs trade boomed after 2011 when the value of traded plants increased more than nine-fold. This rapid increase reflected both a broader species composition and higher unit prices in response to increasing demand from China. The trade expansion was also driven by increasing demand in China and facilitated by improved infrastructure in Nepal and Tibet, including direct flight connections for the transport of high-value products. Official records on both sides of the border under-document both the value and the volume of the trade, implying that much of it is extra-legal. The value chain is thus governed by both legal and extra-legal mechanisms. Conclusion: This study provides the first structured overview of the current trade in commercial MAPs from Nepal to China. While the trade is thriving, growing in both volume and value to the benefit of producers in Nepal and consumers in China, there is little empirical data or research to support policy formulation on sustainable trading. This study provides informative insights into the value chain and makes public policy recommendations to increase the transparency and sustainability of trade by improving traditional border markets and removing market barriers.

Thus, proteasome inhibitors represent an attractive class of anticancer agents, and bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib have been FDA-approved to treat multiple myeloma. However, cancer cells acquire resistance to these inhibitors through point mutations in the proteasome catalytic subunit or induction of alternative compensatory mechanisms. In this study, we identified a quinolin-chlorobenzothioate, QCBT7, as a new proteasome inhibitor showing cytotoxicity in a panel of cancer cell lines. QCBT7 is a more stable derivative of quinoline-8-thiol that targets the regulatory subunit instead of the catalytic subunit of the proteasome. QCBT7 caused the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the cancer cells, indicating its proteasome inhibitory activity. Additionally, QCBT7 increased the expression of a set of genes (PFKFB4, CHOP, HMOX1 and SLC7A11) at both nascent RNA and protein levels, similarly to the known proteasome inhibitors MG132 and ixazomib. Together, QCBT7 induces proteasome inhibition, hypoxic response, endoplasmic reticulum stress and glycolysis, finally leading to cell death. Importantly, we have identified PFKFB4 as a potential biomarker of proteasome inhibitors that can be used to monitor treatment response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The reaction showed excellent functional group compatibility and site selectivity. We demonstrated that -amino amide forming N,N-bidentate coordination with Pd catalyst is more favorable for the -arylation of ketones than -amino acid forming N,O-bidentate coordination with Pd catalyst under relatively mild conditions. This elegant approach provides straightforward access to important structural motifs in organic and medicinal chemistry and is demonstrated here in the efficient synthesis of phenanthridinone alkaloids.

Considering the central catadioptric system, a straight line is projected into a circle on the viewing spherical surface for the first projection. The tangent lines in a group at antipode point pairs with respect to the circle are parallel, with the infinity point being the intersection point; therefore, the infinity line can be obtained from two groups of antipode point pairs. Further, the direction of the polar line of an infinity point with respect to the circle is orthogonal to the direction of its infinity point. Hence, on the imaging plane, images of the circular points or orthogonal vanishing points are used to determine the intrinsic parameters. On the basis of the properties of the antipodal point pairs and a least-squares fitting, a corresponding optimization algorithm for line image fitting is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the two calibration methods, that is, for images of the circular points and orthogonal vanishing points.

As an important ecological corridor connecting China's southwest and Southeast Asia, the Red River Basin is characterized by vulnerable ecosystems and serious soil erosion. Identifying the heterogeneity in vegetation coverage and its response to climatic factors are critical for ecological protection and soil and water conservation. MOD13Q1 NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 250 m and 16 d temporal resolution were collected from 2000 to 2014. The maximum synthesis method, univariate linear regression, Hurst exponent, and partial correlation analysis were used to detect the spatiotemporal variation and sustainability of vegetation coverage and characterize the relationship between vegetation NDVI and climatic factors in the wet season in the Red River Basin. NDVI showed a rather significant increasing trend in the wet season. The "corridor-barrier" function of valleys and mountains affected the spatiotemporal patterns in the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region. Areas of improved, degraded, and stable vegetation coverage accounted for 50.1%, 27.1%, and 22.8% of the total, respectively. The role of precipitation was higher than temperature in the interaction between NDVI and climatic factors. A time lag effect was found in the NDVI response to rainfall and temperature variation. Different vegetation types showed various spatiotemporal responses to climatic factors. Human activities, especially the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GFGP), affected the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation coverage.

The bacterium was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Pairwise comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 730227(T) is closely related to Phenylobacterium lituiforme FaiI3(T) (97.5% sequence similarity), Phenylobacterium muchangponense A8(T) (97.4%), Phenylobacterium panacis DCY109(T) (97.1%), Phenylobacterium immobile E-T (97.1%) and Phenylobacterium composti 4T-6(T) (97.0%), while also sharing 98.0% sequence similarity with Phenylobacterium hankyongense HKS-05(T) after NCBI blast, showing it represents a member of the family Caulobacteraceae. The major respiratory quinone was Q-10 and the major fatty acids were C-16:0,C- summed feature 8 (comprising C(18:1)7c and/or C(18:1)6c), C(18:1)7c 11-methyl and C-17:0. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, unidentified glycolipids, phospholipid and unidentified lipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.2mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain YIM 730227(T) with P. hankyongense HKS-05(T), P. lituiforme FaiI3(T), P. muchangponense A8(T), P. panacis DCY109(T), P. immobile E-T and P. composti 4T-6(T) were 31.3 +/- 0.6, 26.1 +/- 0.2, 24.3 +/- 0.1, 21.8 +/- 0.9, 19.8 +/- 0.6 and 18.2 +/- 1.1%, respectively, values lower than 70%. Besides the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences and the biochemical characteristics indicated that the strain YIM 730227(T) represents a novel member of the genus Phenylobacterium, for which the name Phenylobacterium terrae sp. nov.

We estimated pollinator-mediated selection through female function in L-morph (long-style and short-anther phenotype) and S-morph (short-style and long-anther phenotype) flowers among four Primula secundiflora populations with different pollinator assemblages. Variation in pollinator assemblage strongly contributed to differences in reproductive success among populations and between morphs of the primrose species. A wider corolla tube width was selected in the bumblebee-dominated populations, whereas shorter corolla tube length and wider corolla tube width were selected in the syrphid fly-dominated populations. Morph-specific variation in pollinator-mediated selection on corolla tube length was detected in the syrphid fly-dominated populations. A shorter corolla tube was selected in the L-morph flowers. However, similar selective pressure on this trait was not observed in the S-morph flowers. These results show that variation in pollinator assemblage leads to variation in selection in space and between morphs. The findings highlight the potential forces of different pollinator agents in driving floral evolution in this primrose species.

J	Tian, BQ; Fan, K; Yang, HQ				Tian, Baoqiang; Fan, Ke; Yang, Hongqing			East Asian winter monsoon forecasting schemes based on the NCEP's climate forecast system	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						East Asian winter monsoon; Year-to-year increment method; Hybrid prediction; CFSv2	SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEASONAL PREDICTION; RIVER VALLEY; CIRCUMGLOBAL TELECONNECTION; ANTARCTIC OSCILLATION; ARCTIC-OSCILLATION; SUMMER MONSOON; IMPACTS; YANGTZE	The East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is the major climate system in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal winter. In this study, we developed two schemes to improve the forecasting skill of the interannual variability of the EAWM index (EAWMI) using the interannual increment prediction method, also known as the DY method. First, we found that version 2 of the NCEP's Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) showed higher skill in predicting the EAWMI in DY form than not. So, based on the advantage of the DY method, Scheme-I was obtained by adding the EAWMI DY predicted by CFSv2 to the observed EAWMI in the previous year. This scheme showed higher forecasting skill than CFSv2. Specifically, during 1983-2016, the temporal correlation coefficient between the Scheme-I-predicted and observed EAWMI was 0.47, exceeding the 99% significance level, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased by 12%. The autumn Arctic sea ice and North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are two important external forcing factors for the interannual variability of the EAWM. Therefore, a second (hybrid) prediction scheme, Scheme-II, was also developed. This scheme not only involved the EAWMI DY of CFSv2, but also the sea-ice concentration (SIC) observed the previous autumn in the Laptev and East Siberian seas and the temporal coefficients of the third mode of the North Pacific SST in DY form. We found that a negative SIC anomaly in the preceding autumn over the Laptev and the East Siberian seas could lead to a significant enhancement of the Aleutian low and East Asian westerly jet in the following winter. However, the intensity of the winter Siberian high was mainly affected by the third mode of the North Pacific autumn SST. Scheme-I and Scheme-II also showed higher predictive ability for the EAWMI in negative anomaly years compared to CFSv2. More importantly, the improvement in the prediction skill of the EAWMI by the new schemes, especially for Scheme-II, could enhance the forecasting skill of the winter 2-m air temperature (T-2m) in most parts of China, as well as the intensity of the Aleutian low and Siberian high in winter. The new schemes provide a theoretical basis for improving the prediction of winter climate in China.

In recent decades, dozens of yield-associated genes in rice have been cloned, many of which can increase production in the form of loss or degeneration of function. However, mutations occurring randomly under natural conditions have provided very limited genetic resources for yield increases. In this study, potentially yield-increasing alleles of two genes closely associated with yield were edited artificially. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to edit two yield genes: Grain number la (Gn1a) and DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 (DEP1). Several mutants were identified by a target sequence analysis. Phenotypic analysis confirmed one mutant allele of Gn1a and three of DEP1 conferring yield superior to that conferred by other natural high-yield alleles. Our results demonstrate that favorable alleles of the Gn1a and DEP1 genes, which are considered key factors in rice yield increases, could be developed by artificial mutagenesis using genome editing technology.

We recorded 15 medium- to large-sized mammal species including 9 carnivores, 4 ungulates, 1 primate, and 1 rodent. Six of the species were categorized by IUCN as globally threatened. The results suggested that the sacred mountain was particularly important for alpine ungulates. The mean occupancy probabilities of blue sheep Pseudois nayaur, Chinese goral Naemorhedus griseus, Chinese serow Capricornis milneedwardsii, and alpine musk deer Moschus chrysogaster were 0.93, 0.91, 0.87, and 0.44 respectively. Domestic dog Canis familiaris also occurs widely across the mountain, with a mean occupancy of 0.60. Temporal activity patterns showed that alpine musk deer were mostly nocturnal, with most captures occurring at night. Chinese serow were active at all periods, with an activity peak at dawn. Blue sheep were strictly diurnal, without any captures at night. Although Chinese goral were predominantly diurnal, captures also frequently occurred at night. Our study not only unveiled a wildlife haven benefiting from religious beliefs about sacred mountains but also pointed to the critical situation of the fauna in the sacred site. The fauna in such sacred sites are diverse but poorly studied, and are subject to threats from domestic dogs, garbage pollution, and population isolation. Future conservation and management efforts in such areas should evaluate the population genetic diversity and assess the impact of non-lethal human disturbance on the wildlife communities.

As a result, three recombinatorial mutants named CS/astm21-1, CS/asm21-2 and CS/asm21-4 were successfully constructed. Three mutants and wild type CS were cultured on solid medium, and the extracts were detected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The LC-MS profiles showed several unknown peaks that were present in the spectra of extracts of the CS/asm21-4 cultured on oatmeal solid medium. Then, three new naphthomycins O-Q (1-3), a new macrolide hookerolide (4) as well as nine known compounds were obtained from the solid cultured medium. Their structures were identified by spectra data. These new compounds showed moderate antimicrobial activities.

Based on the biogenesis analysis, tremulane sesquiterpenes were obtained from Irpex lacteus by the stimulation of mixed-culture. The antifungal selectivities of metabolites produced by fungus against their co-culture fungus and common pathogens, exhibited competitive interaction of this mix-culture. The tremulane sesquiterpene conocenol B produced by I. lacteus through the induction of Nigrospora oryzae showed selectivity of anti-fungal activity against its coculture fungus, N. oryzae, with MICs at 16 mu g/mL and 128 mu g/mL against I. lacteus. The fungus can metabolize these new compounds to inhibit the growth of co-culture fungus while not inhibiting its own growth.

This important yet difficult intelligent video analysis problem remains a vigorous area of research due to demands for performance improvements. Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Handcrafted features, such as color and texture histograms, are frequently used for person re-identification, but most handcrafted features are limited by not being directly applicable to practical problems. Deep learning methods have obtained the state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of applications, including image annotation, face recognition, and speech recognition. However, deep learning features are heavily dependent on large-scale labeling of samples. In this paper, by utilizing the Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) metric learning, we propose a novel scheme called deep multi-view feature learning (DMVFL), which exploits the collaboration between handcrafted and deep learning features in a simple but effective way. Furthermore, we prove that the XQDA is a robust algorithm. Extensive experiments on two challenging person re-identification data sets (VIPeR and GRID) demonstrate that DMVFL improves on current state-of-the-art methods.

The results show that there was no significant variation in the euphotic depth (Z(eu)) across the four seasons, and no significant correlations between Z(eu) and potential influencing factors in seasons other than summer, suggesting that the water itself may be a major factor regulating the Z(eu) in general. Nevertheless, significant differences in Z(et), between the north region (NR) and the south region (SR) were observed in all seasonal tests except spring. This finding relates to a higher abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the NR due to runoff, especially in the rainy seasons (summer and autumn). CDOM and its terrigenous component had an important impact on Z(eu) in summer, with the highest precipitation, and impacts from suspended solids and non-algal particles were also found in the NR in summer. The Secchi disk depth in the lake decreased clearly over the years, with significantly negative correlations with the increasing permanganate index and air temperature, implying that organic contaminants (CDOM and/or phytoplankton) are important regulators of water transparency. We estimate that the combined effects of climate warming and changes in land use and land cover are also indirect regulating factors. These findings should be considered in the protection of Lake Fuxian, owing to the importance of light penetration in aquatic ecosystems.

A dynamic model to study the flow of the Koxkar Glacier is used. Ice velocity, ice viscosity, and the stress variation at different depths were studied. The aim was to compare the change in the glacier's physical characteristics with changes in air temperature, analyze the movement mechanism at different temperatures in different seasons, and identify why temperature is the main driving force of glacier movement and change. The results show that the surface stresses have similar trends in different seasons, and that the stress in winter is larger than that in summer. This causes the ice body to break and promotes crack formation. Ice viscosity has an obvious seasonal variation, and this is especially noticeable for near-surface ice viscosity.

This indicates that the stress at the bottom is mainly affected by glacier morphology, hydrological characteristics, and geothermal flow.

In this study, aqueous biphasic systems (ABSs) consisting of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ionic liquids (ILs) (alkyl = butyl, hexyl, and octyl) and phosphate-based salts were studied for extraction of gold(I) from alkaline aurocyanide solutions for the first time. The results indicated that gold(I) preferentially migrated into the IL-rich phase, achieving remarkable extraction efficiency up to 99.9%. The extraction mechanism of gold(I) was evaluated based on characterization by FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results revealed the electrostatic interaction between gold(I) cyanide complex and IL was the main driving force for gold(I) partition. The migration of gold(I) into IL-rich phase was associated with an extraction mechanism by ion pair formation of [C(n)mim(+)]center dot[Au(CN)(2)(-)]. Furthermore, the microscopic structure of the IL-rich solution was also determined by transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the presence of [Au(CN)(2)(-)] anion induced the aggregation of ionic liquids. Finally, the gold present in IL-rich phase was successfully recovered by direct electrodeposition on a copper cathode. The proposed extraction strategy using IL-based ABSs is envisaged as potential platform for the green partition of gold(I) from alkaline aurocyanide solution.

Comparisons of per capita effects of invaders and comparable natives are useful to assess such impacts. Here, we explore ingestion rates (IR) and clearance rates (CR) of Ciona intestinalis and Ciona robusta, co-occurring native and non-native ascidians, respectively, from Brittany, France. IR was positively related to food concentration, with the invader responding more strongly to increasing food concentration. CR also differed by species, with the invader demonstrating higher values. C. robusta exhibited a higher functional response (Type I) than did C. intestinalis (Type II). Relative impact measured using seasonal abundance and IR revealed that C. robusta has a much greater impact than C. intestinalis at all food concentrations tested, though the former has a constrained distribution which limits its regional impact. Nevertheless, when abundant, we expect C. robusta to exert a greater impact on algal foods.

The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurement, UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectrum (PL) spectra. The results show that V and Co co-doping has significant effects on sample average crystalline grain size, absorption spectrum, recombination efficiency of photo-induced electron-hole pairs (EHPs), and photocatalytic degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB). (V,Co)-TiO2 photocatalyst exhibits an obvious red shift of the absorption edge to 475 nm. Photocatalytic degradation rate of (V,Co)-TiO2 sample for MB in 60 min is 92.12% under a Xe lamp with a cut-off filter ( > 400 nm), which is significantly higher than 56.55% of P25 under the same conditions. The first principles calculation results show that V and Co ions doping introduces several impurity energy levels, which can modulate the location of the valence band and conduction band. An obvious lattice distortion is produced in the meantime, resulting in the decrease in photo-generated EHP recombination. Thus, (V,Co)-TiO2 photocatalyst performance is significantly improved.

Previous research has demonstrated that the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays an essential role in regulating immune response to a variety of vaccines. This study aims to investigate the relationship between HLA polymorphisms and immunogenicity of RV vaccine. A nested case-control study was carried out among infants enrolled in phase III clinical trial of trivalent human-lamb reassortant vaccine (RV3) in Henan province, China. Serum RV specific immunoglobulin A (RV-IgA) was detected before and after a 3-dose vaccination series, followed by calculation of seroconversion rates. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in RV-IgA titers between pre-vaccination and 1-month post-dose 3 vaccination. The infants who seroconverted were defined as responders, and the others without seroconversion were considered as non-responders. Their HLA genotypes were obtained by using the sequence-based typing method. The HLA allele and supertype frequencies of 2 groups were analyzed statistically. Eighty-three of 133 infants seroconverted after vaccination. Twenty-one HLA-A, 45 HLA-B, 24 HLA-Cw, 29 HLA-DRB1 and 16 HLA-DQB1 distinct alleles were detected. The frequency of HLA-B*4001 (corrected P=.01, adjusted OR=0.152, 95% CI=0.0480.475) in non-responder group was significantly higher than that in responder group. Furthermore, significant association was found between HLA-B44 supertype (corrected P=.02, adjusted OR=0.414, 95% CI=0.225-0.763) and RV non-response. Certain HLA allele (HLA-B*4001) and supertype (HLA-B44) are potentially associated with non-response after immunization with the novel RV3 vaccine in Chinese infants.

It is generally recognized among modern pteridologists. However, its infrageneric relationships and species diversity have been unclear and controversial. The molecular studies so far have had small taxon and character sampling. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 158 accessions representing ca. 40 out of ca. 50 known species of Hymenasplenium, and 16 species of Asplenium were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) Hymenasplenium as currently defined is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) three major clades representing early splits in Hymenasplenium are identified, with the Old World species being strongly supported as monophyletic; it is ambiguous if the New World species are monophyletic; (3) extensive cryptic speciation in the Old World is discovered demonstrating the complexity of evolution of the genus; and (4) six strongly or moderately supported subclades in the Old World Glade are revealed, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features.

Fullerene derivatives bearing either an alkyl side chain or ethylene glycol (EG) side chains of different lengths are used as the host molecules for molecular doping. It is found that the polar EG side chains can enable better miscibility with the polar dopant than the alkyl side chain, which leads to more than 5-fold enhancement of doping efficiency. Beyond the doping efficiency, another crucial parameter of molecular doping, the molecular order, is readily acquired by simultaneous control of the polarity and the length of the side chain. A polar side chain with an appropriate chain length can contribute to increasing Seebeck coefficients of doped fullerene derivatives more effectively than an alkyl side chain, likely due to the resultant good miscibility and high molecular order. As a result, an optimized power factor of 23.1 mu W m(-1) K-2 is achieved in the fullerene derivative with a tetraethylene glycol side chain. This represents one of the best n-type organic thermoelectrics. Additionally, EG side chains can improve the air stability of n-doped fullerene derivatives films as compared to an alkyl side chain. Our work sheds light on the design of side-chains in efficient n-type small molecules thermoelectric materials and contributes to the understanding of their thermoelectric properties.

J	Wang, LJ; Mi, M; Zhou, JX; Luo, K				Wang, Lin-Jun; Mi, Mei; Zhou, Jia-Xi; Luo, Kai			New constraints on the origin of the Maozu carbonate-hosted epigenetic Zn-Pb deposit in NE Yunnan Province, SW China	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS			English	Article						NanoSIMS in situ S isotopes; LA-MC-ICPMS in situ Pb isotopes; Bulk Sr isotopes; Ore formation processes; The Upper Yangtze Zn-Pb metallogenic province, South China	THERMOCHEMICAL SULFATE REDUCTION; VALLEY-TYPE DEPOSITS; IN-SITU PB; C-O-S; SULFUR ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS; LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCE; ION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SOUTHWEST CHINA; RB-SR; ORE GENESIS	Micro-scale isotopic compositions determined by micro-beam in situ analysis techniques are expected to provide new information for the understanding of ore genesis. Here we use the Maozu (similar to 20 Mt of sulfide ore, grading 7.25 wt% Zn and 4.15 wt% Pb) Zn-Pb deposit in the Upper Yangtze Zn-Pb metallogenic province as a case study, utilizing NanoSIMS in situ S, femtosecond LA-MC-ICPMS in situ Pb and conventional bulk Sr isotopes, as well as field data, aimed to reveal its origin and ore formation process. NanoSIMS in situ delta S-34 values of sulfide minerals from the Maozu deposit have a wider range (+5.9-+20.7 parts per thousand) than that of bulk delta S-34 values (+9.9-+19.9 parts per thousand). Such S isotope signatures reflect the enrichment of heavy S isotopes in ore-forming fluids, and further indicate the source of S is multiple reservoirs (e.g. marine evaporites, coeval seawater, and metamorphic rocks/fluids). Pb isotopic ratios of galena determined by LA-MC-ICPMS in situ techniques have a narrower range ((206)pb/Pb-204 = 18.20-18.21, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.69-15.71 and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.40-38.43) than that of bulk Pb isotopic ratios (Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.13-18.38, (207)pb/(204)pb = 15.64-15.69 and (208)pb/(204)pb = 38.22-38.58). This implies that in situ Pb isotopes can truly reflect the source of Pb, which is due to impurities enclosed by sulfide crystals and pollutants introduced by chemical analysis could significantly affect the quality of the bulk Pb isotopic data. Compared with previously reported Pb isotopic data of potential source rocks (i.e. late Permian Emeishan basalts, Paleozoic ore-bearing sedimentary rocks and Proterozoic basement metamorphic rocks), the in situ Pb isotopic data are significantly different from those of basalts, but are similar to those of both basements and sediments. This means that metal-rich fluids were mainly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments. Sphalerite separates have initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.711-0.719) that are distinctly different from those of ore formation age-corrected basalts (Sr-87/Sr-86(200) (Ma) = 0.704-0.708) and basements (Sr-87/Sr-86(200) (Ma) = 0.724-0.729), whereas partly overlap with those of age-corrected sediments (Sr-87/Sr-86(200) (Ma) = 0.707-0.714). Such Sr isotope signatures suggest that hydrothermal fluids were predominantly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments with a certain influence from basalts. Hence, the Maozu deposit has complex source rocks that are related to the local geological setting. The mixing of metal-rich fluids (related to basements and sediments, and even basalts) and S-bearing fluids (associated with multiple S reservoirs) plays a key role in the formation of sulfide ores. Therefore, the Maozu deposit, formed during Early Mesozoic (similar to 196 Ma), is an epigenetic Zn-Pb deposit that hosts in carbonate rocks, occurs along fault-fold structures, and has a mixed source of mineralizing elements and associated fluids.

In general, the parameters of S-PCNN are set manually, which is complex and time-consuming and usually causes inconsistence. In this paper, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to overcome these shortcomings and improve fusion performance. Firstly, source images are divided into several equidimension sub-blocks, and then, spatial frequency is calculated as the characteristic factor of the sub-block to get the whole source image's characterization factor matrix (CFM), and by this way the operand can be effectively reduced. Secondly, S-PCNN is used for the analysis of the CFM to get its oscillation frequency graph (OFG). Thirdly, the fused CFM will be got according to the OFG. Finally, the fused image will be reconstructed according to the fused CFM and block rule. In this process, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to get the best fusion effect. By CFM and block method, the operand of the proposed method will be effectively reduced. The experiments indicate that the multi-focus image fusion algorithm is more efficient than other traditional image fusion algorithms, and it proves that the automatically parameters setting method is effective as well.

The direct metal deposition relies on the relative position of Si Fermi level and the equilibrium potential of the metal/ion and H+/H-2 in electrolyte. Direct deposition of above mentioned metals shows three types of light-induced plating (LIP) behavior. Even with a relative large potential barrier, Cu2+ /Cu and Bi3+ /Bi could be deposited by the induced plating of the hydrogen evolution. The current density of the Co2+/Co and Ni2+/Ni have been reduced by the light absorption of the electrolyte impact on the solar cell. This work demonstrated the Si solar cells can be used to provide self-powered for metal deposition which can be used in the heavy metal treatment for the polluted water.

Enhancement of plasmon-photon coupling in grating coupled graphene inside a Fabry-Perot cavity	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Graphene; Fabry-Perot cavity; Plasmon-polariton; Coupling enhancement	SOLAR-CELLS; POLARITONS; EXCITATION; ULTRAFAST; OPTICS; MODES	We present a theoretical investigation of the plasmon-polariton modes in grating coupled graphene inside a Fabry-Perot cavity. The cavity or photon modes of the device are determined by the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations and the corresponding plasmon-polariton modes are obtained by applying a many-body self-consistent field theory. We find that in such a device structure, the electric field strength of the incident electromagnetic (EM) field can be significantly enhanced near the edges of the grating strips. Thus, the strong coupling between the EM field and the plasmons in graphene can be achieved and the features of the plasmon-polariton oscillations in the structure can be observed. It is found that the frequencies of the plasmon-polariton modes are in the terahertz (THz) bandwidth and depend sensitively on electron density which can be tuned by applying a gate voltage. Moreover, the coupling between the cavity photons and the plasmons in graphene can be further enhanced by increasing the filling factor of the device. This work can help us to gain an in-depth understanding of the THz plasmonic properties of graphene-based structures.	[Zhao, C.

During the development process, countries intend to balance between stabilizing export demand and maintaining sustainable economic improvement in the context of deteriorating global warming and climate change. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (henceforth, EKC) was originally developed to estimate the correlation between environment condition and economic development. In this paper, we started from the EKC model and adopted an Error Correction Methodology (henceforth, ECM) to estimate the EKC relationships in Japan, Korea (two developed countries), and China (a developing country) over the period of 1990 to 2013. Besides this, instead of only using Gross Domestic Product (henceforth, GDP), two subdivisions of trade diversification-export product diversification and export market diversification-are introduced as proxy variables for economic development in rectification of the EKC. The results demonstrate that both Korea and Japan satisfy the EKC theory by demonstrating an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic development and ecological footprint, while analysis based on data from China does not display the same tendency. For both export product diversification and market diversification, the more diversified the country's export is, the bigger its ecological footprint. The policy implications of this econometric outcome are also discussed.

Ten-year integrations were performed using satellite image data from 2000 and 2010 to represent the urban surface distributions and expansions in China. Changes in the precipitation revealed obvious subregional characteristics, which could be explained by the influences of the vertical wind velocity and moisture flux. With urban-related warming, vertical wind motion generally intensified over urban surface-expanded areas. Meanwhile, the increase in impervious surface areas induced rapid rainwater runoff into drains, and the Bowen ratio increased over urban areas, which further contributed to changes in the local moisture fluxes in these regions. The intensities of the changes in precipitation were inconsistent over the three city clusters, although the changes in vertical motion and local evaporation were similar, which indicates that the changes in precipitation cannot be solely explained by the changes in the local evaporation-related moisture flux. The changes in precipitation were also influenced by the changes in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulation and the corresponding moisture flux, which are expressed in marked subregional characteristics. Therefore, the influence of urban-related precipitation over the three city clusters in China, for which changes in moisture flux from both the impacted local evaporation and EASM circulation should be considered, varied based on the precipitation changes of only a single city.

Future flows were projected using six large-scale Global circulation models (GCMs) with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. A newly developed mathematical modeling using particle swarm optimization was incorporated to work out the projected optimal electricity generation from the Xin'anjiang hydropower station. The results reveal that watershed will be warmer by the end of the 21st century with a maximum increase of up to 4.9 degrees C for mean maximum, and 4.8 degrees C for mean minimum temperature. Six GCMs under Representative Concentration pathways (RCPs) showed that future precipitation is complex to predict with certainty and significant differences were observed among the different GCMs. The overall mean monthly and seasonal precipitation increase for most scenarios with the maximum increase during the 2020s and 2080s, whereas 2050s exhibited the lesser increase. Resultantly, there would be an increase in the stream flows during these periods, which was used for electricity production up to 31.41 x 10(8) kW.h.

The nature of cloud computing requires cloud data processing systems that can handle huge volumes of data and have high performance. However, most cloud storage systems currently adopt a hash-like approach to retrieving data that only supports simple keyword-based enquiries, but lacks various forms of information search. Therefore, a scalable and efficient indexing scheme is clearly required. In this paper, we present a skip list-based cloud index, called SLC-index, which is a novel, scalable skip list-based indexing for cloud data processing. The SLC-index offers a two-layered architecture for extending indexing scope and facilitating better throughput. Dynamic load-balancing for the SLC-index is achieved by online migration of index nodes between servers. Furthermore, it is a flexible system due to its dynamic addition and removal of servers. The SLC-index is efficient for both point and range queries. Experimental results show the efficiency of the SLC-index and its usefulness as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures.

J	Guo, YB; Wang, BY; Li, WH; Yang, B				Guo, Yanbu; Wang, Bingyi; Li, Weihua; Yang, Bei			Protein secondary structure prediction improved by recurrent neural networks integrated with two-dimensional convolutional neural networks	JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bioinformatics; protein secondary structure predication (PSSP); convolutional neural networks (CNNs); recurrent neural networks (RNNs); long short-term memory (LSTM); gated recurrent units (GRUs)		Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is an important research field in bioinformatics. The representation of protein sequence features could be treated as a matrix, which includes the amino-acid residue (time-step) dimension and the feature vector dimension. Common approaches to predict secondary structures only focus on the amino-acid residue dimension. However, the feature vector dimension may also contain useful information for PSSP. To integrate the information on both dimensions of the matrix, we propose a hybrid deep learning framework, two-dimensional convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network (2C-BRNN), for improving the accuracy of 8-class secondary structure prediction. The proposed hybrid framework is to extract the discriminative local interactions between amino-acid residues by two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2DCNNs), and then further capture long-range interactions between amino-acid residues by bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) or bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM). Specifically, our proposed 2C-BRNNs framework consists of four models: 2DConv-BGRUs, 2DCNN-BGRUs, 2DConv-BLSTM and 2DCNN-BLSTM. Among these four models, the 2DConv- models only contain two-dimensional (2D) convolution operations. Moreover, the 2DCNN- models contain 2D convolutional and pooling operations. Experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed 2DConv-BLSTM model performs significantly better than the benchmark models. Furthermore, the experiments also demonstrate that the proposed models can extract more meaningful features from the matrix of proteins, and the feature vector dimension is also useful for PSSP. The codes and datasets of our proposed methods are available at https://github.com/guoyanb/JBCB2018/.

The precise phylogenetic affinity of vetulicolians is debated because there is a lack of consensus regarding the interpretation of their anatomical features. Their disparate morphology might even cause one to question whether this is a monophyletic taxon. In total, there are 15 species grouped into three families included in vetulicolians. Here we focus on new specimens of Yuyuanozoon magnificissimi Chen, Feng, and Thu in Chen et al., 2003, a species that was first described from only a single specimen from the Chengjiang Biota (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 3, Eoredlichia-Wutingaspis trilobite Biozone), Yunnan Province, China. The species is notable in being exceptionally large (up to 20 cm long). Morphological observations on the new specimens clarify the nature of the wide circular opening at the presumed anterior end of the animal and the cowl-shaped lateral openings within this anterior section. Taphonomic observations identify wrinkles in the anterior section and twists in the posterior segmented section. In particular, the shape of the anterior opening of Yuyuanozoon magnificissimi suggests significant differences from other vetulicolians. Taxonomic reappraisal of Y. magnificissimi indicates that it belongs within the family Didazoonidae, as that is presently defined.

A novel compound (10-Methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(g)(1,3) diazepino(1,2-a)-(1,8)naphthyridin-6-yl)(phenyl) methanone (named 3u), showed good anticancer activity in the human malignant melanoma cell line A375 via Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay. After Western blotting confirmed, we found that 3u induces necroptosis at low concentrations and apoptosis at high concentrations via the upregulation of death receptors and scaffold protein in A375 cells. Furthermore, by combining 3u with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or Receptor Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (RIP1) kinase inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), we found that the activity of caspase-8 was the crucial factor that determined whether either apoptosis or necroptosis occurred. The results indicate that 3u should be considered as a potential chemical substance for melanoma treatment.

It is proved that the limit of solutions tends to a special delta-shock rather than the classical one to the transport equations. In order to further study this problem, we consider a perturbed flux approximation system and proceed to investigate the limits of solutions. We rigorously proved that, as the flux approximation vanishes, any Riemann solution containing two shock waves tends to a delta-shock to the transport equations; any Riemann solution containing two rarefaction waves tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Moreover, some representative numerical simulations are exhibited to confirm the theoretical analysis. Published by AIP Publishing.

The binding energy calculated using the ONIOM2(M06-2X-D3/6-311 + G(2df,2p):PM6) method is - 369.43 kJ/mol, demonstrating that DB08446 can strongly bind to HIV-1 RT. The pairwise interaction energy analysis at the M06-2X-D3/6-311 + G(2df,2p) and RI-PWPB95-D3/def2-QZVPP levels of theory disclose that there are more attractive interactions than repulsive interactions in the binding site. In particular, residues Lys103, Va1106, Tyr188, and Trp229 were major contributors for DB08446 binding to HIV-1 RT. Further detailed structure analysis and NCI visualization confirm that the H-bond, X-bond, pi-pi, CH center dot center dot center dot pi, and van der Waals interactions, etc. were the dominant stabilization factors of non -bonded interaction between DB08446 and the binding site of HIV-1 RT.

Several methods to estimate the ice volume exist. However, none of them take the specific characteristics of flat terminus debris-covered glaciers into account. We present a method for deriving spatially-distributed ice thickness for debris-covered dendritic glaciers, which are common not only in Central Tien Shan but also in several other mountain ranges in High Asia. The method relies on automatically generated branch lines, observed surface velocities and surface topographic parameters as basic input. Branch lines were generated using Thiessen polygons and Dijkstra's path algorithm. Ice thicknesses for four debris-covered glaciers - South Inylchek, Kaindy, Tomur and Koxkar glaciers - have been estimated along the branch line network solving the equation of laminar flow. For Koxkar and South Inylchek glaciers, respectively, maximum thicknesses of similar to 250 and 380 m were estimated. These results differ by similar to 50 m compared with GPR measurements with an uncertainty for the debris-covered parts of similar to 40%. Based on geodetic mass balances, we estimate that the investigated glaciers lost between 6 and 28% of their volume from 1975 to the early 2000s.

A pathway-based gene-gene interaction (GGI) network model was constructed and analyzed, containing 116 nodes and 1272 connections. The nodes represented EH-related genes, and that connections represented their interactions. The network showed a small-world property and uneven degree distribution, suggesting that a few highly interconnected hubs played a vital role in EH. An inherent hierarchy and assortative mixing pattern were also observed in the network. GNAS, GNB3, PF4 and PPBP showed the highest values of degrees and centrality indices, and were chosen as potential biomarkers of EH. A two-mode network model based on the potential biomarkers demonstrated that hemostasis and GPCR ligand binding pathway were key pathways contributing to EH. Results of this study improve our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving EH. The selected genes and pathways have the potential to be used in the diagnosis and treatment of EH. Moreover, the combination of pathway analysis and complex network methodology provides a novel strategy for searching new genetic indicators of complex diseases.

As a result of these different habitats there are some differences in their sensory systems. Microscopic and submicroscopic structures of olfactory systems in six representative species of Sinocyclocheilus were studied, including one surface-dwelling species (S. grahami), two intermediate species (S. jii and S. macrophthalmus) and three cave-dwelling species (S. brevibarbatus, S. anshuiensis, and S. tianlinensis). Due to adaptive evolution under extreme environmental conditions, cave-dwelling species have more developed olfactory systems. We observed that, compared with surface-dwelling species, the olfactory sac of the cave-dwelling Sinocyclocheilus species has the following characteristics: higher density of cilia, greater length of sensory cilia, many other special structures (micro-ridge, olfactory islet, rod cilia). These results reveal different levels of olfactory system development, consistent with the view that that cave-dwelling species have more developed olfactory systems than intermediate and surface-dwelling species.

Many algorithms have been proposed for the estimation of fingerprints' OF but it is hard to solve the dilemma of correcting spurious ridge structure and avoiding singularity location deviation, especially for poor images. So far, the following drawbacks still need to be solved for OF construction methods for practical application: (1) How to adaptively choose block scales to resolve the contradiction between accuracy and anti-noise, since small scale is beneficial to accuracy but is sensitive to noise, while large scale is more resistant to noise, but the accuracy is deteriorated. (2) How to construct the genuine OF in the areas close-by singular points and to evade singularity location deviation? Current block based methods give spurious OF estimates in the area near singular points because these areas have large curvature thus the detected singular points deviate from the genuine localizations. When these singular points are used as the anchor for referencing minutiae, it makes the average error of matching or recognition even larger. Therefore, it is essentials to construct the genuine OF in the areas close-by singular points and to evade singularity deviation. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a novel method, combining a weighted multi-scale composite window (WMCM) with a hierarchical smoothing strategy has been proposed for the computation of fingerprint OF. This method mainly contains two procedures: the approximate OF estimation and the hierarchical OF smoothing. In the first procedure, a series of OFs are established under multiple scales of composite windows by using a gradient based method then a coarse OF is estimated using the weight of each scale determined by a squared gradient consistency. In the second procedure, the OF is first quantized into a two-digitized orientation zone and a two-orientation-zone filtering strategy is adapted to the OF blocks based on a filtering mask obtained after eliminating the isolated blocks. In the end a similar three-digitized orientation zone is performed to obtain an accurate and smooth OF. To validate the performance, the proposed method has been applied to OF computation using the FVC2004 databases and three experiments are designed. Experiment 1 aims to validate whether the weighted multi-scale composite window can balance the dilemma of accuracy and robustness more effectively than the previous works do. Experiment 2 is designed to examine whether the hierarchical smoothing method can correct the spurious ridge flow and preserve the genuine localization of singular points. The purpose of experiment 3 is to test the performance of the proposed method on OF reconstruction in low quality fingerprint images. The fingerprint databases FVC 2004 DB1-DB4 are employed in this study. The results of experiment I shows that the proposed method is capable to extract the information of OF reliably and it is more robust against singularity localization deviation in comparison with the other three gradient based methods. The results of experiment II indicates that the proposed smoothing method can balance the contradiction in correcting spurious ridge structures and preserving genuine singularity localization. The results of experiment III illustrates that our approach combing WMCW with the hierarchical smoothing method is capable to extract the information of OF ridge reliably and it is more robust against singularity deviation in comparison with the other three gradient based methods. In a word, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can correct spurious ridge structure and meanwhile avoid singularity deviation compared with the previous works. A novel gradient based algorithm has been proposed which is more reliable for the estimation of the ridge information for fingerprint OF and is more accurate in preserving the singularity localization. Compared with the previously proposed gradient based methods, the advantages of the proposed RBSF lie in three aspects. Firstly a weighted multi-scale composite window is put forward to replace the single window used by conventional gradient based methods and to adaptively choose the scales of the blocks. Secondly, a hierarchical smoothing strategy is proposed to enhance the OF by using the two-orientation-zone filtering and the three-orientation-zone filtering, aiming to correct the spurious ridges and preserving the genuine location of singular points. Finally, three experiments are designed to test the proposed algorithm together with other popular gradient based methods on real fingerprint images, which are selected from different categories and all are suffering from obvious noise effects. All the experiment results show that the proposed method is superior with respect to reliable OF construction and avoiding singularity localization deviation.

J	Wu, J; Zha, JL; Zhao, DM; Yang, QD				Wu, Jian; Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming; Yang, Qidong			Changes of wind speed at different heights over eastern China during 1980-2011	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						different heights; long-term change; pressure gradient force; wind speed	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; LAND-USE; UNITED-STATES; ERA-INTERIM; BILINEAR INTERPOLATION; TURBINE HEIGHT; COVER CHANGE; SURFACE; TRENDS; CLIMATE	Long-term decreasing trends of near-surface wind speed (SWS) have been well demonstrated in China, and at the same time the factors causing the slowdown in SWS have also been explored. However, changes in wind speed and pressure gradient force (PGF) at higher elevations have received little attention. In this paper, the spatio-temporal changes of wind speed and PGF at different heights were explored in eastern China during the period 1980-2011, and the potential causes inducing the changes of wind speed were analysed. The results included that the reduction in wind speed emerged from the near surface to 300 hPa, while the PGF also exhibited a synchronous reduction. The influence of PGF on the decrease of wind speed was relative smaller at near surface than that at higher levels (850-300 hPa). At the near surface, 71.8% of changes in annual mean SWS could be attributed to the changes of PGF, in which the seasonal difference of the influence of PGF on wind speed was less than 7.0%. At the higher levels, most of the changes in wind speed (>90%) was induced by PGF, in which the seasonal difference of the influence of PGF was less than 1.0%. Furthermore, the changes of PGF in eastern China could be mainly influenced by both the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The NAM could affect the inter-annual and inter-decadal changes of PGF, and the effects of NAM played more significant role on the inter-annual scale than that on the inter-decadal scale. At the same time, the correlation between NAM and PGF increased with height. Otherwise, the PDO mainly affected the inter-decadal changes of PGF, and their correlation decreased with height.

The polymers were prepared by precipitation polymerization using Ce3+ as template, allyl phenoxyacetate (APA) as monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinker and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator under the molar ratio of Ce3+, APA and EGDMA as 1:4:40, respectively. Ce3+ was detected directly by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPASV) and its oxidation peak appears at about 0.93 V. All parameters affecting the sensor's response are optimized and a calibration curve is plotted at a linear range of 1.0 x 10(-6)-1.0 x 10(-5) mol/L and 1.0 x 10(-5)-2.0 x 10(-4) mol/L with the detection limit of 1.5 x 10(-7) mol/L. All other rare earth ions have no interference with the determination of Ce3+ even at a concentration 500 times higher than that of Ce3+. This sensor was successfully applied to determination of Ce3+ in two catalyst sample solutions with RSD <= 3.3% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 99.2%-106.5% at our optimal conditions.

The strain S10(T) exhibited antibacterial activity against MRSA. The taxonomic position of the strain S10(T) was determined by a polyphasic approach. There were six copies of 16S rDNA in S10(T) which were not same exactly (MH257693-MH257698). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the strain belonging to the genus Streptomyces and it showed high sequence similarities with Streptomyces chartreusis NBRC 12753(T) (99.31%), Streptomyces phaeoluteigriseus DSM 41896(T) (99.24%), Streptomyces variegatus NRRL B-16380(T) (99.17%) and Streptomyces flavovariabilis NRRL B-16367(T) (99.17%) comparing with MH257693, MH257695, MH257696, MH257697, and MH257698. Similarities with Streptomyces kunmingensis NBRC14463(T) (98.82%), Streptomyces bungoensis DSM 41781(T)(98.76%), S. chartreusis NBRC 12753(T) (98.69%) and S. phaeoluteigriseus DSM 41896(T) (98.62%) with MH257694. Whole-genome average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between strain S10(T) and S. chartreusis NBRC 12753(T), S. phaeoluteigriseus DSM 41896(T), S. variegatus NRRL B-16380(T), S. flavovariabilis NRRL B-16367(T), S. kunmingensis NBRC 14463(T), S. bungoensis DSM 41781(T) were 83.63%, 82.89%, 92.55%, 92.51%, 79.29, and 82.87%, respectively, suggesting that the strain S10(T) represented a new species. A phylogenetic analysis comparing the S10(T) genome with those of 336 other sequenced Streptomyces genomes confirmed its relatedness with Streptomyces variegatus NRRL B-16380(T) and Streptomyces flavovariabilis NRRL B-16367(T). Strain S10(T) contained LL-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8) and the major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, isoC(16:0), and anteiso-C-17:0. Phospholipids detected were diphosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline, three unknown phospholipids, an unknown aminophospholipid and an unknown phosphatidyl glycolipid. On the basis of these genotypic and phenotypic data, it is proposed that isolate S10(T) (=JCM 31184(T) =CGMCC 4.7315(T)) should be classified in the genus Streptomyces as Streptomyces qaidamensis sp. nov.

PRLH and SOD1 gene variations associated with heat tolerance in Chinese cattle	ANIMAL GENETICS			English	Article						Indicine cattle; sequence variation; heat tolerance; THI	DAIRY-CATTLE; STRESS; INTROGRESSION; ORIGIN; MTDNA; COWS	With the proposed global climate change, heat tolerance is becoming increasingly important to the sustainability of livestock production systems. Results from previous studies showed that variants in the prolactin releasing hormone (PRLH) (AC_000160.1:g.11764610G>A) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (AC_000158.1:g.3116044T>A) genes play an important role in heat tolerance in African indicine cattle. However, it is unknown whether or not the mutations are associated with heat tolerance in Chinese cattle. In this study, PCR and DNA sequencing were used to genotype two missense mutations in 725 individuals of 30 cattle breeds. Analysis results demonstrated that two classes of base substitution were detected at two loci: AC_000160.1:g.11764610G>A and AC_000158.1:g.3116044T>A or T>C respectively, with amino acid substitutions arginine to histidine and phenylalanine to isoleucine or leucine. The frequencies of the G and T alleles of the two loci gradually diminished from northern groups to southern groups of native Chinese cattle, whereas the frequencies of A and A or C alleles showed a contrary pattern, displaying a significant geographical difference across native Chinese cattle breeds. Additionally, analysis of these two loci in Chinese indigenous cattle revealed that two SNPs were significantly associated with mean annual temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and temperature humidity index (THI) (P<0.01), suggesting that cattle with A or C alleles were distributed in regions with higher T, RH and THI. Our results suggest that the two mutations of PRLH and SOD1 genes in Chinese cattle were associated with the heat tolerance.

J	Wang, L; Gui, S; Cao, J; Yan, HM				Wang, Lin; Gui, Shu; Cao, Jie; Yan, Hongming			Summer precipitation anomalies in the low-latitude highlands of China coupled with the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole-like sea surface temperature	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MONSOON INTERFACE; EL-NINO; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION	The relationship between the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole (SIOD)-like sea surface temperature (SST) and summer precipitation in the low-latitude highlands (LLH) of China is investigated in a suite of numerical simulations using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and a coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The AGCM experiments driven by SIOD-like SST anomalies are inconsistent with the observations. However, the coupled ocean-atmosphere experiments show a good agreement with the observational results. The modeling results indicate that the air-sea interaction rather than a simple atmospheric forcing-response relationship is a crucial mechanism explaining the connection among the anomalous summer precipitation in the LLH, the anomalous divergence circulations across the Indian Ocean, and the SIOD-like SST anomalies. The effect of the enhanced interhemispheric vertical circulation variability associated with the SIOD-like SST anomalies facilitates zonal wind anomalies in the northern Bay of Bengal, and further induces anomalous water vapor convergence and precipitation anomalies in the LLH. The SST-wind-evaporation feedback mechanism could account for maintenance of the SIOD-like pattern in the coupled ocean-atmosphere experiments. These results could help to improve prediction accuracy of summer rainfall variations over the LLH of China.

Consequently, the colonization rate decreases from the low to high elevation zone, while the extinction rate shows the opposite. Objectives Due to such changes, we test whether (1) species occur at a declining number of sites (mountains) and have a less positive abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) in a higher elevation zone; (2) a lower proportion of rare large-bodied species (less resistant to extinction) and a more positive abundance-body mass relationship (ABR) emerge in a higher elevation zone. Methods Using the data of small mammals from 20 elevational gradients in the Mountainous Region of Southwest China, we compared the AORs and ABRs among the low, middle and high elevation zones. The AOR and ABR were fitted with linear and polynomial regression models. We compared endemic ratios among the different elevation zones. Results The AOR was best characterized by a linear model and positive in all elevation zones. Its slope decreased from the low to high elevation zone. The quadratic model performed the best in fitting the ABR in each zone. When fitted with linear models, both the R-2 and slope of the ABR increased towards the high elevation zone. The endemic ratios were significantly higher in the middle and high elevation zones. Conclusions Both the AOR and ABR in mountainous landscapes are strongly elevation-dependent. The increasing geographical isolation and decreasing area with elevation can have a high impact on macroecological patterns and processes.

In this paper, the occurrence of non-native plant species was examined in a protected area (Laojun Mountain Area) in the eastern Himalayas, China. Sampling plots were systematically set up along elevation from 1950 to 3500m a.s.l. Sixty-one non-natives were recorded that account for 24% of the roadside flora. The number of non-native species decreased continuously with increasing elevation and significant nestedness was found between the low- and high-elevation plots. Moreover, all non-native species distributed at high elevation were also found at low elevation and mountain specialists were not found among non-natives. These results indicate that the eastern Himalayan ecosystem is not immune to invasion and most of the non-natives spread from lowland areas upward to the highlands. Future efforts to manage plant invasions in this region should concentrate on low-elevation areas where agriculture and disturbances by tourism are increasing rapidly.

The influence of the beam and turbulence parameters on the RLGCSM beam is numerically calculated. It is shown that the evolution behavior of the average intensity depends on the beam parameters including the coherence width, beam order, as well as the propagation distance. The RLGCSM beam propagating in turbulence will exhibit self-splitting and self-combining properties, splitting into (m + 1) x (n + 1) beam spots and combining into a Gaussian beam during propagation. The RLGCSM beam has advantages over the Gaussian Schell-model beam or Gaussian beam in turbulence for reducing turbulence-induced degradation.

Current digital predistortion (DPD) techniques may not be effective in linearizing broadband RoF links. This work presents a simple envelope-assisted radio frequency (RF)/intermediate frequency (IF) DPD model for linearization of broadband/multiband RoF transmission. The model uses both RF/IF signals and baseband envelopes, resulting in the short-term and long-term memory effect mitigated efficiently even for high signal bandwidth. The model complexity is lower than the existing baseband DPDs and does not increase with the increase of the signal bands. The model is experimentally evaluated in three scenarios: two 20 MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signals spaced by 100 and 40 MHz, and three 20 MHz LTE signals spaced by 50 MHz. It is shown that the proposed DPD results in comparable performance as today's baseband models.

In this study, the enhanced stability and bioavailability of GA(3) were achieved by forming the inclusion complexes of GA(3) with cyclodextrins (beta- or gamma-CD) and its derivative (HP-beta-CD). In the preliminary plant growth regulation assay, GA(3)/CDs displays superior bioactivity compared to pure GA(3) to help with the early seedling growth of cucumber and mung bean and the root growth of cucumber and mung bean, respectively. The results showed that there was a certain relationship between the inclusion ability, stability and bioactivity. The inclusion stability constants of gibberellin clathrate are consistent with the order of stabilities of the inclusion complex. Among these complexes, GA(3)/HP-beta-CD possess highest inclusion constant, and the binding ability of the HP-beta-CD not only enhances the stability of gibberellic acid in the stability test but also plays a slow release role in the bioactivity assay. Therefore, the complex of GA(3) may be used as a promising plant growth regulator.

However, Bourquin et al. (2018) recently reported that the PTB interval at Chahe has undergone serious tectonic deformation and thus is not suitable for studying the PTB transition or the terrestrial end-Permian extinction due to an unknown amount of stratigraphy removed/displaced by faulting. In order to clarify the observations of Bourquin et al. (2018), we re-surveyed the Chahe section in further detail recently and our observations suggest that the interpreted deformation by Bourquin et al.

On the basis of a Bayesian approach for delayed Heston model that we proposed and parameter Bayesian estimation, we simulate the absolute deviation between mean residence time of positive and negative returns to characterize the herd behavior. In the plots of absolute deviation against the mean reversion long-run variance of volatility or cross correlation between two Wiener processes of stock price and volatility, the results demonstrate an increasing phenomenon of herd behavior with increasing delay time. In the plot of absolute deviation against the amplitude of volatility fluctuations, the result indicates an optimal delay time matching minimum herd behavior, i.e., the time delay restrains the herd behavior. Also, the optimal mean reversion long-run variance of volatility and cross correlation concerning minimum herd behavior can be observed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, unlike DNA level allele-specific modifications such as DNA methylation, it is currently unknown whether RNA editing displays allele-specificity across tissues and species. Here, we analyzed allele-specific RNA editing in human tissues and from brain tissues of heterozygous mice generated by crosses between divergent mouse strains and found a high proportion of overlap of allele-specific RNA editing sites between different samples. We identified three allele-specific RNA editing sites cause amino acid changes in coding regions of human and mouse genes, whereas their associated SNPs yielded synonymous differences. In vitro cellular experiments confirmed that sequences differing at a synonymous SNP can have differences in a linked allele-specific RNA editing site with nonsynonymous implications. Further, we demonstrate that allele-specific RNA editing is influenced by differences in local RNA secondary structure generated by SNPs. Our study provides new insights towards a better comprehension of the molecular mechanism that link SNPs with human diseases and traits.

The morphologies and structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD). These results show that the MnCO3 initially compacted together in particles and then formed random rods due to the mismatch between MnCO3 and substrate. The electrochemical performance of the MnCO 3 /Ni foil for glucose detection was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry, which demonstrates a high sensitivity of 1254.4 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with a detection limit of 1 mu M at 0.55 V, and a fast response time of 10 s. Moreover, the MnCO3/Ni foil electrode exhibits excellent selectivity from interfering species such as KCl, NaCl, Ascorbic acid (AA), Uric acid (UA) and Dopamine (DA). Thus, the MnCO3 would be a promising material in nonenzymatic glucose detection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the ages and routes of these migrations are largely not known. We aimed to reconstruct a well-resolved and dated phylogeny of Hippophae L. (Elaeagnaceae) and test hypothesis of a westward migration of this plant out of the QTP across Eurasian mountains in the Miocene. We produced two data matrices of five chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and five nuclear DNA markers for all distinct taxa of Hippophae. These matrices were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships in the genus. In dating analyses, we first estimated the stem node age of Elaeagnaceae using five fossil records evenly distributed across a tree of Rosales. We used this estimate and two fossil records to calibrate the cpDNA and nDNA phylogenies of Hippophae. The same phylogenies were used to reconstruct ancestral areas within the genus. The monophyly of Hippophae, all five species, and most of subspecies was strongly supported by both plastid and nuclear data sets. Diversification of Hippophae likely started in central Himalayas/southern Tibet in the early Miocene and all extant distinct species had probably originated by the middle Miocene. Diversification of Hippophae rhamnoides likely started in the late Miocene east of the QTP from where this species rapidly expanded to central and western Eurasia. Our findings highlight the impact of different stages in uplift of the QTP and Eurasian mountains and climatic changes in the Neogene on diversification and range shifts in the highland flora on the continent. The results provide support to the idea of an immigration route for some European highland plants from their ancestral areas on the QTP across central and western mountain ranges of Eurasia in the late Miocene.

Using the pion wave functions deduced from a light-cone quark model, we calculate the Wigner distributions of the unpolarized, longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized valence quarks inside the pion meson via the Fock-state overlap representation, respectively. We present the numerical results of the transverse Wigner distributions in which the longitudinal momentum fraction is integrated out. The mixed Wigner distributions as functions of b(y) and k(x) are also presented. As an intermediate step, we provide the analytic results for the generalized transverse-momentum dependent distributions of the pion meson in the same model.

Despite the reported UV-induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, the potential of nitroxides for visible light-excited photosynthesis is underexplored. Here we demonstrate that nitroxide can convert indole to its radical through a visible light-induced HAT process. A chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed cyclization of the in situ-formed imine radical, followed by trapping by another molecule of nitroxide, provides the product in high yield and enantioselectivity. To highlight the novelty and efficiency of this strategy, an asymmetric total synthesis of natural product (-)-verrupyrroloindoline was accomplished in 5 steps.

We applied the sol-gel method (ALS denotes Ag-LaFeO3 prepared by the sol-gel method) and combustion synthesis (ALC denotes Ag-LaFeO3 prepared by combustion synthesis) to prepare Ag-LaFeO3 based sensors. The morphologies and structures of the Ag-LaFeO3 materials were examined via various detection techniques. The ALSM and ALCM sensor (ALSM and ALCM denotes the devices prepared by coating the ALS and ALC materials with methanol, respectively) fabricated using the sol-gel method and combustion synthesis combined with quasi-MIT exhibit good gas sensing properties to methanol, in contrast with the two devices (ALSW and ALCW denote the devices prepared for coating the ALS and ALC materials with water, respectively) without the use of quasi-MIT. The results show that quasi-MIT introduced the target gas in the fabrication process of the device, playing an important role in the design of the ultrasensitive methanol gas sensor. The sensing response and the optimum working temperature of ALSM and ALCM gas sensor are 52.29 and 155 degrees C and 34.89 and 155 degrees C, respectively, for 5 ppm methanol, and the highest response to other gases is 8. The ALSM and ALCM gas sensors reveal good selectivity and response for methanol.

Many members of this genus displayed remarkable physiological and metabolic activity against different plant pathogens. However, Pseudomonas mosselii has not yet been characterized in biocontrol against plant disease. Here we isolated a strain of P. mosselii BS011 from the rhizosphere soil of rice plants, and the isolate showed strong inhibitory activity against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Further we sequenced the complete genome of BS011, which consist of 5.75 Mb with a circular chromosome, 5,170 protein-coding genes, 23 rRNA and 78 tRNA operons. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that seven gene clusters may be involved in the biosynthesis of metabolites. Gene deletion experiments demonstrated that the gene cluster c-xtl is required for inhibitory activity against M. oryzae. Bioassay showed that the crude extract from BS011 fermentation sample significantly inhibited the development of M. oryzae at a concentration of 10 mu g/ml. Besides, we illustrated that the crude extract of BS011 impaired the appressorial formation in a dose dependent manner. Collectively our results revealed that P. mosselii BS011 is a promising biocontrol agent and the gene cluster c-xtl is essential for inhibiting the development of M. oryzae.

Electrical generation of terahertz blackbody radiation from graphene	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							EMISSION	Recent experimental work on the application of graphene for novel illumination motivated us to present a theoretical study of the blackbody radiation emission from a freely suspended graphene driven by a dc electric field. Strong terahertz (THz) emission, with intensity up to mW/cm(2), can be generated with increasing electric field strength due to the heating of electrons in graphene. We show that the intensity of the THz emission generated electrically from graphene depends rather sensitively on the lattice temperature in relatively weak electric fields, whereas it is less sensitive to the lattice temperature in relative strong electric fields. Our study highlights the practical application of graphene as intense THz source where the radiation is generated electrically.

The material parameters of the device are derived and the effectiveness is verified by full-wave simulation. Results show that whether the illusion device acts as invisible cloak or shifting medium depends on a value of shifting distance which is about 2a (a is circum-radius of the outer polygon).When the shifting distance is larger than 2a, the illusion device acts as an invisible cloak, and otherwise it acts as shifting medium. The stealth effect of all kinds of illusion devices are investigated, including identical-size mapped polygonal devices or non-identical size mapped polygonal devices. The results show that the device is a novel interactive cloak and is different from pre-proposed cloaks. The shifting properties of the device are validated by two examples, including moving the target object virtually and generating illusionary image of a line source. The material parameters of the device are homogeneous, which makes it more practicable in reality. It is hoped that our works may open an avenue for designing novel invisible cloaks, and are helpful for speeding up the potential applications of the illusion devices, such as aircraft or military equipment stealth, target objects camouflage or protection.

In recent years, the increasing number of new species described has raised some controversy about the validity of several species within this genus, notably the putative sympatric species pair S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis. To test the validity of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis, we analyzed the complete sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYTB) gene of 20 identified species and one out-group species. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using CYTB with maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Our phylogenetic results showed that all individuals of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis clustered in one clade with strong support. In addition, the genetic distance between the two species was 0.11%, within the range observed at the intraspecific level. The most recent common ancestor of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis dated back to 0.13 million years ago, indicating little time for complete speciation to have occurred. These results clearly support the viewpoint that S. jiuchengensis is a synonym of S. qiubeiensis.

Total conversion of ethanol is obtained in SRE and OSRE with high stability. A higher production of H-2 (60 L h(-1) g(cat)(-1)) can be achieved at a reaction temperature of 300 degrees C in OSRE conditions compared to SRE (10 L h(-1) g(cat)(-1) ) mainly because of a beneficial use of a high concentration of ethanol (14 mol %) in presence of O-2 . Moreover, carbon formation is decreased and a much lower input of energy of 50 degrees C is used to get a temperature of 300 degrees C when O-2 is added. Different physico-chemical characterizations and in particular in H-2 (TPR, H-2-XRD, INS) and after tests allow to conclude that the presence of Ni2+ cations in strong interaction with other cations, anionic vacancies and hydride species on and inside the solid play an important role in the catalytic performance (conversion and selectivity) and stability.

The solubility product of the VB2 in the Al-43at. %Si melt at 1273 K and the Al-35at. %Si melt at 1173 K were initially measured experimentally with equilibrium technology, and were determined to be 8.15 x 10(-11) (1273 K) and 5.97 x 10(-12) (1173 K). The relationship between the solubility product of VB2 and the liquidus temperature of Al-Si melt was estimated, which indicated that an excessive V addition or a lower temperature is needed to enhance the efficiency of B removal from the Al-Si melt. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, V was used as an additive in the Si purification process with the Al-35at. % Si solvent that had electromagnetic solidification. The results of the Si purification indicated that a small amount of V could enhance the B removal efficiently and VSi2 was found in eutectic Al-Si phase along the Si crystals boundaries. The maximum removal rate of B was about 76%. The supplementary V was completely eliminated together with the B and did not contaminate the refined Si.

Many Sillaginidae species, including the Chinese sillago (Sillago sinica), have been recently described in China, providing valuable material to analyze genetic diversification of the family Sillaginidae. Here, we constructed a reference genome for the Chinese sillago, with the aim to set up a platform for comparative analysis of all species in this family. Findings: Using the single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing platform Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel, we generated similar to 27.3 Gb genomic DNA sequences for the Chinese sillago. We reconstructed a genome assembly of 534 Mb using a strategy that takes advantage of complementary strengths of two genome assembly programs, Canu and FALCON. The genome size was consistent with the estimated genome size based on k-mer analysis. The assembled genome consisted of 802 contigs with a contig N50 length of 2.6 Mb. We annotated 22,122 protein-coding genes in the Chinese sillago genomes using a de novo method as well as RNA sequencing data and homologies to other teleosts. According to the phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes, the Chinese sillago is closely related to Larimichthys crocea and Dicentrarchus labrax and diverged from their ancestor around 69.5-82.6 million years ago. Conclusions: Using long reads generated with PacBio sequencing technology, we have built a draft genome assembly for the Chinese sillago, which is the first reference genome for Sillaginidae species. This genome assembly sets a stage for comparative analysis of the diversification and adaptation of fishes in Sillaginidae.

Blazar flares could provide insights into this problem. Here we report statistical results of XMM-Newton observations of X-ray flares in Mrk 421. We analyze all public XMM-Newton X-ray observations for Mrk 421, and construct the light curves. Through fitting the light curves, we obtain the flare-profile parameters, such as peak flux (F-p) and flaring time duration (T-fl). It is found that the distributions of F-p and T-fl both obey a power-law form, with the same index of alpha(F) = alpha(T) approximate to 1. The statistical properties are consistent with the predictions for a self-organized criticality system with energy dissipation in one-dimensional space. This is similar to a solar flare, but with different space dimensions of the energy dissipation domain. This suggests that the X-ray flaers of Mrk 421 might be driven by a magnetic reconnection mechanism. Moreover, in the analysis, we find that variability on a timescale of similar to 1000 s appears frequently. This rapid variability indicates a magnetic field of >= 2.1 delta(-1/3)(D) G (delta(D) is the Doppler factor) in the emission region.

The Late Cretaceous members of Alvarersauria represent such an example, having been posited as members of various theropod lineages, including birds [1-11. A 70-million-year ghost lineage exists between them and the Late Jurassic putative alvarersaurian Haplocheirus [12], which preserves so few derived features that its membership in Alvarersauria has recently been questioned [13]. If Haplocheirus is indeed an alvarersaurian, then the 70-million-year gap between Haplocheirus and other alvarersaurians represents the longest temporal hiatus within the fossil record of any theropod subgroup [14]. Here we report two new alvarersaurians from the Early Cretaceous of Western China that document successive, transitional stages in alvarersaurian evolution. They provide further support for Haplocheirus as an alvarersaurian and for alvarersaurians as basal maniraptorans. Furthermore, they suggest that the early biogeographic history of the Alvarersauria involved dispersals from Asia to other continents. The new specimens are temporally, morphologically, and functionally intermediate between Haplocheirus and other known alvarersaurians and provide a striking example of the evolutionary transition from a typical theropod forelimb configuration (i.e., the relatively long arm and three-digit grasping hand of typical tetanuran form in early-branching alvarersaurians) to a highly specialized one (i.e., the highly modified and shortened arm and one-digit digging hand of Late Cretaceous parvicursorines such as Linhenykus [1, 15]). Comprehensive analyses incorporating data from these new finds show that the specialized alvarersaurian forelimb morphology evolved slowly and in a mosaic fashion during the Cretaceous.

On the Kinematic Signature of the Galactic Warp As Revealed By the LAMOST-TGAS Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics; Galaxy: structure; solar neighborhood; stars: distances; stars: kinematics and dynamics	MILKY-WAY; SPIRAL GALAXIES; LOCAL STANDARD; STARS; DISKS; MASS; HIPPARCOS; ROTATION; REGIONS; ORIGIN	Using a sample of about 123,000 stars with accurate 3D velocity measurements from the LAMOST-TGAS data, we confirm the kinematic signature of the Galactic warp recently found by Schonrich & Dehnen. The data reveal a clear trend of increasing mean vertical velocity (V-z) over bar as a function of absolute vertical angular momentum L-z and azimuthal velocity V-phi for guiding center radius R-g between 6.0 and 10.5 kpc. The trend is consistent with a large-scale Galactic warp. Similar to Schonrich & Dehnen, we also find a wave-like pattern of (V-z) over bar versus L-z with an amplitude of similar to 0.9 km s(-1) on a scale of similar to 2.0 kpc, which could arise from bending waves or a winding warp. Finally, we confirm a prominent, localized peak in (V-z) over bar near L-z similar to 2150 kpc km s(-1) (corresponding to R-g similar to 9 kpc and V-phi similar to 255 km s(-1)). The additional line-of-sight velocity information from LAMOST reveals that stars in this feature have a large, inward radial velocity of V-R similar to -13.33 +/- 0.59 km s(-1) and a small radial velocity dispersion of sigma(R)similar to 25.27 +/- 0.89 km s(-1), suggesting that a stellar stream gives rise to this feature.

This paper focuses on measuring CPU, memory, I/O, and the overall VM performance degradation caused by the performance interference according to the properties in the runtime environment of VMs. To this end, we adopt Bayesian network (BN), as the framework for uncertainty representation and inference, and construct a VM property-performance BN (VPBN) with hidden variables, which represent the unobserved performance degradation of CPU, memory, and I/O, respectively. Then, we present the method to measure performance degradation of VMs by probabilistic inferences with the VPBN. Experimental results show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.

The silica surface is then modified by the Aquivion (R) resin, leading to the hybrid Aquivion (R)/m-SiO2 solid acid bearing highly accessible sulfonic acid sites and adequate porous structure. The catalytic properties, including composition, thermal stability, acidity, porosity, and morphology, are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, XPS, TGA/DTG, elemental analysis, potentiometric titration, N-2 physisorption, SEM, and TEM. The influence of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst dosage, reaction time and temperature, reactants composition, and solvent, is investigated. The optimal Aquivion (R)/m-SiO2 catalyst (10 wt.-%), with an accessible acidity of 45 mu mol(H+)g(catal.)(-1) demonstrates 78% conversion of HMF and 66% yield of tBMF, in the presence of THF, after 3 h at 90 degrees C, whereas the yield of byproduct 5,5-[oxy-bis(methylene)]bis-2-furfural (OBMF), generated by the oligomerization of HMF, is lowered to 4%. The developed catalyst demonstrates good stability after regeneration for five consecutive cycles.

The molecular processes controlling the endosomal positioning utilize several large protein complexes, one of which contains the small GTPase Rab7, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1 (ORP1L). Rab7 is known to interact with RILP through a canonical binding site termed the effector-interacting switch region, but it is not clear how Rab7 interacts with ORP1L, limiting our understanding of the overall process. Here, we report structural and biochemical investigation of the Rab7-ORP1L interaction. We found that, contrary to prior studies, the interaction between Rab7 and the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD(N)) of ORP1L is independent of Rab7's GTP- or GDP-binding state. Moreover, we show that Rab7 interacts with ORP1L ARD(N) via a unique region consisting of helix3 (3) and 3(10)-helix 2 (2). This architecture leaves the canonical effector-interacting switch regions available for RILP binding and thus allows formation of the ORP1L-Rab7-RILP tripartite complex. Mutational disruption of the interacting interface between ORP1L and Rab7 compromised the ability of ORP1L-Rab7-RILP to regulate the late endosome positioning. Collectively, our results again manifested the versatility in the interaction between GTPase and its effector.

However, the mechanisms of how EPA regulates BDNF expression remains incompletely understood. The present study investigated the role of Akt/CREB signaling in the effect of EPA on BDNF expression and its neuroprotective effect. Results: The present results showed that IL-1 beta reduced hippocampal neuronal viability and that EPA showed a concentration-dependent neuroprotective effect, but the neuroprotective effects of EPA were abolished by inhibition of Akt using KRX-0401, an inhibitor of Akt. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with EPA also ameliorated the decrease in Akt and CREB phosphorylation induced by IL-1 beta and BDNF down-regulation mediated by IL-1 beta. However, inhibition of Akt reversed the effect of EPA on levels of p-Akt, p-CREB, and BDNF. Conclusions: Our data indicate that EPA elicited neuroprotection toward IL-1 beta-induced cell damage and BDNF decrease and that its effects potentially occurred via the Akt/CREB signaling pathway.

Recent reports have shown that the Warburg effect can be reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment. Lactic acidosis and glucose deprivation are the common adverse microenvironments in solid tumor. The metabolic reprogramming induced by lactic acid and glucose deprivation remains to be elucidated in glioblastoma. Here, we show that, under glucose deprivation, lactic acid can preserve high ATP levels and resist cell death in U251 cells. At the same time, we find that MCT1 and MCT4 are significantly highly expressed. The metabolic regulation factor HIF-1 alpha decreased and C-MYC increased. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related proteins (NDUFB8, ND1) are all distinctly increased. Therefore, lactic acid can induce lactate transport and convert the dominant Warburg effect to OXPHOS. Through bioinformatics analysis, the high expression of HIF-1 alpha, MCT1 or MCT4 indicate a poor prognosis in glioblastoma. In addition, in glioblastoma tissue, HIF-1 alpha, MCT4 and LDH are highly expressed in the interior region, and their expression is decreased in the lateral region. MCT1 can not be detected in the interior region and is highly expressed in the lateral region. Hence, different regions of glioblastoma have diverse energy metabolic pathways. Glycolysis occurs mainly in the interior region and OXPHOS in the lateral region. In general, lactic acid can induce regional energy metabolic reprogramming and assist tumor cells to adapt and resist adverse microenvironments. This study provides new ideas for furthering understanding of the metabolic features of glioblastoma. It may promote the development of new therapeutic strategies in GBM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The average size of the present synthesized NC-dots is 2.88 +/- 0.4 nm. The NC-dots show outstanding blue fluorescence and exhibit a dramatically high fluorescence quantum yield of 15%. The NC-dots were completely characterized using various techniques. The NC-dots could be employed as a fluorescent material for the sensing of TNP with distinguished selectivity. The addition of TNP into the NC-dots resulted in splendid quenching, which was ascribed to the integrative action of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, electron transfer, and the hydrogen-bond interactions between NC-dots and TNP. In parallel, the proposed NC-dots could be applied as a new type of fluorescent ink. In addition, a detailed mechanism for the production of NC-dots via self-polymerization and carbonization was proposed.

Finite-time fault-tolerant control of neutral systems against actuator saturation and nonlinear actuator faults	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Neutral systems; Fault-tolerant control; Finite-time stabilization; Actuator saturation	H-INFINITY CONTROL; MARKOV JUMP TOPOLOGY; SLIDING-MODE CONTROL; SAMPLED-DATA CONTROL; DELAY SYSTEMS; SYNCHRONIZATION CONTROL; INPUT SATURATIONS; NETWORKED SYSTEMS; LINEAR-SYSTEMS; VARYING DELAY	This paper deals with the problem of finite-time fault-tolerant control design for a class of neutral systems subject to actuator saturation in which the time-varying delay appears in both the state and the state derivative. Specifically, this is the first attempt to consider the concept of finite-time stability for neutral systems under nonlinear fault-tolerant controller. In particular, the fault model which consists of both linear and nonlinear parts is implemented through the design of controller. By applying the Lyapunov technique and some integral inequalities, a set of sufficient conditions is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities to ensure the finite-time stability of the addressed neutral systems. Finally, two numerical examples with simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The mammalian expression system, p3xFLAG tag protein, containing the CMV promoter, allowed us to construct two C-terminally elongated innexins (Cte-Inxs), Splilnx2 (Inx2-FLAG), and Splilnx3 (Inx3-FLAG), which were predicted to have the same secondary topological structures as the native Splilnx2 and Splilnx3. Here, we found that only the mRNAs of the two Cte-Inxs were expressed under the control of the CMV promoter in HeLa cells. Unexpectedly, mRNA expression of the two Cte-Inxs enhanced apoptosis of Hela cells. The two Cte-Inx mRNAs were associated with a significant decrease in Akt phosphorylation in HeLa cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore. Inx3-FLAG mRNA expression in nonapoptotic HCT116 cells was also associated with a significant decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Akt. Intriguingly, expression of the mRNAs of the two Cte-Inxs did not activate caspase 3, but it markedly reduced Bid levels in HeLa cells undergoing apoptosis. These results suggest that mRNA expression of the two Cte-Inxs may activate a Bid-dependent apoptotic pathway in HeLa cells. Our study demonstrates that invertebrate gap junction mRNAs can function in vertebrate cancer cells as tumor suppressors.

According to its atmospheric parameters, it is either a B-type main-sequence (MS) star or a blue horizontal branch (BHB) star. Its Galactocentric distance and velocity are 30.3 +/- 1.6 kpc and 586 +/- 7 km s(-1) if it is an MS star, and they are 13.2 +/- 3.7 kpc and 590 +/- 7 km s(-1) if a BHB star. We track its trajectories back and find that the trajectories intersect with the Galactic disk, and the Galactic center lies outside of the intersection region at the 3a confidence level. We investigate a number of mechanisms that could be responsible for the ejection of the star and find that it is probably ejected from the Galactic disk by supernova explosion or multiple-body interactions in dense young stellar clusters.

Higher-lying magnetically open structures, observed in AIA 171 angstrom. images above the solar limb, move downward and interact with the lower-lying closed loops, resulting in the formation of dips in the former. An X-type structure forms at the interface. The interacting loops reconnect and disappear. Two sets of newly reconnected loops then form and recede from the MR region. During the MR process, bright emission appears sequentially in the AIA 131 and 304 angstrom. channels repeatedly in the dips of higher-lying open structures. This indicates the cooling and condensation process of hotter plasma from similar to 0.9 MK down to similar to 0.6 MK, and then to similar to 0.05 MK, also supported by the light curves of the AIA 171, 131, and 304 angstrom. channels. The part of higher-lying open structures supporting the condensation participate in the successive MR. Without support from underlying loops, the condensation then rains back to the solar surface along the newly reconnected loops. Our results suggest that the MR between coronal loops leads to the condensation of hotter coronal plasma and its downflows. MR thus plays an active role in the mass cycle of coronal plasma because it can initiate the catastrophic cooling and condensation. This underlines that the magnetic and thermal evolution has to be treated together and cannot be separated, even in the case of catastrophic cooling.

Thus, the study of the long-term changes of SWS and their causes is very important for recognizing the effects of these processes. Although the slowdown in SWS has been analyzed in previous studies, to the best of knowledge, no overall comparison or detailed examination of this research has been performed. Similarly, the causes of the decreases in SWS and the best directions of future research have not been discussed in depth. Therefore, we analyzed a series of studies reporting SWS trends spanning the last 30 years from around the world. The changes in SWS differ among different regions. The most significant decreases have occurred in Central Asia and North America, with mean linear trends of - 0.11 m s(-1) decade(-1); the second most significant decreases have occurred in Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, with mean linear trends of - 0.08 m s(-1) decade(-1); and the weakest decrease has occurred in Australia. Although the SWS in Africa has decreased, this region lacks long-term observational data. Therefore, the uncertainties in the long-term SWS trend are higher in this region than in other regions. The changes in SWS, caused by a mixture of global-, regional-, and local-scale factors, are mainly due to changes in driving forces and drag forces. The changes in the driving forces are caused by changes in atmospheric circulation, and the changes in the drag forces are caused by changes in the external and internal friction in the atmosphere. Changes in surface friction are mainly caused by changes in the surface roughness due to land use and cover change (LUCC), including urbanization, and changes in internal friction are mainly induced by changes in the boundary layer characteristics. Future studies should compare the spatio-temporal differences in SWS between high and low altitudes and quantify the effects of different factors on the SWS. Additionally, in-depth analysis of extreme SWS events and prediction of future mean and extreme SWS values at global and regional scales are also necessary.

Using consumer preferences to characterize the trade of wild-collected ornamental orchids in China	CONSERVATION LETTERS			English	Article						behavioral change; demand reduction; orchidaceae; plant trade; regulation; wildlife trade	CONSERVATION AWARENESS; CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; CONSUMPTION; DIVERSITY; MARKETS; RARITY	Overexploitation of wildlife for trade threatens taxa globally. Interest in demand-side approaches to address this problem has grown but understanding of how consumer preferences shape demand remains limited. To quantify the role of consumer preferences for wild orchids in China's horticultural market, we used conjoint analysis to determine which attributes are preferred by orchid owners and nonowners in two socioeconomically contrasting areas of South China. Across all respondents, price was the most important attribute followed by flower color. While Xishuangbanna participants exhibited a slight preference for wild over cultivated plants, origin (wild/cultivated) was of minimal importance. We also measured awareness of orchid import regulations. Most did not recognize the CITES logo, and knowledge of import laws was significantly lower in Hong Kong than in Xishuangbanna. Our findings suggest that trade in wild ornamental orchids in South China is supply-driven, and strengthened regulations might be effective in reducing overexploitation.

Thus, it is necessary to develop a simple and rapid method for determination of europium in trace level. In this paper, a sensor for determination of Eu3+ was established by modifying a screen printed electrode (SPE) successively with poly catechol as signal amplifying element and Eu(III) ion-imprinted membrane fabricated by sol-gel method as the recognition material. After the factors influenced the sensitivity of the sensor for Eu3+ was optimized in detail, Eu3+ can be determined by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPASV) in the concentration range of 3.0 x 10(-7)-1.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1 with the detection limit of 1.0 x 10(similar to 7) mol L-1. The fabricated sensor owns outstanding selectivity, perfect stability and good regeneration. 50-fold excess concentration of rare earth ions such as Ce3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Dy3+, Er3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Yb3+ and 100-fold excess concentration of other metal ions such as Fe3+, Ni3+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Co2+ have no influence on the determination of 1.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1 Eu3+. The obtained sensor, which can maintain > 90% of its original response after used > 60 times or stored in the water for 2 months, has been satisfactorily used to detect Eu3+ in water samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of < 3.6% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 97.6%-101.6%.

The composition, microstructure, morphology, surface area and chemical states are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The characterization results show that the raspberry-like SnO2 with a diameter of about 60 nm is composed of numerous SnO2 nanoparticles with grain size about 8 nm. The raspberry-like SnO2 was used as sensing material for gas sensor to detect n-butanol gas. The gas-sensing properties including gas response, selectivity, response-recovery time, repeatability, stability and dynamic response character were investigated carefully. It can be found that the response value of the sensor towards 100 ppm n-butanol gas was 303.49 at the low operating temperature of 160 degrees C. And the detection limit as low as 1 ppm. All results demonstrate the potential of using raspberry-like SnO2 for n-butanol gas detection. At the same time, the possible formation mechanism and gas-sensing mechanism were also discussed.

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPCs and TFCs) and antioxidant activities of fermented and non-fermented O. thermale (FOT and NFOT) were investigated. The results showed that Talaromyces purpurogenus M18-11 fermented O. thermale possessed significantly improved TPC and TFC and exhibited significantly stronger 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 75.7 +/- 2.1 mu g mL(-1)) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) (IC50 = 20.52 +/- 1.68 mu g mL(-1)) free-radical scavenging activities, ferric reducing antioxidant power (0.585 +/- 0.045 mmol g(-1)), and reducing power (half maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 30.52 +/- 1.91 mu g mL(-1)) than original material. The determination of the contents of representative flavonoids and their glucosides revealed that the improvements are attributed to the hydrolysis of homoisoflavonoid and flavonoid glucosides, glycometabolism, as well as fungal metabolites. This paper is the first to report the fermentation of O. thennale with pure strains and T. purpurogenus is an effective strain to process O. thermale for improving the antioxidant activity.

These Cu2O nanostructures when used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries exhibit the excellent electrochemical cycling stability and reduced polarization during the repeated charge/discharge process. The specific capacity of the Cu2O nanoparticles, multi-branched nanowires and microscale are maintained at 201.2 mAh/g, 259.6 mAh/g and 127.4 mAh/g, respectively, under the current density of 0.1 A/g after 50 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the Cu2O nanostructures compared with microscale counterpart can be attributed to the larger contact area between active Cu2O nanostructures/electrolyte interface, shorter diffusion length of Li+ within nanostructures and the improved stress release upon lithiation/delithiation.

In this work, N-doped C-encapsulated scale-like yolk-shell structured MoSe2-C materials assembled by expanded (002) planes few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets are successfully synthesized by a facile general strategy. The few-layer crystal fringes are no more than 4 layers. Notably, the interlayer spacing of (002) planes is expanded to 1.15 nm, which is larger than its intrinsic value of pristine MoSe2 (0.64 nm). Particularly, the fewlayer nanosheets with expanded (002) planes are spaced-restricted growing in the inner wall and the surface of hollow carbon frame and form scale-like yolk-shell hybrid MoSe2-C structure. When evaluated as anode for SIBs, the MoSe2-C materials show ultra-long cycling life, maintaining 378 mA h g(-1) over 1000 cycles at 3 A g(-1). It also exhibits outstanding rate capability and the Coulombic efficiencies for all the rate performance reaching more than 98.3% except the first one. The expanded (002) planes, 2D fewer-layer nanosheets and unique N-doped C-encapsulated scale-like yolk-shell frame are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance.

In this paper, the glass-transitions in thin-film organic semiconductors are investigated by using various temperature spectroscopic ellipsometer. We observed that glass transition temperatures in organic thin films are characterized by a disruptive change in thickness vs. temperature plot. In order to modify the glass transition temperature of an organic semiconductor, we also made composite thin-films by inclusion of another organic molecule with higher T-g. We found that the transition temperature can be significantly improved by inclusion of another organic molecule. The glass-transition processes of these composite semiconductors, however, also proceed in a disruptive manner, in stark contrast to typical polymeric materials. Despite this disruptive glass transition behavior, the experimental T-g of the composite semiconductors are found to follow precisely a simple inverse sum equation of constituent temperatures with their respective weight factors.

X ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the structure, morphology, specific surface area and chemical state of the samples. The analyzed results indicate that the ZnO nanocrystalline with good dispersion are several nanometers in size about 10 nm. The ZnO nanocrystalline was used as sensing material to fabricate an indirect-heating structure sensor and its gas sensing properties are tested. At the optimal operating temperature (340 degrees C), its gas response toward 500ppm n-butanol is 148.11 and the response and recovery time are 20 and 8s, respectively. The test results show that the sensitivity of the as-prepared gas sensor has high selectivity to n-butanol and good response/ recovery characteristics, linear response, short-term repeatability, as well as the long-term stability. The experimental results show that the gas sensor based on ZnO nanocrystalline can be used in the detection and realtime monitoring of toxic gases, especially n-butanol gas, which makes it to be highly promising candidate for practical detectors for n-butanol gas.

REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES			English	Review						Capture fisheries; Chinese domestic seas; Mariculture; Species composition; Statistical data	STOCK ENHANCEMENT; YELLOW CROAKER; MARICULTURE; RESOURCES; COLLAPSE; TRENDS	China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, unless specified) is the greatest contributor to the total catch of global marine fisheries. As such, data about the degrees of exploitation and developmental dynamics of its fisheries are essential to evaluate and guide future sustainable seafood production and policy implementation and adjustments. In this study, we summarized the national official statistic data on domestic marine fisheries (including both marine capture fisheries and mariculture) from the earliest available year, 1950, to the latest year, 2014, using on the China Fishery Statistical Yearbooks. We also conducted analyses to understand the historical and current statuses of Chinese marine fisheries and their developmental trends. Domestic marine capture fisheries are declining and will continue to decline because of the current degradation and loss of coastal habitats, mainly due to coastal development and pollution and the over-exploitation of coastal natural resources. In contrast, mariculture has demonstrated promise as an approach to increase seafood production. However, given the wide latitudinal range of domestic seas in China, global climate change may impact China's marine natural resources. We highlight that effective management measures and long-term monitoring are essential for the sustainability of domestic marine capture fisheries. Moreover, environmentally-friendly practices in mariculture should be enhanced and species introduction carefully monitored to achieve sustainable development.

The obtained photocatalysts were systematically characterized through XRD, SEM, XPS, BET and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The synthesized heterojunction Fe/Bi2SiO5 photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for 17 beta-Estradiol (E2). While using 20W mercury lamp as UV light source, the degradation efficiency of E2 by 5% Fe/Bi2SiO5 (the molar ratio of Fe/Bi was 5:100) at 60 min irradiation was 99.5%. The rate constant of E2 degradation on 5% Fe/ Bi2SiO5 were about 3.42 times of the P25 and 2.63 times of the pure Bi2SiO5. The impact of catalyst loading and pH as well as the photocatalytic mechanism was investigated. The possible photocatalytic mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the theoretical calculation and the experimental results. The results of this study indicated that Fe/Bi2SiO5 was a stable and efficient photocatalyst, with promising practical applications.

The cAMP responsive element-binding (CREB)-1 gene increases risk of major psychiatric disorders	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA GWAS LOCI; BIPOLAR DISORDER; COMMON VARIANTS; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; MOOD DISORDERS; VRK2 RS2312147; CONFERS RISK; CREB	Bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) are primary psychiatric disorders sharing substantial genetic risk factors. We previously reported that two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2709370 and rs6785 in the cAMP responsive element-binding (CREB)-1 gene (CREB1) were associated with the risk of BPD and abnormal hippocampal function in populations of European ancestry. In the present study, we further expanded our analyses of rs2709370 and rs6785 in multiple BPD, SCZ and MDD data sets, including the published Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) genome-wide association study, the samples used in our previous CREB1 study, and six additional cohorts (three new BPD samples, two new SCZ samples and one new MDD sample). Although the associations of both CREB1 SNPs with each illness were not replicated in the new cohorts (BPD analysis in 871 cases and 1089 controls (rs2709370, P = 0.0611; rs6785, P = 0.0544); SCZ analysis in 1273 cases and 1072 controls (rs2709370, P = 0.230; rs6785, P = 0.661); and MDD analysis in 129 cases and 100 controls (rs2709370, P = 0.114; rs6785, P = 0.188)), an overall meta-analysis of all included samples suggested that both SNPs were significantly associated with increased risk of BPD (11 105 cases and 51 331 controls; rs2709370, P = 2.33 x 10(-4); rs6785, P = 6.33 x 10(-5)), SCZ (34 913 cases and 44 528 controls; rs2709370, P = 3.96 x 10(-5); rs6785, P = 2.44 x 10(-5)) and MDD (9369 cases and 9619 controls; rs2709370, P = 0.0144; rs6785, P = 0.0314), with the same direction of allelic effects across diagnostic categories. We then examined the impact of diagnostic status on CREB1 mRNA expression using data obtained from independent brain tissue samples, and observed that the mRNA expression of CREB1 was significantly downregulated in psychiatric patients compared with healthy controls. The protein-protein interaction analyses showed that the protein encoded by CREB1 directly interacted with several risk genes of psychiatric disorders identified by GWAS. In conclusion, the current study suggests that CREB1 might be a common risk gene for major psychiatric disorders, and further investigations are necessary.

It is well known that MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in maintaining the cell development and other physiological processes, as well as, the aberrant expression of numerous miRNAs involved in CRC progression. MiRNAs are a class of small, endogenous, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) complementary sequences of their target mRNA, resulting in mRNA degradation or inhibition of its translation as a post-transcriptional regulators. Moreover, miRNAs also can target the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to regulate the expression of its target genes involved in proliferation and metastasis of CRC. The functions of these dysregulated miRNAs appear to be context specific, with evidence of having a dual role in both oncogenes and tumor suppression depending on the cellular environment in which they are expressed. Therefore, the unique expression profiles of miRNAs relate to the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic outcome in CRC. In this review, we focused on several oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs specific to CRC, and assess their functions to uncover the molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression in CRC. These data promised that miRNAs can be used as early detection biomarkers and potential therapeutic target in CRC patients.

Plant functional traits and their diversity are key determinants of ecosystem function in changing environments. Understanding the successional dynamics of functional features in forest ecosystems is a first step to their sustainable management. In this study, we tested the changes in functional community composition with succession in tropical monsoon forests in Xishuangbanna, China. We sampled 33 plots at three successional stages-similar to 40-year-old secondary forests, similar to 60-year-old secondary forests, and old growth forests-following the abandonment of the shifting cultivation land. Community-level functional traits were calculated based on measurements of nine functional traits for 135 woody plant species. The results show that the community structures and species composition of the old-growth forests were significantly different to those of the secondary stands. The species diversity, including species richness (S), the Shannon-Weaver index (H), and Pielou's evenness (J), significantly increased during the recovery process after shifting cultivation. The seven studied leaf functional traits (deciduousness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content, leaf potassium content and leaf carbon content) changed from conservative to acquisitive syndromes during the recovery process, whereas wood density showed the opposite pattern, and seed mass showed no significant change, suggesting that leaf traits are more sensitive to environmental changes than wood or seed traits. The functional richness increased during the recovery process, whereas the functional evenness and divergence had the highest values in the 60-year-old secondary communities. Soil nutrients significantly influenced functional traits, but their effects on functional diversity were less obvious during the secondary succession after shifting cultivation. Our study indicates that the recovery of tropical monsoon forests is rather slow; secondary stands recover far less than the old growth stands in terms of community structure and species and functional diversity, even after about half a century of recovery, highlighting the importance of the conservation of old growth tropical monsoon forest ecosystems.

The authors obtain some classifications on biharmonic maps from a torus into a sphere, where the torus is provided with a flat or a class of non-flat metrics whilst the sphere is provided with the standard metric.

According to the definition of Jianghuai cyclones, statistics of their climate characteristics from 1979 to 2010 are obtained by an objective detection and tracking algorithm using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The results show that the frequency of Jianghuai cyclones has a strong year-to-year variability but no obvious trend. Jianghuai cyclones are most frequent in May but fewest in December. As the cold air is active in spring, which interacts with the warm air from the southwest of the subtropical high at the Yangtze-Huai River region, it makes Jianghuai cyclones occur more frequently in this season. The main origins of Jianghuai cyclones are located in the Poyang Lake region, Dongting Lake region, and Dabie Mountain area. The maximum deepening rate of 0-2 hPa/6h is featured in 66.4% of Jianghuai cyclones. Over 40% of Jianghuai cyclones have a mean deepening rate of 0-1 hPa/6h.

One approach to resolve these issues is to draw support from the sedimentary record in the surrounding basins. A volcaniclastic sequence, which divides into Lower and Upper Members, was identified in the southwestern Tarim Basin. The Lower Member was transported by dilute streamflows, which likely flowed during or soon after eruptions, while the Upper Member was formed by a syneruptive volcanic debris flow. Chronological, petrologic, and geochemical data consistently indicate that the sequence was derived from the Central Pamir at similar to 11Ma. The similar to 11 Ma emplacement of the volcaniclastic sequence provides unique constraints for the evolution of the Tashkorgan-Yarkand River and the Pamir salient. Provenance data indicate a multistage evolutionary history of the Tashkorgan-Yarkand River. The paleo-Tashkorgan River was initially formed in the piedmont of the Pamir marginal range before similar to 15Ma. This river cut back into the Tashkorgan region at similar to 15Ma, after which it has eroded the Central Pamir by similar to 11Ma. The N-S trending upper reaches of the Tashkorgan River and the Yarkand River were established after similar to 11Ma. The emplacement of the volcanic debris flow, together with regional deformation evidence, indicates limited strike-slip motion between Pamir and the Tarim at least since similar to 11Ma, which refutes hundreds of kilometers offset between the Pamir and the Tarim after this time and supports an earlier indention of the Pamir salient.

Newly recognized features include, potential optical neuropils, a stout posterolateral carapace spine, serrated tergal pleurae, two rows of mediolateral carinae, an abdomen composed of seven segments, the last possessing a tripartite lateral flap, and a triangular telson. The presence of tergal carinae, a prothorax composed of six segments, and a trunk composed of 43 segments tipped with a flap-like terminal segment, increase similarities with the previously described Shankouia zhenghei, thus prompting a reevaluation of the potential synonymy of these taxa. These previously recognized species also show considerable overlap in body size, and the ratios of selected body features, such as the carapace. This, combined with their co-occurrence over a temporally and geographically limited range, further support their synonymy. L biloba is considered the senior synonym in accordance with ICZN rulings, with morphological differences, specifically the presence of posterolateral spines on the carapace, serrated tergopleurae, and spines on the terminal abdominal segment, attributed to sexual variation. An evaluation of potential sexual dimorphism in other fuxianhuiids, and a reassessment of terminology applied to this group is also provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the relative strength of these barriers can illuminate the ecological factors that currently maintain species integrity and how these factors originally promoted speciation. Two Himalayan alpine gingers, Roscoea purpurea and R. tumjensis, occur sympatrically in central Nepal and have such similar morphology that it is not clear whether or how they maintain a distinct identity. Our quantitative measurements of the components of reproductive isolation show that they are, in fact, completely isolated by a combination of phenological displacement of flowering, earlier for R. tumjensis and later for R. purpurea, and complete fidelity of visitation by different pollinator species, bumblebees for R. tumjensis and a long-tongued fly for R. purpurea. Furthermore, the nectar of R. tumjensis flowers is available to the shorter tongued bumblebees while R. purpurea nectar is less accessible, requiring deep probing from long-tongued flies. Although flowering phenology is a strong current barrier that seemingly obviates any need for pollinator discrimination, this current pattern need not reflect selective forces occurring at the initial divergence of R. tumjensis. There has been considerable pollinator switching during the radiation of the Himalayan Roscoea, and the association of flowering time with type of pollinator in these sympatric species may have originated among the earliest or latest flowering individuals or populations of an ancestor to exploit either bumblebee activity early in the breeding season or long-tongued fly abundance later in the season. These two sympatric Roscoea species add to accumulating evidence of the primacy of prezygotic pollination traits in speciation among angiosperms even in the absence of postzygotic incompatibility.

The structures of 1-16 were elucidated based on NMR data analysis, HRMS experiments and other spectroscopic interpretations. The absolute configuration of 5 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for the first time. Compounds 10 and 12 showed human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 61.1 +/- 5.3 and 45.9 +/- 3.0 mu M, respectively. Molecular docking of the active compound 12 and positive control teriflunomide on the inhibitor-binding site of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was subsequently performed to visualize the interaction pattern. In addition, compounds 8 and 10 exhibited inhibitory effects against lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production with inhibition rates of 61 and 41%, respectively, at the concentration of 10 mu M. Compounds 9 and 12 showed cytotoxic activities with cell viability varying from 29 +/- 57% at 100 mu M against T98G, U87, U251, and GL261 glioma cancer cell lines.

Here, we investigated the relationship between diversity and productivity under plant invasion and studied the response of species level plant mass to species richness in native and invaded communities. A field experiment from 2008 to 2013 and a pot experiment in 2014 were conducted to study the effects of plant invasion on the relationship between diversity and productivity and the response of species level plant mass to species richness in native and invaded communities. The community level biomass was negatively correlated to plant species richness in invaded communities while the same relationship was positive in native communities. The species level plant mass of individual species responded differently to overall plant species richness in the native and invaded communities, namely, most of the species' plant mass increased in native communities, but decreased in invaded communities with increasing species richness. The complementarity or selection effects might dominate in native communities while competition effects might dominate in invaded communities. Accordingly, the negative relationship between diversity and productivity under plant invasion is highlighted in our experiments.

In this study we explored the possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of the combination of the effective components of FFDS (Tan IIA, NG-R1 and Borneol) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on network pharmacology. We firstly constructed AD-related FFDS component protein interaction networks, and revealed that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) might regulate neuronal apoptosis through Bad in the progression of AD. Then we investigated the apoptosis-inducing effects of MIF and the impact of the effective components of FFDS in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We observed the characteristics of a "Pendular state" of MIF, where MIF (8 ng/mL) increased the ratio of p-Bad/Bad by activating Akt and the IKK alpha/beta signaling pathway to assure cell survival, whereas MIF (50 ng/mL) up-regulated the expression of Bad to trigger apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. MIF displayed neurotoxicity similar to A beta(1-142) , which was associated with the MIF-induced increased expression of Bad. Application of the FFDS composite solution significantly decreased the expression levels of Bad, suppressed MIFinduced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. In a D-galactose- and AlCl3-induced AD mouse model, administration of the FFDS composite solution significantly improved the learning and memory, as well as neuronal morphology, and decreased the serum levels of INF-gamma. Therefore, the FFDS composite solution exerts neuroprotective effects through down-regulating the level of Bad stimulated by MIF.

J	Wu, J; Zha, JL; Zhao, DM; Yang, QD				Wu, Jian; Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming; Yang, Qidong			Effects of surface friction and turbulent mixing on long-term changes in the near-surface wind speed over the Eastern China Plain from 1981 to 2010	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Near-surface wind speed; External friction force; Turbulent friction force; Eastern China Plain	CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; LAND-USE; DOWNSCALING METHOD; COVER CHANGE; TRENDS; IMPACT; HOMOGENIZATION; DENSITY; FRANCE	A significant slowdown in the near-surface wind speed (SWS) due to combined effects of the driving and drag forces of the atmosphere has been demonstrated in different regions in the globe. The drag force includes two sources: the friction force between the underlying surface and the bottom of the atmosphere, which is the external friction force (EFF), and the vertical exchange of the horizontal momentum induced by turbulent mixing, which is the turbulent friction force (TFF). In this paper, we propose a diagnostic method to separate the effects of the EFF and the TFF on long-term changes in the SWS over the Eastern China Plain (ECP) region from 1981 to 2010. The results show that the TFF could have caused an increase of 0.5 +/- 0.2 m s(- 1) in the SWS over the ECP region in the past 30 years and the TFF showed an increasing influence of 0.17 m s(- 1) decade(- 1). In contrast, the EFF distinctly decreased the SWS by an average of - 1.1 +/- 0.4 m s(- 1) and presented a significant decreasing trend of - 0.36 m s(- 1) decade(- 1). The effect of EFF is the main inducer of the observed regional long-term decrease of the SWS, which is in accordance with the distinct land use and cover change (LUCC) occurring in the ECP region in recent decades. Furthermore, the effects of the EFF and TFF on the changes in the SWS are more significant in large cities than those in small cities. The TFF effect can accelerate the SWS, with means of 0.5 +/- 0.2 and 0.4 +/- 0.2 m s(- 1) in large and small cities, respectively. The EFF effect can decelerate the SWS, with means of - 1.2 +/- 0.4 and - 0.7 +/- 0.4 m s(- 1) in large and small cities, respectively.

Shear measurement	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis; survey; cosmology: observations	GALAXY SHAPE MEASUREMENT; COSMIC SHEAR; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; CFHTLENS; SEXTRACTOR; UNIVERSE	The VST Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields (VOICE) Survey is a Guaranteed Time programme carried out with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) VLT Survey Telescope (VST) telescope to provide deep optical imaging over two 4 deg(2) patches of the sky centred on the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and ES1 as part of the ESO-Spitzer Imaging Extragalactic Survey. We present the cosmic shear measurement over the 4 deg(2) covering the CDFS region in the r band using LensFit. Each of the four tiles of 1 deg(2) has more than 100 exposures, of which more than 50 exposures passed a series of image quality selection criteria for weak-lensing study. The 5 sigma limiting magnitude in r band is 26.1 for point sources, which is greater than or similar to 1 mag deeper than other weak-lensing survey in the literature [e.g. the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) at VST]. The photometric redshifts are estimated using the VOICE u, g, r, i together with near-infrared VIDEO data Y, J, H, K-s. The mean redshift of the shear catalogue is 0.87, considering the shear weight. The effective galaxy number density is 16.35 gal arcmin(-2), which is nearly twice the one of KiDS. The performance of LensFit on such a deep data set was calibrated using VOICE-like mock image simulations. Furthermore, we have analysed the reliability of the shear catalogue by calculating the star-galaxy cross-correlations, the tomographic shear correlations of two redshift bins and the contaminations of the blended galaxies. As a further sanity check, we have constrained cosmological parameters by exploring the parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter model, we have obtained Sigma(8) = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.68(-0.15)(+0.11).

However, the most existing techniques in many cases cannot gain good fusion performance and acceptable complexity simultaneously. In order to improve image fusion efficiency and performance, we propose a lightweight multi-focus image fusion scheme based on Laplacian pyramid transform (LPT) and adaptive pulse coupled neural networks-local spatial frequency (PCNN-LSF), and it only needs to deal with fewer sub-images than common methods. The proposed scheme employs LPT to decompose a source image into the corresponding constituent sub-images. Spatial frequency (SF) is calculated to adjust the linking strength, beta of PCNN according to the gradient features of the sub-images. Then oscillation frequency graph (OFG) of the sub-images is generated by PCNN model. Local spatial frequency (LSF) of the OFG is calculated as the key step to fuse the sub-images. Incorporating LSF of the OFG into the fusion scheme (LSF of the OFG represents the information of its regional features); it can effectively describe the detailed information of the sub-images. LSF can enhance the features of OFG and makes it easy to extract high quality coefficient of the sub-image. The experiments indicate that the proposed scheme achieves good fusion effect and is more efficient than other commonly used image fusion algorithms.

Thus, it is a great challenge for us to efficiently protect the Buceros bicornis resource from extinct. Molecular biology research can provide the scientific basis for the conservation of key endangered species. In this work, we first reported the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of Buceros bicornis by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The total length of the complete mitogenome was 17,117 bp and its overall base composition was estimated to be 30.2% for A, 23.5% for T, 32.3% for C and 14.0% for G, indicating an A + T (53.7%)-rich feature in the Buceros bicornis complete mitogenome. In addition, it contained the typical structure of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) and a non-coding control region (D-loop region). The newly obtained mitogenome sequence seems to be useful for conservation biology and evolutionary studies on hornbill bird species, which would contribute to enrich the Buceros bicornis mitogenome resource and promote its biological research.

Mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence is informative and very useful for systematics and conservation biology studies. In this study, we first determined and characterized the complete mitogenome of A. coronatus using next-generation sequencing platform. The complete mitogenome of A. coronatus was 17,214 bp in length, with an AT ratio of 52.8%. It contained the typical structure of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a non-coding control region or D-loop region, with an identical gene order to that of most other vertebrates. The complete mitogenome sequence of A. coronatus would not only provide additional molecular markers of choice for detecting illegal poaching and trafficking of this bird species, but also would contribute to phylogenomic study of hornbill birds.

In this study, the spatiotemporal patterns and processes of LUCC in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna, which is located on the northern edge of tropical Asia, were examined using a modified post-classification change detection technique based on random forest classifiers and Landsat images acquired at a 5-year time interval (e.g., 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014) from 1994 to 2014, with a special focus on protected areas and their surroundings. The overall accuracies of land use/ land cover classification reached 90.13-97.90%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84-0.96. Massive but decelerating conversion from forests to artificial plantations has occurred in recent decades. From 1994 to 2014, the area of plantations increased by 1833.85 Km(2), whereas that of forests decreased by 1942.67 km(2). The expanded areas of artificial plantations decreased from 158.41 km(2) per year in 1994-1999 to 59.70 km(2) per year in 2009-2014. More considerable transformation from forests to artificial plantations occurred in lowland areas with elevations below 1000 m and at the edges of National Nature Reserves, which observed a forest loss rate of greater than 40% between 1994 and 2014. This poses serious challenges for sustaining both protected areas and surrounding human communities and to solve the increasingly escalating human-elephant conflicts. The complex food, biodiversity. and land use nexus in this region remain to be untangled in future study.

These RV standard stars are observed at least three times and have a median stability (3o Rv ) around 240 m s(-1) over a time baseline longer than 200 days. They are largely distributed in the northern sky and could be extended to the southern sky by the future APOGEE-2 survey. Most of the stars are red giants (J - Ks >= 0.5) owing to the APOGEE target selection criteria. Only about 10 per cent of them are main-sequence stars. The H-band magnitude range of the stars is 7-12.5 mag with the faint limit much fainter than the magnitudes of previous RV standard stars. As an application, we show the new set of standard stars to determine the RV zero points of the RAVE, the LAMOST, and the Gaia-RVS Galactic spectroscopic surveys.

CdIn2O4 nanoporous thin film was prepared using poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymers as template. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The analyzed results indicate that the obtained thin film is highly crystalline and has pore-solid architectures after removal of the polymer template by calcination. As-prepared CdIn2O4 nanoporous thin film was used directly as sensing device to investigate the sensing properties in HCHO atmosphere. The home-built CdIn2O4 nanoporous thin film gas-sensor shows high response, selectivity, and long-time stability toward HCHO gas at low operating temperature (100 degrees C), making the thin film not only interesting for sensor devices, but also for a number of related electrochemical applications.

The structure and morphology, of the as-synthesized NiFe-LDH were firstly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that NiFe-LDH nanosheets assemble differently on inner and outer Ni foam with different Fe contents. The subsequent electrochemical measurements showed that the NiFe-LDH/Ni foam electrode exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 oxidation with a high sensitivity of 1704 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) (0.5 mu M to 0.84 mM) and low limit of detection (0.5 mu M). These impressive performances indicate that the NiFe-LDH nanosheets is a promising candidate for nonenzymatic H2O2 sensors.

In some constructing specific subgraph problem Q (CSS, for short), the objective is to choose a minimum-length subset of edges, such that these edges form a specific subgraph (such as a spanning tree or a Steiner tree). In the CSS-MSP problem Q', these edges are further required to be cut from some stock pieces of length L, and the new objective, however, is to minimize the number of stock pieces of length L to construct all edges in such a specific subgraph. We obtain two main results. (1) Whenever the CSS problem Q can be approximated by an alpha-approximation algorithm (alpha >= 1) (for the case alpha = 1, the CSS problem Q is solved optimally by a polynomial-time exact algorithm), we design two approximation algorithms with performance ratios 2 alpha and 7 alpha/4 to solve the CSS-MSP problem Q'; (2) In addition, when the problem Q is to find a minimum spanning tree, we present a 3/2-approximation algorithm and an APTAS to solve the problem Q' of constructing spanning tree with minimum number of length-bounded stock pieces.

SEM, XRD and BET were employed to characterize the microstructure, phases and specific surface area. CV method was used to the oxygen electrode behavior of catalysts. Diameter of the holes was about 330 nm, corresponding to the size of SiO2 template. Full-cell discharge tests were performed on aluminum-air battery fabricated by porous LaMn0 3 . Results showed that the discharge performance of porous LaMnO3 were 1.54 V, 1.42 V and 1.24 V respectively when the discharge currents were set at 5 mA/cm(2), 10 mA/cm(2) and 20 mA/cm(2), respectively, which were higher than that of LaMnO3 prepared by coprecipitation method (1.33 V, 1.09 V, 0.63 V, respectively).

We introduce a cosine term to Heston model and develop a modified Heston model with periodic stochastic volatility for capturing the periodicity of the volatility process or volatility clustering which was observed in historical financial data sets. The proposed model was tested against Dow Jones industrial and Hang Seng index data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model fits the historical data well when compared with the original Heston model. The signal power amplification (SPA) is calculated and studied to investigate the stochastic resonance of the proposed dynamic system. Experimental results suggest that: (i) optimal values of volatility parameters can be identified which maximize the effects of systematic and non-systematic randomness to the market periodicity; (ii) different values of correlation strength between noise sources will cause critical phenomenon and induce single or multiple resonances.

CbPyCN exhibits blue-shifted emission ((max) at 420 nm), a wider optical band-bap (E-g: 3.22 eV) and a higher triplet energy (E-T: 2.79 eV) than CzPyCN (454 nm, 3.02 and 2.69 eV). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were -5.77/-2.75 and -5.58/-2.38 eV for CzPyCN and CbPyCN, respectively. With enough HOMO/LUMO energy level offsets, CzPyCN and CbPyCN could function as electron acceptors to form an exciplex with a typical electron-donor, di-[4-(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC), showing broad exciplex emission with peaks at 530 and 520 nm, and long decay lifetimes of 1097 and 1014 ns, respectively. However, when mixed with 1,3-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-benzene (mCP), no exciplex but only typical CzPyCN or CbPyCN deep blue emission with a decay lifetime of 14.3 or 12.1 ns is observed. Blue phosphorescent OLEDs by using mCP (TAPC)/CzPyCN as mixed cohosts show a maximum EQE of 19.1 (6.2)%, lower than the 21.4 (13.3)% of mCP (TAPC)/CbPyCN, respectively, which is probably due to the better electron-transport properties and higher triplet energy levels for electron-deficient -carboline containing CbPyCN. Similarly, exciplex-type green fluorescent OLEDs based on TAPC/CzPyCN show a lower maximum efficiency of 22.0 cd A(-1) and 7.4% than 27.5 cd A(-1) and 9.1% of TAPC/CbPyCN.

The effects of the bombardment of these materials with hot Al atoms, the most commonly used top electrode, are mitigated by using electrodes fabricated from eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn). The geometry of the electrode is defined by injection into microchannels to form stable structures that are nondamaging and that conform to the topology of the organic thin film. The epsilon(r) of a series of references and new organic materials, polymers, and fullerene derivatives was derived from impedance spectroscopy measurements for both Al and EGaIn electrodes showing the specific limitations of Al with soft, organic materials and overcoming them with EGaIn to determine their dielectric properties and provide realistic values of epsilon(r).

J	Meng, WD; Xia, Y; Chen, Y; Pu, XY				Meng, Weidong; Xia, Yan; Chen, Yan; Pu, Xiaoyun			Measuring the mutual diffusion coefficient of heavy water in normal water using a double liquid-core cylindrical lens	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								The mutual diffusion coefficient of heavy water in normal water is measured over a temperature range of 20 to 40 degrees C using a novel method called the shift of equivalent refractive index slice (SERIS). The measured values range from 1.9086 x 10(-5) to 3.0860 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s and fit the Arrhenius equation well, and the calculated data from the equation are consistent with the literature values obtained by the interference method. The SERIS method is based on a double liquid-core cylindrical lens (DLCL); the front liquid core of the DLCL is used as both a liquid diffusion cell and a key imaging lens, and the resolvable minimum of liquid refractive index is delta n = 6.15 x 10(-5). The rear liquid core is used as an aplanatic lens, and the transversal spherical aberration is less than 1 mu m. The SERIS method provides a new way to measure mutual diffusion coefficients of liquid and has the following advantages: visual measurement, use of a simplified device, and easy operation.

J	Li, YK; Li, B; Yao, SS; Xiong, LL				Li, Yongkun; Li, Bing; Yao, Sisheng; Xiong, Lianglin			The global exponential pseudo almost periodic synchronization of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks with time-varying delays	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Pseudo almost periodic solution; Global exponential synchronization; Quaternion valued neural network; Time delay	PROJECTIVE SYNCHRONIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; DYNAMICAL NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; LEAKAGE DELAYS; MIXED IMPULSES; STABILITY; EXISTENCE; SYSTEMS; SCALES	In this paper, we consider the problem of the pseudo almost periodic synchronization of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks (QVCNNs) with time-varying delays. Firstly, we use the Banach fixed point theorem to obtain the existence of pseudo almost periodic solutions of QVCNNs with time varying delays. Then, by designing a novel and very general nonlinear state-feedback controller, and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we obtain that the drive-response structure of QVCNNs with pseudo almost periodic coefficients can realize the global exponential synchronization. Our results are completely new. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our results.

JP-I can display SmA(2) phase triggered by the addition of alkali metal ions. The LC property of the doped system was well demonstrated by polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments. The conductivity of the doped system (JP-I:LiOTf) is 4.0 x 10(-8) S cm(-1). JP-I could gel both in ethanol and aqueous ethanol. Such gel which formed in ethanol showed a helical nanostructure. The XRD displayed that the JP-I could self-assemble into a monolayer structure which had a small tilt angle in the layers. Furthermore, the gel system could be established to remove iodine from water. Additionally, JP-I could recognize Fe3+ with lower detection limit in aqueous ethanol. Finally, JP-I could self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution and the critical micelle concentration CMC was determined to be 0.002 mg/ mL with the diameter of the spherical micelles about 15-20 nm.

Although herbal teas are widely consumed by many cultural groups in different regions of China, no thorough review has been undertaken to assess the diversity of the country's herbal tea usage. This literature review, complemented by a quantitative survey in an important tea market in Kunming, begins to fill this knowledge gap. Aims of the study: The study aims to summarize the current knowledge of plant species used as herbal teas by different cultural groups in different regions of China, with a focus on the teas' perceived traditional healthcare functions, related phytochemical/pharmaceutical research, and safety issues. Materials and methods: The study involved a comprehensive literature review and a market survey. The literature review was based on published ethnobotanical studies of herbal teas in China. We searched the Web of Science (TM), ELSEVIER, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and the China Science and Technology Journal Database to locate relevant studies (including journal articles, Masters/PhD dissertations and books) that were published before March 2017. A species list was compiled based on the review and supplemented with information retrieved from the Scifinder database (https://scifinder.cas.org) and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010). A Use Value Index was employed for ranking the most cited species. Based on the 29 most cited species, we discussed the current research status in relation to healthcare benefits and safety concerns of herbal teas in China. To better understand the current status of the herbal tea market in China, we also surveyed 136 tea vendors at the Xiongda Tea Market in Kunming. Information gathered from the survey included the species sold, the sale prices and the form of the herbal tea product. Results: The literature identified 759 plant species used as herbal tea in China and the market survey identified an additional 23 species. Most of the species used were from the Leguminosae, Compositae and Lamiaceae families. Twenty two provinces and fourteen ethnic minority groups have records on the consumption of herbal teas. Southern China uses up to 82% of the total species, and 211 out of 759 species are used by minority groups. Thirty categories of traditional healthcare functions are linked with herbal teas, with clearing away heat, relieving toxicity and suppressing cough being the most important functions. There is phytochemical/pharmaceutical evidence to support the claimed healthcare benefits of some Chinese herbal teas. Although Chinese herbal teas are generally safe to consume, overdoses of some herbal teas and some unapproved mixtures of species may cause health risks. Based on our market survey, the prices of most herbal teas range between 100 and 200 RMB (US$15-30) per kg. Conclusions: A rich array of herbal tea species with various traditional healthcare functions have long been used in China, and as such there is a huge market potential for Chinese herbal teas. More pharmaceutical/phytochemical research is needed to assess a wide range of perceived healthcare benefits of Chinese herbal teas. Our research highlights the need to study herbal teas through an ethnopharmacological perspective and by employing a holistic approach, which requires greater consideration of traditional knowledge in the pharmacological research design. Product safety and sustainability issues should also be considered, so the traditional applications of herbal teas can be transformed to efficient health boosting functional products.

Two kinds of AuNPs with glutathione as ligand were prepared using the one. step method and two. step method respectively. The particle size and colloid stability of the as. prepared AuNPs were compared. The two. step method prepared AuNPs was more stable. Then, a non. aggregation colorimetric strategy for detection of ascorbic acid (AA) based on metal nanoparticles was constructed using the AuNPs prepared by two. step method as seeds and catalyst. This strategy combined the target. induced silver deposition reaction and the extraordinarily high molar extinction coefficient of silver nanoparticles, which exhibited high detection sensitivity and good specificity. The presence of AA could reduce Ag+ to Ag0 on the surface of AuNPs, and the resulting color change of the detection solution and the A410 was used for AA detection. The detection limit was as low as 0. 75 mu mol/L(S/N = 3). In brief, a simple, fast and sensitive colorimetric assay method for detection of AA with good specificity and strong anti. interference ability was proposed. This method was applied to AA detection in real complex samples, which showed great prospect in bioanalytical applications.

Our results show that the monolayer MoS2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 eV. The SOCs and d-electrons in Mo play a very significant role in deciding its electronic and optical properties. Moreover, electronic elementary excitations are studied theoretically within the diagrammatic self-consistent field theory. Under random phase approximation, it shows that two branches of plasmon modes can be achieved via the conduction-band transitions due to the SOCs, which are different from the plasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas and graphene owing to the quasi-linear energy dispersion in single-layer MoS2. Moreover, the strong optical absorption up to 10(5) cm(-1) and two optical absorption edges I and II can be observed. This study is relevant to the applications of monolayer MoS2 as an advanced photoelectronic device.

In this paper, we discuss latent link analysis for community detection in social behavioral interactions. We adopt Markov network (MN) as the framework and propose the algorithm to discover latent links among social objects implied in their behavioral interactions without regard for the topological structures of social networks. First, starting from the frequent itemsets of the behavioral interactions, we propose the algorithm to construct the item-association Markov network (IAMN), which establishes the inherent relationship between frequent itemset and MN. Then, we propose the algorithm to detect communities by incorporating the concepts of k-clique and k-nearest neighbor set, as the typical application of the constructed IAMN Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the method proposed in this paper.

In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NXHG29 exhibited dually antagonistic activities against TBW and TBS in vitro assays. Pot experiments were performed to evaluate the capability of a novel bio-organic fertilizer (BOF) consisting of organic fertilizer with NXHG29 to control TBW and TBS. The results showed that application of BOF could more effectively decrease the disease incidence of TBW and TBS than the direct application of NXHG29. Higher amounts of BOF application (0.5% and 1% amendment) resulted in the more suppressive effects on tested pathogens when compared with a low amount of BOF application (0.1% amendment). To determine the antagonistic mechanism of NXHG29, we investigated the colonization pattern of NXHG29 on tobacco roots in a sand system and a natural soil system by tagging NXHG29 with a GFP-marked plasmid. Similar observations were obtained in the two systems. The results indicated that GFP-tagged NXHG29 colonized first the differentiation zones followed by the elongation and maturation zones of the primary roots and subsequently around the junctions of primary and lateral roots. The population dynamics of GFP-tagged NXHG29 on tobacco roots and in the rhizosphere were also monitored. The development of the BOF using dually antagonistic bacteria might provide new options for control strategies, especially with respect to managing both diseases simultaneously in the host plant, which should be more effective in the long term.

However, the cellular effects of pollutants on fish immune system are largely unknown. Here, we exploited the transgenic zebrafish Tg(lysC:DsRed2) larva as a preliminary screening system to evaluate the potential inflammatory effects of environmental pollutants. Tg(lysC:DsRED2) larvae aged 7-day-postfertilization (7 dpf) were treated with selected environmental chemicals for 24 h (24 h) and the number of neutrophils were quantified using both image analysis and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). We found that the numbers of neutrophils in the Tg (lysC:DsRED2) larvae were significantly increased by most of the organic chemicals tested, including E2 (17 beta-estradiol), BPA (Bisphenol-A), NDEA (N-nitrosodiethylamine), 4-NP (4-Nitrophenol) and Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane). Neutrophil numbers were also increased by all the metals tested (Na2HAsO4 center dot 7H20, Pb (NO3)2, HgCl2, CdCl, CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O, ZnSO4, and K2Cr2O7). The only exception was TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), which significantly reduced the number of neutrophils after exposure. Additionally, the transcription of genes (lyz, mpo, tnf alpha and il8) related to fish immune system were significantly modulated upon exposure to some of the selected chemicals such as E2, TCDD, Cu and Cd. This study revealed that representatives of major categories of environmental pollutants could cause an acute inflammatory response in zebrafish larvae as shown by alterations in the neutrophils, which may imply a common immunotoxicity mechanism for most environmental pollutants. This study has also demonstrated that Tgayz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish is an excellent tool for screening environmental chemicals with potential inflammatory effects through FACS-facilitated neutrophil counting.

Lower omega (n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lower n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios occur in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously reported that an n-3 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), can improve memory and attenuate neurodegeneration-like changes in animal models of AD. However, whether and how EPA modulates glial cell activity and functions remains unclear. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that EPA may attenuate neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and microglia-produced proinflammatory cytokines, and by enhancing the expression of astrocytes-produced neurotrophins and their receptors. Male Long-Evans rats were fed either palm oil supplemented diet or EPA supplemented diet for 42 days. On day 36 of diet feeding, rats received an intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1 beta or saline for 7 days. The glial activation, the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), calcium-dependent phospholipase (cPL) A2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, and PUFA profile in the hippocampus were analyzed. IL-1 beta elevated biomarkers of microglial CD11b and astrocyte GFAP expression, increased the expression of APP, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but reduced BDNF and its receptor (TrKB). IL-1 beta also lowered n-3 EPA and docosapentaenoic acid concentrations but increased n-6 PUFAs and cPLA2 activity in the hippocampus. EPA supplement normalized the n-3 and n-6 PUFA profiles and cPLA2 levels, inhibited glial activation, reduced APP and TNF-alpha expression, as well as up-regulated BDNF and TrKB. Supplementation with EPA appear to have potential effects on improving glial over-activation, n3/n6 imbalance and BDNF down-regulation, which contribute to anti-inflammatory and may provide beneficial effects on inflammation-associated disease such as AD.

In this study, we analyzed iron species, redox-sensitive trace elements, and S-N-C isotopes of deepwater black shales in the Silikou section in the continental-margin Nanhua Basin (South China), which represent extensive clastic input mainly from the Cathaysia Block during the early Cambrian (similar to 541-509 Ma). Integrated data reveal a continuous shift in bottom-water redox conditions at Silikou from euxinic in the lowermost black-shale interval (BS1, 0-37.4 m) to oxic in the uppermost black-shale interval (BS4, 296-372.9 m) accompanying a progressive movement of the O-2/H2S redoxcline into the sediment. In between, most importantly, the BS2 interval (91-154 m) accumulated under manganous-ferruginous conditions (i.e., Fe-Mn reduction zone) characterized by an active Fe-Mn particulate shuttle, and the BS3 interval (204-260 m) under nitrogenous conditions (i.e., nitrate reduction zone) characterized by strong denitrification processes, suggesting highly complex redox conditions in early Cambrian oceans. The observed sequence of redox conditions supports a strong lateral and depth-related redox stratification in the early Cambrian ocean, including (from surface to deep and from nearshore to offshore) oxic, nitrate reduction, Fe-Mn reduction, and euxinic zones, which were sequentially recorded at Silikou likely due to secular expansion of the oxic surface layer and/or long-term relative sea level fall. Our study highlights the need for continued paleo-redox studies to explore the redox heterogeneity of early Cambrian oceans.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET) to obtain information about its crystal structure, morphology, and BET surface area, respectively. The nanosheets present hexagonal shape with mesoporous structure in nature. The obtained mesoporous ZnCo2O4 nanosheets exhibit a high specific surface area of 191.64 m(2)/g. The electrochemical properties of the mesoporous ZnCo2O4 nanosheets were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) in 6 mol/L KOH aqueous electrolyte. The ZnCo2O4 nanosheets show a high specific capacity of 835.26 F/g at the current density of 1.0 A/g, as well as good cycle stability with specific capacitance remaining 73.28% of the initial value after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles under the current density of 8 A/g. These superior electrochemical features demonstrate that the mesoporous ZnCo2O4 nanosheet is a promising electroactive material for supercapacitor.

The corrugated structure is fabricated by nanoimprint lithography using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) soft diffraction grating mold and by pressing the mold on spin-coated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole-injection layer on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass. The OLEDs' current efficiency is enhanced by about 24% as compared to that of OLEDs with planar cathode structures. This enhanced is explained as due to a reduced optical loss from waveguide (WG) modes, total internal reflection (TIR), and electrode surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The dispersion relation of the SPP modes is computed theoretically and is found in good agreement with angle-resolved spectral measurements.

The objective of this study was to explore farmers' perceptions of the drought's prevalence and characteristics, its socioeconomic and environmental impacts, their strategies for coping with and mitigating it, and types of conflicts and resolution mechanisms. A questionnaire was completed by 147 farming households. The results indicate that farmers' perceptions regarding drought are in line with the results obtained using the precipitation data. Even though the respondents have religious belief in interpreting the weather related issues, they also perceived drought as the climatic and environmental factors such as increased temperature, decreased precipitation, and other factors like war, financial weakness, deforestation, over-exploitation of groundwater, lack of electricity supply etc. The results show that drought has had serious economic impacts, including loss of employment and reduction in crop yield and livestock production, which have reduced farmers' livelihood options and weakened their financial situation. Social impacts have included migration, a sense of hopelessness and loss, conflicts over water, health problems, impacts on the schooling of children, malnutrition, and limits to food options. Significant environmental impacts such as an increase in temperature, pasture and forest degradation, deterioration of water quality, damage to fish and wildlife habitats, and groundwater depletion were also reported. Farmers used local techniques to adapt to drought and lessen its effects. Farmers perceived irrigation water to be a major source of conflict. Local elders, water-user associations, and formal courts were reported to be the most successful conflict resolution methods. It is expected that the results of this study will support policy makers within government and development agencies in Afghanistan to develop future drought adaptation policies.

A study from the perspective of reproductive assurance	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						autonomous self-fertilization; dimorphic incompatibility; distyly; homostyly; Primula chungensis; reciprocal herkogamy; reproductive assurance	POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION; PRIMULA-VULGARIS; EVOLUTION; PLANT; POPULATIONS; DISPLAY; POLLEN; ORCHID	Aims Distyly is one of the most widespread floral polymorphisms promoting cross-fertilization. Evolutionary transition from obligate cross-fertilized distyly to predominantly self-fertilized homostyly is frequently documented in various groups. However, empirical studies concerning the ecological factors connected with this transition are still lacking. Primula chungensis, suggested to be evolving from distyly to homostyly, provides an ideal model for the study of the ecological factors concerned with this transition. We study P. chungensis to understand if autonomous self-fertilization would provide reproductive assurance for the self-fertilized homo-styled morph in the field. Methods The incompatibility features of P. chungensis were tested with handpollination experiments. We compared the capacity of autonomous self-fertilization between the distylous and homo-styled morph of P. chungensis in the field by excluding the pollinators with bags. In addition, the degrees of herkogamy of some P. chungensis plants were between the short-styled and homo-styled morphs. These plants were studied to understand whether they were able to obtain greater reproductive assurance when the herkogamy in the flowers was reduced. Important Findings All three morphs of P. chungensis were highly self-and intra-morph compatible. The degree of herkogamy positively correlated with the capacity for autonomous self-fertilization. A negative correlation between the degree of herkogamy and the magnitude of pollen limitation was found, but no significant correlation was found between the degree of herkogamy and the contribution of cross-fertilization to overall fertilization. This study suggests that reducing the degree of herkogamy can significantly increase the reproductive assurance for a self-compatible plant. Our results provided evidence that the homo-styled morph of P. chungensis had the highest capacity for autonomous self-fertilization and the highest seed production in the field, because autonomous self-fertilization provided reproductive assurance for the homo-styled morph. This may cause selection towards the transition from distyly to homostyly.

An effective and robust similarity measure between a person image pair plays an important role in the re-identification tasks. In this work, we propose a new metric learning method based on least squares for person re-identification. Specifically, the similar training images pairs are used to learn a linear transformation matrix by being projected to finite discrete discriminant points using regression model; then, the metric matrix can be deduced by solving least squares problem with a closed form solution. We call it discriminant analytical least squares (DALS) metric. In addition, we develop the incremental learning scheme of DALS, which is particularly valuable in model retraining when given additional samples. Furthermore, DALS could be effectively kernelized to further improve the matching performance. Extensive experiments on the VIPeR, GRID, PRID450S and CUHK01 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.

Batch studies were carried out, and the maximum adsorption capacities of Pd(II), Co(III), and Fe(III) reached 172.9, 101.0, and 102.6, respectively. Adsorption was rapid, and equilibrium was established within 30 min. Et-N-Cu(BDC-NH2)(DMF) exhibited high thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, absorbed Pd(CN)(4)(2-) was selectively recovered by two-step elution. First, Co(CN)(6)(3-) and Fe(CN)(6)(3-) were eluted with a 1.5 mol L-1 KCl solution. Elution rates of Co(CN)(6)(3-) and Fe(CN)(6)(3-) were greater than 98.0%, whereas the elution percentage of Pd(CN)(4)(2-) was less than 2.0%. Second, >97.0% Pd(CN)(4)(2-) on the loaded MOFs was eluted using a 2.0 mol L-1 KI solution. The recovery rate of Pd(CN)(4)(2-) was greater than 91.0% after five testing cycles. Adsorption isotherms, kinetics models, and adsorption thermodynamics of Pd(CN)(4)(2-) on Et-N-Cu(BDC-NH2) (DMF) were also systematically investigated. The Et-N-Cu(BDC-NH2) (DMF) absorbent exhibited a rapid, excellent ability for the adsorption of metal cyanide complexes.

Rose flowers emit eugenol and its derivatives. We recently reported a eugenol synthase gene (RcEGS1) (JQ522949) that was present in petals of R. chinensis cv. Old Blush. RcEGS1 has its highest expression levels in the petals compared to other tissues; it has higher transcript levels at the developmental blooming stage and lower levels at budding and senescence stages. Here, we overexpressed the RcEGS1 protein in Escherichia coil, and showed by Western-blot analysis that its expression was mainly detected in stamens and petals at the flower opening stage. RcEGS1 was principally localized in the upper and lower epidermal layers, which are the major sites of scent emission in roses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that down-regulation of RcEGS1 expression in flowers by virus-induced gene silencing led to a reduction of the relative content of eugenol. We suggested that RcEGS1 was responsible for eugenol biosynthesis in roses.

J	Yu, H; Fang, J				Yu, Huan; Fang, Jun			An explanation for the peculiar periphery of supernova remnant G309.2-0.6	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						hydrodynamics (HD); methods: numerical; ISM: supernova remnants	JETS	Supernova remnant (SNR) G309.2-0.6 has a peculiar radio morphology with two bright ears to the southwest and northeast, although the main shell outside the ears is roughly circular. Based on an earlier proposal that the supernova ejecta has a jet component with extra energy, the dynamical evolution of the remnant is solved using 3D hydrodynamical (HD) simulation to investigate the formation of the periphery of the remnant. Assuming the ejecta with a kinetic energy of 10(51) erg and a mass of 3 M-circle dot evolved in a uniform ambient medium for a time of similar to 4000 yr and the jet component has cylindrical symmetry with a half open angle of 10 degrees, the result indicates that the energy contained in the jet is about 10%-15% of the kinetic energy of the entire ejecta to reproduce the detected profile. This study supports that the remnant originated from a jet-driven core-collapse supernova.

While the operating temperature of which is high. In this study, B, N, S and Cl doped graphene quantum dots (GQD) were prepared with a simple liquid-phase exfoliation method and with which decorated AL in order to low the operating temperature of AL. The sensors based on the doped GQD operated at room temperature and showed affinity toward different volatile organic compounds (VOCs). B-GQD revealed p-type semiconductor property and reduced the operating temperature of AL markedly form 90 degrees C to 55 degrees C when composite with it because of the synergy effect. Undoped GQD and N, S, Cl doped GQD showed n-type semiconductor property and oppositely increased the operating temperature of AL to different extent when composite with AL. That is, the more electrons in the outer layer of the doped element, the higher the temperature of GQD/AL composite rise. Thus the gas-sensing properties of B-GQDIAL composite was further researched, the results showed that the composite possessed high sensitivity, good selectivity, good stability and low operating temperature to low concentration of formaldehyde.

The evolution of island size and density with the interruption time were well studied by atomic force microscopy. During the growth interruption process, Ostwald ripening induces a drastic decrease of the density of islands without capping. The distribution of these islands determines the further growth of Ge islands after depositing the second amount of Ge. For the interruption time below 60 s, the self-limiting growth of islands is significant, leading to a slight increase of island diameter and an obvious enlargement of island height with increasing the time. As the interruption time is more than 60 s, many new smaller islands form after depositing the second amount of Ge. Consequently, the density and the average aspect ratio of Ge islands remain stable. This is indicated that the growth of islands exhibits an equilibrium state between Ostwald ripening and the formation of new smaller islands. With an interruption time of 60 s, both island diameters and heights with an unimodal distribution are observed.

Between April and October, 18 dye tracer experiments were conducted by injecting the tracer at one location of the lower ablation area of the Hailuogou Glacier to diagnose the seasonal variation of the subglacial drainage system of this section of glacier ice tongue. Using a simple advection-dispersion model (ADM), the flow velocity, hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, and degree of tracer spreading were deduced. Tracer transit velocity through the tested subglacial channel varied from 0.148 to 0.555 m s(-1) during the 2009 ablation season. Dispersivity showed a relatively high value than that found at other glaciers, which varied between 27.05 and 287.49 m(2) s(-1). Seasonal changes of these indexes indicated that the subglacial drainage system of the lower ablation area of the Hailougou Glacier is a relatively stable existing system in the case of its longitudinal shape, whereas its hydraulic efficiency is low in the early and late ablation seasons and high during the middle of summer due to subglacial channel expansion.

The spectra were carefully sky-subtracted taking into account the complex filamentary structure of S147. We have utilized all available LAMOST spectra toward S147, including sky and stellar spectra. By measuring the prominent optical emission lines including H alpha, [N II] lambda 6584 and [S II] lambda lambda 6717, 6731, we present maps of radial velocity and line intensity ratio covering the whole nebula of S147 with unprecedented detail. The maps spatially correlate well with the complex filamentary structure of S147. For the central 2 degrees of S147, the radial velocity varies from -100 to 100 km s(-1) and has peaks between similar to 0 and 10 km s(-1). The intensity ratios of H alpha/[S II] lambda lambda 6717, 6731, [S II] lambda 6717/lambda 6731 and H alpha/[NII] lambda 6584 peak at about 0.77, 1.35 and 1.48, respectively, with a scatter of 0.17, 0.19 and 0.37, respectively. The intensity ratios are consistent with the literature values. However, the range of variations of line intensity ratios estimated here, which are representative of the whole nebula, is larger than previously estimated.

Herein we analyzed a 910-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region sequences of 280 individuals from 6 Yunnan native cattle breeds, of which 251 sequences were newly determined. There were 93 variable sites that defined 117 haplotypes among all sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of all haplotypes revealed that Yunnan native cattle had two distinct mtDNA lineages - taurine and zebu. The taurine sequences fell into four haplogroups T1a, T2, T3 and T4, whereas the zebu sequences grouped into two haplogroups I1 and I2. In addition, our results revealed patterns of gradient changes in frequencies of taurine and zebu mtDNA lineages across different geographic regions of Yunnan. Furthermore, three kinds of methods (haplotype network, analysis of molecular variance, and Mantel tests) consistently showed no significant phylogeographic structuring among Yunnan native cattle breeds. This might be attributed to historical strong gene flow and genetic admixture among native cattle breeds in different geographic regions.

One is a quasi-60-day period known as the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO), and the other is a quasi-15-day period known as the quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO). After the mid-1970s, both the ISO and QBWO become intensified and more active, and these changes are equivalently barotropic. The primitive barotropic equations are adopted to study the involved mechanism. It reveals that the e-folding time of the least stable modes of both the ISO and QWBO becomes shorter if the model is solved under the atmospheric basic state after the mid-1970s than if solved under the basic state before the mid-1970s. This result suggests that the atmospheric basic flow after the mid-1970s facilitates a more rapid growth of the ISO and QBWO, and thereby an intensification of the low-frequency oscillations at the two bands.

J	Zhou, LH; Lu, K; Liu, WY; Ren, CC				Zhou, Lihua; Lu, Kevin; Liu, Weiyi; Ren, Changchun			Decision-making under uncertainty through extending influence diagrams with interval-valued parameters	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian networks; decision-making; influence diagrams; interval-valued parameters	PROBABILITY	Influence diagrams (IDs) are one of the most commonly used graphical and mathematical decision models for reasoning under uncertainty. In conventional IDs, both probabilities representing beliefs and utilities representing preferences of decision makers are precise point-valued parameters. However, it is usually difficult or even impossible to directly provide such parameters. In this paper, we extend conventional IDs to allow IDs with interval-valued parameters (IIDs) and develop a counterpart method of Copper's evaluation method to evaluate IIDs. IIDs avoid the difficulties attached to the specification of precise parameters and provide the capability to model decision-making processes in a situation that the precise parameters cannot be specified. The counterpart method to Copper's evaluation method reduces the evaluation of IIDs into inference problems of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities. An algorithm based on the approximate inference of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities is proposed, and extensive experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal strategies effectively in IIDs, and the interval-valued expected utilities obtained by proposed algorithm are contained in those obtained by exact evaluating algorithms. The newly development approach would significantly extend the range of IDs for managerial decision support applications where parameters of variables can be specifically defined by only estimated intervals.

Cells showed oxidase-negative and catalase-positive reactions and were motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Growth occurred at 2540 degrees C and pH 6.0-8.0 with optimal growth at 30-35(degrees)C, pH 7.0. The major respiratory lipoquinone was Q-10. C-16:0 and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) were identified as major cellular fatty acids. The profile of polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylcholine and one unidentified glycolipid. The major polyamine was sym-homospermidine. The genomic DNA G+C content was 66.5 mol%. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that X1-8(T) should be affiliated to the genus Sphmgomonas and formed a clade with most closely related species Sphingomonas changbaiensis NBRC 104936(T). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequences similarity analysis indicated that X1-8(T) had the highest similarity with S. changbaiensis NBRC 104936(T) (98.4%) and lower than 96.0% with other species of the genus Sphingomonas. DNA-DNA hybridization data indicated that X1-8(T) represented a novel genomic species of the genus Sphingomonas. The characteristics determined in the polyphasic taxonomic study indicated that X1-8(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas tabacisoh sp. nov. (type strain X1-8(T)=KCTC 62032(T)=CGMCC 1.16275(T)) is proposed.

The neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 60016(T) formed a distinct clade with N. rhizosphaerae EGI 80099(T) and N. massiliensis NP1(T). The polar lipids detected for strain EGI 60016(T) were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unidentified glycolipid, an unidentified lipid and an unidentified phospholipid The DNA G+C content was determined to be 64.1 mol% Other chemotaxonomic features of strain EGI 60016(T) included MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9 as the respiratory quinones, and anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0 as the major fatty acids. Based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis supported by morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and other differentiating phenotypic characteristics, strain EGI 60016(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed.

To help meet industrial needs, here we tested the influence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and starch on the performance of crosslinked alpha-amylase aggregates (CLEA), alpha-amylase-prepared as CLEA with starch (CLEA-S), and BSA (CLEA-BSA). Our results showed that the activities of CLEA, CLEA-S, and CLEA-BSA were 1.1-, 1.0-, and 0.74-fold higher than the free alpha-amylase, respectively. The stability of the immobilized enzyme slightly changed. After immobilization, the enzyme increased its pH and temperature ranges with the optimal pH values of 5.5, 7.5, 5.5, respectively for CLEA, CLEA-S, and CLEA-BSA, and an upper temperature limit of 50 degrees C for all three immobilized forms. Among the three immobilized forms, the CLEA-S was the most thermostable, losing only 3% of its initial activity during 390 min incubation at 50 degrees C. Our microscopic observations of CLEA-S showed that porous structures were formed and such structures could help substance diffusion. In addition, there was excellent affinity between CLEA-S and the substrate. The results suggest that CLEA-S have great potential for industrial application, including for use in starch-based alcohol fermentation.

Field observations, petrography, geochronology, major and trace elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions are reported to elucidate the genesis of the Houyaoyu granite porphyries. SIMS zircon U-Pb analyses for the Houyaoyu granite porphyries yield two concordant ages of 133.2 +/- 2.3 (2 sigma) and 131 +/- 1.1 (2 sigma) Ma, respectively. Major and trace elemental compositions indicate that these porphyries are high-K I-type granites with high contents of SiO2, K2O, Rb, U, Pb, low Nb, Ta, Ti, and P. Initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios range from 0.708 3 to 0.709 7, and epsilon (Nd)(t) values range from -9.13 to -12.3, with corresponding two-stage depleted-mantle Nd model ages (T (2DM)) varying from 1.57 to 1.91 Ga. This suggests that the Houyaoyu granite porphyries were predominantly derived from ancient lower continental crust, with minor involvement of mantle-derived components. On the basis of the tectonic evolution of the Qinling Orogen and geochemical characteristics of the Houyaoyu granite porphyries, it is proposed that they were formed in an extensional tectonic setting related to lithospheric destruction of the North China Craton, and produced Mo and Pb-Zn mineralization in East Qinling Orogen.

Three cases of different interstellar medium structures are considered: the uniform medium, the turbulent medium, and the cloudy medium. Large-scale density and magnetic fluctuations are calculated and mapped into the computational domain before simulations. The clouds are set by random distribution in advance. The above configuration allows us to study the time-dependent dynamical properties and morphological evolution of the SNR evolving with different ambient structures, along with the development of the instabilities at the contact discontinuity. Our simulation results indicate that remnant morphology deviates from symmetry if the interstellar medium contains clouds or turbulent density fluctuations. In the cloudy medium case, interactions between the shock wave and clouds lead to clouds' fragmentation. The magnetic field can be greatly enhanced by stretching field lines with a combination of instabilities while the width of amplification region is quite different among the three cases. Moreover, both the width of amplification region and the maximum magnetic-field strength are closely related to the clouds' density.

However, the capability of convergence peak statistic is affected by the noise in galaxy shape measurement, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as the contribution from the projected mass distribution from the large-scale structures along the line of sight (LOS). In this paper, we use the ray-tracing simulation on a curved sky to investigate the correspondence between the convergence peak and the dark matter haloes at the LOS. We find that, in case of no noise and for source galaxies at z(s) = 1, more than 65 per cent peaks with SNR >= 3 (SNR) are related to more than one massive haloes with mass larger than 10(13)M(circle dot). Those massive haloes contribute 87.2 per cent to high peaks (SNR >= 5) and the remaining contributions are from the large-scale structures. On the other hand, the peak distribution is skewed by the noise in galaxy shape measurement, especially for lower SNR peaks. In the noisy field where the shape noise is modelled as a Gaussian distribution, about 60 per cent high peaks (SNR >= 5) are true peaks and the fraction decreases to 20 per cent for lower peaks (3 <= SNR < 5). Furthermore, we find that high peaks (SNR >= 5) are dominated by very massive haloes larger than 10(14) M-circle dot.

Our results show the following. (1) All stellar populations younger than 10 Gyr exhibit strong disk flaring, which is accompanied by a dumpy vertical density profile that is best described by a sechn function with index depending on both radius and age. (2) Asymmetries and wave-like oscillations are presented in both the radial and vertical direction, with strength varying with stellar populations. (3) As a contribution by the Local spiral arm, the midplane stellar mass density at solar radius but 400-800 pc (3 degrees-6 degrees) away from the Sun in the azimuthal direction has a value of 0.0594 +/- 0.0008M(circle dot) pc(-3), which is 0.0164M(circle dot) pc(-3) higher than previous estimates at the solar neighborhood. The result raises doubts on the current estimate of local dark matter density. (4) The radial distribution of surface mass density yields a disk scale length evolving from similar to 4 kpc for the young populations to similar to 2 kpc for the old populations. The overall population exhibits a disk scale length of 2.48 +/- 0.05 kpc and a total stellar mass of (3.6 +/- 0.1) x 10(10)M(circle dot) assuming R-circle dot = 8.0 kpc, and the value becomes (4.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(10) M-circle dot if R-circle dot = 8.3 kpc. (5) The disk has a peak star formation rate (SFR) changing from 6-8 Gyr ago at the inner part to 4-6 Gyr ago at the outer part, indicating an inside-out assemblage history. The 0-1 Gyr population yields a recent disk total SFR of 1.96 +/- 0.12M(circle dot) yr(-1).

The ME dipole is composed of rectangular patches and metallic via holes, and is embedded in a square aperture etched on substrate-integrated gap waveguide (SIGW). In particular, the ME dipole is fed by a coplanar strip line, which is designed in SIGW to realize a low profile of 0.19 lambda(g) (lambda(g) is the guide wavelength at center frequency). The measurements show that the 10 dB impedance bandwidth of the antenna is 29%, ranging from 22.4 to 30 GHz, with a mean gain of 8.04 dBi. Furthermore, the antenna emits a stable radiation pattern, validated by the far-field measurements.

To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in DMP-mediated signaling pathways, we examined the mRNA levels in Arabidopsis with jasmonic acid (JA), DMP or salicylic acid (SA) treatment compared with a control. RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after DMP treatment were significantly enriched in three metabolism pathways shared by SA treatment and one additional pathway shared by JA treatment. Key DEGs, including PR1, EIN3 and FRK1, in the SA, JA/ethylene (ET) and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) pathways for inducing resistance were significantly regulated. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that DMP-mediated signaling cross-talked with JA and SA signaling and associated with PAMP-triggered immunity. SA accumulated significantly after DMP treatment. However some known small molecules inducing SA accumulation were not found in DMP. Together, we demonstrated that DMP treatment activated defense in SAR via gene regulation in the JA and SA pathways. These results provide molecular evidence for the mechanisms in the DMP induced SAR and could guide the further identification of the activators.

However, the biochemical impacts of these fungal endophytes on grape cells is also expected due to their potential application in grape quality management. After assessed multiple physiochemical traits to those grape cells which have co-cultured with different endophytic fungal strains in this study, and found the presence of fungal endophytes obviously triggered ROS stress responses in grape cells, and the biochemical status in grape cells were differentially modified by different fungal strains. In those tested endophytic fungal strains, RH37 (Epicoccum sp.), RH6 (Alternaria sp.), RH32 (Alternaria sp.) and RH34 (Trichothecium sp.) conferred greater metabolic impacts on grape cells. And soluble protein (SPr), total flavonoids (TF), total phenols (TPh) and malondialdehyde (MDA) on the other hand, were sensitive biochemical parameters which can be influenced in greater ranges than other detected parameters. Most interestedly, fungal endophytes shaped metabolites patterns in grape cells during the dual culture appeared fungal genus/species/strain-specificity. The work confirmed the significance of fungal endophytes in grape metabolic regulation and elucidated the possibility to purposely manage grape quality using tool of fungal endophytes.

Shear bias calibrations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis; surveys; cosmology: observations	GALAXY SHAPE MEASUREMENT; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; AREA ISO SURVEY; OPTICAL SURVEY; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; X-RAY; CFHTLENS; SEXTRACTOR; SOFTWARE; PROGRAM	The VST Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields (VOICE) Survey is proposed to obtain deep optical ugri imaging of the CDFS and ES1 fields using the VLT Survey Telescope (VST). At present, the observations for the CDFS field have been completed, and comprise in total about 4.9 deg(2) down to r(AB)similar to 26 mag. In the companion paper by Fu et al., we present the weak lensing shear measurements for r-band images with seeing <= 0.9 arcsec. In this paper, we perform image simulations to calibrate possible biases of the measured shear signals. Statistically, the properties of the simulated point spread function and galaxies show good agreements with those of observations. The multiplicative bias is calibrated to reach an accuracy of similar to 3.0 per cent. We study the bias sensitivities to the undetected faint galaxies and to the neighbouring galaxies. We find that undetected galaxies contribute to the multiplicative bias at the level of similar to 0.3 per cent. Further analysis shows that galaxies with lower signal-to-noise ratio are impacted more significantly because the undetected galaxies skew the background noise distribution. For the neighbouring galaxies, we find that although most have been rejected in the shape measurement procedure, about one-third of them still remain in the final shear sample. They show a larger ellipticity dispersion and contribute to similar to 0.2 per cent of the multiplicative bias. Such a bias can be removed by further eliminating these neighbouring galaxies. But the effective number density of the galaxies can be reduced considerably. Therefore efficient methods should be developed for future weak lensing deep surveys.

Under stress, melatonin usually accumulates sharply by modulating its biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. Beginning from the precursor tryptophan, four consecutive enzymes mediate the biosynthesis of tryptamine or 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, N-acetylserotonin or 5-methoxytryptamine, and melatonin. Then, the compound is catabolized into 2-hydroxymelatonin, cyclic-3-hydroxymelatonin, and N-1-acetyl-N-2-formyl-5-methoxyknuramine through 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalysis or reaction with reactive oxygen species. As an ancient and powerful antioxidant, melatonin directly scavenges ROS induced by various stress conditions. Furthermore, it confreres stress tolerance by activating the plant's antioxidant system, alleviating photosynthesis inhibition, modulating transcription factors that are involved with stress resisting, and chelating and promoting the transport of heavy metals. Melatonin is even proven to defense against pathogen attacks for the plant by activating other stress-relevant hormones, like salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. Intriguingly, other precursors and metabolite molecules involved with melatonin also can increase stress tolerance for plant except for unconfirmed 5-methoxytryptamine, cyclic-3-hydroxymelatonin, and N-1-acetyl-N-2-formyl-5-methoxyknuramine. Therefore, the precursors and metabolites locating at the whole biosynthesis and catabolism pathway of melatonin could contribute to plant stress resistance, thus providing a new perspective for promoting plant stress tolerance.

Therefore, we should anticipate a diverse, pollinator fauna. China also has a long history of applied ethnobiology, including a sustainable agriculture based on apiculture and plant-pollinator interactions. However, the science of pollination ecology is a far younger sub-discipline in China, compared to in the West. Chinese studies in pollination ecology began in the 1970s. For this review, we compiled a complete reference database (>600 publications) of pollination studies in China. Using this database, we identified and analyzed gaps and limitations in research on the pollination systems of native and naturalized species. Specifically, we asked the following questions: 1) What do we know about the pollination systems of native, Chinese species? 2) How does Chinese pollination ecology compare with the development of pollination research abroad and which aspects of research should be pursued by Chinese anthecologists in the near future? 3) What research on pollination in China will advance our understanding and contribute to our ongoing analyses of endemism and conservation? Subsequently, we segregated and identified prospective lines of future research that are unique to China and can only be done in China. This requires discussing priorities within a systematic approach. Copyright (C) 2018 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

PERFORMANCE AND SURVIVAL OF PERENNIAL RICE DERIVATIVES (ORYZA SATIVA L./ORYZA LONGISTAMINATA) IN LAO PDR	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							FED LOWLAND RICE; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; GENOTYPE; YIELD; FOOD	Genotype by environment (G x E) interactions for grain yield were investigated in 13 perennial rice (Oryza sativa L./Oryza longistaminata) derivatives over three sites and 2 years in Lao PDR. Genotype accounted for 29.0% of the total sum of squares, with environment and the G x E interaction responsible for 60.2 and 10.8%, respectively. Cluster analysis identified three environment and six genotype groups, which accounted for 49.7, 98.0 and 42.8% of the E, G and G x E sums of squares, respectively. Principal component axes 1, 2 and 3 accounted for 54.0, 30.6 and 11.7% of the G x E sum of squares, respectively, with PCA1 indicating yield potential, PCA2 timing of cessation of rainfall in the 2011 wet season, and PCA3 environmental stresses affecting regrowth in the 2012 wet season. Genotype groups differed in adaptation to these contrasting conditions. G6 (Line 213, 240 and RD23) was widely adapted to all environments, with G5 (Line 248) being especially adapted to the 2012 environments. G3 and G4 were neutral, though G3 (Line 53) showed some preference for the Na Pok environments. G1 and G2 were poorly adapted everywhere, with the tall and late G1 (Line 11) being especially poor at Na Pok 2011 in a dry finish. While yields were lower in 2012, all derivatives survived the dry season with access to life-saving irrigation. This is promising as the annual rice RD23 was unable to ratoon under these conditions, and had to be re-sown. Importantly, Line 213. 240 and 248 yielded comparably to RD23 from regrowth in 2012. Development of perennial rice should target rainfed and especially upland environments.

Probing the transcriptome of Aconitum carmichaelii reveals the candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of the toxic aconitine-type C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids	PHYTOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Aconitum carmichaelii (Ranunculaceae); Fuzi; Transcriptome; Biosynthesis; Aconitine-type C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids; Acute toxicity; Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)	LATERAL ROOT; METHYLTRANSFERASE; PLANTS; DIVERSITY; BAHD; TOOL	Aconitum carmichaelii has long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine, and its processed lateral roots are known commonly as fuzi. Aconitine-type C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids accumulating in the lateral roots are some of the main toxicants of this species, yet their biosynthesis remains largely unresolved. As a first step towards understanding the biosynthesis of aconitine-type C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of rootstocks and leaf tissues of Aconitum carmichaelii by next-generation sequencing. A total of 525 unigene candidates were identified as involved in the formation of C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids, including those encoding enzymes in the early steps of diterpenoid alkaloids scaffold biosynthetic pathway, such as ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases, entkaurene synthases, kaurene oxidases, cyclases, and key aminotransferases. Furthermore, candidates responsible for decorating of diterpenoid alkaloid skeletons were discovered from transcriptome sequencing of fuzi, such as monooxygenases, methyltransferase, and BAHD acyltransferases. In addition, 645 differentially expressed genes encoding transcription factors potentially related to diterpenoid alkaloids accumulation underground were documented. Subsequent modular domain structure phylogenetics and differential expression analysis led to the identification of BAHD acyltransferases possibly involved in the formation of acetyl and benzoyl esters of diterpenoid alkaloids, associated with the acute toxicity of fuzi. The transcriptome data provide the foundation for future research into the molecular basis for aconitine-type C-19-diterpenoid alkaloids biosynthesis in A. carmichaelii.

As shown in the optimized geometry of the complexes, the introduction of styryl group not only extended the conjugated area of the intercalative ligand, but also retained the excellent planarity. These two merits have been proven to be beneficial for their DNA intercalation, thus greatly improved their inhibition activity towards DNA transcription by RNA polymerase and DNA topoisomerase, two enzymes closely related to both DNA and tumor cell growth. The relationships between the substituent group structures and the biological activities have also been investigated from energetic and electronic aspects by quantum chemistry calculations. Results from cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis assay testified that the styryl substituted ruthenium complexes possessed higher antitumor activity than [Ru(bpy)(2)(pip)](2+), as expected. As quantified in the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, the tumor cell death is caused mostly through apoptosis for Ru2 and Ru3, while non-apoptotic processes for Rul, Ru4 and Ru5. In vitro fluorescence evaluation revealed that all complexes located mainly in cytoplasm, but the three complexes with high antiproliferative activity could enter nucleus. All complexes have shown apparent lower cytotoxicity towards normal human colon epithelial cell CCD-841-CON than the examined tumor cell lines.

In this paper, we consider a special class of three-element languages, where two words have the same length which is less than the length of the third word. We give a necessary and sufficient condition to state whether a three-element language in this class is a code. This result partially resolves the problem proposed by Professor H. J. Shyr in 1990s.

Complexes 1-4 are also determined by elemental analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, IR and electronic spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complexes 1-3 are isostructural and they crystallize in the orthorhombic space group of Pbca, while complex 4 belongs to triclinic system with P (1) over bar space group. Based on different intermolecular hydrogen bonding and pi...pi stacking interactions, complexes 1-4 further assembled into 3D supramolecular frameworks. Hirshfeld surface analysis was used to further study the intermolecular interactions of the complexes. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) reveal that these complexes possess good thermal stability, and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses show intense exothermic phenomena in the decomposition processes of triazole groups. Besides, the photoluminescence property of complex 1 in the solid state is also determined.

The root samples were cross-sectioned at a thickness of 10 mu m. Selected areas in the root epidermis and endodermis were mapped with a sampling resolution of 100 and 200 nm, varying with the mapping areas. The results indicate that trace element concentrations in the epidermis and endodermis vary among the elements measured, possibly because of their different chemical properties or their ability to act as micronutrients for the plants. Elemental concentrations (As, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, P, S and Zn) within each individual root sample and between the root samples collected during two different seasons are both significantly different (p < 0.01). Furthermore, this study indicates that the nonessential elements (As and Cr) are significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with Fe, with high concentrations in the root epidermis, while others are not, implying that Fe may be a barrier to nonessential element transport in the root system. Hierarchy cluster analysis shows two distinct groups, one including As, Cr and Fe and the other the rest of the elements measured. Factor analysis also indicates that the processes and mechanisms controlling element transport in the root system can be different between the nutrient and nonessential elements.

NOV.; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; SEQUENCING DATA; DEGREES-C; CLOSTRIDIUM; BACTERIUM; EUBACTERIUM; BIOREACTOR	In this study, changes in the microbial communities and the metabolic pathway involved in anaerobic digestion were examined as the temperature was changed from 9 to 55 degrees C. The results from six batch biogas reactors, which were designed to ferment at 9, 15, 21, 35, 45 and degrees 55 C, showed that: 1) The components of the microbial communities and metabolic pathways were found to be very similar but the metabolic activities increased significantly when the temperature grew from 15 to 35 degrees C. 2) Hydro-genotrophic metabolism was almost exclusively observed when the temperature was lowered to 9 degrees C, whereas greater bacterial diversity involving hydrolisis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis was observed when the temperature was raised to 45 degrees C. Finally, these dominant bacteria involved in hydrolisis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis decreased in number when the temperature was raised to 55 C and acetotrophic-type metabolism became the major metabolic pathway. That means the turning point for microbial community composition and metabolic pathway from mesophilic to thermophilic was at 45 degrees C and the metabolic pathway at 9 degrees C was somewhat different to those observed at 15-35 degrees C.

The biomass carbon material after activation (AC) is constituted of small particles and achieves a large specific surface area of 1602 m(2)/g. After decoration of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, the Ni(OH)(2)/AC composites were investigated the microwave absorption performances in 2-18 GHz. The maximum reflection loss of the Ni(OH)(2)/AC composites reached -23.6 dB at 15.48 GHz with a thickness of 6 mm. Moreover, the fundamental mechanism based on conductivity, the polarization and defects is discussed. The present investigation offers a new possibility for the biomass based fabrication of potential microwave absorbing materials. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS, BET and PL. The photocatalytic performance of BiOI/Bi5O7I composite was evaluated by the photocatalytic decomposition of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) under visible light irradiation. The results revealed that the BiOI/Bi5O7I composite showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to pure BiOI and pure Bi5O7I. The mass ratio of BiOI/Bi5O7I and effect of pH value for photocatalytic activity of BiOI/Bi5O7I composite were investigated. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism of the degradation process was thoroughly elucidated. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of the BiOI/Bi5O7I composite should be attributed to fabrication of BiOI/Bi5O7I p-n heterojunction, which was responsible for efficient separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs.

However, most methods for the detection of PSA often require major laboratories, precisely analytical instruments and complicated operations. Currently, the design and development of satisfying electrochemical biosensors based on biomimetic materials (e.g. synthetic receptors) and nanotechnology is highly desired. Thus, we focused on the combination of molecular recognition and versatile nanomaterials in electrochemical devices for advancing their analytical performance and robustness. Herein, by using the present prepared multifunctional hydroxyl pillar[5]arene@gold nanoparticles@graphitic carbon nitride (HP5@AuNPs@g-C3N4) hybrid nanomaterial as robust biomimetic element, a high-performance electrochemical immunosensor for detection of PSA was constructed. The as-prepared immunosensor, with typically competitive advantages of low cost, simple preparation and fast detection, exhibited remarkable robustness, ultra-sensitivity, excellent selectivity and reproducibility. The limit of detection (LOD) and linear range were 0.12 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and 0.0005-10.00 ng respectively. The satisfying results provide a promising approach for clinical detection of PSA in human serum.

The Cu2O backbone supports the growth of an ultrathin Mn(OH)(2) nanoflake shell, leading to a relatively large surface area (65.8 m(2) g(-1)) for sufficient utilization of active materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements (GCD), as well as cycling stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to examine the electrochemical performances of the Cu2O@Mn(OH)(2) core-shell structure. Applied as a supercapacitor electrode, the Cu2O@Mn(OH)(2) composite delivers a high specific capacitance of 540.9 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and an energy density of 6.4-18.2 Wh kg(-1). After conducting 3000 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1), the capacitance retention of 71.5% was achieved. The unique core-shell structure of the Cu2O@Mn(OH)(2) composite favours the effective transport of electrolytes and shortens the ion diffusion path. In addition, the synergetic effects from both Cu2O and Mn(OH)(2) significantly enhance the electrochemical performances. Our findings suggest that this Cu2O@Mn(OH)(2) core-shell is very promising for next generation high-performance supercapacitors.

These are used as gas-sensing material in sensors, fabricated according to the indirect heating method. Gas-sensing performance of the sensors is investigated by testing their gas response to acetone, which exhibits favorable selectivity, good gas response value, fast response/recovery time, low detection concentration and good long-term stability to acetone. Gas response was defined as the ratio of R-a/R-g, where R-a and R-g are the resistance values of gas sensor exposed in air and objective gas, respectively. Among all these as-prepared gas sensors, the 0.5% Pt-functionalized TiO2 based gas sensor shows the highest gas response value of 29.51-200ppm acetone at 300 degrees C, and the gas response value is 5.2 times higher than that (5.67) of pure TiO2 based gas sensor. It also has excellent selectivity to acetone when comparing with toluene, n-butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. The large specific surface area (168.101m(2)g(-1)) provides enough contacting interface between gas and the as-prepared materials, then the gas molecules could be broken into CO2 and H2O by the active adsorbed oxygen species. The present results of the Pt-functionalized TiO2 based gas sensors illustrates their potential application in detecting acetone.

Polyploid plants and some fishes have been commercialized. Typically, severe genomic perturbations immediately follow polyploidization and little is known about how polyploid offspring survives the genetic and epigenetic changes. Investigations into this require the identification of genes related to polyploidization and the discrimination of dosage-balance from paternal and maternal copies, and regardless of the mechanism being either autopolyploidization or allopolyploidization. New approaches and technologies may discern the mosaic of novel gene functions gained through the recombination of paternal and maternal genes in allopolyploidization. Modifications of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated system (Cas) protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) have been employed in studies of polyploidization of plants. However, the approach has seldom been applied to polyploidization in vertebrates. Herein, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to trace gene-fate in tetraploid goldfish, and specifically to identify the functional differentiation of two divergent copies of fgf20a, which are expressed differently throughout embryonic development. We expect this gene editing system will be applicable to studies of polyploids and the genetic improvement of polyploid livestock.

In this study, we integrated the molecular design tactics of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) into ESIPT molecules with the goals of improving their Phi(PL)s and increasing their fluorescence lifetimes. Two proof-of-concept molecules, PXZPDO and DMACP-DO, were developed by adopting symmetric D-pi-A-pi-D molecular architectures (where D and A represent donors and acceptors, respectively) featuring electron donating phenoxazine or a 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine moiety, an ESIPT core beta-diketone, and phenylene pi-bridges. Both molecules exhibited sole enol-type forms stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and exhibited a unique and dynamic ESIPT character that was verified by transient absorption analyses. Endowed with distinct TADF features, PXZPDO and DMACPDO showed high Phi(PL)s of 68% and 86% in the film state, coupled with notable delayed fluorescence lifetimes of 1.33 and 1.94 mu s, respectively. Employing these ESIPT emitters successfully achieved maximum external quantum efficiencies (n(ext)s) of 18.8% and 23.9% for yellow and green organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), respectively, which represent the state-of-the-art device performances for ESIPT emitters. This study not only opens a new avenue for designing efficient ESIPT emitters with high Phi(PL)s and long fluorescence lifetimes in solid state but also unlocks the huge potential of ESIPT emitters in realizing high-efficiency OLEDs.

J	He, J				He, Jun			Harvest and trade of caterpillar mushroom (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) and the implications for sustainable use in the Tibet Region of Southwest China	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Commercial non-timber forest products; Customary tenure; Medicinal plants; Value chain; Tibet region	FOREST-PRODUCTS; FUNGUS; COMMODIFICATION; AREAS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; COLLECTION; DIVERSITY; HIMALAYAS; VILLAGES	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Caterpillar mushroom (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) is a unique medicinal fungi which is only found in alpine grasslands in Himalayan mountain regions and the Tibetan Plateau. Known locally as Yartsa Gunbu, it has been widely used in Tibetan and Chinese Medicine for centuries. It is crucial to understand local commercial harvest and trade practices of caterpillar mushroom to support the sustainable management of this valuable resource. However, data derived from empirically grounded research is currently limited, particularly in China. Aim of this study: The research aims to provide the most up-to-date insights into caterpillar mushroom harvest and trade in the main production area of the Tibet Region in Southwest China and to generate policy recommendations for sustainable use. Materials and methods: The research was conducted in 2015-2016 in six Tibetan communities located in two counties in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest China. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from in-depth interviews with local households engaged in caterpillar mushroom harvesting (n = 157), local caterpillar mushroom traders (n = 14), and from focus groups discussions (n = 5) with regional caterpillar mushroom industry stakeholders. Results: The research found large regional-and community-level differences in caterpillar mushroom harvest practices. The harvest practices of communities involved in the co-management of a Nature Reserve were more sustainable than those communities not involved in such a scheme, and this was due to the external support and training provided via the co-management scheme. Moreover, a customary tenure system was proving effective for avoiding competition over caterpillar mushroom collection. However, in both counties, narrow marketing channel and non-grading system in trade limits the possibility of improving the local benefits generated from the commercial harvest of caterpillar mushroom. Meanwhile, the local traders play an important bridging role in the value chain and generate greater benefits from product grading. Conclusion: To support the sustainable management of the caterpillar mushroom industry in Southwest China, the prefectural governments should invest in training on appropriate harvesting techniques and the dissemination of market information. It is also critical that prefectural governments recognize and support the customary tenure system of mushroom collection to avoid competition between collectors.

In this paper, gas sensors for monitoring of benzene are developed based on a boron-doped graphene quantum dot (BGQD)/Ag-LaFeO3 p-p heterojunction (B/APPH). The band gap of the BGQDs and Ag-LaFeO3 matched well, promoting separation of electron-hole pairs and enhancing the carrier transport ability. The introduced Ag catalytically oxidized benzene into CO2 and H2O in gas-sensing reactions. We optimized the selectivity of the B/APPH by benzene molecular imprinting. Our results show that B/APPH possesses a high response (17.5) and good selectivity, repeatability, and accuracy at a low operating temperature (65 degrees C) for detection of as little as 1 ppm of benzene. The heterojunction between the BGQDs and Ag-LaFeO3 improved the carrier-transport ability and reduced the operating temperature while maintaining the high sensing response and selectivity. The ability to modulate carrier-transport developed in this work will guide work on high performance gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors.

The central Yunnan Plateau of Southwest China is characterized by monsoon related seasonal drought, and frequent forest fires. We sampled five fire sites burned in different years and a middle aged forest, measured species composition dissimilarity and its species turnover and nestedness components, within each fire site and across all sites. Results indicated species turnover as the primary component of beta diversity within all communities. There was no trend of change with year-since-fire (YSF) in beta diversity among early post-fire communities, but beta diversity in the middle aged community was significantly higher. Species turnover patterns across fire sites revealed a weak dispersal limit effect, which was stronger at lower than upper slope position for woody plants, and reverse for herbs. At the site scale, the species dissimilarity and turnover both enlarged with increasing slope position difference, especially in the middle-aged community, but the species nestedness had no consistent trend among sites, except a decreasing trend in the middle-aged forest. (Partial) Mantel tests indicated habitat filtering [ primarily indicating total nitrogen (TN) and slope position] played a much stronger role than dispersal limit and YSF (indicating competition intensity) for the post-fire forest assembly at the landscape scale, for both woody and herbaceous layers. However, at the site scale, Mantel tests indicated a diminishing effect of soil nutrient filtering with increasing YSF, while effects of topography and spatial distance in the middle aged community was stronger. This divergence suggests the primary assembly mechanism gradually shift away from the soil constraint. While the seasonal drought and the mountain topography dominate the environmental legacy, our results imply that fires may reinforce a priority effect in the forests assembly in this region, by creating a habitat filtering (e.g., moisture and nitrogen limitation) effect on species composition in post-fire communities.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Galactic Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy in the Northern Hemisphere from the ARGO-YBJ Experiment during 2008-2012	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astroparticle physics; cosmic rays	AIR-SHOWER ARRAY; SCALE SIDEREAL ANISOTROPY; ARRIVAL DIRECTIONS; SKY SURVEY; ENERGY; INTENSITY; DETECTOR	This paper reports on the observation of the sidereal large-scale anisotropy of cosmic rays using data collected by the ARGO-YBJ experiment over 5 years (2008-2012). This analysis extends previous work limited to the period from 2008 January to 2009 December, near the minimum of solar activity between cycles 23 and 24. With the new data sample, the period of solar cycle 24 from near minimum to maximum is investigated. A new method is used to improve the energy reconstruction, allowing us to cover a much wider energy range, from 4 to 520 TeV. Below 100 TeV, the anisotropy is dominated by two wide regions, the so-called "tail-in" and "loss-cone" features. At higher energies, a dramatic change of the morphology is confirmed. The yearly time dependence of the anisotropy is investigated. Finally, no noticeable variation of cosmic-ray anisotropy with solar activity is observed for a median energy of 7 TeV.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RA-associated CPI remains little understood. Here we established a novel tree shrew-based collagen-induced arthritis (TsCIA) model to study RA-associated CPI. Our results showed that typical CPI but not fibrosis developed pathologically in the TsCIA model. Furthermore, abnormal up-regulation of pulmonary chemokine CXCL10 was directly associated with lung damage. Specific blockage of CXCR3 (a CXCL10 receptor) significantly decreased the severity of CPI by decreasing the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Therefore, CXCL10 is proposed as a key player responsible for the development of TsCIA-associated CPI. Our findings also suggest that CXCR3 could be developed as a potential diagnosis biomarker for RA-associated CPI.

Of the nine new species, H. chingii, H. denticulatum, H. sinense, H. speluncicola, and H. wangpeishanii are from southern China, whereas H. distans, H. ngheanense, H. phamhoanghoi, and H. quangnamense are from Vietnam. These new species are morphologically similar to but distinguishable from those of the H. unilaterale s. l. group (H. apogamum, H. hondoense, and H. murakami-hatanakae). All except one new species were included in a recent phylogenetic analysis and were well supported as distinct lineages based on molecular data. All new species are illustrated and the information on their distributions, habitats, and major distinguishing characters is provided.

ACFO emits intense orange-red light peaking at 600 nm in toluene solution, which is significantly red-shifted compared with its benzophenone-based counterpart. Imparted with a small singlet-triplet splitting energy of 0.13 eV, ACFO exhibits distinct TADF feature with a short delayed fluorescent lifetime of 3.8 mu s and displays a moderate photoluminescence quantum yield of 31%. Consequently, employing ACFO as an emitter results in orange-red organic light-emitting diodes that exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 11%, corresponding to a nearly 100% exciton utilization efficiency in electroluminescence process. Our finding demonstrates for the first time that fluorenone derivatives can be employed as TADF emitters for high-efficiency fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes.

Most previous studies have concentrated on the effects of human disturbances on species diversity, but their effects on phylogenetic diversity have been relatively seldom documented. Here, we measured the temporal changes in species and phylogenetic alpha diversity in 12 mainstream regions of the Lancang River (LCR) in the context of hydropower development and widespread exotic invasions. We found that disturbances by dams and widespread introductions of exotic fishes have induced a marked loss of native species (average 36.8 species disappeared per region, accounting for 47.2% of the historical native species) in the downstream regions over time, whereas few native species were disappeared (average 4 species disappeared, accounting for 23.8% of the historical native species) in the upstream regions. In terms of phylogenetic diversity, however, the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+), a taxonomic proxy for phylogenetic diversity) of the entire assemblages significantly increased (an increase of 4.4% compared to historical Delta(+)) in all regions, while native Delta(+) insignificantly decreased in downstream regions, and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+), a proxy for variation in phylogenetic diversity) of the entire assemblages significantly increased (24.6%) in downstream regions, while native Delta(+) significantly decreased (12.0%) in all regions. Such changes in phylogenetic diversity were triggered by invasions by distantly related exotic species and disappearances of congeneric endemic species. Across the LCR, the relationships between species richness, Delta(+), and Delta(+) and altitude all became obscure due to the combined effect of introductions and disappearances. In dammed regions, the disappearance rate and rate of change in the taxonomic distinctness of native assemblages showed negative correlations with the distances of cascade dams. Our study showed that intensive hydropower development and exotic invasions have significantly affected both the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of fish assemblages in the LCR, especially in its downstream region. However, the response of phylogenetic diversity to human disturbance was inconsistent with that of species diversity, implying that examining the response of phylogenetic diversity could provide additional information for assessing the impacts of human domination.

Pairwise comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains YIM 72259(T) and YIM 72238(T) are closely related to Tepidimonas ignava SPS-1037(T) (97.0 and 97.5%, respectively), Tepidimonas taiwanensis I1-1(T) (96.5 and 97.3%), while sharing 98.0% sequence similarity with each other. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strains YIM 72238(T) with T. ignava SPS-1037(T) and T. taiwanensis I1-1(T) were determined to be 25.2 +/- 1.2 and 24.6 +/- 3.1%, respectively, while the two strains (YIM 72259(T) and YIM 72238(T)) had a relatedness value of 38.3 +/- 4.4% between themselves. The two strains were aerobic, Gram-stain negative, motile by means of a polar flagellum and formed non-pigmented colonies. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 72259(T) and YIM 72238(T) were determined to be 71.6 and 68.9 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids in both strains were identified as (> 10%) C-16:0, C-17:0 and summed feature 8, while the strain YIM 72238(T) contained a moderately high amount of summed feature 3 as well. The polar lipid profiles for strains YIM 72259(T) and YIM 72238(T) consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified aminolipid and several unidentified phospholipids. Besides the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences and the biochemical characteristics indicated that the two strains represented two novel members of the genus Tepidimonas, for which the name Tepidimonas sediminis sp. nov. [type strain YIM 72259(T) (= NBRC 112410(T) = CGMCC 1.15971(T)) and Tepidimonas alkaliphilus sp. nov. [type strain YIM 72238(T) (= KCTC 52717(T) = CCTCC AB 2017168(T))] are proposed.

In this work, a novel, rapid, and convenient electrochemical approach for recognition of tryptophan isomers (L-/D-Trp) was constructed based on the alternating layer-by-layer assembly of water-soluble cationic and anionic pillar[5] arene on a carboxylic graphene (C-Gra) modified glass carbon electrode. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed to study the electrochemical recognition of tryptophan isomers. The results reveal that both the peak currents of L-Trp and D-Trp decreased with the increasing of the layer number of the assembled pillar[5] arene, whereas the peak current value's difference between the L-Trp and D-Trp increased with the increased layers, which demonstrated an efficient route for discriminating the L-Trp and D-Trp. The recognition mechanism was studied by H-1 NMR spectra and molecular docking. The host - guest interaction is different for D-and L-Trp due to the opposite steric configurations of the Trp isomers, resulting in significantly discernible electrochemical differences in both peak currents and consequently effective chiral recognition of Trp isomers. This study is the first example that shows the construction of electrochemical chiral separation platform based on pillar[5] arene. This method shows potential applications in many fields, including separation, purification, storage of chiral molecule, drug detection and analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In present work, the S. hirsutum was fermented in YMG broth, and four novel mixed terpenes, stereumamides A-D (1-4), which are sesquiterpenes combined with alpha-amino acids to form quaternary ammonium hybrids, were isolated from the Stereum hirsutum FP-91666 and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. Stereumamides A and D showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 12.5-25.0 mu g/mL. The stereumamides A-D should be apparently the first example of naturally occurring a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) conjugated by sesquiterpene with an alpha-amino acid. QAC is a common antibacterial agent in food industry, which is found in the mycelium of Stereum hirsutum would suggest that the complex basidiocarp is a functional food and veritable folk medicine.

In this study, we functionally characterized Slt2 orthologs AoSlt2 and MhSlt2 from the nematode-trapping fungi Arthrobotrys oligospora and Monacrosporium haptotylum, respectively. We found that disruption of AoSlt2 and MhSlt2 led to reduced mycelial growth, increased sensitivity to environmental stresses such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Congo red, and H2O2, and an inability to produce conidia and nematode-trapping structures. Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based analyses showed that the transcription of sporulation-related (AbaA, Sep2, and MedA) and cell wall synthesis-related (Chs, Glu, and Gfpa) genes was down-regulated in the mutants compared with the wildtype strains. Moreover, the mutant strains showed reduced extracellular proteolytic activity and decreased transcription of three homologous serine protease-encoding genes. These results show for the first time that MAP kinase Slt2 orthologs play similar roles in regulating mycelial growth, conidiation, trap formation, stress resistance, and pathogenicity in the divergent nematode-trapping fungal species A. oligospora and M. haptotylum.

The Ensem-NN is introduced based on the idea of ensemble learning, "two heads are better than one." According to the property of skeleton sequences, we design one-dimensional convolution neural network with residual structure as Base-Net. From entirety to local, from focus to motion, we designed four different subnets based on the Base-Net to extract diverse features. The first subnet is a Two-stream Entirety Net, which performs on the entirety skeleton and explores both temporal and spatial features. The second is a Body-part Net, which can extract fine-grained spatial and temporal features. The third is an Attention Net, in which a channel-wised attention mechanism can learn important frames and feature channels. Frame-difference Net, as the fourth subnet, aims at exploring motion features. Finally, the four subnets are fused as one ensemble network. Experimental results show that the proposed Ensem-NN performs better than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used datasets.

Two schedulability tests are presented. The first test is a concise utilization-based test which can be applied to the implicit deadline IMC task set. The suboptimality of the proposed utilization-based test is evaluated via a widely-used scheduling metric, speedup factors. The second test is a more effective test but with higher complexity which is based on the concept of demand bound function (DBF). The proposed DBF-based test is more generic and can apply to constrained deadline IMC task set. Moreover, in order to address the high time cost of the existing deadline tuning algorithm, we propose a novel algorithm which significantly improve the efficiency of the deadline tuning procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed schedulability tests, confirm the theoretical suboptimality results with respect to speedup factor, and demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm over the existing deadline tunning algorithm. In addition, issues related to the implementation of the IMC model under EDF-VD are discussed.

This study was conducted to recognize the distribution of grass roots and its impacts on soil nutrients in the water level fluctuation zone of TGR. Roots of four predominant herbaceous plants in the study area, specifically, Cynodon dactylon, Hemarthria altissima, Hemarthria compressa, and Paspalum paspaloides, and their corresponding relation with soil nutrient contents were investigated. Root surface area density was determined with WinRHIZO, and the relationships of root distribution with soil depths and soil nutrient contents were studied. The results indicates that most roots are distributed in the top soil layer of 0-10 cm. Estimated root surface area density for the selected grass species ranges from 0.16 to 13.44 cm2/cm3, and decreases exponentially with an increase in soil depth. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents are significantly lower on bare control area than the corresponding values on the grasslands. Total nutrient contents on grasslands of C. dactylon and H. compressa are higher than those of other grass areas. Root length density and root surface area density are significantly correlated with soil organic matter and total nitrogen content for the four grasslands. The present results suggests that plant roots have significant effects on the distribution of soil nutrients in soil profiles in the riparian zone along the TGR. Nevertheless, additional investigations are needed to reveal the specific interactions between plant roots distribution, soil nutrients and water level fluctuations.

Don complex comprises several taxa that are either diploid or tetraploid. The tetraploids are assumed to have originated from diploid ancestors by relatively recent autopolyploidization or allopolyploidization. Some of the diploids are readily recognized morphologically but most of the taxa have until now been placed into a single species. However, phylogenetic studies have challenged this treatment and emphasized the notion that the taxonomic treatment of this complex needs to be revised. An integrative taxonomic approach was employed to delimit species in the complex using cytological, morphological, and DNA sequence data. Initially, we employed a diploid first approach to establish a robust taxonomic framework. Special efforts were made to collect and identify the diploid progenitors of each polyploid lineage identified in the plastid DNA based phylogenetic hypothesis. A total of six distinct diploid species were identified. The distinctive nature of the six diploids is strongly supported by sequence differences in plastid DNA and nuclear loci, as well as by the results of morphometric analysis. Diagnostic morphological characters were identified to distinguish the six diploid species, resulting in their revised taxonomy, which includes two novel species, namely, Asplenium normaloides and A. guangdongense. Further studies to strengthen the taxonomic classification of all of the tetraploid taxa are warranted.

Five new azaphilones were isolated, and their structures were determined by spectral analysis. In terms of azaphilones, compound 2 had an unprecedented skeleton, with a bicyclic oxygen bridge. The antifungal selectivities of the metabolite produced by N. oryzae against its co-culture fungus, B. bassiana, and common pathogens exhibited competitive interaction in this mix-culture.

To enhance the performance of structure-texture decomposition, a new method based on region covariance of simple image features and total variation optimization is proposed in this paper. We first identify texture from structure by patch-based covariance, which shows highly discriminative power for textures. Then, a total variation model built on the joint covariance and gradient is used for structure-preserving smoothing. To overcome the inherent limitation of covariance descriptor in locating main structures, patch shifting based on the variation of the region covariance is introduced. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art structure-preserving decomposition methods and the results show that our approach outperforms them in removing unimportant texture details while preserving main structures. Even for images containing the mixture of high-contrast textures with obscure boarders between them, our approach still can improve the decomposition at few extra cost of computation. Besides better decomposition results and robustness for various types of images, the simplicity of our approach make it easy to implement and adaptable to other applications.

We sequence the genomes of gayal, gaur, banteng, wisent and bison, and provide population genomic sequencing of an additional 98 individuals. We use these data to determine the phylogeny and evolutionary history of these species and show that the threatened gayal is an independent species or subspecies. We show that there has been pronounced introgression among different members of this genus, and that it in many cases has involved genes of considerable adaptive importance. For example, genes under domestication selection in cattle (for example, MITF) were introgressed from domestic cattle to yak. Also, genes in the response-to-hypoxia pathway (for example, EGLN1, EGLN2 and HIF3 alpha) have been introgressed from yak to Tibetan cattle, probably facilitating their adaptation to high altitude. We also validate that there is an association between the introgressed EGLN1 allele and haemoglobin and red blood cell concentration. Our results illustrate the importance of introgression as a source of adaptive variation and during domestication, and suggest that the Bos genus evolves as a complex of genetically interconnected species with shared evolutionary trajectories.

Multifocus image fusion is an efficient technology that can synthesize an all-in-focus image using several partially focused images. Previous methods have accomplished the fusion task in spatial or transform domains. However, fusion rules are always a problem in most methods. In this letter, from the aspect of focus region detection, we propose a novel multifocus image fusion method based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) learned from synthesized multifocus images. The primary novelty of this method is that the pixel-wise focus regions are detected through a learning FCN, and the entire image, not just the image patches, are exploited to train the FCN. First, we synthesize 4500 pairs of multifocus images by repeatedly using a gaussian filter for each image from PASCAL VOC 2012, to train the FCN. After that, a pair of source images is fed into the trained FCN, and two score maps indicating the focus property are generated. Next, an inversed score map is averaged with another score map to produce an aggregative score map, which take full advantage of focus probabilities in two score maps. We implement the fully connected conditional random field (CRF) on the aggregative score map to accomplish and refine a binary decision map for the fusion task. Finally, we exploit the weighted strategy based on the refined decision map to produce the fused image. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we compare its fused results with several start-of-the-art methods not only on a gray data set but also on a color data set. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior fusion performance in both human visual quality and objective assessment.

These objectives, however, are often in conflict with socio-economic development. We investigated the plant communities dominated by the dove tree Davidia involucrata in a nature reserve on Mount Jinfo, China, where people intensively manage large areas of bamboo stands. We found a significant lack of small-sized main stems of D. involucrata (> 1.3 cm diameter at breast height; height > 1.3 m) and newly emerging sprouts in the reserve. The height-class distribution showed a unimodal pattern, with most individuals (of both D. involucrata and co-occurring species) concentrated in the 16-28 m height-class, and few individuals in the shrub and sub-canopy layer (1.3-8 m). Existing practices to facilitate the spread of bamboo stands, and the need to develop a local market for bamboo shoots received little consideration when the nature reserve was established in 1979 to protect D. involucrata. To conserve D. involucrata on Mount Jinfo the appropriate authorities and local parties involved in bamboo harvesting need to focus on methods that are favourable to the life history of this and other tree species, and strategies for their regeneration. These methods will also benefit the conservation of other highly valued trees that share similar life-history characteristics with D. involucrata.

However, most current approaches assume that the source images are noise-free, which is not usually the case in practice. The performance of traditional fusion methods decreases significantly when images are corrupted with noise. It is therefore necessary to develop a fusion method that accurately preserves detailed information even when images are corrupted. However, suppressing noise and enhancing textural details are difficult to achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a novel medical image fusion, denoising, and enhancement method based on low-rank sparse component decomposition and dictionary learning. Specifically, to improve the discriminative ability of the learned dictionaries, we incorporate low-rank and sparse regularization terms into the dictionary learning model. Furthermore, in the image decomposition model, we impose a weighted nuclear norm and sparse constraint on the sparse component to remove noise and preserve textural details. Finally, the fused result is constructed by combining the fused low-rank and sparse components of the source images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity positively correlated to species richness and functional evolution exceeded taxonomic differentiation. We divided the Yangtze whole basin into 56 units, and then the information on fish composition and their distribution in each unit was revised. Results showed that the fish diversity was strongly driven by variation in the species turnover between watersheds with the geological environmental heterogeneity, while the TD and FD variation could be attributed to species nestedness, as taxonomic category or functional trait of species in one unit was a subset of that in other units. The high beta-diversity in SR was mostly composed of high turnover, while the high beta-diversity of TD and FD resulted from high nestedness. Species functional differentiation was faster than taxonomic differentiation during the process of adoption to environment variation. An integrated index of multifaceted diversity considering the high species richness and important functional role suggested the headwater with abundant endemic species, the middle mainstream necessary to fish migration, and the lakes containing higher diverse species were primarily recommended for conservation.

PH30583 cultured in liquid medium only led to one structure type of novel isochroman dimers. Using the one strain-many compounds strategy, the reinvestigation of the metabolites from Stachybotrys sp. PH30583 cultured in rice solid medium led to the isolation of four triprenyl phenols, including two new bisabosquals and two known phenylspirodrimanes. Nitrobisabosquals A and B (1 and 2) are the first case of pyrrolidone-bisabosquals reported in literature. Totally different compounds were isolated using rice solid medium, compared with those isolated using liquid medium, so that rice solid medium presents a key factor in the production of triprenyl phenols. Compound 1 exhibited cytotoxicity against tumor cells, A-549, HL-60, MCF-7 SMMC-7721, and SW480, as well as weak anticoagulant activity with activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 32.1 +/- 0.17 s (p < 0.05 vs. Con.) at a concentration of 5 mM. Triprenyl phenol metabolites could be used as chemotaxonomic markers for Stachybotrys.

In this paper, using an H5N1 pseudo-typed virus drug screening system combined with a bioassay guided purification approach, an antiviral butanolide (1) was identified from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. SMU03, a bacterium isolated from the feces of Elephas maximus in Yunnan province, China. This compound displayed broad and potent activity against a panel of influenza viruses including H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, as well as influenza B virus and clinical isolates with half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC50) in the range of 0.29 to 12 mu g/mL. In addition, 1 was also active against oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus strain of A/PR/8/34 with NA-H274Y mutation. Studies on the detailed modes of action suggested that 1 functioned by interfering with the fusogenic process of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV), thereby blocking the entry of virus into host cells. Furthermore, the anti-IAV activity of 1 was assessed with infected BALB/c mice, of which the appearance, weight, and histopathological changes in the infected lungs were significantly alleviated compared with the no-drug-treated group. Conclusively, these results provide evidence that natural products derived from microbes residing in animal intestines might be a good source for antiviral drug discovery.

To date, there have been no studies investigating gene number, gene features, or gene expression patterns of orphan genes in Brassica rapa. In this study, 1540 Brassica-specific genes (BSGs) and 1824 Cruciferae-specific genes (CSGs) were identified based on the genome of Brassica rapa. The genic features analysis indicated that BSGs and CSGs possessed a lower percentage of multi-exon genes, higher GC content, and shorter gene length than evolutionary-conserved genes (ECGs). In addition, five types of BSGs were obtained and 145 out of 529 real A subgenome-specific BSGs were verified by PCR in 51 species. In silico and semi-qPCR, gene expression analysis of BSGs suggested that BSGs are expressed in various tissue and can be induced by Plasmodiophora brassicae. Moreover, an A/C subgenome-specific BSG, BSGs1, was specifically expressed during the heading stage, indicating that the gene might be associated with leafy head formation. Our results provide valuable biological information for studying the molecular function of BSGs for Brassica-specific phenotypes and biotic stress in B. rapa.

However, the resource allocation problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. The existing studies mainly use approximate algorithms such as PTAS or heuristic algorithms to determine a feasible solution; however, these algorithms have the disadvantages of low computational efficiency or low allocate accuracy. In this paper, we use the classification of machine learning to model and analyze the multi-dimensional cloud resource allocation problem and propose two resource allocation prediction algorithms based on linear and logistic regressions. By learning a small-scale training set, the prediction model can guarantee that the social welfare, allocation accuracy, and resource utilization in the feasible solution are very close to those of the optimal allocation solution. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good effect on resource allocation in cloud computing.

The results show that our model has higher amplitude than the spherical harmonic magnetic field model MF7. The resulting lithospheric anomaly distribution of continental China agrees with the geotectonic structure and crustal thermal structure. The magnetic anomaly distribution clearly indicates extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau towards the northeast and northwest directions. Northward movement is impeded by the relative rigid Tarim Basin featured with positive magnetic anomalies. The positive magnetic anomalies in Tarim basin extend to the northern Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the southern part of Tarim Basin underthrusted the northern Tibetan Plateau.

Consequently, WR is usually used as fuel to produce heat or as fillers in furniture and decoration materials. Herein, a WR-based sustainable thermoplastic with both good thermoplasticity and waterproof performance by grafting hydrophobic n-octanol side chains (IP-8) onto the WR is reported. Thermoplasticity and waterproof mechanisms of the prepared thermoplastics are extensively evaluated. It is found for the first time that T-g of the modified WR can be significantly reduced to 54 degrees C, which is much lower than the reported value (approximate to 200 degrees C) of unmodified WR. T-m peaks are evidently detected once the IP-8 content exceeds 52.1 wt%, implying much better thermoplasticity in comparison with the unmodified WR. The good thermoplasticity and waterproof performance are mainly attributed to the formation of new crystal lamella with a crystallite size of approximate to 84 nm and hydrophobic spherical nanoparticles (150-350 nm). The developed method has large potential application in the fields of environmental-friendly and sustainable macromolecular materials based on biomass resources like wood residue and plant straw.

Changes in functional structure characteristics mediate ecosystem functions during human-induced land-cover alteration: A case study in southwest China	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						community functional structure; functional diversity; functional traits; trait-based approach	OLD-FIELD SUCCESSION; HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS; SECONDARY SUCCESSION; MULTIPLE TRAITS; CENTRAL YUNNAN; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; MULTIFUNCTIONALITY; DIVERGENCE	Past studies have provided extensive documentation of changes in species diversity in response to land-cover alteration; however, little is known about the effects of land-cover alteration on the patterns of functional structures and ecosystem functions. In this study, we introduce a functional trait-based methodology for incorporating multiple levels of functional structures into models to assess the impacts of human-induced land-cover changes on functional structures and to evaluate how these functional attributes affect ecosystem functions. To this purpose, different functional structure indices (species diversity, functional diversity, and community-weighted mean trait values) in three widespread communities (a man-made Pinus yunnanensis forest, a man-made Eucalyptus smithii forest, and a natural secondary forest) were determined, with a focus on our study sites in southwest China. Meanwhile, ecosystem functions (soil nutrients, water and soil conservation, and multifunctionality) were quantified. Our results showed that most community diversity indices were affected by human-dominated land-cover changes, except species richness and functional evenness. Changes in the relationship between species diversity and functional diversity displayed two patterns. The first pattern reflected reduced species diversity with an increase in functional diversity, whereas the second pattern was associated with a correlated loss of species and functional diversity, indicating the removal of environmental filters in response to changes from natural secondary forest to man-made forests. Community-weighted mean trait values (related to leaf nitrogen [N] concentration, leaf phosphorus [P] concentration, and seed mass) were negatively correlated with water and soil conservation and multifunctionality, which accounted for 65.9% and 48.5% of the variance, respectively. Functional diversity (based on functional richness, quadratic entropy, and functional dispersion) was positively associated with soil nutrients and explained 33.6% of the variance. These results suggest that the community functional structure was affected by land-cover alteration through changes in environmental filters and replacement by functionally different species. Moreover, changes in functional structure characteristics mediate different ecosystem functions by niche complementarity or the mass ratio effect under land-cover alteration.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ZMN-3(T) was affiliated with the genus Massilia and showed the highest similarity to Massilia humi THG S6-8(T) (98.9 %) and Massilia buxea A9(T) (98.2 %). In partial gyrB and lepA sequences, the highest similarity of strain ZMN-3(T) and M. humi THG S6-8(T) were 95.9 and 96.8 %, respectively. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain ZMN-3(T) and its closely related type strains were all below 70 %. The major respiratory quinone of strain ZMN-3(T) was Q-8 and the major cellular fatty acids consisted of summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) and C-16:0. The predominant polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content of strain ZMN-3(T) was 66.3 mol%. On the basis of this polyphasic taxonomic study, strain ZMN-3(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Massilia, for which the name Massilia armeniaca sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ZMN-3(T) (=CGMCC 1.16209(T) = DSM 104676(T)).

In this study, ZnO nanosheets covered with polyaniline (PANI) thin layer (ZnO@PANI) were synthesized by a simple in-situ polymerization. The as-prepared ZnO@PANI powders were well characterized by XRD, Raman, FTIR, XPS and photoluminescence spectra, as well as SEM and TEM techniques. The effect of PANI incorporation on the chemical dissolution and dispersing stability of ZnO aqueous suspension was investigated. Dissolution experiments showed that the dissolution of ZnO was effectively restrained by the surface-hybridized PANI layer. ZnO@PANI suspension can be more stable in a wider pH range. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis indicated that ZnO@PANI particles were thoroughly dispersed in the neutral and alkaline solution as proven by the emergence of a single distribution with a high diffused intensity. Sedimentation experiments suggested that ZnO@PANI suspension was a more stable dispersion taking into account the effect of pH and ionic strength.

Qualitative and quantitative chemotaxis assays revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa NXHG29 with antagonistic activity displayed positive chemotactic responses towards TREs and their three main components (nicotine, scopoletin, octadecane) and its enhanced chemotaxis were induced by these substances in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, following GC-MS and chemotaxis analysis, nicotine was selected as the target for evaluation of the effect on NXHG29 regarding antagonism, growth, root colonization and biocontrol efficiency. Results of in vitro studies showed that nicotine as a sole carbon source could enhance growth of NXHG29 and significantly increased the antagonism of NXHG29. We also demonstrated that nicotine exerted enhancing effects on the colonization ability of NXHG29 on tobacco roots by combining CLSM observations with investigation of population level dynamics by selective dilution plating method. Results from greenhouse experiments suggested nicotine exhibited stimulatory effects on the biocontrol efficiency of NXHG29 against bacterial wilt and black shank on tobacco. The stimulatory effect of nicotine was affected by the concentration and timing of nicotine application and further supported by the results of population level of NXHG29 on tobacco roots. This is the first report on the enhancement effect of nicotine from TREs on an antagonistic bacterium for its root colonization, control of soil-borne pathogens, regarding the chemotaxis and in vitro antagonism and growth.

We generate two sets of simulations to test our method. The first set is generated by GalSim with an elliptical Moffat profile and strong anisotropy that shifts the center of the PSF. The second set of simulations is drawn from CFHT i band stellar imaging data. We find non-negligible anisotropy from CFHT stellar images, which leads to similar to 0.08 scatter in units of pixels using a polynomial fitting method (Vakili & Hogg). When we apply the FPF method to estimate the centroid in real space, the scatter reduces to similar to 0.04 in S/N = 200 CFHT-like sample. In low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N; 50 and 100) CFHT-like samples, the background noise dominates the shifting of the centroid; therefore, the scatter estimated from different methods is similar. We compare polynomial fitting and FPF using GalSim simulation with optical anisotropy. We find that in all S/N (50, 100, and 200) samples, FPF performs better than polynomial fitting by a factor of similar to 3. In general, we suggest that in real observations there exists anisotropy that shifts the centroid, and thus, the FPF method provides a better way to accurately locate it.

However, the effect and potential mechanisms of Taraxasterol on the growth of human liver cancer have not been clarified. Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint1) is a tumor suppressor and its downregulated expression is associated with the development of cancer. Here, we report that Taraxasterol treatment significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in liver cancer cells, but not in non-tumor hepatocytes. Furthermore, Taraxasterol upregulated Hint1 and Bax, but downregulated Bcl2 and cyclin D1 expression, accompanied by promoting the demethylation in the Hint1 promoter region in liver cancer cells. The effects of Taraxasterol were abrogated by Hint1 silencing and partially mitigated by Bax silencing, Bcl2 or cyclin D1 over-expression in HepG2 cells. Moreover, oral administration with Taraxasterol did not affect body weight, urinary protein levels, and the heart, liver, and kidney morphology in BALB/c mice but effectively inhibited the growth of implanted SK-Hep1 tumor in vivo. Collectively, we demonstrate that Taraxasterol inhibits the growth of liver cancer at least partially by enhancing Hint1 expression to regulate Bax, Bcl2, and cyclin D1 expression. Taraxasterol may be a drug candidate for the treatment of human liver cancer. Taraxasterol inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human liver cancer cells. Taraxasterol enhances Hint1 expression by promoting demethylation in Hint1 promoter. Taraxasterol increases Hint1 levels to regulate Bax, Bcl2, and cyclinD1 expression. The effects of Taraxasterol are abrogated by Hint1 silencing in liver cancer cells. Taraxasterol inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted liver cancers in mice.

White dwarf-main sequence binaries from LAMOST: the DR5 catalogue	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						binaries: close; binaries: spectroscopic; stars: low-mass; white dwarfs	COMMON-ENVELOPE BINARIES; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; SUBDWARF-B-STARS; IA SUPERNOVAE; DATA RELEASE; ORBITAL PERIOD; CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ECLIPSING BINARY	We present the data release (DR) 5 catalogue of white dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries from the Large sky Area Multi-Object fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). The catalogue contains 876 WDMS binaries, of which 757 are additions to our previous LAMOST DR1 sample and 357 are systems that have not been published before. We also describe a LAMOST dedicated survey that aims at obtaining spectra of photometrically selected WDMS binaries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that are expected to contain cool white dwarfs and/or early-type M dwarf companions. This is a population under-represented in previous SDSS WDMS binary catalogues. We determine the stellar parameters (white dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses, and M dwarf spectral types) of the LAMOST DR5 WDMS binaries and make use of the parameter distributions to analyse the properties of the sample. We find that, despite our efforts, systems containing cool white dwarfs remain under-represented. Moreover, we make use of LAMOST DR5 and SDSS DR14 (when available) spectra to measure the Na I lambda lambda 8183.27, 8194.81 absorption doublet and/or Ha emission radial velocities of our systems. This allows identifying 128 binaries displaying significant radial velocity variations, 76 of which are new. Finally, we cross-match our catalogue with the Catalina Surveys and identify 57 systems displaying light-curve variations. These include 16 eclipsing systems, two of which are new, and nine binaries that are new eclipsing candidates. We calculate periodograms from the photometric data and measure (estimate) the orbital periods of 30 (15) WDMS binaries.

Highly heterogeneous "poikiloredox" conditions in the early Ediacaran Yangtze Sea	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH			English	Article						Iron speciation; Oxygen; Trace elements; Molybdenum; Uranium; Phosphorus	NEOPROTEROZOIC DOUSHANTUO FORMATION; SOUTH CHINA; PYRITE MORPHOLOGY; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; NANHUA BASIN; OCEAN; IRON; OXYGENATION; MOLYBDENUM; PHOSPHORUS	Although there has been a sustained effort to reconstruct ocean-redox conditions throughout the Ediacaran, a lack of high-resolution data across time-equivalent strata (shelf to basin) has hindered our ability to understand redox dynamics at the basinal scale. We measured iron species, trace- and major-element concentrations, TOC, and C-org/P ratios of black shale from six high-resolution sections from the early Ediacaran Yangtze Sea (i.e., the inner-shelf Jiulongwan, outer-shelf Zhongling, slope Siduping and Mingle, and basinal Yuanjia and Long'e sections), which were integrated with published data from these sections and seven other correlative sections from the same region for a basinwide perspective on redox tracers. These results document strong spatiotemporal redox variability during the early Ediacaran, including transitions between ferruginous, euxinic, suboxic, and oxic conditions at high frequencies and short distances (a pattern for which we coin the term "poikiloredox conditions"). Our results also suggest that multiple geochemical proxies including iron species, redox sensitive trace element concentrations and enrichments, and C-org/P ratios show different responses to poikiloredox conditions, accounting for conflicting redox interpretations in early Ediacaran studies. This study thus demonstrates the importance of multiple proxies, high stratigraphic resolution, and a basin-scale perspective in paleomarine redox studies, underlining the potential for overgeneralization of redox patterns based on analysis of a single or a limited number of proxies or sections.

Although existing allocation mechanisms allocate VMs to users through the single-mapping mechanism, such allocations cannot guarantee maximum social welfare or efficient utilization of multiple types of resources for cloud providers. Thus, we consider the multi-mapping mechanism, which permits mapping VMs allocated to one user to physical machines for VM provisioning and allocation. This can result in improved social welfare and lead to less resource fragmentation. We formulate the HPMRM problem in an auction-based setting, and design optimal and approximate mechanisms to solve it. In addition, we show that our proposed mechanism is strategy-proof; that is, our proposed mechanism drives the system into an equilibrium where no users have incentives to maximize their own profit by untruthfully reporting their requests. Furthermore, we analyze the approximation ratio of our proposed approximation algorithm. We also perform experiments to investigate the performance of our proposed approximation mechanism compared to the optimal mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approximation mechanism can obtain near optimal solutions and significantly improve allocation efficiency, while generating greater social welfare.

Using delay Fokker-Planck approach, the stationary probability distribution (SPD), the normalized variance beta(2), skewness beta(3) and kurtosis beta(4) of the state variable are obtained, respectively. The effects of the time delayed feedback and non-Gaussian noise on the SPD are analyzed theoretically. The numerical simulations about the SPD are obtained and in good agreement with the approximate theoretical results. Furthermore, the impacts of the time delayed feedback and non-Gaussian noise on the beta(2), beta(3) and beta 4 are discussed, respectively. It is found that the curves in beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4) exhibit an optimum strength of feedback where beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4) have a maximum. This maximum indicates the large deviations in beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4). From the above findings, it is easy for us to have a further understanding of the roles of the time delayed feedback and non-Gaussian noise in the foraging colonies system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims at the numerical investigation of gas (mainly produced by corrosion of metallic parts) migration properties through the low-permeable formation of Callovo-Oxfordian argillite. Traditional methods, based on macroscopic approaches or homogeneous transport properties, are inappropriate to analyze this issue at the mesoscopic/microscopic scale. In this study, realistic porous space morphologies are constructed through union of excursions of random fields considering different experimental pore size distributions. Afterwards, purely geometric analysis of pore space is conducted by morpho-mathematical operations for the purpose of the extraction of preferential gas transport pathways and the prediction of the gas entry pressure, the gas breakthrough pressure, and the following imbibition process.

J	Tang, NS; Wu, Y; Chen, D				Tang, Niansheng; Wu, Ying; Chen, Dan			Semiparametric Bayesian analysis of transformation linear mixed models	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian local influence analysis; Dirichlet Process prior; Linear mixed model; P-spline; Transformation	CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; LOCAL INFLUENCE; HIERARCHICAL-MODELS; SURVIVAL-DATA; P-SPLINES; DIRICHLET; VARIANCE	In classical linear mixed models (LMMs), it is commonly assumed that the random effects and within-individual errors independently follow a Gaussian distribution. However, in some applications, this assumption may be inappropriate. To this end, this paper proposes a novel LMM by assuming that the random effects follow an unknown distribution, and the within-individual errors associated with the transformed responses are Gaussian. A semiparametric Bayesian approach is developed to make Bayesian inference on the novel LMM by using the truncated centered Dirichlet Process prior to approximate the unknown distribution of the random effects and using Bayesian P-splines to approximate the transformation function, and combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. A Bayesian local influence analysis method is developed to assess the effect of minor perturbations. Simulation studies and an example are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

L.; Murphy, Robert W.; Wang, Ying-Yong; Che, Jing			Large-scale phylogenetic analyses provide insights into unrecognized diversity and historical biogeography of Asian leaf-litter frogs, genus Leptolalax (Anura: Megophryidae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Species delimitation; Biogeography; Source-sink dynamics; Taxonomy; Leptolalax; Leptobrachella	BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; SPECIES DELIMITATION; AMPHIBIA; BORNEO; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION; COLONIZATION; JMODELTEST; INFERENCE; TADPOLES	Southeast Asia and southern China (SEA-SC) harbor a highly diverse and endemic flora and fauna that is under increasing threat. An understanding of the biogeographical history and drivers of this diversity is lacking, especially in some of the most diverse and threatened groups. The Asian leaf-litter frog genus Leptolalax Dubois 1980 is a forest-dependent genus distributed throughout SEA-SC, making it an ideal study group to examine specific biogeographic hypotheses. In addition, the diversity of this genus remains poorly understood, and the phylogenetic relationships among species of Leptolalax and closely related Leptobrachella Smith 1928 remain unclear. Herein, we evaluate species-level diversity based on 48 of the 53 described species from throughout the distribution of Leptolalax. Molecular analyses reveal many undescribed species, mostly in southern China and Indochina. Our well-resolved phylogeny based on multiple nuclear DNA markers shows that Leptolalax is not monophyletic with respect to Leptobrachella and, thus, we assign the former to being a junior synonym of the latter. Similarly, analyses reject monophyly of the two subgenera of Leptolalax. The diversification pattern of the group is complex, involving a high degree of sympatry and prevalence of microendemic species. Northern Sundaland (Borneo) and eastern Indochina (Vietnam) appear to have played pivotal roles as geographical centers of diversification, and paleoclimatic changes and tectonic movements seem to have driven the major divergence of clades. Analyses fail to reject an "upstream" colonization hypothesis, and, thus, the genus appears to have originated in Sundaland and then colonized mainland Asia. Our results reveal that both vicariance and dispersal are responsible for current distribution patterns in the genus.

Despite their sponge-like body plan, their spines are unlike modern sponge spicules, but share several features with the sclerites of certain Cambrian bilaterians, notably halkieriids. However, a proposed homology of these 'coelosclerites' implies complex transitions in body plan evolution. A new species of chancelloriid, Allonnia nuda, from the lower Cambrian (Stage 3) Chengjiang Lagerstatte is distinguished by its large size and sparse spination, with modified apical sclerites surrounding an opening into the body cavity. The sclerite arrangement in A. nuda and certain other chancelloriids indicates that growth involved sclerite addition in a subapical region, thus maintaining distinct zones of body sclerites and apical sclerites. This pattern is not seen in halkieriids, but occurs in some modern calcarean sponges. With scleritome assembly consistent with a sponge affinity, and in the absence of cnidarian-or bilaterian-grade features, it is possible to interpret chancelloriids as sponges with an unusually robust outer epithelium, strict developmental control of body axis formation, distinctive spicule-like structures and, by implication, minute ostia too small to be resolved in fossils. In this light, chancelloriids may contribute to the emerging picture of high disparity among early sponges.

Associated morphometric and geospatial differentiation among 98 species of stone oaks (Lithocarpus)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CAMELLIA PERICARP THICKNESS; ARMS-RACE; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; SEED PREDATION; ACORN SIZE; DISPERSAL; PLANT; QUERCUS; WEEVIL; PERSPECTIVE	Two fruit types can be distinguished among stone oaks (Lithocarpus) species: the 'acorn' (AC) and the 'enclosed receptacle' (ER) types. Our morphometric analysis of 595 nuts from 98 species (one third of all Lithocarpus spp.) found substantial transition in mechanical protection of the seed between two woody fruit tissues (exocarp and receptacle) of two fruit types. AC fruits were smaller in seed and fruit size and the thin brittle exocarp largely enclosed the seed, whereas ER fruits were larger and the seed was mostly enclosed by thick woody receptacle tissue. The differences in these two tissues were considerably greater between compared to within fruit type and species. Geospatial distribution showed that seed size of all examined species increased with elevation and decreased with latitude, the physical defense increased with both elevation and latitude, and ER-fruit species were more common at higher elevation. The two fruit types represent distinct suites of associated traits that respond differently to the various biotic and abiotic factors associated with geographic variation, profoundly impacting the evolution of the two fruit types. The co-occurrence of two fruit types in the same forest could be a consequence of distinct fruit and animal interactions.

Based on core level and valence photoemission experimental measurements a paradoxical relationship between core-level shift and charge transfer is shown, demonstrating the failure of conventional practice of using Fermi level to measure chemical shifts of molecules on solid surfaces. Thus, great care needs to be taken when interpreting experimentally observed shifts in core level binding energies as well as assigning core level energy peaks associated with certain oxidation states. To resolve this paradoxical problem, it is shown that measurement of interface dipoles is essential in investigating the charge transfers of molecules to/from solid surfaces.

Combined with the molecular imprinting technique, the selectivity of the gas sensor can be altered and enhanced gas-sensing properties are obtained due to the unique molecular recognition and large specific surface area. The Ag-LaFeO3 nanoparticles are found to exhibit an ultrahigh xylene response (R-g/R-a = 16.76 to 10 ppm), fast gas response and recovery (68 and 36 s) and superior selectivity against the other tested interfering gases at a relatively low operating temperature of 125 degrees C. They also exhibit excellent humidity stability and long-term stability with small deviations, and this result may deliver a new approach that enables the stable detection of xylene gas.

Chemoselective synthesis of aryl(pyridinyl)methanol derivatives through Ni-NIXANTPHOS catalyzed alpha-arylation and tandem arylation/rearrangement of pyridylmethyl ethers	ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC HYDROGENATION; WITTIG REARRANGEMENTS; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY; REACTIVITY; INHIBITORS; DIARYLMETHANES; COMPLEXES	An efficient synthesis of aryl(pyridyl)-methanol derivatives using a nickel-NIXANTPHOS catalyst is described. Combinations of the Ni-NIXANTPHOS catalyst, solvent, and reaction temperature achieved chemoselective arylation and tandem arylation/rearrangement of pyridylmethyl ethers. A large variety of aryl halides were tolerated (55 examples, up to 96% yield). The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated. The order of the tandem arylation and [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement was probed by comparative studies.

An Early Cretaceous eutherian and the placental-marsupial dichotomy	NATURE			English	Article							JEHOL BIOTA; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; SKULL	Molecular estimates of the divergence of placental and marsupial mammals and their broader clades (Eutheria and Metatheria, respectively) fall primarily in the Jurassic period. Supporting these estimates, Juramaiathe oldest purported eutherianis from the early Late Jurassic (160 million years ago) of northeastern China. Sinodelphysthe oldest purported metatherianis from the same geographic area but is 35 million years younger, from the Jehol biota. Here we report a new Jehol eutherian, Ambolestes zhoui, with a nearly complete skeleton that preserves anatomical details that are unknown from contemporaneous mammals, including the ectotympanic and hyoid apparatus. This new fossil demonstrates that Sinodelphys is a eutherian, and that postcranial differences between Sinodelphys and the Jehol eutherian Eomaiapreviously thought to indicate separate invasions of a scansorial niche by eutherians and metatheriansare instead variations among the early members of the placental lineage. The oldest known metatherians are now not from eastern Asia but are 110 million years old from western North America, which produces a 50-million-year ghost lineage for Metatheria.

This combination allows for a complete analysis of the field, effectively breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. In a Bayesian framework, we simultaneously constrain the mass profile and morphology of each individual cluster, assuming an elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White halo characterized by the mass, concentration, projected axis ratio, and position angle (PA) of the projected major axis. We find that spherical mass estimates of the clusters from azimuthally averaged weak-lensing measurements in previous work are in excellent agreement with our results from a full 2D analysis. Combining all 20 clusters in our sample, we detect the elliptical shape of weak-lensing halos at the 5 sigma significance level within a scale of 2 Mpc h(-1). The median projected axis ratio is 0.67 +/- 0.07 at a virial mass of M-vir = (15.2 +/- 2.8) x 10(14) M-circle dot, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions from recent numerical simulations of the standard collisionless cold dark matter model. We also study misalignment statistics of the brightest cluster galaxy, X-ray, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and strong-lensing morphologies with respect to the weak-lensing signal. Among the three baryonic tracers studied here, we find that the X-ray morphology is best aligned with the weak-lensing mass distribution, with a median misalignment angle of I vertical bar Delta PA vertical bar = 21 degrees +/- 7 degrees. We also conduct a stacked quadrupole shear analysis of the 20 clusters assuming that the X-ray major axis is aligned with that of the projected mass distribution. This yields a consistent axis ratio of 0.67 +/- 0.10, suggesting again a tight alignment between the intracluster gas and dark matter.

Among this series, compound 24f displayed potent cytotoxic activities invitro against HCT116 and SW480 cell lines with GI(50) values of 8.1 and 7.9m, respectively, and was inactive against MRC-5 cells. The newly synthesized compounds were also evaluated for anti-angiogenesis capabilities by chick chorioallantoic membrane, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, and endothelial microtubule formation assays. Moreover, the effects of 24f on the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and the signaling pathway in HUVECs indicated that this compound inhibits VEGFR-2 and its downstream related proteins. These results indicate that compound 24f, as well as the other derivatives, are promising inhibitors of angiogenesis.

The SST configuration orientated in northwest-southeast direction exerts its impact on the summer rainfall coming into the CLLH via modifying the activity of cold air in the northeast CLLH. When SST is warmer than normal in the GS and colder than normal around the NASR, a teleconnection with an anomalous cyclone over the Europe, an anomalous anticyclone around the Lake Baikal and an anomalous cyclone over the East Asia will be forced out by the dispersion of Rossby wave on the spherical surface of the earth. The teleconnection traversing Europe-East China is favourable to transportation of cold air from the East Siberian southwestwards to the CLLH and thus gives rise to the increase of summer rainfall in the CLLH. When SST is colder than normal in the GS and warmer than normal around the NASR, the similar teleconnection with opposite phase is forced out, causing a less than normal summer rainfall in the CLLH.

Besides, we also discuss the interaction between rogue wave solution and different forms of stripe solitons (one stripe soliton and double stripe solitons), and investigate the annihilation and emergence of rogue waves. Finally, the parametric reasons of soliton fusion and fission are discussed, furthermore, the fusion and fission phenomena of soliton are simulated by three-dimensional plots. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we first recognize a new assemblage of highly mineralized macroalgae from this biota. Based on morphological differences, there are three new genera and four new species identified: Doulia rara gen. et sp. nov., Eolaminaria simigladiola sp. nov., Singulariphyca ramose gen. et sp. nov. and Rugophyca longa gen. et sp. nov. Relative to the other three species, S. ramosa is widely distributed among the beds, which may indicate a dominat species in this community. This new discovery fills part of the long gap in the detailed record of macroalgae between the Chengjiang Biota and the Kaili Biota, representing a localized macroalgal flourish at the end of Cambrian Stage 3. The assemblage that shows morphological characters similar to some macroalgae found in the Precambrian and primitive to those of the Cambrian Stage 5 lays the basis for revealing the evolutionary biology of early macroalgae and understanding the Precambrian-Cambrian transition questions. Taphonomic study of this fossiliferous bed indicates that some well-preserved macroalgae are preserved within their original habitats. Through analyzing the depositional environments of the known Cambrian macroalgae, we suggest that macroalgae tend to be preserved in relatively deep marine environments with less disturbance.

In this study, the concentrations of As(III), total arsenic [As(T)], sulfide, iron (Fe), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in overlying water were observed after the initial sulfate (SO42-) concentrations were increased by four gradients in the presence and absence of microbial systems. The results indicate that increased SO42- concentrations in overlying water triggered As desorption from sediments. Approximately 10% of the desorbed As was desorbed directly as arsenite or arsenate by competitive adsorption sites on the iron salt surface; 21% was due to the reduction of iron (hydr)oxides; and 69% was due to microbial activity, as compared with a system with no microbial activity. The intensity of microbial activity was controlled by the SO42- and DOC concentrations in the overlying water. In anaerobic systems, which had SO42- and DOC concentrations higher than 47 and 7 mg/L, respectively, microbial activity was promoted by SO42- and DOC; As(III) was desorbed under these indoor simulation conditions. When either the SO42- or DOC concentration was lower than its respective threshold of 47 or 7 mg/L, or when either of these indices was below its concentration limit, it was difficult for microorganisms to use SO42- and DOC to enhance their own activities. Therefore, conditions were insufficient for As desorption. The migration of As in lake sediments was dominated by microbial activity, which was co-limited by SO42- and DOC. The concentrations of SO42- and DOC in the overlying water are thus important for the prevention and control of As pollution in lakes. We recommend controlling SO42- and DOC concentrations as a method for controlling As inner-source pollution in lake water.

Through analysing the genomes of 49 modern breeds and eight East Asian ancient samples, worldwide cattle are consistently classified into five continental groups based on Y-chromosome haplotypes and autosomal variants. We find that East Asian cattle populations are mainly composed of three distinct ancestries, including an earlier East Asian taurine ancestry that reached China at least similar to 3.9 kya, a later introduced Eurasian taurine ancestry, and a novel Chinese indicine ancestry that diverged from Indian indicine approximately 36.6-49.6 kya. We also report historic introgression events that helped domestic cattle from southern China and the Tibetan Plateau achieve rapid adaptation by acquiring similar to 2.93% and similar to 1.22% of their genomes from banteng and yak, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of cattle and the importance of introgression in adaptation of cattle to new environmental challenges in East Asia.

The two HTMs have low-lying HOMO levels and impressive mobility. Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with YN2 showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 19.27% in ambient air, which is significantly higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (17.80%). PSCs based on YN1 showed an inferior PCE of 16.03%. We found that the incorporation of the stronger electron-withdrawing group in the HTM YN2 improves the PCE of PSCs. Furthermore, the YN2-based PSCs exhibit good long-term stability retaining 91.3% of its initial efficiency, whereas PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD retained only 42.2% after 1000 h lifetime (dark conditions). These promising results can provide a new strategy for the design of D-A-D HTMs for PSC applications in future.

A core-shelled Fe3O4@C hybrid nanoparticle aggregates with environmental-friendly channel in the study. Moreover, the higher exposure of adsorption sites can be achieved for the special configuration that higher Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area reaches up to 238.18 m(2) g(-1). Thus, a more efficiently heavy metal ion removal is obtained, Pb (II), Cd (II), Cu (II), and Cr (VI) up to 100, 99.2, 96.6, and 94.8%, respectively. In addition, the products are easy to be separated from the aqueous solutions after adsorption, due to the relative large submicrometer size and the enhanced external magnetic fields introduced by the iron-based cores. We provide an ideal mode to remove heavy metal ions using core-shelled Fe3O4@C under the water treatment condition. A new approach is clarified that core-shell nano/micro-functional materials can be synthesized well on large scales which are used in many fields such as environmental remediation, catalyst, and energy.

The room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) properties of TGA@CdS QDs were investigated. The results indicate that the polarity of the solvent and the surface trap state resulted in the broadness Stokes shift between the maximum absorption wavelength and the emission wavelength of TGA@CdS QDs. The Co2+ sensing properties of fluorescence determination were investigated using TGA@CdS QDs. The as-synthesized CdS QDs exhibits the excellent selectivity and sensitivity of fluorescence quenching for cobalt ion (Co2+). The limit of detection (LOD) is as low as 0.05 mu M which is much lower than maximum limit of cobalt ions in drinking water. The linear response range of Co2+ was from 0.5 to 80 mu M.

As both types of photo-carriers (electrons and holes) are harvested to generate visible photons, this tandem device exhibits a significantly higher On/Off switching and has higher photon-photon conversion efficiency than conventional upconversion devices. We show that a high 5% photon-photon conversion rate is possible by optimizing the various functional layers in the tandem structure. We also demonstrate that a pixel-less NIR imaging chip can be made simply by using a large area single tandem organic upconversion device. Published by AIP Publishing.

The well-known W-line can also be observed in SII SOI samples, its emitting behavior and structural evolution have been discussed in this article. The parallel PL pattern trend and the similar changes of temperature-dependent intensity suggest that luminescence center of I-1 and I-2 peaks located in the near-infrared band originates from the same interstitial-clusters (InCs). The PL peak at 1.762 eV can be ascribed to the quantum confinement (QC) from small-sized Si nanocrystals. Based on the electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and the variation of normalized PL intensities at different annealing temperature (T-A), the neutral oxygen vacancy (NOV) [O-3 equivalent to Si-Si equivalent to O-3] is proposed to be responsible for the blue emission of P-2 and P-3 peaks, whose intensity can be restrained by the existence of the paramagnetic E-1' defects [O-3 equivalent to Si+]. The density of E-1' defect is found to reduce with the increase of annealing temperature (T-A). Our results provide a useful method to identify the origin of luminescence centers and pave a way for the application of new type optical defects on silicon based light emitting devices (LEDs).

The effects of etching time, beam current, and voltage on the size reduction of PS particles were well investigated. A slow etching rate, about 9.2 nm/min, is obtained for the nanospheres with the diameter of 100 nm. The rate does not maintain constant with increasing the etching time. This may result from the thermal energy accumulated gradually in a long-time bombardment of ion beam. The etching rate increases nonlinearly with the increase of beam current, while it increases firstly then reach its saturation with the increase of beam voltage. The diameter of PS nanoparticles can be controlled in the range from 34 to 88 nm. Based on the non-close-packed arrays of PS nanoparticles, the ordered silicon (Si) nanopillars with their average diameter of 54 nm are fabricated by employing metal-assisted chemical etching technique. Our results pave an effective way to fabricate the ordered nanostructures with the size less than 100 nm.

However, it is still unclear as to which climatic factors and biotic interactions drive the reproductive phenology of woody trees in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region in Southwest China. We conducted observations on woody plants (including trees and shrubs) phenology between November 2004 and October 2007 at biweekly intervals in the one hectare permanent plot of tropical seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. A total of 357 individuals of 76 species (70 genera, 37 families), comprising of 59 (78%) woody trees and 17 (22%) shrub species were observed. Our results demonstrate that flowering and fruiting frequencies show slight temporal variation between years. Flowering was significantly correlated with day-length, temperature and rainfall and fruiting was significantly correlated with rainfall and temperature. This finding indicates that woody tree reproductive phenology was primarily associated with temperature and rainfall and to a lesser extent with day-length. Reproductive phenology is also linked to seasonal patterns with flowering peaking in the late dry season and fruiting peaking in the late wet season. Moreover, reproductive phenology is also significantly associated with reproductive ecological guilds such as pollination types and dispersal modes. Community reproductive phenology is associated with climatic seasonality and biotic interactions. It also suggests that seasonal phenology patterns may play a fundamental role in community reproductive success in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region of Southwest China.

To date, microRNA (miRNAs) functions in cardiac remodeling induced by obesity remain to be elucidated. We found that rats fed a high fat diet (HFD) manifested cardiac fibrosis and LV dysfunction. In the heart of rats fed HFD, the phosphorylation levels of Smad 2 and the expression of fibrotic genes, such as connective tissue growth factor, collagen-1 alpha 1 (Col1 alpha 1), Col3 alpha 1, and Col4 alpha 1, were up-regulated, which accompanied by an increase in Smad 7 protein levels, but not its mRNA levels. Using miRNA microarray analysis, we showed that the miRNA miR-410-5p inhibited the protein expression of Smad 7, thus increasing the phosphorylation levels of Smad 2. Overexpression of miR410-5p promoted cardiac fibrosis in rats fed normal diet, whereas inhibition of miR-410-5p by way of miR-410-5p antimiR suppressed cardiac fibrosis in rats fed HFD. Finally, our data revealed that miR410-5p from the kidney and adipose tissues was probably transferred to heart to induce cardiac fibrosis. Taken together, our study characterizes an endocrine mechanism in which adipose-or kidney-derived circulating miR-410-5p regulates metabolic disorders-mediated cardiac remodeling by activating the TGF beta/Smad signaling in heart.

The obtained CQDs are with an average size of 3.1 nm. They reveal uniform morphology and well-crystalline and can generate bright blue-green light emission under UV or blue light irradiation. We find that the fluorescence from these CQDs is mainly induced by the presence of oxygen-containing groups on the surface and edge of the CQDs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the as-prepared CQDs can be applied to imaging plant cells.

Notably, when cyclic enaminone 4 was used as a substrate in the aza-Michael and 1,2-addition reactions with quinone monoketals 1, they gave another novel morphan 8. This method is suitable for parallel synthesis of bridged ring compounds. As a result, highly diverse morphan derivatives were easily and efficiently prepared by the Michael/aza-Michael or aza-Michael/1,2-addition reactions.

In this paper, some changes of glacial thermodynamic parameters caused by ice thickness and atmospheric temperature variation were simulated in view of different thickness. The purpose of this study was to fill the gap in analyzing the ice dynamic characteristic of a polar continental glacier. The diagnostic simulation revealed the following conclusions: (1) when the thickness change was small, surface velocity, ice temperature, and deviation stress variation in the bedrock showed a tendency to change with thickness, and when the terrain was gentle, the thickness variation dominated the ice velocity. (2) The ice temperature of the bedrock was high in the whole profile and reached the pressure melting point in the terminus, and it was easy to slide at the bottom, which was consistent with the measured ground penetrating radar data near the terminus. (3) The static friction forces decrease with thickness, and they showed a complex nonlinear relationship, which revealed that the deviation stress in the bottom was influenced by thickness and ice temperature at the bedrock. The prognostic simulating from 2007 to 2047 presented: (1) The simulation forecasted a shrinkage of nearly 600 m in the terminus and the longitudinal section, and wound up diminished by nearly 25% by the end of 2047; (2) the change of thickness was small at the region between 5650 and 5700 m.a.s.l, which might be related to lower atmospheric temperature; (3) thickness dominated the deviation stress (sigma(xx) and sigma(xz)) in the bottom, and the impact of the terrain was little higher compared to deviation stress (sigma(xx)). In other words, the glacial thickness dominated the glacial force and movement to a great extent and the low temperature at high altitude reduced the XD's sensitivity facing future climate warming.

A Holistic Perspective on the Dynamics of G035.39-00.33: The Interplay between Gas and Magnetic Fields	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: magnetic fields; stars: formation	CLUMP IDENTIFICATION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; DUST EMISSION; FRAGMENTATION; SCUBA-2; POLARIZATION; SIMULATIONS; KINEMATICS; TURBULENT; ACCRETION	Magnetic field plays a crucial role in shaping molecular clouds and regulating star formation, yet the complete information on the magnetic field is not well constrained owing to the limitations in observations. We study the magnetic field in the massive infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33 from dust continuum polarization observations at 850 mu m with SCUBA-2/POL-2 at JCMT for the first time. The magnetic field tends to be perpendicular to the densest part of the main filament (F-M), whereas it has a less defined relative orientation in the rest of the structure, where it tends to be parallel to some diffuse regions. A mean plane-of-the-sky magnetic field strength of similar to 50 mu G for F-M is obtained using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. Based on (CO)-C-13 (1-0) line observations, we suggest a formation scenario of F-M due to large-scale (similar to 10 pc) cloud-cloud collision. Using additional NH3 line data, we estimate that F-M will be gravitationally unstable if it is only supported by thermal pressure and turbulence. The northern part of F-M, however, can be stabilized by a modest additional support from the local magnetic field. The middle and southern parts of F-M are likely unstable even if the magnetic field support is taken into account. We claim that the clumps in F-M may be supported by turbulence and magnetic fields against gravitational collapse. Finally, we identified for the first time a massive (similar to 200 M-circle dot, collapsing starless clump candidate, "c8," in G035.39-00.33. The magnetic field surrounding "c8" is likely pinched, hinting at an accretion flow along the filament.

Thermomorphogenesis and ambient temperature signaling pathways have been well studied in model plants, but little information is available for vegetable crops. Here, we investigated genes responsive to warming conditions from two Brassica rapa inbred lines with different geographic origins: subtropical (Kenshin) and temperate (Chiifu). Genes in Gene Ontology categories response to heat, heat acclimation, response to light intensity, response to oxidative stress, and response to temperature stimulus were upregulated under warming treatment in both lines, but genes involved in response to auxin stimulus were upregulated only in Kenshin under both warming and minor-warming conditions. We identified 16 putative high temperature (HT) adaptation-related genes, including 10 heat-shock response genes, 2 transcription factor genes, 1 splicing factor gene, and 3 others. BrPIF4, BrROF2, and BrMPSR1 are candidate genes that might function in HT adaptation. Auxin response, alternative splicing of BrHSFA2, and heat shock memory appear to be indispensable for HT adaptation in B. rapa. These results lay the foundation for molecular breeding and marker development to improve warming tolerance in B. rapa.

The synthesized nano-adsorbent was characterized by TEM, TGA, SEM, FTIR, VSM, XPS and BET, XRD, respectively. Various factors influencing the adsorption of MO such as the adsorbent dosage, initial concentration of MO, the contact time, pH value of the solutions and the temperatures were studied by batch experiments. The results indicated that it agreed well to the Langmuir adsorption model, and the maximum adsorption capacities of MO were found to be 355.8 mg/g at pH 6.0. Kinetic data showed good correlation with pseudo-second-order equation. The results of adsorption thermodynamic studies illustrate that the sorption is exothermic, spontaneous and decreased randomness of the system. Besides, good magnetic performance of Fe3O4/MIL-101(Al0.9Fe0.1)/NH2 makes it simply achieve the solid-liquid separation at low magnetic field within 5 min. In addition, compared with Fe3O4/MIL-101(Al)/NH2, the Fe3O4/MIL-101(Al0.9Fe0.1)/NH2 not only showed higher removal efficiency toward MO, but also had higher stability in aqueous solution.

This buffered Ag electrode enables fabrication of transparent organic light emitting diodes (TOLEDs). The excellent conductivity of ReO3, second only to metal amongst oxide semiconductors, is made possible to use a thick hole-injecting buffer layer. The use of thick ReO3 layer alleviates strong local electric field on a rough electrode surface. For device optical design, the transfer matrix method is used to provide theoretical guidance on electrode fabrication. Based on microcavity theory in TOLEDs, the optical path parameters are also optimized to the thicknesses of different functional organic films. To test the device performance, we fabricated normal fluorescent green Alg(3) devices. The data show that TOLEDs with ReO3-buffered Ag electrodes have good photochromic uniformity on both sides of the devices.

To better understand the risk of P losses, the fractions of soil P in four aggregate size classes were quantified for two vegetable production sites (<10 and >25 yrs) and a conservation buffer site ( 8 yrs) in southwestern China. Sequential extraction methods of inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) were carried out on samples from Nitisol and Gleysol soils from 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 10 cm depths. On average, soil Pi concentrations exceeded Po concentrations threefold, primarily in the bioavailable Pi fractions (labile Pi, loosely bound Pi and non-occluded Pi). Soil Po fractions and bioavailable Pi fractions were significantly greater under the >25 yrs field than in the <10 yrs field. The conversion of fields under vegetable production to forested buffer substantially decreased the levels of the bioavailable Pi and labile Po in the Gleysol after 8 yrs. Soil macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm) had greater concentrations of bioavailable Pi fractions and of labile and moderately labile Po than did micro-aggregates and silt and clay size components. Although more P was stored in recalcitrant P forms, a larger percentage of all P fractions was found in macro-aggregates in these soils. Small active P-enriched aggregates potentially intensify export of P from the vegetable soils by run-off, and therefore, management practices must be optimized to enhance agricultural P efficiencies.

Nitrogen removal performance and responses of substrate enzyme activities (nitrate reductase, dehydrogenase, CM-cellulase, beta-glucosidase, urease, and protease) were investigated and assessed in the present study. Nitrogen removal was significantly improved by all of the biomass (averaging 0.27 g TN.m(-2) day(-1) for control and 2.15-2.80 g TN.m(-2) day(-1) for the experimental systems), with best performance achieved by P. stratiotes. Dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential values in the biomass-added systems were significantly lower, beneficial for nitrate reduction. Effluent organic carbon content was low due to the low amount of biomass added, but quick decline of nitrate removal efficiency and nitrite accumulation were observed. All of the enzyme activities were notably enhanced by the biomass addition, especially in the initial phase after addition, which might be significant for decomposition and utilization of the macrophyte biomass for denitrification and the enhancement of nitrogen removal of the BSFCWs.

Its high adaptability enabled its rapid colonization of European countries, where population growth has been raising concerns regarding ecosystem disturbance and the spread of zoonotic diseases. The genetic diversity and structure of endemic, source, and introduced populations from seven locations across South Korea, China, Russian Far East, Finland (spread to Finland after introduction to European part of Russia from Russian Far East), Vietnam, and Japan (Honshu and Hokkaido) were examined based on 16 microsatellite loci. Two major and significantly different (F-ST = 0.236) genetic clusters were found: continental (South Korean, Chinese, Russian, Finnish, and Vietnamese) and island (Japanese) populations. The continental raccoon dog population comprises three subpopulations (Chinese_Russian_Finnish, South Korean, and Vietnamese) and the Japanese population consists of Honshu and Hokkaido subpopulations. The genetic diversity and geographic structure of raccoon dogs in East Asia has been influenced by natural barriers to gene flow and reveals a typical central-marginal trend in genetic diversity (continental vs. island, and central vs. marginal or source vs. introduced within continental populations). The detected differences between continental and island populations agree with those reported in previous studies that considered these populations as different species.

Herein, two morphologies of nanoceria were synthesized via adjusting the concentration of NaOH, and CeO2 nanorod has been utilized as sensing material to achieve sensitive and selective detection of C. perfringens DNA sequence due to its strong adsorption ability towards DNA compared to nanoparticle. The DNA probe was tightly immobilized on CeO2/chitosan modified electrode surface via metal coordination, and the DNA surface density was 2.51 x 10(-10) mol/cm(2). Under optimal experimental conditions, the electrochemical impedance biosensor displays favorable selectivity toward target DNA in comparison with base-mismatched and non-complementary DNA. The dynamic linear range of the proposed biosensor for detecting oligonucleotide sequence of Clostridium perfringens was from 1.0 x 10(-14) to 1.0 x 10(-7) mol/L. The detection limit was 7.06 x 10(-15) mol/L. In comparison, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method quantified the target DNA with a detection limit of 1.95 x 10(-15) mol/L. Moreover, the DNA biosensor could detect C. perfringens extracted DNA in dairy products and provided a potential application in food quality control.

The Sidingheishan intrusion is mainly composed of wehrlite, olivine websterite, olivine gabbro, gabbro and hornblende gabbro. At least two pulses of magma were involved in the formation of the intrusion. The first pulse of magma produced an olivine-free unit and the second pulse produced an olivine-bearing unit. The magmas intruded the Devonian granites and granodiorites. An age of 351.4 +/- 5.8 Ma (Early Carboniferous) for the Sidingheishan intrusion has been determined by U-Pb SHRIMP analysis of zircon grains separated from the olivine gabbro unit. A U-Pb age of 359.2 +/- 6.4 Ma from the gabbro unit has been obtained by LA-ICP-MS. Olivine of the Sidingheishan intrusion reaches 82.52 mole% Fo and 1414 ppm Ni. On the basis of olivine-liquid equilibria, it has been calculated that the MgO and FeO included in the parental magma of a wehrlite sample were approximately 10.43wt% and 13.14wt%, respectively. The Sidingheishan intrusive rocks are characterized by moderate enrichments in Th and Sm, slight enrichments in light REE, and depletions in Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf. The epsilon(Nd) (t) values in the rock units vary from +6.70 to +9.64, and initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios range between 0.7035 and 0.7042. Initial Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 values fall in the ranges of 17.23-17.91, 15.45-15.54 and 37.54-38.09 respectively. These characteristics are collectively similar to the Heishan intrusion and the Early Carboniferous subduction related volcanic rocks in the Santanghu Basin, North Tianshan and Beishan area. The low (La/Gd)(PM) values between 0.26 and 1.77 indicate that the magma of the Sidingheishan intrusion was most likely derived from a depleted spinel-peridotite mantle. (Th/Nb)(PM) ratios from 0.59 to 20.25 indicate contamination of the parental magma in the upper crust. Crystallization modeling methods suggest that the parental magma of the Sidingheishan intrusion was generated by flush melting of the asthenosphere and subsequently there was about 10vol% contamination from a granitic melt. This was followed by about 5vol% assimilation of upper crustal rocks. Thus, the high-Mg basaltic parental magma of Sidingheishan intrusion is interpreted to have formed from partial melting of the asthenosphere during the break-off of a subducted slab.

Darwin hypothesizes that distyly evolves to promote precise pollen transfer between morphs. Primula chungensis exhibits two types of anther heights, and these two types of anthers show pollen of two different size classes. To understand whether the stigma could capture more pollen grains from the anthers of the pollen donor as the separation between the stigma of pollen receiver and the anther of pollen donor decreased, the present research assessed the source of the pollen load in a series of open-pollinated flowers with continuous variation of style lengths. Individuals with continuous variation of style length were tagged, and the selected flowers in the tagged plants were emasculated the day before dehiscence. The stigma of the emasculated flowers was fixed in fuchsin gel at the end of blooming. We assessed the pollen sources on each stigma by taking photos under a microscope and measured the diameter of each conspecific pollen grain with ImageJ. We found that a shorter distance from the stigmas to the anthers of a pollen donor gave the flower a higher capacity to receive pollen from those anthers. Our result provides a new evidence that distyly could promote the pollen transfer between morphs, which is consistent with Darwin's hypothesis of disassortative pollination. An alternative hypothesis for the evolution of distyly (e.g. selfing avoidance) might also be true, but less likely, because self-incompatibility would greatly avoid self-fertilization for many distylous species.

REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Tonle Sap Lake; Lancang-Mekong River; MODIS; water index; international river	DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; UPPER MEKONG BASIN; INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; HYDROLOGICAL ALTERATIONS; MODIS OBSERVATIONS; TIME-SERIES; CAMBODIA; IMAGERY; IMPACTS; CHINA	Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Water development infrastructures are increasingly being constructed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, which is a major concern considering its potential impact on Tonle Sap Lake. This study aimed to investigate variations in the area of the lake and discuss their possible linkage to runoff alterations in the Lancang River (Upper Mekong) by comparing runoff at the Yunjinghong hydrological station before and after significant changes in runoff trends that occurred in 2008. First, four commonly used water body extraction methods (MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, and EVI) were compared and MNDWI was found to provide a better and more stable performance. Based on MOD09A1 data, MNDWI was used to extract the water area of the lake from 2000 to 2014, and characteristics of variations in the area before and after 2008 were analyzed. The water area of Tonle Sap Lake displayed an overall decreasing trend, and specifically decreased by 8.3% during the flood season and by 1.5% on average during the dry season after 2008. Seasonal variations in the water area of Tonle Sap Lake were dominantly influenced by runoff from the Mekong River. Compared with the period 2000-2007, runoff at Yunjinghong station were increased during the dry season (20.74%) and decreased during the flood season (34.25%) between 2008 and 2014. Changes in upstream runoff contributed to runoff at the Stung Treng station in the lower Mekong River by 6.17% (dry season) and -2.41% (flood season). Evidently, the operation of dams in the Lancang River does not primarily account for the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake during the flood season. In contrast, runoff increase during the dry season mitigates the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake to a certain extent.

However, its underlying mechanism has not yet been characterized. In this study, the anthers of OsDMS-2 dominant male sterile mutant were shorter and whiter than wild-type anthers. Moreover, pollen abundance was lower in mutant than wild-type anthers, with most mutant pollen grains being small and malformed. Inheritance analysis showed that male sterility was controlled by one dominant gene. However, gene mapping suggested that two loci, OsDMS-2A (on chromosome 2) and OsDMS-2B (on chromosome 8), might be responsible for the dominant sterility of the OsDMS-2 mutant. The flanking markers of OsDMS-2A are C2D11 and C2D12, with genetic distances of 0.66 and 0.33 cM, respectively. The C8D3 and C8D7 markers flanking OsDMS-2B have genetic distances of 1.32 and 2.32 cM, respectively. Molecular mapping disagreeing with classical genetic analysis indicates OsDMS-2 is a novel and valuable mutant for understanding male sterility genetic mechanism.

The Wuliangshan area is a very complex region of metamorphism, where it is nearly impossible to conduct conventional geological investigation because of the extremely rugged topography and difficult travel conditions. Previous research on the area's metamorphic rocks is limited. There are two metamorphic belts, the Yunling-Jinghong and Wuliangshan metamorphic belts, identified by means of traditional field survey. To better identify the metamorphic rocks of the Wuliangshan area, this study adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) and spectrum-area (S-A) methods, using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, to extract the anomalies of diagnostic metamorphic minerals in metamorphic rocks, such as actinolite, chlorite, epidote, biotite, muscovite, hornblende, andalusite, staurolite, cordierite, and sillimanite. The methods are based on the principle that the metamorphic degree is reflected by the diagnostic metamorphic minerals. Profile investigation and petrographic analysis show that the identification accuracy of the diagnostic metamorphic minerals reached 85.65%. Seven concentrations of metamorphic rocks were delineated based on the extracted metamorphic mineral anomalies. Compared with previous study results, this study showed that there are metamorphic rocks in defined Regions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, which are consistent with existing data; whereas in Regions 5 and 7, there is new information regarding the existence of metamorphic rocks, which may offer new clues about the formation of this area through additional studies. The results of this study not only reveal detailed information for geological survey of the Wuliangshan area but also provide useful methods for future surveys.

It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which it suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G(0)/G(1) to the S phase after serum starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintain a significantly lower level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than control cells. Based on the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression and are controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), a key molecule induced by prolonged starvation and involved in mitochondrial metabolism, we hypothesized that PGC-1 alpha might be related to the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. In this paper, we show that PGC-1 alpha is upregulated by Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following Bcl-2 knockdown or downregulation after serum starvation. However, Bcl-2 is negatively regulated by PGC-1 alpha expression. Further, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments showed that PGC-1 alpha protein is co-precipitated with Bcl-2 at the G(0)/G(1) phase. Taken together, our results suggest that PGC-1 alpha interacts with Bcl-2 after serum depletion, and that Bcl-2 might recruit PGC-1 alpha to reduce ROS, which in turn delays cell cycle progression in coordination with Bcl-2.

In the process of endospore formation, sporulation initiation is a vital stage and this stage is governed by autophosphorylation of the sensor histidine kinases. The second major sensor kinase KinB perceives the intracellular changes of GTP and ATP during sporulation. However, determination of the environmental signals as well as its related signaling pathway of KinB requires further elucidation. Our current study found that, contrary to the sporulation failure induced by kinA in the nutrient-rich 2x SG medium, the sensor kinase KinB sensed the environmental cues in the nutrient-poor MM medium. Two other membrane proteins, KapB and KbaA, also responded similarly to the same external signal as KinB. Both KapB and KbaA acted upstream of KinB, but they exerted their regulation upon KinB independently. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both the SH3 domain and the -helix structure in KapB are required for sensing or transducing the signal of sporulation initiation. Collectively, our work here supplied the direct evidences that KinB and its pathway sense the external signal of nutrient starvation in MM medium, and further analyzes the interrelationship among KinB, KbaA, and KapB.

However, the anti-inflammatory effects of cirsitakaoside are poorly understood. We investigated the anti-inflammatory action of cirsitakaoside in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and mice in vivo. Cirsitakaoside could suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in a dose-dependent manner in LPS-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. Cirsitakaoside also could inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2) mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. These effects were partially carried out by inactivated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway via inhibiting the phosphorylation of the IKK alpha/beta, I kappa B alpha and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK) in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages. In vivo, we showed that cirsitakaoside could relieve LPS-induced inflammation response. These results suggest that cirsitakaoside has the potential anti-inflammatory effect for treatment of inflammation diseases.

In this study, we attempted to track the dynamics of glaciers in the region, for example the glacier area and mass changes in Aru Co for the period 1971-2016, which were determined using topographic maps and Landsat images and ASTER-derived DEMs (2011-16), the Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission DEM (2000) and topographic maps (1971). Our results showed that the glacier area of Aru Co decreased by -0.4 +/- 4.1% during 1971-2016. The geodetic mass-balance results showed that the glaciers in Aru Co lost mass at a rate of -0.15 +/- 0.30 m w.e. a(-1) during 1971-99, while they gained mass at a rate of 0.33 +/- 0.61 m w.e. a(-1) for the period 1999-2016. The twin glaciers experienced a larger negative mass budget than the others in the region before 1999. This process produced large amounts of meltwater, followed by a sustained increase in the meltwater on the pressure melting point, possibly in response to a period of positive mass balance (1999-2016) and then, transferred to the glacier bed until the glaciers collapsed.

Annual average heat income is greater than heat expenditure on the dam surface. The mean annual temperature at observed the depths of 0-150 cm is >0 degrees C, although the average annual air temperature was -3.6 degrees C over the dam, indicating a relatively larger temperature difference between moraine dam and air. The volumetric soil moisture content is relatively low with an annual average of 5%, peaking after the snow cover melting and active layer thawing. Simulation results indicate that the average yearly maximum thawing depth has been similar to 0.3 m deeper than the average yearly maximum freezing depth during the observation period. In the past 55 years, the yearly maximum thawing depth has increased, while yearly maximum freezing depth has decreased, implying that the permafrost in the dam has been deteriorating. The annual surplus heat and increasing permafrost thawing depth will result in further deterioration of permafrost and melting of buried ice in the dam, thereby decreasing its stability.

The CO observation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively covered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at VLSR = -60 to -54 km s(-1). Both the symmetric axis of the radio emission and the trailing X-ray PWN appear projectively to be along a gap between two molecular gas patches at -58 to -57 km s(-1). Asymmetric broad profiles of (CO)-C-12 lines peaked at -58 km s(-1) are found at the eastern and southwestern edges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent with an SNR-MC interaction. We also find that a superbubble, similar to 37' in radius, appears to surround the SNR from H I 21 cm (V-LSR similar to-61 to -68 km s(-1)), WISE mid-IR, and optical extinction data. We build a multi-band photometric stellar sample of stars within the superbubble region and find 82 OB star candidates. The likely peak distance in the stars' distribution seems consistent with the distance previously suggested for CTB 87. We suggest the arc-like radio emission is mainly a relic of the part of the blast wave that propagates into the MC complex and is now in a radiative stage while the other part of the blast wave has been expanding into the low-density region in the superbubble. This scenario naturally explains the lack of X-ray emission related to the ejecta and blast wave. The SNR-MC interaction also favors a hadronic contribution to the.-ray emission from the CTB 87 region.

We present a method to locate a gamma-ray emission region in the framework of a one-zone emission model. From measurements of the core-shift effect, the relation between the magnetic field strengths (B') in the radio cores of the jet and the distances (R) of these radio cores from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be inferred. Therefore, once the magnetic field strength in the gamma-ray emission region (B-diss') is obtained, one can use the relation of B'-R to derive the distance (R-diss) of the gamma-ray emission region from the SMBH. Here, we evaluate the lower limit of B-diss' by using the criteria that the optical variability timescale t(var) should be longer than or equal to the synchrotron radiation cooling timescale of the electrons that emit optical photons. We test the method with the observations of PSK 1510-089 and BL Lacertae, and derive R-diss< 0.15 delta(1/3)(D)(1+ A)(2/3) pc for PSK 1510-089 with t(var) similar to a few hours and R-diss< 0.003 delta(1/3)(D)(1+ A)(2/3) pc for BL Lacertae with t(var) similar to a few minutes. Here, delta(D) is the Doppler factor and A is the Compton dominance (i.e., the ratio of the Compton to the synchrotron peak luminosities).

There are large populations of indigenous horse (Equus caballus) in China and some other parts of East Asia. However, their matrilineal genetic diversity and origin remained poorly understood. Using a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and hypervariable region (HVR-1) sequences, we aim to investigate the origin of matrilineal inheritance in these domestic horses. Methods. To investigate patterns of matrilineal inheritance in domestic horses, we conducted a phylogenetic study using 31 de novo mtDNA genomes together with 317 others from the GenBank. In terms of the updated phylogeny, a total of 5,180 horse mitochondrial HVR-1 sequences were analyzed. Results. Eightteen haplogroups (Aw-Rw) were uncovered from the analysis of the whole mitochondrial genomes. Most of which have a divergence time before the earliest domestication of wild horses (about 5,800 years ago) and during the Upper Paleolithic (35-10 KYA). The distribution of some haplogroups shows geographic patterns. The Lw haplogroup contained a significantly higher proportion of European horses than the horses from other regions, while haplogroups Jw, Rw, and some maternal lineages of Cw, have a higher frequency in the horses from East Asia. The 5,180 sequences of horse mitochondrial HVR-1 form nine major haplogroups (A-I). We revealed a corresponding relationship between the haplotypes of HVR-1 and those of whole mitochondrial DNA sequences. The data of the HVR-1 sequences also suggests that Jw, Rw, and some haplotypes of Cw may have originated in East Asia while Lw probably formed in Europe. Conclusions. Our study supports the hypothesis of the multiple origins of the maternal lineage of domestic horses and some maternal lineages of domestic horses may have originated from East Asia.

A continental-scale, westward-flowing axial river, or paleo-Middle Yangtze, formed following the Mesozoic collision between the North China and South China blocks. The river later flowed to the east as a result of the Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, but its reversal history remains largely unknown. Changes in detrital zircon U-Pb ages of Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata in the Three Gorges region identify a vital provenance shift in the sediments of the paleo-Middle Yangtze. Combined with paleocurrent measurements and petrography, our results indicate that the paleo-Middle Yangtze initially reversed during the late Cretaceous, followed by progressive westward capturing in the Eocene. This conclusion provides a paleogeographic explanation for the limited exposures of Upper Cretaceous to Cenozoic rocks in the Sichuan Basin and refutes the "drainage divide" hypothesis for the Three Gorges.

Calibration of colour gradient bias in shear measurement using HST/CANDELS data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis	GALAXY SHAPE MEASUREMENT; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; WEAK LENSING SURVEYS; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; COSMIC SHEAR; REQUIREMENTS; SIMULATIONS; ALGORITHM; EVOLUTION; FLEXION	Accurate shape measurements are essential to infer cosmological parameters from large area weak gravitational lensing studies. The compact diffraction-limited point spread function (PSF) in space-based observations is greatly beneficial, but its chromaticity for a broadband observation can lead to new subtle effects that could hitherto be ignored: the PSF of a galaxy is no longer uniquely defined and spatial variations in the colours of galaxies result in biases in the inferred lensing signal. Taking Euclid as a reference, we show that this colour gradient bias (CG bias) can be quantified with high accuracy using available multicolour Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In particular we study how noise in the HST observations might impact such measurements and find this to be negligible. We determine the CG bias using HST observations in the F606W and F814W filters and observe a correlation with the colour, in line with expectations, whereas the dependence with redshift is weak. The biases for individual galaxies are generally well below 1 per cent, which may be reduced further using morphological information from the Euclid data. Our results demonstrate that CG bias should not be ignored, but it is possible to determine its amplitude with sufficient precision, so that it will not significantly bias the weak lensing measurements using Euclid data.

Bi2O3/BiFeO3 had a good absorption for visible light, which was benefit to photocatalytic activity. The highest degradation efficiency was obtained when the content of Bi2O3 in Bi2O3/BiFeO3 was 63.9%. Effect of experimental conditions was investigated, and the highest photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3/BiFeO3 was observed at photocatalyst dosage of 0.5 g/L, initial BPA concentration of 10 mg/L, and solution pH of 6.3. Bi2O3/BiFeO3 photocatalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for BPA, and the reaction rate constant over Bi2O3/BiFeO3 composite was 2.23, 3.65, and 8.71 times higher than that of BiFeO3, Bi2O3 and commercial TiO2 (P25), respectively. Bi2O3/BiFeO3 showed high photocatalytic activity after three cycles, suggesting that it was a stable photocatalyst. The possible photocatalytic mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the theoretical calculation and the experimental results. The hydroxyl and superoxide radicals together with photogenerated holes played significant roles in the photocatalytic reaction.

U-Concordant Semigroups	ALGEBRA COLLOQUIUM			English	Article						regular semigroup; regular biordered set; RBS generalized category; RBS generalized groupoid; concordant semigroup	ORTHODOX SEMIGROUPS	We introduce the relations (L) over cap (U) and (R) over cap (U) with respect to a subset U of idempotents. Based on (L) over cap (U) and (R) over cap (U), we define a new class of semigroups which we name U-concordant semigroups. Our purpose is to describe U-concordant semigroups by generalized categories over a regular biordered set. We show that the category of U-concordant semigroups and admissible morphisms is isomorphic to the category of RBS generalized categories and pseudo functors. Our approach is inspired from Armstrong's work on the connection between regular biordered sets and concordant semigroups. The significant difference in strategy is by using RBS generalized categories equipped with pre-orders, we have no need to discuss the quotient of a category factored by a congruence.

This fungus differs from other Ophiocordyceps species by its enormously long monophialidic conidiogenous cells and a large periclinal protuberance often growing near the apex of conidiogenous cells, single conidia (lanceolate to fusiform) embedded in mucous sheath, and much larger conidial dimensions. Four-locus (nrSSU, nrLSU, tef-1 alpha and rpb1) and ITS data phylogenetic analyses show that O. unituberculata belongs to the Hirsutella nodulosa clade within the genus Ophiocordyceps of Ophiocordycipitaceae and is a separate clade from other allied species. Molecular phylogeny and morphology both strongly support the distinctiveness of this taxon. The interspecific relationships in the H. nodulosa clade are discussed.

However, the preparation conditions for this material are quite harsh. Therefore, it is rather significant to obtain well-qualified NCA by simple solid-phase synthesis. In this study, the solid-phase synthesis of NCA cathode material is carried out by mixing two types of raw materials via stirring or sand milling. The effects of different particle sizes on the structure and morphology of NCA materials are analyzed. Owing to the different particle sizes of the raw materials, the diffusion path of Li+ between the solid phases differs greatly. The XRD results show that the samples mixed by stirring have a worse cation mixture than those mixed by sand milling due to the larger particle size, smaller sintering surface energy, and insufficient sintering strength. The electrochemical results show that the sample mixed by sand milling has a higher specific capacity at a low rate, the initial discharge capacity is 199.22 mAh g(-1), and the capacity retention rate is 86.9% after 50 cycles. In contrast, the initial discharge capacity of the sample mixed by stirring is 184.86 mAh g(-1), and the capacity is 171.93 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles with a 93.0% capacity retention rate.

However, the mean regression theory breaks down if the error variance is infinite. In addition, correct specification of the likelihood function for existing imputation approach is often challenging in practice, especially for skewed data. In this paper, we develop a novel composite quantile regression and a weighted quantile average estimation procedure for parameter estimation in linear regression models when some responses are missing at random. Instead of imputing the missing response by randomly drawing from its conditional distribution, we propose to impute both missing and observed responses by their estimated conditional quantiles given the observed data and to use the parametrically estimated propensity scores to weigh check functions that define a regression parameter. Both estimation procedures are resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response and can achieve nice robustness and efficiency. Moreover, we propose adaptive penalization methods to simultaneously select significant variables and estimate unknown parameters. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are carefully investigated. An efficient algorithm is developed for fast implementation of the proposed methodologies. We also discuss a model selection criterion, which is based on an ICQ-type statistic, to select the penalty parameters. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated via simulated and real data sets.

To analyze NPP spatial-temporal variation within the context of changes in hydrothermal conditions, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) is used to elucidate the mathematical relationship between NPP and hydrothermal conditions. Based on this spatial-temporal pattern of NPP and hydrothermal conditions in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, regression statistics, an empirical model of land evaporation, and the water and thermal product index (K) are used to evaluate correlations between NPP and hydrothermal conditions in terms of their distribution pattern and interaction. The results show the following. (1) From 2000 to 2014, NPP in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin was highest in the central region and gradually decreased toward the southwest and northwest, whereas the annual change rate in NPP showed no significant increasing trend. (2) In the Lancang Basin, the correlation between hydrothermal conditions and NPP was high with respect to their distribution patterns, though this correlation was low in the Mekong Basin. (3) Correlation between K and NPP is high in the region where the effects of water and thermal factors on vegetation growth are similar. (4) K is an effective complement to the correlation between a single hydrothermal factor (temperature or precipitation) and NPP, and the influence of hydrothermal conditions on NPP was positive in the Lancang River and negative in the Mekong River Basin. Our study quantitatively analyzes the spatial-temporal correlation between NPP and hydrothermal conditions. The findings can reflect the vegetation change tendency and provide scientific data for ecological environment development and protection in the study area.

However, its ubiquitous sampling and openness results in serious privacy concerns. People's activity trajectories may reveal their private information such as home and work place and thus requires proper protection. In this paper, we propose a novel design scheme, called query logics detached storage (OLDS), for trajectory privacy protection. The core idea of OLDS is to extract the query logics for personal trajectory retrieval and make actual trajectory tuples not clustered to any route-identity or user-identity at server end, which introduces fine-granularity anonymity. The QLDS design scheme stores the extracted query logics at users own client devices and the un-clustered location tuples at the backend server, guaranteeing trajectory reconstruction at client-end and privacy preservation at server-end.

It is also reported as a fungus associated with bark beetles. In this study, based on ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, 14 strains collected from the beetle bodies and galleries of Tomicus minor and Tomicus yunnanensis infesting Pinus yunnanensis in Southwestern China were identified as S.polyspora. To assess the virulence of S.polyspora to P.yunnanensis, pathogenicity tests were conducted by inoculating the fungus in the stems and on needles of P.yunnanensis. The results after 30 days showed that the lesion lengths in the phloem after inoculation with S.polyspora were significantly longer than for the control. In addition, the fungus caused partly distinct chlorisis or discolouration of needles 14 days after inoculation. This suggests that S.polyspora is able to colonize stem phloem and pine needles of P.yunnanensis and thus may cause secondary damages to this host after being spread with bark beetles.

Three approaches are developed to estimate distribution functions and quantiles, i.e., the Horvtiz-Thompson-type method, regression imputation method and augmented inverse probability weighted approach. The propensity score is specified by a semiparametric exponential tilting model. To estimate the tilting parameter in the propensity score, the authors propose an adjusted empirical likelihood method to deal with the over-identified system. Under some regular conditions, the authors investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed three estimators for distribution functions and quantiles, and find that these estimators have the same asymptotic variance. The jackknife method is employed to consistently estimate the asymptotic variances. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies.

The new method has the following merits: (i) its implementation does not require specifying a regression form of predictors and response variables; (ii) it can deal with various types of covariates and response variables including continuous, discrete and categorical variables; (iii) it works well even when the covariatesirandom errors are heavy-tailed, or the predictors are strongly correlated, or there are outliers; (iv) it is unsensitive to the slicing scheme. Under some regularity conditions, the sure screening and ranking consistency properties are established for the proposed procedure without assuming any moment conditions on the predictors. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure. A real data example is illustrated to the proposed procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By using the continuation theorem of Mawhin's coincidence degree theory, the existence of periodic solutions for QVCNNs is obtained. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability of periodic solutions for QVCNNs. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analyses of whole genomes of 63 frogs reveal population structuring and historical demography, characterized by highly restricted gene flow in a narrow geographic zone lying between matrilines West (W) and East (E). A population found only along a single tributary of the Yalu Zangbu River has the mitogenome only of E, whereas nuclear genes of W comprise 89-95% of the nuclear genome. Selection accounts for 579 broadly scattered, highly divergent regions (HDRs) of the genome, which involve 365 genes. These genes fall into 51 gene ontology (GO) functional classes, 14 of which are likely to be important in driving reproductive isolation. GO enrichment analyses of E reveal many overrepresented functional categories associated with adaptation to high elevations, including blood circulation, response to hypoxia, and UV radiation. Four genes, including DNAJC8 in the brain, TNNC1 and ADORA1 in the heart, and LAMB3 in the lung, differ in levels of expression between low-and high-elevation populations. High-altitude adaptation plays an important role in maintaining and driving continuing divergence and reproductive isolation. Use of total genomes enabled recognition of selection and adaptation in and between populations, as well as documentation of evolution along a stepped cline toward speciation.

A sphere in 3D space is projected to two parallel circles on which two tangents of a point and its antipode are parallel on the unit viewing sphere and intersect at the point at infinity. The direction of the polar of the point at infinity is orthogonal to the direction of the point at infinity with respect to the circle. The imaged circular points and orthogonal vanishing points can be obtained to solve the intrinsic camera parameters.

While only millets were eventually domesticated in early sedentary societies there, recent archaeobotanical evidence reported here indicates that grasses from the Paniceae (including millets) and Triticeae tribes were exploited together by foraging groups from the Last Glacial Maximum to the mid-Holocene. Here we explore how and why millets were selected for domestication while Triticeae were abandoned. We document the different exploitation and cultivation trajectories of the two tribes employing ancient starch data derived from nine archaeological sites dating from 25,000 to 5500 cal BP (LGM through mid-Holocene) in North China. With this diachronic overview, we can place the trajectories into the context of paleoclimatic reconstructions for this period. Entering the Holocene, climatic changes increased the yield stability, abundance, and availability of the wild progenitors of millets, with growing conditions increasingly favoring millets while becoming more unfavorable for grasses of the Triticeae tribe. We thus hypothesize that climate change played a critical role in the selection of millet species for domestication in North China, with early domestication evidenced by 8700 cal BP.

The nano-sized spinel crystallites connected together to form mesoporous structure by annealing homogeneous complex oxalates precursor at a low rate of heating. It is found that the low anneal rate plays an important role for the formation of mesoporous ZnCo2O4 rods. The effects of the heat temperature on the phase, morphology and catalytic properties of the products were studied. The XRD, SEM TEM, and N-2 absorption/desorption have been done to obtain compositional and morphological information as well as BET surface area of the as-prepared sample. Catalytic activities of mesoporous ZnCo2O4 rods toward the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) techniques. The results show that the addition of ZnCo2O4 rods to AP dramatically reduces the decomposition temperature. The ZnCo2O4 rods annealed at 250 degrees C possesses much larger specific area and exhibits excellent catalytic activity (decrease the high decomposition temperature of AP by 162.2 degrees C). The obtained mesoporous ZnCo2O4 rods are promising as excellent catalyst for the thermal decomposition of AP.

Until now, it is still unclear how the degree of liver injury dictates hepatocyte senescence and carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether the severity of injury determines cell fate decisions between hepatocyte senescence and carcinogenesis. After testing of different degrees of liver injury, we found that hepatocyte senescence is strongly induced in the setting of severe acute liver injury. Longer-term, moderate liver injury, on the contrary did not result into hepatocyte senescence, but led to a significant incidence of HCC instead. In addition, carcinogenesis was significantly reduced by the induction of severe acute injury after chronic moderate liver injury. Meanwhile, immune surveillance, especially the activations of macrophages, was activated after re-induction of senescence by severe acute liver injury. We conclude that severe acute liver injury leads to hepatocyte senescence along with activating immune surveillance and a low incidence of HCC, whereas chronic moderate injury allows hepatocytes to proliferate rather than to enter into senescence, and correlates with a high incidence of HCC. This study improves our understanding in hepatocyte cell fate decisions and suggests a potential clinical strategy to induce senescence to treat HCC.

Nevertheless, current methods are not good at recovering the PSF fluctuations of high spatial frequencies. In general, the residual PSF fluctuations are spatially correlated, and therefore can significantly contaminate the correlation functions of the weak lensing signals. We propose a method to correct for this contamination statistically, without any assumptions on the PSF and galaxy morphologies or their spatial distribution. We demonstrate our idea with the data from the W2 field of CFHTLenS.

In mesoscopic carbon-based PSCs, however, compared to conventional ones, the hole-transport-layer-free PSCs often lead to inefficient hole extraction. Here, we used liquid metal (LM, Galinstan) as an interface modifier material in combination with a carbon electrode. Considering the high conductivity and room-temperature fluidity, it is found that LMs are superior in improving hole extraction and, more importantly, LMs tend to be reserved at the interface between ZrO2 and carbon for enhancing the contact property. Correspondingly, the carrier transfer resistance was decreased at the carbon/perovskite interface. As optimized content, the triple mesoscopic PSCs based on mixed-cation perovskite with a power conversion efficiency of 13.51% was achieved, involving a 26% increase compared to those without LMs. This work opens new techniques for LMs in optoelectronics and printing.

To date, the development of anode materials for SIBs is still confronted with many serious problems. In this work, encapsulation-type structured MoSe2@hollow carbon nanosphere (HCNS) materials assembled with expanded (002) planes few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets confined in HCNS are successfully synthesized through a facile strategy. Notably, the interlayer spacing of the (002) planes is expanded to 1.02 nm, which is larger than the intrinsic value of pristine MoSe2 (0.64 nm). Furthermore, the few-layer nanosheets are space-confined in the inner cavity of the HCNS, forming hybrid MoSe2@HCNS structures. When evaluated as anode materials for SIBs, it shows excellent rate capabilities, ultralong cycling life with exceptional Coulombic efficiency even at high current density, maintaining 501 and 471 mA h g(-1) over 1000 cycles at 1 and 3 A g(-1), respectively. Even when cycled at current densities as high as 10 A g(-1), a capacity retention of 382 mA h g(-1) can be achieved. The expanded (002) planes, 2D few-layer nanosheets, and unique carbon shell structure are responsible for the ultralong cycling and high rate performance.

Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) was prepared based on an organic solvent-free and self-catalytic process, using synthesized CMLCD as a hydrophilic diol. The CMLCD has self-catalytic ability to the reaction of hydroxyl and isocyanate during the prepolymerization, which can greatly shorten the preparation period and avoid the utilization of highly toxic catalyst such as dibutyltin dilaurate. Importantly, the prepared WPU has narrow particle size distribution with the average particle size of 137 nm, which leads to good stability even centrifugated at 3000 rpm. Mechanical test results show that the WPU film possesses good mechanical performance with the tensile strength of 59.3 MPa and elongation at break of 819.2%. Additionally, the prepared WPU film has high water resistance. This study is attractive for future green WPU in industrial production and application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells via fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity. Overall, this work revealed that introduction of specific metabolites in host plants may be one consequence during the process of endophytes-host metabolic interactions, which raise the possibility to shape grape qualities and characteristics using tool of fungal endophytes.

Terahertz magneto-optical properties of bi- and tri-layer graphene	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						graphene; terahertz time domain spectroscopy; high magnetic field; magneto-optical properties	OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; SPECTROSCOPY; CONDUCTIVITY; MONOLAYER; PLASMONS; DYNAMICS	Magneto-optical (MO) properties of bi- and tri-layer graphene are investigated utilizing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz TDS) in the presence of a strong magnetic field at room-temperature. In the Faraday configuration and applying optical polarization measurements, we measure the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse MO conductivities of different graphene samples. The obtained experimental data fits very well with the classical MO Drude formula. Thus, we are able to obtain the key sample and material parameters of bi- and tri-layer graphene, such as the electron effective mass, the electronic relaxation time and the electron density. It is found that in high magnetic fields the electronic relaxation time tau for bi- and tri-layer graphene increases with magnetic field B roughly in a form tau similar to B-2. Most importantly, we obtain the electron effective mass for bi- and tri-layer graphene at room-temperature under non-resonant conditions. This work shows how the advanced THz MO techniques can be applied for the investigation into fundamental physics properties of atomically thin 2D electronic systems.

We observed chemotactic behaviors of C. elegans with respect to response to attractants produced by nematode parasitic fungus Stropharia rugosoannulata, which were partially induced by specific amino acids. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis suggested that 1-octen-3-ol was produced and benzaldehyde concentrations increased when L-phenylalanine was added to water agar plate. Similarly, the addition of L-tryptophan to the medium induced the production of benzaldehyde, 1-octen-3-ol and indole. The presence of L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan increased the attraction of C. elegans to S. rugosoannulata. With attraction increased, nematode mortality increased more than 6 times higher.

Negatively charged DNA was electrostatically adsorbed onto materials by protonation of positively charged chitosan under acidic conditions. The electrode surface and hybridization process were carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under optimal conditions, the biosensor showed a good linear relationship between peak currents difference (I) and logarithm of the target DNA concentration (Log C) ranging from 2.0x10(-13) to 2.0x10(-6)M with a detection limit of 2.0x10(-15)M (signal/noise ratio of 3). The biosensor also revealed an excellent selectivity to three-base, completely mismatched and completely matched DNA. This is a simple, fast and friendly method with a low detection limit for the detection of Bacillus cereus specific DNA compared with previously reported electrochemical DNA biosensor. Furthermore, the DNA biosensor may lead to the development of a technology for gold prospecting in the wild.

An in situ experiment was set up to study the phosphorus release mechanisms of cyanobacterial blooms in Dianchi Lake during its decline period. In the enclosure, the cyanobacteria were dying out gradually and this process further affected the water quality parameters and lead to P release from bloom-cyanobacteria. The pH and electric conductivity (EC) increased substantially, while the redox potential (ORP) decreased during the whole experimental period. Among all the released P forms, the orthophosphate (ortho-P) was the main released P form and accounted for 96.7 and 67.8% of the total phosphorus (TP) increment in the water and the TP reduction in algae respectively. According to the TP in sediment and lost P of overlying water column, it could be concluded that the ortho-P released from algae was absorbed by sediment as well. The release of TP, organic P (OP), and ortho-P from bloom-cyanobacteria all followed the first-order kinetics, and the release rate of ortho-P was much higher than that of OP (p < 0.05). Furthermore, according to the total extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) determination and related Pearson's correlation analysis, the release of TP and ortho-P from bloom-cyanobacteria would probably depend on the reduction of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and colonial sheath disaggregation. In conclusion, a large amount of ortho-P was released and adsorbed by sediment gradually during cyanobacterial bloom decline period, and these bioavailable P could provide the sufficient nutrient for newborn cyanobacteria and could contribute to the construction of a new internal P cycle among sediment, water, and cyanobacterial bloom.

Collaborative QoS prediction is proposed to address this issue by borrowing ideas from recommender systems. However, there is still a challenging problem as how to incorporate contextual factors into existing algorithms to realize context aware QoS prediction as contextual factors play a crucial role in QoS assessment. In this paper, we propose a general context-sensitive matrix-factorization approach (CSMF) to make collaborative QoS prediction. By considering the complexity of service invocations, CSMF models the interactions of users-to-services and environment-to-environment simultaneously, and make full use of implicit and explicit contextual factors in the QoS data. Experimental results show that CSMF significantly outperforms the-state-of-art methods in metric of prediction accuracy. Particularly, when the QoS data is very sparse, CSMF is more effective and robust. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Himalayas are known as one of the world's most GLOF-vulnerable zones. Effective hazard assessments and risk management require a thorough inventory of historical GLOF events across the Himalayas, which is hitherto absent. Existing studies imply that numerous historical GLOF events are contentious because of discrepant geographic coordinates, names, or outburst time, requiring further verifications. This study reviews and verifies over 60 historical GLOF events across the Himalayas using a comprehensive method that combines literature documentations, archival remote sensing observations, geomorphological analysis, and field investigations. As a result, three unreported GLOF events were discovered from remote sensing images and geomorphological analysis. Eleven suspicious events were identified and suggested to be excluded. The properties of five outburst lakes, i.e., Degaco, Chongbaxia Tsho, Geiqu, Lemthang Tsho, and a lake on Tshojo Glacier, were corrected or updated. A total of 51 GLOF events were verified to be convincing, and these outburst lakes were classified into three categories according to their statuses in the past decades, namely disappeared (12), stable (30), and expanding (9). Statistics of the verified GLOF events show that GLOF tended to occur between April and October in the Himalayas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to rapidly expanding glacial lakes with high possibility of repetitive outbursts. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating remote sensing and geomorphic interpretations in identifying and verifying GLOF events in remote alpine environments. This inventory of GLOFs with a range of critical attributes (e.g., locations, time, and mechanisms) will benefit the continuous monitoring and prediction of potentially dangerous glacial lakes and contribute to outburst-induced risk assessments and hazard mitigations.

The shortcoming of the traditional CCA lies that it only handles data represented by two-view features and cannot reveal the nonlinear correlation relationship. In recent years, many variant algorithms have been developed to extend the capability of CCA such as discriminative CCA, sparse CCA, kernel CCA, locality preserving CCA and multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA). One representative work is Laplacian multiset canonical correlations (LapMCC) that employs graph Laplacian to exploit the nonlinear correlation information for multiview high-dimensional data. However, it possibly leads to poor extrapolating power because Laplacian regularization biases the solution towards a constant function. In this paper, we present Hessian multiset canonical correlations (HesMCC) for multiview dimension reduction. Hessian can properly exploit the intrinsic local geometry of the data manifold in contrast to Laplacian. HesMCC takes the advantage of Hessian and provides superior extrapolating capability and finally leverage the performance. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets for handwritten digits classification, face classification and object classification validate the effectiveness of the proposed HesMCC algorithm by comparing it with baseline algorithms including TCCA, KMUDA, MCCA and LapMCC.

The inhibition performance was tested by immersing aluminum in HCl solution using weight loss and electrochemical methods. CS-SAS-AAGC showed an inhibition efficiency as high as 95% at low inhibitor concentration of 100 mg/L. The inhibitive performance is much higher than that of CS, SAS, AA, CS/AA, CS/SAS or CS/AA/SAS mixture. The adsorption of CS-SAS-AAGC on aluminum surface was found to obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm. CS-SAS-AAGC behaves as a mixing-type inhibitor, while mainly inhibiting the cathodic reaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has two time constants with a large capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by also a large inductive one at low frequencies. The inhibition of aluminum surface by CS-SAS-AAGC is evidenced through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and contact angle images. The adsorption mechanism was theoretically analyzed by quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Molecular oxygen and water were used as the oxidant and solvent, respectively. Various dominant reaction parameters, including HMF/Ru molar ratio, O-2 pressure, reaction temperature and reaction time were systematically investigated. When HMF/Ru molar ratio was of 25, Ru/HAP catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic performance, i.e., total conversion of HMF and 99.6% yield of FDCA were achieved at 120 degrees C and 1 MPa O-2. Kinetic study revealed that the oxidation of HMF to FDCA followed a tandem pathway and the oxidation of carbonyl group in 5-formylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (FFCA) was found as the rate determining step. Besides, well-dispersed uniformly-small metallic Ru-0 nanoparticles and the acidic-basic sites presented on HAP surface were both essential to drive this base-free oxidation process. During the kinetic controlled range (i.e., initial 1 h of reaction), the activity of the catalyst can be almost remained after five consecutive cycles; afterwards a minor decline in activity was observed mainly due to the partial oxidation of surface metallic Ru species, but the activity can be entirely recovered by a hydrogen reduction at 350 degrees C.

The selection function of the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-centre	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; techniques: spectroscopic; Galaxy: stellar content	STELLAR ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS; DATA RELEASE; GAC; EVOLUTION; STARS; MILKY; CALIBRATION; ANTICENTRE; RAVE; DR1	We present a detailed analysis of the selection function of the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-centre (LSS-GAC). LSS-GAC was designed to obtain low-resolution optical spectra for a sample of more than 3 million stars in the Galactic anti-centre. The second release of value-added catalogues of the LSS-GAC (LSS-GAC DR2) contains stellar parameters, including radial velocity, atmospheric parameters, elemental abundances, and absolute magnitudes deduced from 1.8 million spectra of 1.4 million unique stars targeted by the LSS-GAC between 2011 and 2014. For many studies using this data base, such as those investigating the chemodynamical structure of the MilkyWay, a detailed understanding of the selection function of the survey is indispensable. In this paper, we describe how the selection function of the LSS-GAC can be evaluated to sufficient detail and provide selection function corrections for all spectroscopic measurements with reliable parameters released in LSS-GAC DR2. The results, to be released as new entries in the LSS-GAC value-added catalogues, can be used to correct the selection effects of the catalogue for scientific studies of various purposes.

The shortages of the single QD and graphene materials could be remedied by the synergistic effects from QDs/GR composite materials; meanwhile, some unique phenomena and superior physical properties were also produced. The QDs/GR composites processed better photocatalytic activities, higher photon capture abilities and excellent optical responsibilities. Therefore, they were widely applied in various techniques. Here, we reviewed and discussed recent research progresses about the QDs/GR composites and focused on their industrial preparation and commercial applications. Among these synthetic methods, ion beam sputtering deposition (IBSD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) were discussed in detail because they could be directly applied in commercial industry for preparing size-tunable quantum dots. In another part, the applications of the QDs/GR composites were also discussed, the advanced physical and chemical properties promoted these composites to have numerous potential for being applied in photodetectors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors and other devices. The appropriate synthetic method for QDs/GR materials is highly dependent on the requirements of its applications. We firmly believe that the direct synthesis technique of ideal QDs/GR composite for specific applications is a challenge and research emphasis for scientist and engineers in future.

J	Liu, WF; Zhang, LB; Tao, DP; Cheng, J				Liu, Weifeng; Zhang, Lianbo; Tao, Dapeng; Cheng, Jun			Reinforcement online learning for emotion prediction by using physiological signals	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Emotion prediction; Reinforcement learning; Online learning; Biometric surveillance	RECOGNITION; EXPRESSION	Physiological signals generated from human internal organs can objectively and truly reflect the real-time variations of human emotion and monitor body situation. Recently, with the accessibility of a massive number of physiological signal data, emotion analysis by using physiological signals is attracting an increasing attention and many methods have been reported by using electroencephalogram (EEG) or peripheral physiological signals. Although the prominent online learning methods can predict the emotion status with time varying physiological signals, it does not consider the reward of current operation in each iteration. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement online learning (ROL) method for real-time emotion state prediction by exploiting the reward to modify the predictor during the online training iterations. In each iteration, we evaluate the reward and then select some specific instances into predictor learning. It gains both significant time reduction and prominent performance. We apply the reinforcement online learning to least squares (LS) and support vector regression (SVR) for Emotion Prediction, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on artificial dataset and real-world physiological signal dataset (DEAP dataset) and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A wide variety of divisible applications have been found in the area of parallel and distributed processing. This paper addresses the problem of how to partition and allocate divisible applications to available resources in mobile edge computing environments with the aim of minimizing the completion time of the applications. A theoretical model was proposed for partitioning an entire divisible application according to the load of the application and the capabilities of available resources, and the solutions were derived in closed form. Both simulations and real experiments were carried out to justify this model.

Both efflux and influx transporters are reported to play important roles in the disposition of VPA, however, no comprehensive investigation into the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ABC/SLC families with VPA concentration are reported. In the present study, we investigated the association of 12 SNPs in ABCC2,ABCC4,ABCG2, MCT1, MCT2, and OATP2B1 in 187 Chinese patients with epilepsy on VPA monotherapy with the trough concentrations of VPA. The data showed that VPA concentration in patients with ABCC2 rs2273697 AA genotype was significantly higher than that in those with GA+GG genotypes (p=0.000). The findings of the present study suggest that ABCC2 polymorphisms influence VPA concentrations in patients with epilepsy on VPA monotherapy, which may affect the treatment outcomes.

In this study, a map of the current distribution of vegetation in Yunnan Province was compiled based on data from remote sensing imagery from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) from 2008 to 2011. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to predict the potential distribution of the main forest vegetation types in Yunnan Province and estimate the changes in carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in response to increasing temperature. The results show that the current total forest area in Yunnan Province is 1.86 x 10(7) ha and that forest covers 48.63% of the area. As the temperature increases, the area of forest distribution first increases and then decreases, and it decreases by 11% when the temperature increases from 1.5 to 2 degrees C. The mean carbon density of the seven types of forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 84.69 Mg/ha. The total carbon storage of the current forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 871.14 TgC, and the CSP is 1100.61 TgC. The largest CSP (1114.82 TgC) occurs when the temperature increases by 0.5 degrees C. Incremental warming of 2 degrees C will sharply decrease the forest CSP, especially in those regions with mature coniferous forest vegetation. Semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests were highly sensitive to temperature changes, and the CSP of these forests will decrease with increasing temperature. Warm-hot coniferous forests have the greatest CSP in all simulation scenarios except the scenario of a 2 degrees C temperature increase. These results indicate that temperature increases can influence the CSP in Yunnan Province, and the largest impact emerged in the 2 degrees C increase scenario.

The as-prepared mesoporous 1D-PSiNW arrays here had especially high specific surface areas of 323.47 m(2.)g(-1) and were applied as anodes to achieve fast charge-discharge performance for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The 1D-PSiNWs anodes with feature size of similar to 7 nm exhibited reversible specific capacity of 2061.1 mAhg(-1) after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1.5 A.g(-1). Moreover, under the ultrafast charge-discharge current rate of 16.0 A.g(-1), the 1D-PSiNWs anodes still maintained 586.7 mAh.g(-1) capacity even after 5000 cycles. This nanoporous 1D-PSiNW with high surface area is a potential anode candidate for the ultrafast charge-discharge in LIBs with high specific capacity and superior cycling performance.

By using two donor materials, poly(3-hexylthiosphene) (P3HT) and titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc), as well as two acceptor materials, [6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C-60, the cascade multiple heterojunctions of P3HT:PCBM/TiOPc:C-60/C-60 have been constructed. Applying the optimized inverted configuration of FTO/Zinc Tin Oxide (ZTO)/C-60 (30 nm)/TiOPc:C-60 (1:1.5, 25 nm)/P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8, 100 nm)/MoO3 (4 nm)/Ag, the considerably enhanced open circuit voltage (V-OC) and short circuit current (J(SC)) can be harvested together, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is three times higher than that of the control cell with conventional structure. The significant improvements of the inverted cell are mostly due to the broadened spectral absorption and high efficient multi-interface exciton dissociation in the cascade multiple heterojunctions, indicating that the optimized cascade heterojunctions match the inverted structure well.

In this study, the proteomes of fungistatic conidia, fresh conidia and germinated conidia of Arthrobotrys oligospora ATCC24927 were determined and quantified. The protein expression profile of fungistatic conidia was significantly different from those in the other two conditions. 281 proteins were down expressed in fungistatic conidia and characterized by GO annotation. Gene transcription analysis and inhibition of puromycin (a protein translation inhibitor) on conidial germination suggested that down expression of 33 protein translation related proteins might well result in repression of protein synthesis and inhibition of conidial germination. In addition, 16 down-expressed proteins were mapped to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (Ras/MAP) regulatory networks which regulate conidial DNA synthesis. The conidial DNA synthesis was found to be definitely inhibited under by ammonia, and function studies of two Ras/MAP proteins by using knock-out strains provided partial evidence that Ras/MAP pathway regulate the conidial germination. These results suggested that down-expression of Ras/MAP related proteins might result in inhibition of DNA synthesis and finally result in inhibition conidial germination. This study revealed partial fungistatic mechanism of ammonia against conidial germination.

However, the significant surface structures and properties for photo-catalytic absorption layers have not yet been studied in detail for CZTS. Hence, the surface structure and electronic properties of low-index stoichiometric CZTS surfaces are calculated based on density functional theory. The relaxation is much large for the (001), (100), (101) and (112) surfaces. Moreover, more surface states appear at the bottom of conduction band and the top of valence band. The conduction band is mainly composed of S-3p and Sn-5p orbits. The valence band top is mainly composed of S-3p and Cu-3d orbits. The band gap values of five surfaces do not vary greatly. The dangling bond density for the (112) surfaces is minimal, resulting in minimum surface energy. Finally, the equilibrium morphology of CZTS is constructed by the Wulff rule. It is found that the {101} surface is the dominant surface (72.6%). These results will help us to better understand the surface properties of absorption layer that is related to CZTS surface and provide theoretical support for future experimental studies.

Binary stars play an important role in formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Through comparing the radial velocity variations from multiepoch observations, we analyze the binary fraction of dwarf stars observed with LAMOST. Effects of different model assumptions, such as orbital period distributions on the estimate of binary fractions, are investigated. The results based on log-normal distribution of orbital periods reproduce the previous complete analyses better than the power-law distribution. We find that the binary fraction increases with T-eff and decreases with [Fe/H]. We first investigate the relation between alpha-elements and binary fraction in such a large sample as provided by LAMOST. The old stars with high [alpha/Le] dominate with a higher binary fraction than young stars with low [alpha/Fe]. At the same mass, earlier forming stars possess a higher binary fraction than newly forming ones, which may be related with evolution of the Galaxy.

Yet, only a limited number of miRNA sponges have been identified. Here, we show that the recently evolved noncoding tumor suppressor transcript, antisense RNA to TP73 gene (TP73-AS1), functions as a natural sponge of human-specific miRNA miR-941. We find unusually nine high-affinity miR-941 binding sites clustering within 1 kb region on TP73-AS1, which forms miR-941 sponge region. This sponge region displays increased sequence constraint only in humans, and its formation can be traced to the tandem expansion of a 71-nt-long sequence containing a single miR-941 binding site in old world monkeys. We further confirm TP73-AS1 functions as an efficient miR-941 sponge based on massive transcriptome data analyses, wound-healing assay, and Argonaute protein immunoprecipitation experiments conducted in cell lines. The expression of miR-941 and its sponge correlate inversely across multiple healthy and cancerous tissues, with miR-941 being highly expressed in tumors and preferentially repressing tumor suppressors. Thus, the TP73-AS1 and miR-941 duo represents an unusual case of the extremely rapid evolution of noncoding regulators controlling cell migration, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.

Arthrobotrys oligospora is a representative nematode-trapping fungus that can produce adhesive networks to capture nematodes. In this study, the roles of two Rab GTPases AoRab-7A and AoRab-2 were characterized by gene knockout in the fungus A. oligospora. The disruption of AoRab-7A hindered the mycelial growth in different media, the conidiation of Delta AoRab-7A transformants was almost abolished, and the transcription of four sporulation-related genes (AbaA, FluG, Hyp1, and VosA) was downregulated compared to the wild-type strain (WT). Furthermore, the tolerance of the Delta AoRab-7A mutants to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and H2O2 was also significantly reduced compared to the WT, and the transcription of several genes related to environmental resistance, such as genes for catalase and trehalose synthase, was downregulated. Similarly, the extracellular proteolytic activity was decreased. Importantly, the Delta AoRab-7A mutants were unable to produce traps and capture nematodes. However, the disruption of gene AoRab-2 only affected the conidiation slightly but non-significantly, while other phenotypic traits were unaffected. Moreover, the gene AoRab-7A was also involved in the autophagy induced by nitrogen deprivation in A. oligospora. Our results revealed for the first time that the Rab GTPases are involved in the regulation of mycelial growth, conidiation, trap formation, stress resistance, and pathogenicity in the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora.

The film was formed by the in situ polymerization of colchicine-imprinted membranes on the G@AuNPs-modified GCE using methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. The specific surface area, catalytic performance, and electrical conductivity of the electrode increased on account of the formation of G@AuNPs compound materials, thereby improving the sensitivity of the sensor. The MIM as a preconcentrator exhibited chemical selectivity. Under optimal conditions, the MIM/G@AuNPs/GCE sensor exhibited high selectivity and high anti-interference ability. Moreover, good linearity was obtained in the range of 1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol L-1 and 1.2 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1 of colchicine with a detection limit of 4.8 x 10(-9) mol L-1. The sensor was successfully applied for the direct determination of colchicine in colchicine tablets and human serum samples, with a relative standard deviation of less than 3.1% (n = 5) and recoveries ranging from 97.5% to 110.0%.

Sulfenate anions as organocatalysts for benzylic chloromethyl coupling polymerization via C=C bond formation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							POLY(P-PHENYLENE VINYLENE) MATERIALS; CATALYZED REGIOSELECTIVE ARYLATION; PROTON-TRANSFER POLYMERIZATION; STEREOCONTROLLED SYNTHESIS; 1,1,3-TRIARYL-2-AZAALLYL ANIONS; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN; INCLUSION MODE; ALL-CIS	Organocatalytic polymerization reactions have a number of advantages over their metal-catalyzed counterparts, including environmental friendliness, ease of catalyst synthesis and storage, and alternative reaction pathways. Here we introduce an organocatalytic polymerization method called benzylic chloromethyl-coupling polymerization (BCCP). BCCP is catalyzed by organocatalysts not previously employed in polymerization processes (sulfenate anions), which are generated from bench-stable sulfoxide precatalysts. The sulfenate anion promotes an umpolung polycondensation via step-growth propagation cycles involving sulfoxide intermediates. BCCP represents an example of an organocatalyst that links monomers by C=C double bond formation and offers transition metal-free access to a wide variety of polymers that cannot be synthesized by traditional precursor routes.

Revealing the Faraday depth structure of radio galaxy NGC612 with broad-band radio polarimetric observations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: polarimetric; galaxies: individual: NGC612; galaxies: magnetic fields; radio continuum: galaxies	MAGNETIC-FIELD STRENGTHS; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; STELLAR POPULATIONS; SURFACE PHOTOMETRY; COMPLETE SAMPLE; CLASS-I; X-RAY; ROTATION; DEPOLARIZATION; LOBES	We present full-polarization, broad-band observations of the radio galaxy NGC612 (PKS B0131-637) from 1.3 to 3.1 GHz using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The relatively large angular scale of the radio galaxy makes it a good candidate with which to investigate the polarization mechanisms responsible for the observed Faraday depth structure. By fitting complex polarization models to the polarized spectrum of each pixel, we find that a single polarization component can adequately describe the observed signal for the majority of the radio galaxy. While we cannot definitively rule out internal Faraday rotation, we argue that the bulk of the Faraday rotation is taking place in a thin skin that girts the polarized emission. Using minimum energy estimates, we find an implied total magnetic field strength of 4.2 mu G.	[Kaczmarek, J.

Nematode-trapping fungi can switch their lifestyle from saprophytic to pathogenic by developing specific trapping devices induced by nematodes to infect their prey as a response to nutrient depletion in nature. However, the chemical identity of the specific fungal metabolites used during the switch remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that these important signal molecules might be volatile in nature. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to carry out comparative analysis of fungal metabolomics during the saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles of the model species Arthrobotrys oligospora. Two media commonly used in research on this species, cornmeal agar (CMA) and potato dextrose agar (PDA), were chosen for use in this study. The fungus produced a small group of volatile furanone and pyrone metabolites that were associated with the switch from the saprophytic to the pathogenic stage. A. oligospora fungi grown on CMA tended to produce more traps and employ attractive furanones to improve the utilization of traps, while fungi grown on PDA developed fewer traps and used nematode-toxic furanone metabolites to compensate for insufficient traps. Another volatile pyrone metabolite, maltol, was identified as a morphological regulator for enhancing trap formation. Deletion of the gene AOL_s00079g496 in A. oligospora led to increased amounts of the furanone attractant (2-fold) in mutants and enhanced the attractive activity (1.5-fold) of the fungus, while it resulted in decreased trap formation. This investigation provides new insights regarding the comprehensive tactics of fungal adaptation to environmental stress, integrating both morphological and metabolomic mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Nematode-trapping fungi are a unique group of soil-living fungi that can switch from the saprophytic to the pathogenic lifestyle once they come into contact with nematodes as a response to nutrient depletion. In this study, we investigated the metabolic response during the switch and the key types of metabolites involved in the interaction between fungi and nematodes. Our findings indicate that A. oligospora develops multiple and flexible metabolic tactics corresponding to different morphological responses to nematodes. A. oligospora can use similar volatile furanone and pyrone metabolites with different ecological functions to help capture nematodes in the fungal switch from the saprophytic to the pathogenic lifestyle. Furthermore, studies with A. oligospora mutants with increased furanone and pyrone metabolites confirmed the results. This investigation reveals the importance of volatile signaling in the comprehensive tactics used by nematode-trapping fungi, integrating both morphological and metabolomic mechanisms.

J	Dai, J; Sun, BN				Dai Jing; Sun Bainian			Early Cretaceous atmospheric CO2 estimates based on stomatal index of Pseudofrenelopsis papillosa (Cheirolepidiaceae) from southeast China	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH			English	Article						Pseudofrenelopsis papillosa; Stomatal index; Atmospheric CO2 concentration; Early Cretaceous	CARBON-DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS; FOSSIL PLANTS; PALEOSOL CARBONATE; REVISED MODEL; CLIMATE; RECORD; CONIFER; PCO(2); SENSITIVITY; ISOTOPE	Estimates of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration levels were made for three time intervals of the Early Cretaceous using the stomatal indices of an extinct fossil conifer, Pseudofrenelopsis papillosa (Chow et Tsao) Cao ex Zhou. The fossil materials were collected from the upper Hauterivian, upper Aptian, and upper Albian of the Lower Cretaceous in the Fujian and Jiangxi Provinces of southeast China. The estimated paleo-CO2 (pCO(2)) was 600-1300 ppmv from the late Hauterivian to the late Albian based on the ratio between the stomatal indices of fossil species P. papillosa and those of four modern nearest living equivalent (NLE) species, using Carboniferous and recent standardizations. The results showed a low value of 595-957 ppmv in the late Hauterivian, and a high value of 805-1292 ppmv in the late Albian, which was only slightly higher than the value of 753-1210 ppmv in the late Aptian. Our calculated CO2 values were consistent with GECORB II, and similar to the previously published estimates of CO2 based on stomata! indices or carbon isotopes. Thus, it could be inferred that the stomatal index of P. papillosa is a potential indicator for estimating the pCO(2) content during the geological history. Furthermore, the global mean land surface temperature (GMLST) was estimated based on the CO2 data. This showed that the change ratios of GMLST increased from 2.8 to 4.7 degrees C in the late Hauterivian to 3.6-5.5 degrees C in the late Albian and 3.8-5.7 degrees C in the late Aptian. It appears that the temperature gradually increased from the early to late Early Cretaceous. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, performance and microbial community dynamics of the AGS were assessed with stepwise increasing influent loads. RESULTSAGS exhibited good structure stability and effective removal efficiency; when the influent load increased from 6.5 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) (0.255 NH4+-N m(-3) d(-1)) to 10.1 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) (0.455 kg NH4+-N m(-3) d(-1)). COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies reached 97.1-97.9% and 84.5-98%, respectively. As indicated from the PCR-DGGE results, the microbial community and dominant species in the AGS also gradually evolved along with the increase of influent loads. A coincidence was observed, namely, three main distinct clusters of the phylogenetic tree appeared respectively in the three stages of influent loads. The microbial diversity attained a maximum in the medium loads stage. The identified bacteria mainly belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The dominant species were responsible for the AGS stability and pollutant removal. CONCLUSIONVariation in the influent load strongly affected the microbial community dynamics, and hence the AGS performance. These results and understanding could lead to potential improvements in guiding AGS wastewater treatment.

However, compared to terrestrial ecosystems, the long-term effects of climate change on species' phenology are poorly understood in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the long-term changes in fish reproductive phenology is essential for predicting population dynamics and for informing management strategies, but is currently hampered by the requirement for intensive field observations and larval identification. In this study, a very low-frequency sampling of juveniles and adults combined with otolith measurements (long axis length of the first annulus; LAFA) of an endemic Tibetan Plateau fish (Gymnocypris selincuoensis) was used to examine changes in reproductive phenology associated with climate changes from the 1970s to 2000s. Assigning individual fish to their appropriate calendar year class was assisted by dendrochronological methods (crossdating). The results demonstrated that LAFA was significantly and positively associated with temperature and growing season length. To separate the effects of temperature and the growing season length on LAFA growth, measurements of larval otoliths from different sites were conducted and revealed that daily increment additions were the main contributor (46.3%), while temperature contributed less (12.0%). Using constructed water-air temperature relationships and historical air temperature records, we found that the reproductive phenology of G.selincuoensis was strongly advanced in the spring during the 1970s and 1990s, while the increased growing season length in the 2000s was mainly due to a delayed onset of winter. The reproductive phenology of G.selincuoensis advanced 2.9days per decade on average from the 1970s to 2000s, and may have effects on recruitment success and population dynamics of this species and other biota in the ecosystem via the food web. The methods used in this study are applicable for studying reproductive phenological changes across a wide range of species and ecosystems.

In this work, Zn(CH3COO)(2)center dot 2H(2)O, Na2S center dot 9H(2)O and thioglycolic acid were used to prepare ZnS quantum dots through a facile water-bath method. The structure and morphology of the ZnS quantum dots were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used to observe the surface morphology of the test paper prepared by a simple dipping-drying process. The Co2+ sensing properties of as-prepared test paper were investigated. And it was found that the color of as-fabricated test paper could change from white to brown within 1 min with addition of Co2+ aqueous solution, which makes it possible for qualitative detection of Co2+ through naked eyes. In this mode, a widely detectable range from 10 to 1000 mg L-1 is reached by the test paper. In addition, through measuring the grey level of the test paper by ordinary smart phone and laptop, a semi-quantitative function of the test paper is realized. Moreover, the as-fabricated paper sensor can resist the interference of a serious cations and anions, and suits for a wide pH surrounding from 1.08 to 9.65, which makes it a promising Co2+ sensor for practical use. In addition, through X-ray diffraction and UV-vis spectra, the sensing properties of as-fabricated test paper are attributed to the chemical reaction between as-prepared ZnS quantum dots and Co2+ ions. And the formation of CoS2 should be responsible for the color change from white to brown. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rh(III) ion imprinted polymer was synthesized by copolymerization of acrylamide-Rh(III) complex and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate according to the precipitation polymerization. Acrylamide acted as both functional monomer and complexing agent to create selective coordination sites in a cross-linked polymer. The ion imprinted carbon paste electrode (IIP-CPE) was prepared by mixing rhodium IIP-nanoparticles and graphite powder in n-eicosane as an adhesive and then embedding them in a Teflon tube. Amperometric i-t curve method was applied as the determination technique. Several parameters, including the functional monomer, molar ratio of template, monomer and cross-linking agent, the amounts of IIP, the applied potential, the buffer solution and pH have been studied. According to the results, IIP-CPE showed a considerably higher response in comparison with the electrode embedded with non-imprinted polymer (NIP), indicating the formation of suitable recognition sites in the IIP structure during the polymerization stage. The introduced electrode showed a linear range of 1.00x10(-8)similar to 3.0x10(-5) mol.L-1 and detection limit of 6.0 nmol.L-1 (S/N = 3). The IIP-CPE was successfully applied for the trace rhodium determination in catalyst and plant samples with RSD of less than 3.3% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 95.5 similar to 102.5%.

Most of the conventional manifold learning methods are subjected to the choice of parameters. In this paper, we present a Regularized Locality Projection based on Sparsity Discriminant Analysis (RLPSD) method for Feature Extraction (FE) to understand the high-dimensional data such as face images. In RLPSD,firstly, we show the sparse representation of training samples by collaborative representation-based classification (CRC). Secondly, the idea of part optimization based on sparse representation is used to ensure the within-class compactness which combines with the labels of measurements and the weights of sparse presentation can be as small as possible. Finally, whole optimization can be directly obtained without the iteration of local optimization. Meanwhile, the separability information of between-class can be well discriminated by scatter matrix which is similar to Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The great recognition performance of the proposed method is verified by comparing with the popular algorithms on Yale, ORL, AR and Extended YaleB face databases and Oxford 102 flowers dataset.

We found that Tb3+ cations can bind to GQDs and display photoluminescence. Excitation dependent experiments show that the Tb3+ emission is stronger at shorter excitation wavelengths, which is likely due to pseudo-isolated small aromatic moieties produced during the synthesis of the GQDs.

Their abundance is therefore closely related to the halo mass function and thus a powerful cosmological probe. However, besides individual massive halos, large-scale structures (LSS) along lines of sight also contribute to the peak signals. In this paper, with ray-tracing simulations, we investigate the LSS projection effects. We show that for current surveys with a large shape noise, the stochastic LSS effects are subdominant. For future WL surveys with source galaxies having a median redshift z(med) similar to 1 or higher, however, they are significant. For the cosmological constraints derived from observed WL high-peak counts, severe biases can occur if the LSS effects are not taken into account properly. We extend the model of Fan et al. by incorporating the LSS projection effects into the theoretical considerations. By comparing with simulation results, we demonstrate the good performance of the improved model and its applicability in cosmological studies.

Here we unveil the intrinsic problem prevailing over different versions and applications, showing that GCaMP containing CaM (calmodulin) interferes with both gating and signaling of L-type calcium channels (Ca(V)1). GCaMP acts as an impaired apoCaM and Ca2+/CaM, both critical to Ca(V)1, which disrupts Ca2+ dynamics and gene expression. We then design and implement GCaMP-X, by incorporating an extra apoCaM-binding motif, effectively protecting Ca(V)1-dependent excitation-transcription coupling from perturbations. GCaMP-X resolves the problems of detrimental nuclear accumulation, acute and chronic Ca2+ dysregulation, and aberrant transcription signaling and cell morphogenesis, while still demonstrating excellent Ca2+-sensing characteristics partly inherited from GCaMP. In summary, CaM/Ca(V)1 gating and signaling mechanisms are elucidated for GCaMP sideeffects, while allowing the development of GCaMP-X to appropriately monitor cytosolic, submembrane or nuclear Ca2+, which is also expected to guide the future design of CaMbased molecular tools.

In this study, we performed a quantitative lysine acetylome analysis on B16 to understand the potential roles of protein lysine acetylation on this host pathogen interaction. Altogether, we identified 529 acetylation sites in 349 proteins, quantified 411 sites in 288 proteins, determined that the acetylation levels of 18 sites were up-regulated and those of 19 sites were down-regulated during pathogenesis. The acetylated proteins mainly participated in metabolic processes, protein synthesis, and cell wall/membrane biogenesis. Moreover, these proteins are involved in more than twenty KEGG pathways. Eight peptide motifs of acetylated proteins were identified, five of which have been thus far found only in the B16 acetylome. Twenty-two acetylated proteins were found to be involved in the synthesis of nematode attractants, and two were found to be involved in the secretion of virulence factors. In addition, the acetylation levels of ten lysine sites were regulated significantly differently in the presence of nematodes. Our results reveal that lysine acetylation may play roles in regulating B16-nematode interaction. Significance: B. nematocida B16 is a bio-control bacterium against nematodes. It lures nematodes to their death by a Trojan horse mechanism. But there is little understanding about the regulation of this "Trojan horse" like pathogenesis. Lysine acetylation was reported to regulate diverse cellular processes. Our results revealed that lysine acetylation played indeed roles in regulating the B16-nematodes interaction. Our data laid a foundation for studying the molecule mechanism of lysine acetylation in regulating this host pathogen interaction.

Spatial co-location pattern mining has been a research hot in recent years. However, maybe the features in a prevalent co-location pattern further have more interesting relationships such as symbiotic relationships, competitive relationships or causal relationships. This paper mines symbiotic relationships implied in prevalent co-location patterns from dynamic spatial databases. Firstly, after analyzing the existed definition of symbiotic patterns, a criterion of judging strong symbiotic patterns is proposed. Secondly, a novel algorithm to mine strong symbiotic patterns from prevalent co-location patterns is presented, named basic algorithm. Third, for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm, an improved algorithm which integrates two expensive operations of the basic algorithm into together, and a pruning strategy with two pruning lemmas are presented. The experiments evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms with "real + synthetic" data sets and the results show that strong symbiotic patterns are more concise and actionable compared to traditional prevalent co-location patterns.

For the nanodots with a fixed outer diameter of d = 580 nm, the switching field H-sw and switching field distribution (SFD) are almost invariant with respect to s. However, the H-sw and SFD for the nanodot arrays could be easily modulated by varying d, which is ascribed to the size effect. In contrast, the H-sw and SFD are strongly dependent on s for the nanorings. Compared to the strongly coupled magnetic moments of the closely-packed nanorings, the magnetostatic interaction among nanodots is negligible, which should be responsible for the observed different magnetization reversal behaviors.

In this work, an extremely simple all TADF WOLED with a single-emissive-layer singe-host/dopant system is demonstrated, by the design of a new TADF material as a dual-role non-doped light-blue emitter and efficient host for a yellow TADF dopant. The carbazole/oxadiazole hybrid compound 2-(2,3,4,5,6-penta(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (5CzOXD) shows bright light-blue TADF emission with a photoluminescence (PL) peak at 496 nm, and a PL quantum yield of 8.6 and 58.2% under ambient conditions and under degassed toluene, respectively. 5CzOXD also exhibits a delayed decay time of 13 s in a PMMA doped film as well as a narrow singlet-triplet bandgap (E-ST) of 0.22 eV. A maximum current efficiency ((c)) and external quantum efficiency ((ext)) of 19.3 cd A(-1) and 9.3% or 12 cd A(-1) and 3.6% are achieved in light blue TADF OLEDs by using 5CzOXD as a doped or non-doped emitter, respectively. A moderately high triplet energy level of 2.58 eV guarantees the application of 5CzOXD as an efficient organic host material for green and yellow TADF OLEDs, with maximum (ext) as high as 16.2 and 17.1%, respectively. In addition, a two-color WOLED with the extremely simple device architecture of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/5CzOXD:4CzPNPh (0.6 wt%, 10 nm)/BmPyPB (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al is subsequently fabricated, which shows maximum (c) and (ext) of 21.5 cd A(-1) and 7.2%, respectively, with CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.44). This simple strategy provides a bright future for constructing low-cost efficient vacuum-deposited WOLEDs based on all organic TADF materials for solid state lighting.

J	Wang, SF; Yue, YT				Wang, Shunfang; Yue, Yaoting			Protein subnuclear localization based on a new effective representation and intelligent kernel linear discriminant analysis by dichotomous greedy genetic algorithm	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; PREDICTING SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER; LOCATION PREDICTION; WEB-SERVER; PSEAAC; PLATFORM; MODES; PLOC	A wide variety of methods have been proposed in protein subnuclear localization to improve the prediction accuracy. However, one important trend of these means is to treat fusion representation by fusing multiple feature representations, of which, the fusion process takes a lot of time. In view of this, this paper novelly proposed a method by combining a new single feature representation and a new algorithm to obtain good recognition rate. Specifically, based on the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), we proposed a new expression, correlation position-specific scoring matrix (CoPSSM) as the protein feature representation. Based on the classic nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm, kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA), we added a new discriminant criterion and proposed a dichotomous greedy genetic algorithm (DGGA) to intelligently select its kernel bandwidth parameter. Two public datasets with Jackknife test and KNN classifier were used for the numerical experiments. The results showed that the overall success rate (OSR) with single representation CoPSSM is larger than that with many relevant representations. The OSR of the proposed method can reach as high as 87.444% and 90.3361% for these two datasets, respectively, outperforming many current methods. To show the generalization of the proposed algorithm, two extra standard datasets of protein subcellular were chosen to conduct the expending experiment, and the prediction accuracy by Jackknife test and Independent test is still considerable.

The precursors were then used to prepare SLMIPs cage (SLM-cage) and SLMIPs core-shell (SLM-core-shell) structures by using a carbon sphere as the template and hydrothermal synthesis, respectively. The structures, morphologies, and surface areas of these materials were determined, as well as their gas-sensing properties and related mechanisms. The SLM-cage and SLM-core-shell samples exhibited good responses to methanol gas, with excellent selectivity. The response and optimum working temperature were 16.98 degrees C and 215 degrees C, 33.7 degrees C and 195 degrees C, respectively, with corresponding response and recovery times of 45 and 50 s (SLM-cage) and 42 and 57 s (SLM-core-shell) for 5 ppm methanol gas. Notably, the SLM-cage and SLM-core-shell samples exhibited lower responses (<= 5 and <= 7, respectively) to other gases, including ethanol, ammonia, benzene, acetone, and toluene. Thus, these materials show potential as practical methanol detectors.

The Properties of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps in the L1495 Dark Cloud	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects (L1495); ISM: molecules; stars: formation	GOULD BELT SURVEY; CLERK MAXWELL TELESCOPE; MOLECULAR CLOUD; STAR-FORMATION; DENSE CORES; SCUBA-2 OBSERVATIONS; PROTOSTELLAR CORES; PRESTELLAR CORES; TAURUS; JCMT	Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) possibly represent the early stages of star formation. To understand better the properties of PGCCs, we studied 16 PGCCs in the L1495 cloud with molecular lines and continuum data from Herschel, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and the PMO 13.7 m telescope. Thirty dense cores were identified in 16 PGCCs from 2D Gaussian fitting. The dense cores have dust temperatures of T-d = 11-14 K, and H-2 column densities of NH2 = (0.36-2.5) x 10(22) cm(-2). We found that not all PGCCs contain prestellar objects. In general, the dense cores in PGCCs are usually at their earliest evolutionary stages. All the dense cores have non-thermal velocity dispersions larger than the thermal velocity dispersions from molecular line data, suggesting that the dense cores may be turbulence-dominated. We have calculated the virial parameter a and found that 14 of the dense cores have alpha < 2, while 16 of the dense cores have alpha > 2. This suggests that some of the dense cores are not bound in the absence of external pressure and magnetic fields. The column density profiles of dense cores were fitted. The sizes of the flat regions and core radii decrease with the evolution of dense cores. CO depletion was found to occur in all the dense cores, but is more significant in prestellar core candidates than in protostellar or starless cores. The protostellar cores inside the PGCCs are still at a very early evolutionary stage, sharing similar physical and chemical properties with the prestellar core candidates.

While conservation reserves have been established and population numbers of the giant panda have recently increased, the interpretation of its genetic diversity remains controversial. Previous analyses, surprisingly, have indicated relatively high levels of genetic diversity raising issues concerning the efficiency and usefulness of reintroducing individuals from captive populations. However, due to a lack of DNA data from fossil specimens, it is unknown whether genetic diversity was even higher prior to the most recent population decline. We amplified complete cytb and 12s rRNA, partial 16s rRNA and NDI, and control region sequences from the mitochondrial genomes of two Holocene panda specimens. We estimated genetic diversity and population demography by analyzing the ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences alongside those from modem giant pandas, as well as from other members of the bear family (Ursidae). Phylogenetic analyses show that one of the ancient haplotypes is sister to all sampled modern pandas and the second ancient individual is nested among the modern haplotypes, suggesting that genetic diversity may indeed have been higher earlier during the Holocene. Bayesian skyline plot analysis supports this view and indicates a slight decline in female effective population size starting around 6000 years B.P., followed by a recovery around 2000 years ago. Therefore, while the genetic diversity of the giant panda has been affected by recent habitat contraction, it still harbors substantial genetic diversity. Moreover, while its still low population numbers require continued conservation efforts, there seem to be no immediate threats from the perspective of genetic evolutionary potential.

However, formal mixed-criticality models have traditionally been characterized by two impractical assumptions: once any high-criticality task overruns, all low-criticality tasks are suspended and all other high-criticality tasks are assumed to exhibit high-criticality behaviors at the same time. In this paper, we propose a more realistic mixed-criticality model, called the flexible mixed-criticality (FMC) model, in which these two issues are addressed in a combined manner. In this new model, only the overrun task itself is assumed to exhibit high-criticality behavior, while other high-criticality tasks remain in the same mode as before. The guaranteed service levels of low-criticality tasks are gracefully degraded with the overruns of high-criticality tasks. We derive a utilization-based technique to analyze the schedulability of this new mixed-criticality model under EDF-VD scheduling. During run time, the proposed test condition serves an important criterion for dynamic service level tuning, by means of which the maximum available execution budget for low-criticality tasks can be directly determined with minimal overhead while guaranteeing mixed-criticality schedulability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the FMC scheme compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

Similar to closed frequent itemset mining, closed co-location pattern (CCP) mining was proposed for losslessly condensing large collections of prevalent co-location patterns. However, the state-of-the-art condensation methods in mining CCP are inspired by closed frequent itemset mining and do not consider the intrinsic characteristics of spatial co-locations, e.g., the participation index and ratio in spatial feature interactions, thus causing serious containment issues in CCP mining. In this paper, we propose a novel loss less condensed representation of prevalent co-location patterns, Super Participation Index closed (SPI-closed) co-location. An efficient SPI-closed Miner is also proposed to effectively capture the nature of spatial co-location patterns, alongside the development of three additional pruning strategies to make the SPI-closed Miner efficient. This method captures richer feature interactions in spatial co-locations and solves the containment issues in existing CCP methods.

The results of analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that KC 198(T) was most closely related to Actinorectispora indica YIM 75728(T) (98.4 %). Aerial hyphae differentiated into long, straight chains of cylindrical spores. Growth was observed at 10-45 degrees C (optimum 28 degrees C), with 0-10% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, in the absence of NaCl) and at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). KC 198(T) possessed MK-9(H-4) as the predominant respiratory quinone and a minor amount of MK-10(H-4). Polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. Three unidentified lipids were also detected. The main cellular fatty acids were iso-C-16 : 0 (30.9 %), iso-C16 : 1H (22.9 %) and iso-C-15 : 0 (14.8 %). The genomic DNA G+C content was 66.8 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, we propose that strain KC 198(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinorectispora. The name Actinorectispora metalli sp. nov. is, therefore, proposed for the novel species with the type strain KC 198(T) (= CCTCC AA 2015043(T) = KCTC 39718(T)). The description of the genus Actinorectispora has also been emended.

The morphology of oligoanilines was controlled from hollow to hard microspheres, by simply changing the volumes of alkaline medium. SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR and physical adsorption of nitrogen were used to characterize the products. Hexavalent chromium ion uptake experiments were run with these aniline oligomers. RESULTS: Adsorption experiments showed that the removal of chromium ions was strongly dependent on the initial pH of the solution. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models were well correlated with the experimental data. The adsorption of Cr(VI) and synergistic reduction to Cr(III) were confirmed by analyzing remnant chromium in the liquid and XPS detection of the exhausted adsorbent. A redox/pseudo-protonation process was suggested as the mechanism to explain the Cr(VI) removal. The adsorbed chromium ions could be desorbed by NaOH solution. The higher desorption efficiency of 96.2% was achieved by using 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH as the desorption agent. CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the hollow microsphere were the most effective adsorbent of the three adsorbents and its removal efficiency reached 99% to remove 60 mg L-1 Cr(VI). The facile fabrication, efficient removal of Cr(VI) and simple regeneration offered an option to remove Cr(VI) contamination from natural water and industrial wastewater.

Investigation of the leaves and twigs of Callicarpa bodinieri resulted in the isolation of nine new abietane diterpenoids, bodinieric acids A-I (1-9), along with six known compounds (10-15). The structures of 1-9 were elucidated on the basis of the interpretation of their HRESIMS and NMR data and by ECD calculations. To explore the potential therapeutic target of this plant for immune-mediated disease, the inhibitory activities of the isolates obtained were determined against 13 kinase enzymes. Eight compounds exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and the IC50 values of compounds 2 and 6 were 7.2 and 10.7 mu M, respectively. In addition, a preliminary structure-activity relationship of this scaffold was analyzed with both molecular docking and a 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model.

Recently, some of the works have explored neural networks to do an in-depth understanding of textual item content and achieved impressive effectiveness by generating more accurate item latent models. Nevertheless, there remains an open issue as how to effectively exploit description documents of both users and items in matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed dual-regularized matrix factorization with deep neural networks (DRMF) to deal with this issue. DRMF adopts a multilayered neural network model by stacking convolutional neural network and gated recurrent neural network, to generate independent distributed representations of contents of users and items. Then, representations serve to regularize the generation of latent models both for users and items in matrix factorization. We propose the corresponding algorithm for learning all parameters in DRMF. Experimental results proved that the dual-way regularization strategy significantly improves the matrix factorization methods on the accuracy of rating prediction and the recall of top-n recommendations. Also, as the components of DRMF, the new neural network model works better than the single convolutional neural network model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The gold orebodies are restricted to the Emeishan basaltic rocks and the interlayer fractures between the Emeishan basaltic rocks and the limestone of the Maokou Formation. Three generations of pyrite (Py0, Py1, and Py2) have been recognized in these deposits based on morphology and paragenetic relationships. Electron microprobe (EMP), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and laser-ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) analyses were carried out to characterize their chemical and sulfur isotopic compositions. The framboidal Py0 is enriched in As but depleted in most of the other trace elements. It has negative delta S-34 values of -14.5-1.9 parts per thousand, which are typical of diagenetic pyrites resulted from bacterial reduction of marine sulfate. Pyl and arsenopyrite exhibit high concentrations of Au and As, making them the most dominant auriferous minerals. They yield comparable delta S-34 values of -2.8- + 2.1 parts per thousand, consistent with the derivation of sulfur from the Emeishan basaltic rocks. Py2 is characterized by well developed oscillatory-zoned textures, that are interpreted in terms of internal self-organization processes. It contains low concentrations of Au and highly variable concentrations of As, Sb, Co, and Ni. The Py2 grains show slightly positive delta S-34 values of + 0.4- + 7.0 parts per thousand, indicating that the sulfur was mainly sourced from the Emeishan basaltic rocks with variable amounts of contamination from reduced marine sulfate. The Emeishan basaltic rocks may have provided not only ore-hosting space but also Au, S, and other associated elements for gold mineralization in the Lianhuashan ore field. Similar gold deposits are expected to be discovered in the areas of Emeishan basaltic rocks with high Au backgrounds and small thicknesses.

Woody evergreen plants inhabiting cold desert ecosystems must retain their foliage amidst chronically dry conditions and large seasonal temperature variations. To understand the strategies enabling survival of evergreens in these environments, we monitored seasonal changes in foliar gas exchange and photosynthetic traits of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen broadleaved shrub native to the cold desert of northwestern China. We found that photosynthesis was relatively higher in spring and summer and lower in fall and winter. Transitioning from spring to summer, A. mongolicus maintained high photosynthetic capacity (A (max)). Transitioning into fall, the A (max) and maximum stomatal conductance (g (smax)) decreased, while the relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (L (s)) increased. In winter, A. mongolicus decreased A (max), maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)), maximum RuBisCo carboxylation rates (V (cmax)), maximum RuBP regeneration rates (J (max)), and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) relative to other seasons. Collectively, these results suggest that A. mongolicus adapts physiologically to maximize carbon assimilation during spring and summer, and to maximize foliar resistance to cold stress at the expense of photosynthesis in winter. Foliage was protected against photo-oxidative damage during temperature extremes in winter by dark-sustained thermal energy dissipation. Overall, our study reveals that multiple photosynthetic adjustments, varying among the seasons, enable the survival of cold desert evergreens.

An algorithm with better capabilities to resist cropping and combined attacks, as well as having a larger embedding capacity, is proposed. Feature points from the attacked image are obtained with the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm. Then, they are matched with a few feature points obtained from the watermarked image. The matching point pairs are used to estimate the affine matrix, and then the geometric attacks are corrected by the inverse affine transform. Some positioning watermarks are embedded in the spatial domain to improve the accuracy of the resynchronization. Finally, the watermark is encoded by the fountain code such that the anti-cropping performance of the algorithm can be improved. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has a larger embedding capacity but also is resistant to many kinds of attacks.

To examine such changes, this paper analyzed the effect of the reservoir in the head area of the Xiluodu hydropower station based on the temperature data of MODIS MYD11A2. The temperature differences (TD) between various locations in the study area and the reservoir were calculated to explore the TD in different seasons. The reservoir effect change intensity (RECI) was established to explore the impact of the reservoir on local weather changes in different flood seasons. The combination of the TD and RECI was applied to explore the role of the hydropower station in regulating the temperature of the surrounding reservoir. The results showed the following: (1) after hydropower station construction (HSC), the TD in the valleys decreased and the TD in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season; (2) the RECI had different distribution characteristics in different flood seasons of the reservoir, and the RECI was stronger in the wet season than that in the dry season; and (3) unlike in the plains, cooling and warming effects existed simultaneously in different parts of the mountains.

Recently, perennial rice was reported to successfully survive, regrow, and yield across a diverse range of environments in Southern China and Laos, with perennial rice PR23 being identified as a prime candidate for release to farmers. This paper reports the evaluation of PR23 for release, by (1) comparing its survival, regrowth, performance, and adaptation with preferred annual rices across nine ecological regions in southern Yunnan Province of China; (2) examining the economic costs and benefits of perennial versus annual rice there; and (3) discussing the evidence for the release of PR23 as a broadly adapted and acceptable cultivar for farmers. Overall, the grain yield of PR23 was similar to those of the preferred annual rice cultivars RD23 and HXR7, but the economic analysis indicated substantial labour savings for farmers by growing the perennial instead of the annual. PR23 was comparable to the annuals in phenology, plant height, grain yield, and grain size, and was acceptable in grain and cooking quality. Farmers were keen to grow it because of reduced costs and especially savings in labour. PR23 is proposed for release to farmers because of its comparable grain yields to annual rices, its acceptable grain and milling quality, its cost and labour savings, and the likely benefits to soil stability and ecological sustainability, along with more flexible farming systems.

The accuracy and quality of two widely used datasets, the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets to force the SWAT model (CMADS), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP), were evaluated in this paper. The accuracy of daily precipitation, max/min temperature, relative humidity and wind speed from CMADS and CFSR are firstly evaluated by comparing them with results obtained from 131 meteorological stations in the TP. Statistical results show that most elements of CMADS are superior to those of CFSR. The average correlation coefficient (R) between the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature of CMADS and CFSR ranged from 0.93 to 0.97. The root mean square error (RMSE) for CMADS and CFSR ranged from 3.16 to 3.18 degrees C, and ranged from 5.19 degrees C to 8.14 degrees C respectively. The average R of precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed for CMADS are 0.46; 0.88 and 0.64 respectively, while they are 0.43, 0.52, and 0.37 for CFSR. Gridded observation data is obtained using the professional interpolation software, ANUSPLIN. Meteorological elements from three gridded data have a similar overall distribution but have a different partial distribution. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate hydrological processes in the Yellow River Source Basin of the TP. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) of CMADS+SWAT in calibration and validation period are 0.78 and 0.68 for the monthly scale respectively, which are better than those of CFSR+SWAT and OBS+SWAT in the Yellow River Source Basin. The relationship between snowmelt and other variables is measured by GeoDetector. Air temperature, soil moisture, and soil temperature at 1.038 m has a greater influence on snowmelt than others.

Strain EGI 6500139(T) formed sparse aerial mycelium with rod-like spores. Whole-cell hydrolysates of the isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the cell-wall diamino acid, glucose as major sugar, and mannose, galactose, xylose and ribose as minor sugars. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, one unidentified glycolipid, one unidentified phospholipid and four unidentified polar lipids. The major fatty acids identified were anteiso-C-17:0, anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The predominant menaquinones detected were MK-11 and MK-11(H-2). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain EGI 6500139(T) was 70.4 mol%. Strain EGI 6500139(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Glycomyces lacisalsi XHU 5089(T) (96.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain EGI 6500139(T) fell within the Glade of the genus Glycomyces, and formed a Glade with G. lacisalsi XHU 5089(T) and G. albus CCTCC AA 2013004(T). Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain EGI 6500139(T) represents a novel species of the genus Glycomyces, for which the name Glycomyces anabasis sp. nov. (type strain EGI 6500139(T)=JCM 30088(T)=KCTC 29495(T)) is proposed.

Notably, this protocol features improved energy efficiency, broad isothiourea substrate scope, easily available starting materials, and high atom efficiency and applicability toward gram-scale synthesis. Additionally, the target compounds were evaluated for the cytotoxic effect against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT116 and HT29), human gastric cancer (SGC-7901), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells, and it was found that these compounds have excellent antitumor activities. Among them, compound 3e was found to be one of the most potent derivatives with IC50 values lower than 9.44 mu M against five human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP). Furthermore, for the first time, the fluorinated 2-alkylthio-substituted 4-aminoquinazolines were identified as phosphatase CDC25B inhibitors.

Expression of new genes in early development raises the possibility that new genes could originate and be recruited for functions in embryonic development, but this remains undocumented. Here, based on temporal gene expression at different developmental stages in Xenopus tropicalis, we found that young protein-coding genes were significantly enriched for expression in developmental stages occurring after the midblastula transition (MBT), and displayed a decreasing trend in abundance in the subsequent stages after MBT. To complement the finding, we demonstrate essential functional attributes of a young orphan gene, named as Fog2, in morphological development. Our data indicate that new genes could originate after MBT and be recruited for functions in embryonic development, and thus provide insights for better understanding of the origin, evolution, and function of new genes.

Although synergistic action between these two neurotransmitters has been found, their functional roles remain unclear. Here, low dose morphine (2.5mg/kg) and low dose dopamine receptor agonists (apomorphine 0.05mg/kg; SKF38393 0.01mg/kg; bromocriptine 0.05mg/kg), which have no effects on spatial recognition memory, were injected intraperitoneally into mice 30minutes before a memory test in a two-trial recognition Y-maze. The Y-maze is based on the innate tendency of rodents to explore novel environments and is therefore suitable for exploring the effects of morphine on learning and memory. Our results showed that both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor agonists dose-dependently impaired the retrieval of spatial recognition memory in the Y-maze, and co-administration of memory ineffective doses of apomorphine (0.05mg/kg), SKF38393 (0.01mg/kg), or bromocriptine (0.05mg/kg) and of morphine (2.5mg/kg) resulted in impaired spatial recognition memory retrieval in mice. These findings suggest the existence of interactions between morphine and dopamine receptor agonists in memory processing and that activation of the dopamine system might contribute to morphine-induced impairment of memory, which could provide insight into human addiction.

Identification of Potential Biomarkers from Aconitum carmichaelii, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, Using a Metabolomic Approach	PLANTA MEDICA			English	Article						Aconitum; Aconitum carmichaelii; Ranunculaceae; aconitum alkaloids; diterpene alkaloids; analgesic activity; acute toxicity; traditional Chinese medicine; TCM	MS-BASED METABOLOMICS; ALKALOIDS; ROOT; CHROMATOGRAPHY; DEBEAUX; FUZI	Despite their well-known toxicity, Aconitum species are important traditional medicines worldwide. Aconitum carmichaelii, known in Chinese as ?? (fuzi), is an officially recognized traditional Chinese medicine with characteristic analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, whose principal pharmacological ingredients are considered as aconitine-type diterpene alkaloids. Notwithstanding the long-recorded use of A.carmichaelii in traditional Chinese medicine, no single-entity aconitum alkaloid drug has been developed for clinical use. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to investigate the marker compounds that can be used to differentiate A.carmichaelii from seven other Aconitum species collected in Yunnan Province. Nontargeted principle component analysis scores plots found that all the tested Aconitum species clustered into three distinct groups, and A.carmichaelii was significantly different chemically than the other seven species. Furthermore, the primary and lateral roots of A.carmichaelii also showed significant differences. Using orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis analysis, eight marker compounds were identified, including 14-acetylkarakoline, aconitine, carmichaeline, fuziline, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, neoline, and talatisamine. Four of these aconitum alkaloids, fuziline, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, and neoline, showed significant analgesic activity in a dose-dependent manner compared to the negative and positive controls. However, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, and neoline exhibited significant acute toxicity activity, while fuziline showed no acute toxicity in mice, suggesting the relative safety of this alkaloid. This study provides a good example of how to differentiate an authentic medicinal plant from common adulterants using a metabolomics approach, and to identify compounds that may be developed into new drugs.

In this paper, however, we introduce a new synergy punishment mechanism into a spatial public good game which is different from the previous works, every cooperator has a probability to be a punisher, additionally if punishment is carried out by several punishers, the cost of punishment will be reduced by synergistic effect. The simulation results show that punishment can promote cooperation and the synergistic effect has an obvious influence on cooperation for a small punishment fine but has little influence for a big punishment fine.

The damping constant of bulk gold layer is optimized to eliminate the adverse effects of the grain boundary and the surface scattering of thin films on the absorption property. Two absorption peaks (A1 = 58%, A2 = 23%) are achieved based on the localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes resonance. Moreover, the plasmonic hybridization phenomenon between LSP modes is found, which leads to the absorption enhancement between two absorption peaks. The proposed metamaterial absorber holds the property of wide-angle incidence.

The study of prominence oscillations provides an alternative way to investigate their internal magnetic and thermal structures because the characteristics of the oscillations depend on their interplay with the solar corona. Prominence oscillations can be classified into longitudinal and transverse types. We perform three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prominence oscillations along a magnetic flux rope, with the aim of comparing the oscillation periods with those predicted by various simplified models and examining the restoring force. We find that the longitudinal oscillation has a period of about 49 minutes, which is in accordance with the pendulum model where the field-aligned component of gravity serves as the restoring force. In contrast, the horizontal transverse oscillation has a period of about 10 minutes and the vertical transverse oscillation has a period of about 14 minutes, and both of them can be nicely fitted with a two-dimensional slab model. We also find that the magnetic tension force dominates most of the time in transverse oscillations, except for the first minute when magnetic pressure overwhelms it.	[Zhou, Yu-Hao; Fang, C.; Chen, P.

Several necessary and/or sufficient conditions are given to ensure these constraint qualifications. It is proved that basic constraint qualification and strong basic constraint qualification for convex generalized equations can be obtained by these constraint qualifications, and the existing results on constraint qualifications for the inequality system can be deduced from the given conditions in this paper. The main work of this paper is an extension of the study on constraint qualifications from inequality systems to generalized equations.

Stomatal development is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other developmental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as too many mouths-1 and stomatal density and distribution1-1) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal development. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal development. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal development. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal development is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal development of the myc2 myc3 myc4 triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal development in Arabidopsis cotyledons.

It is revealed that the SnO2 QDs is about 3 nm in size to form clusters. The gas sensor based on SnO2 QDs shows a high potential for detecting low-ppm-level butane at 400 degrees C, exhibiting a high sensitivity, short response and rapid recovery time, and effective selectivity. The sensing mechanism is understood in terms of adsorbed oxygen species. Significantly, the excellent sensing performance is attributed to the smaller size of -SnO2 and larger surface area (204.85 m(2)/g).

The experimental results indicate that, with the increase in annealing temperature, the volume of Ge QDs increases monotonically, while the QD density initially increases then decreases. The maximal QD density can reach 1.1 x 10(11) cm(-2) after a 10 min annealing at 650 degrees C. The Ge-Ge peak of Ge QDs obtained by Raman spectroscopy initially undergoes a blue shift and then a red shift with increasing annealing temperature. This behavior results from the competition between the dislocation and the strain relaxation in QDs. Concurrently, a series of photoelectric detectors are fabricated to evaluate the photoelectric performance of these annealed Ge QD samples. A high-photoelectricity response is demonstrated in the QD sample annealed at 650 degrees C. Our results pave a promising way for whole-silicon-material optical-electronic integration based on a simple and practicable fabrication method.

NOV.; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES; LIPIDS; TREES	A novel Gram-staining positive, moderately halophilic, endospore-forming, motile, rod-shaped and strictly aerobic strain, designated YIM 93565(T), was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang province of China and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain YIM 93565(T) grew in the range of pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), 10-45 A degrees C (optimum 35-40 A degrees C) and at salinities of 2-24% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 7-10%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM 93565(T) clustered with members of the genera Gracilibacillus and form a clade with Gracilibacillus bigeumensis KCTC 13130(T) (95.6% similarity) and Gracilibacillus halophilus DSM 17856(T) (94.9%), which was well separated from others. The DNA G + C content of this novel strain was 36.8 mol%. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, C-16:0 and anteiso-C-17:0 and its polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid and two unidentified phospholipids. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was based on meso-diaminopimelic acid. Based on the results of phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic comparative analyses, the isolate is assigned to a novel species of the genus Gracilibacillus, for which the name Gracilibacillus eburneus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain YIM 93565(T) (= DSM 23710(T) = CCTCC AB 2013249(T)).

The harvested tubers then overwinter and are planted again the next spring for flowering and seeds. FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a MADS-box transcription factor that acts as a major repressor of floral transition by suppressing the flowering promoters FT and SOC1. Here we show that vernalization effectively represses tuber formation and promotes flowering in Tibetan turnip. We functionally characterized four FLC homologues (BrrFLC1, FLC2, FLC3, and FLC5), and found that BrrFLC2 and BrrFLC1 play a major role in repressing flowering in turnip and in transgenic Arabidopsis. In contrast, tuber formation was correlated with BrrFLC1 expression in the hypocotyl and was repressed under cold treatment following the quantitative downregulation of BrrFLC1. Grafting experiments of non-vernalized and vernalized turnips revealed that vernalization independently suppressed tuberization in the tuber or hypocotyl of the rootstock or scion, which occurred in parallel with the reduction in BrrFLC1 activity. Together, our results demonstrate that the Tibetan turnip is highly responsive to cold exposure, which is associated with the expression levels of BrrFLC genes.

Here, 28 BrrOPT genes were identified in the turnip. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two well-supported clades in the OPT family, containing 15 BrrOPTs and 13 BrrYSLs. The exon/intron structure of OPT clade are conserved but the yellow stripe-like (YSL) clade was different. The exon/intron of the YSL clade possesses structural differences, whereas the YSL class motifs structure are conserved. The OPT genes are distributed unevenly among the chromosomes of the turnip genome. Phylogenetic and chromosomal distribution analyses revealed that the expansion of the OPT gene family is mainly attributable to segmental duplication. For the expression profiles at different developmental stages, a comprehensive analysis provided insights into the possible functional divergence among members of the paralog OPT gene family. Different expression levels under a variety of ion deficiencies also indicated that the OPT family underwent functional divergence during long-term evolution. Furthermore, BrrOPT8.1, BrrYSL1.2, BrrYSL1.3, BrrYSL6 and BrrYSL9 responded to Fe(II) treatments and BrrYSL7 responded to calcium treatments, BrrYSL6 responded to multiple treatments in root, suggesting that turnip OPTs may be involved in mediating cross-talk among different ion deficiencies. Our data provide important information for further functional dissection of BrrOPTs, especially in transporting metal ions and nutrient deficiency stress adaptation.

However, it is unclear whether PDRs are involved in Nicotiana attenuata resistance to the necrotic fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata. In this study, transcriptional levels of both NaPDR1 and NaPDR1-like were highly induced in N. attenuata leaves after A. alternata inoculation. Interestingly, silencing NaPDR1 or NaPDR1-like individually had little effect on N. attenuata resistance to A. alternata; however, when both genes were co-silenced plants became highly susceptible to the fungus, which was associated with elevated JA and ethylene responses. Neither NaPDR1 nor NaPDR1-like was significantly elicited by exogenous treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), whereas both were highly induced by ethylene. The elicitation levels of both genes by A. alternata were significantly reduced in plants with impaired JA or ethylene signaling pathways. Thus, we conclude that both NaPDR1 and NaPDR1-like function redundantly to confer resistance against A. alternata in N. attenuata, and the elicitation of the transcripts of both genes by the fungus is partially dependent on ethylene and jasmonate signaling.

Optimal growth of strain YIM 98012(T) was observed at 37 A degrees C and pH 7.0 and it was found to grow in the presence of 5-20% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10% NaCl). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the novel strain is affiliated with the family Bacillaceae of the phylum Firmicutes and that it shares high (94.7%) sequence similarity with Alteribacillus persepolensis DSM 21632(T) and does not show sequence similarities of more than 94.0% to known members of other related genera. The major fatty acids (> 10%) were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-16:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 41.0 mol% and the dominated respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7. The cell wall peptidoglycan of strain YIM 98012(T) was found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, while the polar lipids profile was found to include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. Based on physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain YIM 98012(T) is concluded to be the type strain of the type species of a novel genus in the family Bacillaceae for which the name Aidingibacillus halophilus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 98012(T) (= KCTC 33868(T) = DSM 104332(T)).

With a geometric (two-pole caustic) model and a physical outer gap model (revised 3D outer gap model) in a three dimensional (3D) retarded magnetic dipole with a perturbation magnetic field, the observed features of these MSPs are studied. In order to obtained the best-fitting model parameters, the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is used and reasonable GeV band light curves for three MSPs are given. Our calculations indicate that MSPs emit high energy photons with smaller inclination angles (alpha approximate to 10 degrees-50 degrees), larger view angles (zeta approximate to 65 degrees-100 degrees), and smaller perturbation factor (epsilon approximate to -0.15-0.1). Note that the factor epsilon, describing the strength of the perturbed magnetic field, is all less than zero in these two models, so the magnetic field caused by current-induced play a leading role in the pulsed location of MSPs.

Our proposed ensemble features in a bi-weighting scheme in the process of examining each partition and optimizing consensus function on these input partitions in accordance with their level of importance. Within our proposed scheme, the multiple partitions, generated by HMM-based K-models under different initializations, are optimally re-consolidated into a representation of bi-weighted hypergraph, and the final consensus partition is generated and optimized via the agglomerative clustering algorithm in association with a dendrogram-based similarity partitioning (DSPA). In comparison with the existing state of the arts, our proposed approach not only achieves the advantage that the number of clusters can be automatically determined, but also the superior clustering performances on a range of temporal datasets, including synthetic dataset, time series benchmark, and real-world motion trajectory datasets.

The variation of the film morphology, the crystalline structure, the cationic distributions and the optical properties are reported and explained by the variation of the film growth rate. Scanning electron microscopy results indicate that a too fast growth rate of the film results in dense surface defects or the degradation of the film crystallinity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that oxygen defects are almost inevitable in such thin films deposited by RF sputtering. At a moderate (120 W) sputtering power the Mn2+ content increases 10-20% and the Mn4+ content is accordingly reduced. The detailed cationic configuration is proposed, where Zn2+ ions occupy both the tetrahedral site and the octahedral site. Raman and spectroscopic results allows asserting the relation between Mn valence states and the sputtering power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Each of the dark and light layers are considered as deposited synchronously throughout the deeper (> 500 m) part of the sea. However, attempts for correlation and age estimation of individual layers are limited to the upper few tens of meters. In addition, the exact timing of the depositional onset of these dark and light layers and its synchronicity throughout the deeper part of the sea have not been explored previously, although the onset timing was roughly estimated as similar to 1.5 Ma based on the result of Ocean Drilling Program legs 127/128. Consequently, it is not certain exactly when their deposition started, whether deposition of dark and light layers was synchronous and whether they are correlatable also in the earlier part of their depositional history. The Quaternary hemipelagic sediments of the Japan Sea were drilled at seven sites during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 346 in 2013. Alternation of dark and light layers was recovered at six sites whose water depths are > similar to 900 m, and continuous composite columns were constructed at each site. Here, we report our effort to correlate individual dark layers and estimate their ages based on a newly constructed age model at Site U1424 using the best available paleomagnetic datum and marker tephras. The age model is further tuned to LR04 delta O-18 curve using gamma ray attenuation density (GRA) since it reflects diatom contents that are higher during interglacial high-stands. The constructed age model for Site U1424 is projected to other sites using correlation of dark layers to form a high-resolution and high-precision paleo-observatory network that allows to reconstruct changes in material fluxes with high spatio-temporal resolutions.

The comparisons between the exact treatment results and the ones of the equivalent photon approximation approach are expressed as the Q(2) (the virtuality of photon) and p(T) distributions. The method developed by Martin and Ryskin is used for avoiding double counting when the coherent and incoherent contributions are considered simultaneously. The numerical results indicate that the equivalent photon approximation is only effective in small Q(2) region and can be used for coherent photoproduction processes with proper choice of Q(max)(2) (the choices Q(max)(2) similar to (s) over cap or infinity will cause obvious errors), but cannot be used for incoherent photoproduction processes. The exact treatment is needed to deal accurately with the photoproduction of large p(T) dileptons and photons.

However, blue ones still remain a challenge on account of their relatively dissatisfactory Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and low efficiency. After analyzing the reported blue iridium complexes in the literature, a new deep-blue-emitting iridium complex with improved photoluminescence quantum yield is designed and synthesized. By rational screening host materials showing high triplet energy level in neat film as well as the OLED architecture to balance electron and hole recombination, highly efficient deep-blue-emission OLEDs with a CIE at (0.15, 0.11) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 22.5% are demonstrated. Based on the transition dipole moment vector measurement with a variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry method, the ultrahigh EQE is assigned to a preferred horizontal dipole orientation of the iridium complex in doped film, which is beneficial for light extraction from the OLEDs.

Not only can this new type of neural networks unify discrete, continuous and q-difference analysis, but also it initiates an original idea of slight vibration in time variables of neural networks to precisely describe the double almost periodicity for the status of neural networks. Moreover, a new timescale functional is established and some new Lyapunov functional on time scales are constructed to obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence and psi-exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for this new type of high-order Hopfield neural networks with variable delays. Finally, several numerical examples with simulation are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our results. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To solve these problems, we demonstrate a water-based method for the synthesis of ultrasmall Pd clusters with an average size of 2.5 nm uniformly dispersed on single-walled carbon nanohorns functionalized by para-sulfonated calix[8]arene (SCX8-SWCNHs) at room temperature without organic solvents. The high dispersibility of the 2.5 nm Pd clusters is caused by the large amount of SCX8 (with many negative charges of -SO3-) on SWCNHs. The large amount of negative charges from -SO3- enhances the interactions between the supports and metal precursors, resulting in the in situ growth of the highly dispersed Pd clusters. The Pd@SCX8-SWCNHs nanocatalyst exhibits increased catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol when compared with that of the Pd/C catalyst in alkaline media, which is ascribed to the high dispersity and ultrafine properties of the Pd clusters. This simple and facile approach has major importance for the preparation of electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic activity on suitable supports.

Rapid Global Spread of wRi-like Wolbachia across Multiple Drosophila	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETICS; POPULATION GENOMICS; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; SEQUENCING DATA; DNA-SEQUENCES; SIMULANS; INFECTION	Maternally transmitted Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, and Cardinium bacteria are common in insects [1], but their interspecific spread is poorly understood. Endosymbionts can spread rapidly within host species by manipulating host reproduction, as typified by the global spread of wRi Wolbachia observed in Drosophila simulans [2, 3]. However, because Wolbachia cannot survive outside host cells, spread between distantly related host species requires horizontal transfers that are presumably rare [4-7]. Here, we document spread of wRi-like Wolbachia among eight highly diverged Drosophila hosts (10-50 million years) over only about 14,000 years (5,000-27,000). Comparing 110 wRi-like genomes, we find % 0.02% divergence from the wRi variant that spread rapidly through California populations of D. simulans. The hosts include both globally invasive species (D. simulans, D. suzukii, and D. ananassae) and narrowly distributed Australian endemics (D. anomalata and D. pandora) [8]. Phylogenetic analyses that include mtDNA genomes indicate introgressive transfer of wRi-like Wolbachia between closely related species D. ananassae, D. anomalata, and D. pandora but no horizontal transmission within species. Our analyses suggest D. ananassae as the Wolbachia source for the recent wRi invasion of D. simulans and D. suzukii as the source of Wolbachia in its sister species D. subpulchrella. Although six of these wRi-like variants cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, two cause no detectable reproductive effects, indicating that pervasive mutualistic effects [9, 10] complement the reproductive manipulations for which Wolbachia are best known. "Super spreader" variants like wRi may be particularly useful for controlling insect pests and vector-borne diseases with Wolbachia transinfections [11].

The codon usage effect on protein expression was thought to be mainly due to its impact on translation. Here, we show that transcription termination is an important driving force for codon usage bias in eukaryotes. Using Neurospora crassa as a model organism, we demonstrated that introduction of rare codons results in premature transcription termination (PTT) within open reading frames and abolishment of full-length mRNA. PTT is a wide-spread phenomenon in Neurospora, and there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and PTT events. Rare codons lead to the formation of putative poly(A) signals and PTT. A similar role for codon usage bias was also observed in mouse cells. Together, these results suggest that codon usage biases co-evolve with the transcription termination machinery to suppress premature termination of transcription and thus allow for optimal gene expression.

Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (Type-2 FS) have a good prospect in image fusion field, because it can effectively address the uncertain and fuzzy problem in image fusion for selecting the high-quality pixels or coefficients of source images. We try to extend the application fields of Type-2 FS and improve the performance of MSIF; therefore, this paper presents a hybrid method by combining the local spatial frequency (LSF) with interval Type-2 FS in nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain. NSST is used to decompose source images, and interval Type-2 FS and LSF is employed to extract the regional features of source images; so it can extract and fuse the detailed features of different source images accurately. First, NSST is performed to decompose the source images into low frequency and high frequency sub-images. Second, LSF-based fusion rule is applied to fuse low frequency sub-images. Thirdly, a novel fusion process based on interval Type-2 FS is designed to fuse high frequency sub-images. At last, inverse NSST2 (INSST) is implemented to reconstruct the fused images. The experimental and contrastive results of different image sets show that the proposed method is an effective MSIF scheme, which can achieve better fusion effect than the existing representative methods.

Two kinds of liquid crystal compounds, which have the structures of biphenyl with C equivalent to C or CF2O moiety as a linkage group, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer(GC-MS). The results show that the spectra of the compounds are obtained by remarkable odd electron radical ion peaks and doubly charged fragment ion peaks, so the cleavage pathways were similar for the two kinds of compounds. We noted a sequential loss of alkyl, alkyl, or phenoxyl radicals under electron impact, which seems to be frequent in the case of liquid crystal compounds. The achievement of a higher degree of aromaticity may be the driving force for these processes. For the alkyl biphenyl compounds with CF2O central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the alkyl carbon-carbon bond is initiated by the loss of alkyl radical via the a-cleavage, followed by the the losing of the other alkyl radical by sigma bond cleavage, i.e., i-sigma cleavage. For the alkyl biphenyl compounds with CF2O central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond is initiated by the loss of phenoxyl radical via the i-cleavage, followed by the losing of the other alkyl radical by sigma bond cleavage, i.e., i-sigma cleavage. For the biphenyl compounds with double CF2 O central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond is initiated by the loss of phenoxyl radical via the i-cleavage, followed by the losing of the other phenoxyl radical by sigma bond cleavage, i.e., alpha-sigma cleavage. The obtained results suggest the reason of sigma-bond breakage, which should be caused by an internal conversion (IC). Generally, doubly charged ions are found in the electron ionization (EI) mass spectra of hydrocarbons, but the intensities of them are weak and cannot be used in chemical analyses. In contrast, in this paper we showed two kinds of liquid crystal compounds, as interesting examples, which can eliminate two internal alkyl or phenoxyl groups as radicals and yield the most abundant doubly charged ions in their EI mass spectrum by alpha alpha/i alpha or ii cleavage reactions. As an example, the DFT method is adopted to simulating the cleavage pathway of compound 2d. A conclusion can be draw that the proposed fragmentation mechanism is agreed by both experimental data and theoretical research.

Genome-wide association studies were conducted for seed composition, including protein, oil, fatty acids, and amino acids, using 313 diverse soybean germplasm accessions genotyped with a high-density SNP array. A total of 87 chromosomal regions were identified to be associated with seed composition, explaining 8%-89% of genetic variances. The candidate genes GmSAT1, AK-HSDH, SACPD-C, and FAD3A of known function, and putative MtN21 nodulin, FATB, and steroid-5-a-reductase involved in N2 fixation, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism were found at the major-effect loci. Further analysis of additional germplasm accessions indicated that these major-effect loci had been subjected to domestication or modern breeding selection, and the allelic variants and distributions were relevant to geographic regions. We also revealed that amino acid concentrations related to seed weight and to total protein had a different genetic basis. This helps uncover the in-depth genetic mechanism of the intricate relationships among the seed compounds. Thus, our study not only provides valuable genes and markers for soybean nutrient improvement, both quantitatively and qualitatively, but also offers insights into the alteration of soybean quality during domestication and breeding.

Single-crystal X-ray analyses revealed that complex 1 displays a discrete mononuclear structure with the ligand in a bowl-shaped configuration. Complex 2 possesses a tetra nuclear 10 beaded chain structure. While complex 3 features a discrete trinuclear `H-type' structure with the ligand in a chair-like configuration. The distinct compositions and structures of 1-3 are mainly ascribed to the different pH values of the reaction solution, the influences of anions, as well as the configurations which the zwitterion ligands adopt. The magnetic properties of 2, and the photoluminescence properties of 2, and 3 have been investigated. Moreover, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis were also performed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we theoretically studied the electronic and magnetic properties of arsenene functionalized by 3D transition-metal (TM) atoms (TM@As). Although pristine arsenene is a nonmagnetic material, the dilute magnetism can be produced upon TM atoms chemisorption, where the magnetism mainly originates from TM adatoms. We find that the magnetic properties can be tuned by a moderate external strain. The chemisorption of 3D TM atoms also enriches the electronic properties of arsenene, such as metallic, half-metallic, and semiconducting features. Interestingly, we can classify the semiconducting feature into three types according to the band-gap contribution of spin channels. On the other hand, the chemisorption properties can be modified by introducing monovacancy defect in arsenene. Present results suggest that TM-adsorbed arsenene may be a promising candidate for electronic and spintronic applications.

The QD density increases sharply after the post rapid thermal annealing (PRTA). The observations of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy suggest that the good morphology of Ge QDs results from an appropriate thermodynamics and kinetics surrounding shaped by the cooperative interaction of the Ge-Si lattice mismatch, the film's surface temperature, and the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between Ge and Si. The photoluminescence (PL) peaks of Ge QDs are detected in monolayer Ge QDs with ultrahigh density at 17 K. The Metal-Ge/Si QDs-Metal (MGM) photodetector fabricated from the ultrahigh-density QDs sample exhibits a relatively high current gain, absolute photoelectric responsivity, and internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Our results demonstrate that the high-quality Ge QDs with strong light absorption and quantum confinement effect can be realized by modulating DC magnetron sputtering and the PRTA process. This paves the way for realizing silicon-based optoelectronic devices with high performance by the traditional, relatively low-cost, and large-scale production nanomaterial fabricating method.

A ratio-based approach using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ID LC-MS/MS) with indirect multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of the derivative tag was developed to simultaneously quantify endo-/exogenous plasma glucose. Using diluted D-[C-13(6)] glucose as tracer of exogenous glucose, C-12(6)/C-13(6) glucoses were first derivatized and then data were acquired in MRM mode. The metabolism of exogenous glucose can be tracked and the concentration ratio of endo/exo-genous glucose can be measured by calculating the endo-/exo-genous glucose concentrations from peak area ratio of specific daughter ions. Joint application of selective derivatization and MRM analysis not only improves the sensitivity but also minimizes the interference from the background of plasma, which warrants the accuracy and reproducibility. Good agreement between the theoretical and calculated concentration ratios was obtained with a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9969 in the range of D-glucose from 0.5 to 20.0 mM, which covers the healthy and diabetic physiological scenarios. Satisfactory reproducibility was obtained by evaluation of the intra- and inter-day precisions with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 5.16%, and relative recoveries of 85.96 to 95.92% were obtained at low, medium, and high concentration, respectively. The method was successfully applied to simultaneous determination of the endo-/exogenous glucose concentration in plasma of non-diabetic and type II diabetic cynomolgus monkeys.

To date, however, the geophysical results are not definitive due to the non-uniqueness of the solutions found through data inversion and the resolution limitations. In this study the polarity of P-to-S converted phases at intra-crustal interfaces are analyzed in order to reveal evidence for low seismic velocity and lower-crustal flow in southeastern Tibet. We are interested in a joint study that is both a mapping of the crustal structure (Moho topography and Poisson's ratio) and an attempt to constrain an ICLVZ. We have determined the crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio from P (PRFs) and S (SRFs) receiver functions acquired in 108 permanent seismic stations deployed in the Sichuan and Yunnan areas. Also, we have obtained 98 measurements of Pms-phase splitting parameters at the array stations. The crustal thickness provided by PREs is consistent with that given by SRFs. It varies from similar to 60 km in the Songpan-Ganzi (SG) fold system and the northern part of the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond shaped block (SYDSB), near the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, to similar to 33 km in southern Yunnan. The Poisson's ratio varies mostly from 0.24 to 0.32; the highest values 0.28-0.32 are found along the axis formed by the Longmenshan fault, the Lijiang-Jinhe fault and in the Tengchong volcano area. The value of similar to 0.28 observed in SYDSB and the SG fold system is attributed to the presence of a low-velocity zone in the lower crust, and partly to the great sediment thickness in Sichuan Basin. The crust is clearly anisotropic in the southeastern margin of Tibet: the fast-wave polarization direction exhibits a NW-SE regional bias, while the time delay varies between 0.07 s and 1.27 s, being the average 0.54 s +/- 0.12 s, implying the existence a strong shear zone in the lower crust. Based on the negative polarity observed after the direct P-wave in teleseismic receiver functions, we have detected an intra-crustal low-velocity zone (ICLVZ) in a wide region including east and southeast of Tibet and southern Yunnan, so both the shear zone and ICLVZ suggest the existence of lower crustal flow. The reverberation PpPs and PsPs + PpSs phases at the Moho are clearly weaker in SYDSB and the SG fold system than in the Indochina Block and eastern Yunnan, implying that SYDSB has a structure and tectonic history different from Indochina on its west side and eastern Yunnan on its east side. The above results provide seismological evidence for a lower crustal flow spreading from the eastern Tibet and that in its advance southward has invaded SYDSB widely, crossed the Lijiang-Jinhe fault and reached southern Yunnan.

J	Yu, LC; Wang, J; Lai, KR; Zhang, XJ				Yu, Liang-Chih; Wang, Jin; Lai, K.

However, existing context-based word embeddings such as Word2vec and GloVe typically fail to capture sufficient sentiment information, which may result in words with similar vector representations having an opposite sentiment polarity (e.g., good and bad), thus degrading sentiment analysis performance. To tackle this problem, recent studies have suggested learning sentiment embeddings to incorporate the sentiment polarity (positive and negative) information from labeled corpora. This study adopts another strategy to learn sentiment embeddings. Instead of creating a new word embedding from labeled corpora, we propose a word vector refinement model to refine existing pretrained word vectors using real-valued sentiment intensity scores provided by sentiment lexicons. The idea of the refinement model is to improve each word vector such that it can be closer in the lexicon to both semantically and sentimentally similar words (i.e., those with similar intensity scores) and further away from sentimentally dissimilar words (i.e., those with dissimilar intensity scores). An obvious advantage of the proposed method is that it can be applied to any pretrained word embeddings. In addition, the intensity scores can provide more finegrained (real-valued) sentiment information than binary polarity labels to guide the refinement process. Experimental results show that the proposed refinement model can improve both conventional word embeddings and previously proposed sentiment embeddings for binary, ternary, and fine- grained sentiment classification on the SemEval and Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets.

However, due to a lack of cultivation and limited genomes on hand, their biodiversity, metabolisms, and physiologies remain largely unresolved. Here, we obtained 39 genomes from acid mine drainage (AMD) and hot spring environments around the world. 16S rRNA gene based analyses revealed that Parvarchaeota were only detected in AMD and hot spring habitats, while Micrarchaeota were also detected in others including soil, peat, hypersaline mat, and freshwater, suggesting a considerable higher diversity and broader than expected habitat distribution for this phylum. Despite their small genomes (0.64-1.08 Mb), these archaea may contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycling by degrading multiple saccharides and proteins, and produce ATP via aerobic respiration and fermentation. Additionally, we identified several syntenic genes with homology to those involved in iron oxidation in six Parvarchaeota genomes, suggesting their potential role in iron cycling. However, both phyla lack biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and nucleotides, suggesting that they likely scavenge these biomolecules from the environment and/or other community members. Moreover, low-oxygen enrichments in laboratory confirmed our speculation that both phyla are microaerobic/anaerobic, based on several specific genes identified in them. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the close evolutionary history of energy related functionalities between both phyla with Thermoplasmatales. These results expand our understanding of these elusive archaea by revealing their involvement in carbon, nitrogen, and iron cycling, and suggest their potential interactions with Thermoplasmatales on genomic scale.

However, clinical development of C-1027 has been hampered by its low titer from the original producer Streptomyces globisporus C-1027. Here we report three new C-1027 alternative producers, Streptomyces sp. CB00657, CB02329, and CB03608, from The Scripps Research Institute actinomycetes strain collection. Together with the previously disclosed Streptomyces sp. CB02366 strain, four C-1027 alternative producers with C-1027 titers of up to 11-fold higher than the original producer have been discovered. The five C-1027 producers, isolated from distant geographic locations, are distinct Streptomyces strains based on morphology and taxonomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis of the five C-1027 producers reveal that their C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are all located on giant plasmids of varying sizes. The high nucleotide sequence similarity among the five C-1027 BGCs implies that they most likely have evolved from a common ancestor.

However, knowledge on carbon exchanges, their spatio-temporal patterns, and the extent of the key controls that affect carbon fluxes is lacking. In this study, we employed 29-site-years of eddy covariance data to observe the state, spatio-temporal variations and climate sensitivity of carbon fluxes (gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE)) in four representative forest ecosystems in Yunnan. We found that 1) all four forest ecosystems were carbon sinks (the average NEE was -3.40 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)); 2) contrasting seasonality of the NEE among the ecosystems with a carbon sink mainly during the wet season in the Yuanjiang savanna ecosystem (YJ) but during the dry season in the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest ecosystem (XSBN), besides an equivalent NEE uptake was observed during the wet/dry season in the Ailaoshan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest ecosystem(ALS) and Lijiang subalpine coniferous forest ecosystem(LJ); 3) as the GPP increased, the net ecosystem production (NEP) first increased and then decreased when the GPP > 17.5 tC ha(-1) yr(-1); 4) the precipitation determines the carbon sinks in the savanna ecosystem (e.g., YJ), while temperature did so in the tropical forest ecosystem (e.g., XSBN); 5) overall, under the circumstances of warming and decreased precipitation, the carbon sink might decrease in the YJ but maybe increase in the ALS and LJ, while future strength of the sink in the XSBN is somewhat uncertain. However, based on the redundancy analysis, the temperature and precipitation combined together explained 39.7%, 32.2%, 25.3%, and 29.6% of the variations in the NEE in the YJ, XSBN, ALS and LJ, respectively, which indicates that considerable changes in the NEE could not be explained by variations in the temperature and precipitation. Therefore, the effects of other factors (e.g., CO2 concentration, N/P deposition, aerosol and other variables) on the NEE still require extensive research and need to be considered seriously in carbon-cycle-models.

N-CQDs were prepared via microwave route by using urea and citric acid as raw materials. Two kinds of macrocyclic hosts, beta-CD and WP6, were incorporated on to the N-CQDs via hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions, respectively. The FTIR, TGA, and XPS characterizitions demonstrated that the beta-CD-N-CQD and WP6-N-CQD composites were successfully prepared. The WP6-N-CQD-modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) indicated an enhanced electrochemical signal than the beta-CD-N-CQDs/GCE in the reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), which was attributed to the higher supramolecular recognition capability of the WP6 host than that of beta-CD towards TNT. The linear ranges of 0.001 mu M1.0 mu M and 1.0 mu M20.0 mu M were obtained by using this electrochemical sensing platform. The detection limit was 0.95 nM (S/N = 3). The developed electrochemical sensing technique was successfully applied for the detection of TNT in lake water samples. Therefore, WP6-N-CQD nanocomposites are promising for the construction of high performance electrochemical sensors for the detection of explosives. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Genomic differentiation between swamp and river buffalo using a cattle high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms panel	ANIMAL			English	Article						water buffalo; admixture; genome-wide; diversity; traceability	WATER-BUFFALO; GENETIC-EVIDENCE; EUROPEAN CATTLE; BUBALUS-BUBALIS; DNA; POPULATIONS; DOMESTICATION; PROBABILITY; ASSOCIATION; GENOTYPES	Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is an important livestock species in many tropical and subtropical regions. In recent decades, the interest in buffalo's milk have expanded and intensive buffalo farms start to emerge. However, breeding programs and population genetics information for this species is scarce or inexistent. The present study aims to test the suitability of the commercial high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotyping panel, the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip, to estimate population genetics parameters, pedigree control and identification of common variants in major production candidate genes. From a total of 777 962 SNPs included in the panel, 20 479 were polymorphic in water buffalo at a call rate of 86% and an average expected heterozygosity (H-E) of 0.306. From these, 357 were mapped within or around the flanking regions of several major candidate genes. A principal components analysis identified three different clusters, each representing pure swamp buffalo type, pure river buffalo type and admixed river buffalo. The hybrids between swamp and river buffalo were clearly identified as an intermediary cluster. The suitability of these SNPs data set for parentage and identity testing demonstrated that the combination of just 30 to 50 SNPs were enough to attain high probabilities of parentage exclusion (0.9999) in both types and identity (2.3x10(-5) and 2.0x10(-7)) for river and swamp buffalo, respectively. Our analysis confirms the suitability of the BovineHD BeadChip to assess population structure, hybridization and identity of the water buffalo populations.

Their structures were determined by means of HR-ESI-MS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 2 were tested for their anti-tobacoo mosaic virus (TMV) activities and cytotoxicity activities. The results revealed that compounds 1 and 2 showed high anti-TMV activity with inhibition rates of 32.6 and 30.2%. These rates are close to that of positive control. Compounds 1 and 2 also showed weak inhibitory activities against some tested human tumor cell lines.

Because the orientation effect may vary with species, we hypothesize that habitat orientation may alter interspecific interactions between animal species. We experimentally investigated how habitat orientation (placing cuboid chambers in three orientations with long, medium, and small side as the chamber height) affected the interaction between two common cladoceran species, Daphnia magna and Moina micrura, which competitively exploited green algae of Chlorella pyrenoidosa at two volume scales (64 and 512ml). Results show that chamber orientation and volume additively affected the behavior and species performance of the grazers. Specifically, both grazer species generally decreased their average swimming velocity, grazing rate (on algal cells), body size, and survival and reproduction rates with increasing chamber height for both chamber volumes and with decreasing chamber volume regardless of chamber orientation. Nevertheless, the decrease magnitude was greater for M.micrura with increasing chamber height but was greater for D.magna with decreasing chamber volume. Correspondingly, when cocultured, the density ratio of D.magna to M.micrura increased with increasing chamber height but decreased with decreasing chamber volume. At the end of the experiment, none of D.magna individuals survived in the small and short (large-based) chambers, and few M.micrura individuals survived in large and tall (small-based) chambers. These results indicate that both habitat orientation and size affect the outcome of interspecific competition between grazer species. We suggest that variation in habitat orientation may improve community coexistence and species diversity in nature.

The architecture of these Cu2O NWs was examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the resulting crystal nanowire consists of the trunk growing along [100] plane and the branch growing along [110] plane. Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) in the experiment indicates that pure Cu2O NWs prepared at 150 degrees C have a higher photocatalytic activity (90% MO were degraded within 20 min without the presence of H2O2) compared with the samples obtained at other temperatures. In the photoelectrochemical test, pure Cu2O NWs had outstanding photoelectric response, which corresponds to the catalytic performance. The superior photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the absence of grain boundaries between the small branches and the nanowire trunk, which is conducive to the transport of photo-generated carriers, and the reduction of Cu impurities to reduce the number of recombination centers.

Probing molecular orientations in thin films by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							ENERGY-LEVEL ALIGNMENT; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; ORGANIC HETEROJUNCTION INTERFACES; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; SOLAR-CELLS	A great number of functional organic molecules in active thin-film layers of opto-electronic devices have highly asymmetric structures, such as plate-like, rod-like, etc. This makes molecular orientation an important aspect in thin-films as it can significantly affect both the optical and electrical performance of optoelectronic devices. With a combination of in-situ ultra violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations for organic molecules having a broad range of structural properties, we discovered a rigid connection of core levels and frontier highest occupied molecular orbital levels at organic interfaces. This finding opens up opportunities of using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy as an alternative tool to UPS for providing an easy and unambiguous data interpretation in probing molecular orientations.

Such factors are not yet well documented for fauna from the southern border of the Himalayan region. This study used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and ecological niche modeling (ENM) to explore how the late Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and complex geography of the Himalayan region have shaped genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and demographic history of the Nepalese population of Assam macaques (Macaca assamensis) in the Himalayan foothills. A total of 277 fecal samples were collected from 39 wild troops over almost the entire distribution of the species in Nepal. The mtDNA fragment encompassing the complete control region (1121bp) was recovered from 208 samples, thus defining 54 haplotypes. Results showed low nucleotide diversity (0.0075SD 0.0001) but high haplotype diversity (0.965 +/- SD 0.004). The mtDNA sequences revealed a shallow population genetic structure with a moderate but statistically significant effect of isolation by distance. Demographic history analyses using mtDNA sequences suggested a post-pleistocene population expansion. Paleodistribution reconstruction projected that the potential habitat of the Assam macaque was confined to the lower elevations of central Nepal during the Last Glacial Maximum. With the onset of the Holocene climatic optimum, the glacial refugia population experienced eastward range expansion to higher elevations. We conclude that the low genetic diversity and shallow population genetic structure of the Assam macaque population in the Nepal Himalaya region are the consequence of recent demographic and spatial expansion. Fine scale sampling and molecular analysis reveals that Nepal population of Assam macaque (Macaca assamensis) has low genetic diversity and shallow population genetic structure lacking signature of strong riverine barrier effects. Molecular data and ecological niche modeling complimentarily support the post-Pleistocene demographic and spatial expansion of the species in Nepal Himalaya. The species requires its taxonomic revision using multi-locus molecular approaches comparing with the recently described species like M. leucogenys, M. munzala, and conspecific populations from Bhutan and north-eastern India.

Half of its survey field is located on the Galactic Anti-center disk, which makes XSTPS-GAC highly suitable to search for new open clusters in the GAC region. In this paper, we report new open cluster candidates discovered in this survey, as well as properties of these open cluster candidates, such as age, distance and reddening, derived by isochrone fitting in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). These open cluster candidates are stellar density peaks detected in the star density maps by applying the method from Koposov et al. Each candidate is inspected in terms of its true color image composed from three XSTPS-GAC band images. Then its CMD is checked, in order to identify whether the central region stars have a clear isochrone-like trend differing from background stars. The parameters derived from isochrone fitting for these candidates are mainly based on three band photometry of XSTPS-GAC. Moreover, when these new candidates are able to be seen clearly in 2MASS data, their parameters are also derived based on the 2MASS (J - H, J) CMD. There are a total of 320 known open clusters rediscovered and 24 new open cluster candidates discovered in this work. Furthermore, the parameters of these new candidates, as well as another 11 previously known open clusters, are properly determined for the first time.

Within the tailored parameter regime, the transiently anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking, spanning several orders of magnitude in time, have been obtained. The ageing nature of the system weakens as the dissipation of the system increases for other given parameters. Its origin is ascribed to the highly local heterogeneity of the disorder. Two kinds of approximations (in the stationary state), respectively, for large bias and large damping are derived. These results may be helpful in further understanding the nontrivial response of nonlinear dynamics, and also have potential applications to experiments and activities of biological processes.

However, the application of brazilin is greatly restricted by its low stability. In this study, the preparation, characterization, inclusion mode, stability and solubility of brazilin with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) were studied for the first time in both the solid state and solution by means of XRD, DSC, SEM, H-1 and 2D NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy. The molecular modelling demonstrated the most stable inclusion model of brazilin/HP beta CD complex. The results illustrated that the stability of brazilin were improved in the inclusion complex with HP beta CD. This satisfactory characterization and stability of the brazilin/HP beta CD complex should be possibly useful for its utilization as dye, food or drug.

The FTIR, C-13 NMR, and XPS studies demonstrated that the hydroxy groups in HPS reduce Au3+ into Au-0, which leads to nucleation, growth, and formation of AuNPs, and the hydroxy groups themselves are oxidized to carboxyl groups. It is surprising that the HPS functionalized AuNPs can self-assemble and form multiple well-defined architectures, including vesicles, like nanotubes, and one-/two-dimensional (1D/2D) nanostructures without the need of a guest mediator. The self assembly mechanism was also studied. Moreover, the prepared HP5@AuNPs could be employed as not only scaffolds but energy acceptors for turn-on fluorescence sensing based on a competitive host-guest interaction. In addition, the AuNPs exhibited very excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). We believe that the versatile HP5@AuNPs could be potentially used in the field of self-assembly, sensing, and catalysis.

However, the traditional preparation methods are frequently limited by tedious operations, high-energy consumption, and massive pollution. Herein, we present a facile and green method for preparation of MnO2 nanoflakes mediated by macrocyclic molecule calix[8]arene. The MnO2 nanoflakes in situ grew on the preformed gold nanoparticles, forming an impressive core shell Au@MnO2 flake-like nano composite. The catalytic properties of Au@MnO2 composite for reduction of 4-NP and degradation of MB were 2.4 and 187 times better than commercial Pd/C, respectively. Meanwhile, the as synthesized Au@MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited specially excellent sensitivity and selectivity for detection of GSH with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.11 mu M. The core-shell nanostructured Au@MnO2 shows great potential value for the sustainable development of the environment and human health.

Conventional icing alert methods either cannot predict future icing accretion or these methods suffer from inadequate predictive accuracy. To resolve these issues, historical and online micrometeorological data from local observations are used to build a multivariate prediction model. Moreover, data preprocessing based on wavelets is used to prefilter spiking noise within the obtained field signals. In addition, the phase-space reconstruction theory is applied to find the minimal embedding dimensions of the contributing factors by which the computational complexity of the multivariate model is reduced. Finally, an online adaptive predictive model based on support vector regression is proposed and implemented to further improve the predictive accuracy and predictive length of the icing process of overhead power lines. Experimental results indicate that this method can predict the real-time icing value on overhead power lines 5hours in advance, with an acceptable error term.

Here, we report on the first complete chloroplast (cp) genome of P. bulbocodioides. The circular genome was 159,269 bp in length and consisted of a pair of inverted repeats (IR 26,716 bp), which were separated by a large single-copy region (LSC 87,125 bp) and a small single-copy region (SSC 18,712 bp). It contained 115 unique genes, including 81 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis indicated that P. bulbocodioides was closely related to the genera Cymbidium and Bletilla. The complete cp genome will useful for further studies of the endangered orchid.

Intra-Regular Abel Grassmann's Groupoids Determined by (is an element of(gamma), is an element of(gamma), Vq(delta)) Fuzzy Sets	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						AG-groupoid; Left invertive law; Medial law; Paramedial law and (is an element of(gamma), is an element of(gamma), Vq(delta))-Fuzzy ideal	SUBGROUP	It is common knowledge that various models with their limited boundaries of truth and falsehood are not sufficient to detect the reality so there is a need to discover other systems which are able to address the daily life problems. In every branch of science problems arise which abound with uncertainties and imprecisions. Some of these problems are related to human life, some others are subjective while others are objective and classical methods are not sufficient to solve such problems because they can not handle various ambiguities involved. To overcome this problem, Zadeh introduced the concept of a fuzzy set which provides a useful mathematical tool for describing the behavior of systems that are either too complex or are ill-defined to admit precise mathematical analysis by classical methods. Our aim in this paper is to use non-associate algebraic structures such as AG-groupoids and to develop the resulting properties. For the applications of this concept we introduce generalized fuzzy ideals and discuss their properties, specifically we characterize intra regular AG-groupoids using the properties of generalized fuzzy ideals.

The objective is to minimize the sum of the maximum load over all dimensions of the total vector of all accepted jobs, and the total penalty of rejected jobs. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and design two approximation algorithms running in polynomial time. When d is a fixed constant, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.

Investigating the scope of cognitive impairment across the severity spectrum of tinnitus patients may shed light on the issue. Methods: A consecutive series of 207 subjective chronic tinnitus patients were classified into mild tinnitus group (n = 95) and severe tinnitus group (n = 112) by THI score (the cutoff THI scores were 37/38). These patients were assessed using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and P300 event-related potential. Results: Although pure tone averages were not different between mild or severe tinnitus patients, severe tinnitus patients scored lower on the CASI assessment as well as almost all subdomains of CASI, particularly in items such as "short-term memory," "concentration or mental manipulation," "orientation," "abstraction and judgment," "language abilities," and "visual construction." Furthermore, compared to mild tinnitus patients, severe tinnitus patients exhibited longer N2 and P3 latencies. Finally, a correlation analysis revealed that tinnitus severity was negatively correlated with CASI score and positively correlated with N2 and P3 latencies. Conclusions: This study reveals that tinnitus patients on the severe end of the spectrum may be at risk for serious cognitive deficits, which may not be a secondary response to disease manifestations but a primary feature of the underlying disease.

Here, feces of 164 black-necked cranes collected in Dashanbao Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve, China, were examined to determine the prevalence of coccidial oocysts. Of the 164 fecal samples, 76 (46.3%) were positive for oocysts of Eimeria, including E. gruis in 59 (35.9%), E. reichenowi in 52 (31.7%), and E. bosquei in 47 (28.7%) by microscopic observation. Sixty-eight (89.5%) of these positive samples included two or more morphologically identifiable species of Eimeria. The nearly full length 18S rRNA gene (18S rRNA; about 1.8 kb) and partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COX1; about 1.3 kb) from oocysts of each morphologically distinct species of Eimeria were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. BLAST searches using these new 18S rRNA sequences for E. gruis, E. reichenowi, or E. bosquei showed the most similar sequences were those of E. gruis (98.7-99.7% identity), E. reichenowi (97.9-100% identity), or E. gruis (98.6-99.6% identity) isolated from different species of Grus. BLAST searches using the new COX1 sequences for the three species of Eimeria showed that no nucleotide sequences of Eimeria and Isospora coccidia in GenBank have more than 83.0% identity with these species. Identities among the new COX1 sequences were 91.8% for E. gruis and E. reichenowi, 94.5% for E. gruis and E. bosquei, and 91.3% for E. reichenowi and E. bosquei. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA or COX1 sequences indicated that Eimeria spp. in black-necked cranes were clustered together with other previously identified Eimeria species from different cranes.

The structure of violacin A was established using comprehensive NMR spectroscopic data analysis together with UV, IR, and MS data. The anti-inflammatory effects and action mechanisms of violacin A were investigated in vitro. The results demonstrated that violacin A attenuated the production of NO, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha as well as inhibited the expression of iNOS in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, Western blot and qRT-PCR results revealed that 1 down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression correlated with the suppression of NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

Phosphorus (P)-enriched soils in the southern basin can contribute significantly to the overall P loads in the Dian Lake. The objective of the present study was to investigate the distribution of P fractions and the P sorption properties in the P-enriched soils along the Chai river, southern of the Dian Lake. The information is essential to understanding P discharge from the intensively cropped field to waterways. Soil samples were collected in five sites located along the Cha river at the southern part of the basin of the Dian Lake, southwestern China, from the upstream cropped fields to the estuary buffer, respectively. Soil total phosphorus (TP), inorganic P fractions, organic carbon (SOC), N, pH, and particle size distribution were quantified. Phosphorus sorption was modeled with the simple Langmuir equations. Total P, loosely bound, and non-occluded inorganic P (Pi) concentrations at all soil depths (0-80 cm) were significantly higher in the upstream Ferrisols than that in the downstream Gleysols of the Chai river. However, the occluded Pi concentrations were significantly higher in the Gleysols than that in the Ferrisols. Phosphorus in the 0-80 cm soil profile of both Ferrisol and Gleysols are largely dominated by Ca-bound Pi (47-79%). The higher sorption maximum (S-max), binding energy (k), and equilibrium buffering capacity (PEBC) and lower zero equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) over all sampling depths were observed in the Gleysols than that in the Ferrisols. The increase of S-max, k, and PEBC and decrease of EPC0 as sampling depth increased suggest that there might be fewer P losses via leaching process both in the upstream and downstream areas of the Chai river. It is evident from this study that the upstream areas is actually acting as a source for dissolved P, whereas the downstream areas is acting as a sink. Moreover, management options to reduce P losses in land runoff may therefore be a more effective way to minimizing eutrophication risk in the P-enriched area.

Chemical investigation of the genus Leonurus not only enriched the natural products library, but also enlarged the pharmacological application of this traditional herb. In this review, we systematically summarized the structures of 259 compounds isolated from the genus Leonurus, featured with 147 labdane diterpenoids. The reported bioactivity studies up to 2017 are presented in the second part, with the main focus on the isolated compounds and also concerning the extracts. In addition to the traditional uterine contraction and sedative activity, recently the cardiovascular protection effect of leonurine has drawn most attention. Other than that, neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, anti-platelet aggregation and many other activities have been assigned to various compounds from the genus Leonurus. Among 70 bioactivity references cited in this review, 57% of them were concentrated on two alkaloids (leonurine and stachydrine), whereas only 20% are about the 147 diterpenoids. Anti-inflammation is the major bioactivity discovered so far for the labdane diterpenoids from the genus Leonurus, whose further therapeutic potential still remains for exploration.

J	Zhou, K; Tan, GM; Zhou, W				Zhou, Keren; Tan, Guangming; Zhou, Wei			Quadboost: A Scalable Concurrent Quadtree	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Concurrent data structures; quadtree; continuous find; decoupling; LCA		Building concurrent spatial trees is more complicated than binary search trees since a space hierarchy should be preserved during modifications. We present a non-blocking quadtree (quadboost) that supports concurrent insert, remove, move, and contain operations, in which the move operation combines the searches for different keys together and modifies different positions atomically. To increase its concurrency, a decoupling approach is proposed to separate physical adjustment from logical removal within the remove operation. In addition, we design a continuous find mechanism to reduce the search cost. Experimental results show that quadboost scales well on a multi-core system with 32 hardware threads. It outperforms existing concurrent trees in retrieving two-dimensional keys with up to 109 percent improvement when the number of threads is large. Furthermore, the move operation achieves better performance than the best-known algorithm with up to 47 percent.

In order to provide more complex functionalities, services can be reused by applying service composition. A service composition can be designed and implemented through a centralization or decentralization strategy. When observing the decentralized service composition, several researchers found out that this kind of compositions has its own advantages. These findings promote the development of approaches for designing, implementing and applying decentralized service compositions. Process partitioning is a topic about dividing a process into a collection of small parts. The technique is applicable to partitioning a process in a centralized service composition, and the result can provide support to constructing a decentralized service composition. This paper presents a technique of process partitioning. The technique can be used for constructing decentralized service compositions, and it provides a graph transformation based approach to reorganizing a process which is represented as a process structure graph. Compared to existing approaches, the technique can partition well-structured and unstructured processes. Some issues about decentralized service compositions and performance tests of service compositions are discussed in this paper. Experimental results show that, when compared with the centralized service composition, the decentralized service composition can have lower average response time and higher throughput in runtime environment.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within OCM genes may affect folic acid (FA) metabolism, disrupt homocysteine (Hcy) homeostasis, and increase the risk of disease. This study investigated the relationship between SNPs in key OCM genes and their association with blood FA and Hcy levels in a healthy population in Yunnan, China. Methods: Six SNPs within five key OCM genes (MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MS A2756G, MTRR A66G, CBS T833C, and SHMT C1420T) were genotyped in 300 healthy volunteers (148 males and 152 females) using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Blood folate [serum FA (SFA) and red blood cell folate (RBC FA)] and Hcy levels were determined by chemiluminescence immunoassays and enzymatic assays. Results: Subjects with the MTHFR 677TT genotype had significantly higher Hcy levels and RBC FA concentrations compared with those harboring the MTHFR 677CC/CT genotypes (p<0.01). Both Hcy and blood FA concentrations were also increased in subjects with MS 2756AA, as well as those within CBS 833TT, when compared with those with MS 2756AG/GG (p<0.05) and CBS 833TC/CC (p<0.05) genotypes, respectively. Subjects harboring the combined genotype of MTHFR 677TT and MS 2756AA had a higher Hcy concentration than those carrying other MTHFR and MS combinations (p=0.002). Similarly, subjects harboring the combination of CBS 833TT with MTHFR 677TT had higher Hcy concentrations than those harboring other CBS and MTHFR combinations (p=0.011). Conclusions: The genotypes involving the MTHFR C677T, MS A2756G, and CBS T833C polymorphisms, including combinations of these genotypes, were the most important factors associated with blood FA and Hcy levels of the investigated SNPs in the OCM genes.

Tunable terahertz optical properties of graphene in dc electric fields	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						Terahertz; Electro-optical materials; Graphene	ABSORPTION	We develop a simple theoretical approach to investigate terahertz (THz) optical properties of monolayer graphene in the presence of an external dc electric field. The analytical results for optical coefficients such as the absorptance and reflectivity are obtained self-consistently on the basis of a diagrammatic self-consistent field theory and a Boltzmann equilibrium equation. It is found that the optical refractive index, reflectivity and conductivity can be effectively tuned by not only a gate voltage but also a driving dc electric field. This study is relevant to the applications of graphene as advanced THz optoelectronic devices.	[Dong, H.

The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, UV-vis DRS, and PL. The synthesized CdS/BiOI composites exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in photodegrading of 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) compared to pure CdS and pure BiOI, and the removal rate of EE2 could approach 100% after only 12 min of visible light irradiation using 3:1 CdS/BiOI composite as photocatalyst. The reaction rate constant over 3:1 CdS/BiOI composite was 6.3, 7.1 and 70.9 times higher than that of pure CdS, pure BiOI and P25 respectively. In addition, a Z-scheme charge separation mechanism was proposed on the basis of the experimental results and the theoretical calculation. Moreover, the prepared composite showed good stability and recyclability which are beneficial for its practical application.

A small particle of 3-5 nm and a high specific surface area (around 123.47 m(2)/g) are obtained. To further enhance the sensing properties, a wide Pd functionalization was investigated. It is revealed that the as-synthesized 7 at% Pd-functionalized SnO2/In2O3 nanocomposites exhibits high response of 71.28 towards 3000 ppm butane at optimal operating temperature of 320 degrees C. Furthermore, rapid response (3.51 s) and recovery (7.86 s) time, wide detection range (1-3000 ppm), and good selectivity in general flammable gases are observed. Besides the native nature of both SnO2 and In2O3, the excellent sensing properties can be plausibly explained by the synergistic effects arising from the simultaneous presence of these multiple functional materials, i.e. the high specific surface area, the formation of the heterojunctions, the mutual doping effect, and the influence of Pd nanoparticles.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Observation of the thunderstorm-related ground cosmic ray flux variations by ARGO-YBJ	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRIC-FIELD; SCALER MODE; ENHANCEMENTS; INTENSITY; AVALANCHE; BREAKDOWN; DETECTOR; FLASHES	A correlation between the secondary cosmic ray flux and the near-earth electric field intensity, measured during thunderstorms, has been found by analyzing the data of the ARGO-YBJ experiment, a full coverage air shower array located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a. s. l., Tibet, China). The counting rates of showers with different particle multiplicities (m = 1, 2, 3, and = 4) have been found to be strongly dependent upon the intensity and polarity of the electric field measured during the course of 15 thunderstorms. In negative electric fields (i. e., accelerating negative charges downwards), the counting rates increase with increasing electric field strength. In positive fields, the rates decrease with field intensity until a certain value of the field EFmin (whose value depends on the event multiplicity), above which the rates begin increasing. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that this peculiar behavior can be well described by the presence of an electric field in a layer of thickness of a few hundred meters in the atmosphere above the detector, which accelerates/decelerates the secondary shower particles of opposite charge, modifying the number of particles with energy exceeding the detector threshold. These results, for the first time to our knowledge, give a consistent explanation for the origin of the variation of the electron/positron flux observed for decades by high altitude cosmic ray detectors during thunderstorms.

In this study, we aimed to examine how the selfing timing correlated with floral traits in three Gentianopsis species in which autonomous selfing is achieved through filament elongation. Although the three Gentianopsis species exhibit no significant variation in their capacity for autonomous selfing, flowers of G. grandis last longer, are larger and have a higher corolla biomass, P/O ratios and male biomass allocation than those of G. paludosa, and especially those of G. contorta. Autonomous selfing occurs in the early floral life of G. paludosa and G. contorta and in the later floral life of G. grandis. Seed production mainly results from autonomous selfing in G. paludosa and G. contorta; however, G. grandis could be more described as having a mixed mating system. We suggest that autonomous selfing in later floral life increases the chance of cross-pollination prior to this, while autonomous selfing in early floral life offers a selective advantage to plants by reducing the resource investment in traits that may increase pollinator attraction and visitation.

Herein, a new library of disubstituted FCOEs bearing adjacent heteroatoms were synthesized and applied in ROMP. To address the issues associated with the handling of the reactive thienyl chloride intermediate, a two-step continuous flow method has been developed to prepare 5-thio-6-chlorocyclooctene compounds from abundant cyclooctadiene starting materials. These newly synthesized FCOE monomers were subsequently polymerized through ROMP, giving rise to a range of functionalized polymers with high molecular weights. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the thermal properties of these polymers could be fine-tuned by changing the functional groups in the FCOE monomers. We expect that this functionalization-polymerization strategy will enable the preparation of a range of polymeric materials with complex structures.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in the modulation of immune responses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of MMP1, 3, and 12 promoter polymorphisms with RHD in a Han population in Southern China since the 3 genes are localized on the same chromosome and have a combined effect. Methods: DNA samples were obtained from 90 adult patients with RHD and 90 control subjects. Polymorphisms in MMP1 (rs1799750), MMP3 (rs3025058), and MMP12 (rs2276109) were genotyped by direct sequencing. Differences in genotype and allele frequencies of these polymorphisms were compared between the cases and the controls using Unconditional logistic regression models and Chi-squared test. Results: The 2G/2G genotype of rs1799750 in MMP1 was associated with a significantly higher risk of RHD when compared with the 1G/1G genotype (OR = 3.227; 95% CI:1.118-9.31; p = 0.03). The frequency of allele 2G was higher in patients with RHD compared to the controls (69.4% vs. 58.9%; p = 0.048) No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of rs3025058 in MMP3 and rs2276109 in MMP12 were found between the patients with RHD and the controls (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that rs1799750 in MMP1 might be a risk factor for RHD in a Han population in Southern China, and individuals carrying the 2G/2G genotype are likely more susceptible to RHD. In contrast, rs3025058 in MMP3 and rs2276109 in MMP12 might not contribute to the risk of developing RHD in this population. Further studies with larger samples and other ethnic populations are required to confirm these findings.

This study selected population density, gross domestic product (GDP) density and areal percentage of human land use to reveal the human pressures of national and provincial NRs (NNRs and PNRs) in Yunnan Province, China. We calculated three types of internal and external human pressure index (HPI) and comprehensive HPI (CHPI) for NRs. Human pressures on most of NRs were slight and light, indicating that most of NRs were well protected. Human pressures on PNRs were higher than on NNRs; with respect to five types of NRs, geological relict NRs were facing the highest human pressures, followed by wetland ecosystem NRs. Land use and population density were the main human pressures on these NRs. Yunnan Province should put the highest emphasis on three NNRs and two Ramsar site PNRs with severe CHPI, secondly pay attention to eight conservation-oriented PNRs with extreme or severe CHPI. It's urgent for Yunnan to implement scientific policies and measures to reduce land use and population density pressures of NRs, especially with severe and extreme CHPI, by transforming internal land use and/or implementing residents' eco-migration.

The properties of metallic nanoparticles depend strongly on their particle size, shape, and interparticle distances. It is therefore desirable for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles to be controlled for specific shapes and sizes. The rapid development in this research area has attracted intense interest from researchers with diverse expertise, and numerous methods towards the synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles have been reported. In this Focus Review, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of the template synthesis of metallic nanoparticles using closed-shell structures, including biological molecules/assemblies and cage molecules.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within OCM genes may affect folic acid (FA) metabolism, disrupt homocysteine (Hcy) homeostasis, and increase the risk of disease. This study investigated the relationship between SNPs in key OCM genes and their association with blood FA and Hcy levels in a healthy population in Yunnan, China. Methods: Six SNPs within five key OCM genes (MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MS A2756G, MTRR A66G, CBS T833C, and SHMT C1420T) were genotyped in 300 healthy volunteers (148 males and 152 females) using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Blood folate [serum FA (SFA) and red blood cell folate (RBC FA)] and Hcy levels were determined by chemiluminescence immunoassays and enzymatic assays. Results: Subjects with the MTHFR 677TT genotype had significantly higher Hcy levels and RBC FA concentrations compared with those harboring the MTHFR 677CC/CT genotypes (p<0.01). Both Hcy and blood FA concentrations were also increased in subjects with MS 2756AA, as well as those within CBS 833TT, when compared with those with MS 2756AG/GG (p<0.05) and CBS 833TC/CC (p<0.05) genotypes, respectively. Subjects harboring the combined genotype of MTHFR 677TT and MS 2756AA had a higher Hcy concentration than those carrying other MTHFR and MS combinations (p=0.002). Similarly, subjects harboring the combination of CBS 833TT with MTHFR 677TT had higher Hcy concentrations than those harboring other CBS and MTHFR combinations (p=0.011). Conclusions: The genotypes involving the MTHFR C677T, MS A2756G, and CBS T833C polymorphisms, including combinations of these genotypes, were the most important factors associated with blood FA and Hcy levels of the investigated SNPs in the OCM genes.

Amphiphilic Aquivion PFSA was used as both acidic and template agent for the sol-gel synthesis of amorphous mesoporous silica which was found very appropriate to effectively immobilize Aquivion resin by using an impregnation method. Various characterizations including elemental analysis, acid-base titration, XRD, FTIR, Raman, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM and TEM revealed that Aquivion@silica catalyst presented large surface area, sufficient porosity and afforded highly accessible sulfonic acid groups. Efficient and productive HMF production from the dehydration of fructose was achieved in the polar dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent at low temperature of 90 degrees C, i.e. 85% yield of HMF and 43 mol(HMF) mol(H+) productivity of HMF. The influence of reaction time, reaction temperature, Aquivion loading, catalyst dosage and solvent on the dehydration process was systematically investigated. The catalyst could be regenerated through a simple ion-exchange method and a stable HMF yield was maintained after being used four times.

The results show that: (i) the synchronicity between the stock and the stock-index increases with the rising degree of market information capitalized into stock prices in certain range; (ii) the synchronicity decreases for large firm-specific information; (iii) the stock return synchronicity is small compared to the big noise trading, however the variance noise facilitates the synchronization within the tailored realms. These findings may be helpful in understanding the effect of market information on synchronicity, especially for the response of firm-specific information and noise trading to synchronicity.

They were noticed due to locally increased thickness of sediment and enhanced vegetation but had not yet been systematically studied and defined. Considering only the geometry of the investigated surface features and the rare traces of cave environments detected by field surveys, it was unclear which processes (surface karstification and/or speleogenesis) contributed most to their formation. The low-frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) method using a special 50 MHz RTA antenna was applied to study and describe these karst features. Three study sites were chosen and 5 km of GPR profiles were positioned to include various surface features. The results obtained from the GPR investigation lead to the following conclusions: (1) an increased thickness of sediment was detected in all the investigated depressions indicating their considerable depth; (2) areas between different depressions expressed as attenuated zones in GPR images reveal their interconnection; (3) transitions between surface and underground features are characterized by a collapsed passage visible in the GPR data; and (4) an underground continuation of surface valley-like depressions was detected, proving the speleogenetic origin of such features. Subsurface information obtained using GPR indicates that the valley like depressions, irregular depressions completely or partially filled with sediment, and some dolines are associated with a nearly 4 km-long unroofed cave and developed as a result of karst denudation. In the regional context, these results suggest long-lasting karstification processes in the area, in contrast to the pre-karstic fluvial phase previously assumed to have occurred here. This research is the first application of the GPR method to survey unroofed caves worldwide and the first detailed study of such karst features in Croatia. The low-frequency GPR proved to be an efficient method not only for detecting underground continuations but also for distinguishing and identifying surface features and transition zones between surface and subsurface segments of unroofed caves and can therefore be used for recognizing similar geomorphological features.

Although the experimental results could help to understand the basic behavior of coal hydrogasification, it was difficult to directly utilize such data for devising a new hydrogasifier. This paper designed a continuous entrained flow bed facility and described the hydrogasification characteristics. This device (15-30 kg/d) mainly consisted of a high H-2 pressure feed system, a high-temperature tube reactor. The capabilities were shown as follows: the temperature from 700 degrees C to 850 degrees C, H-2 pressure from 0.1 MPa to 3.0 MPa, isothermal zone 300-600 mm, feeding rate from 15 to 30 kg/d and water yield was easy to obtained by tar-water separation. The good mass balance on the carbon and weight basis was established by analyzing the product distribution in detail. The results showed the yields of CH4 and light aromatic hydrocarbons increased through hydrogenation of tar and volatiles, hydrogasification of coal char. Although the small pilot plant had high heat loss through refractory with increasing H-2 pressure, the typical results obtained from the continuous stable operation of the entrained flow bed reactor confirmed the design of new large-scale hydrogasification process was technical feasibility.

Aeolian dust supply from the Yellow River floodplain to the Pleistocene loess deposits of the Mangshan Plateau, central China: Evidence from zircon U-Pb age spectra	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Provenance analysis; Sanmen Gorge; Mangshan Plateau; End member modelling; Grain-size	GRAIN-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; PALEOSOL SEQUENCE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; LATE QUATERNARY; ASIAN MONSOON; LATE PLIOCENE; LATE MIOCENE; RECORD; PROVENANCE; EVOLUTION	The thick loess-palaeosol sequences in the Mangshan Loess Plateau (MLP; central China) along the south bank of the lower reach of the Yellow River provide high-resolution records of Quaternary climate change. In addition, substantial increases in grain-size and accumulation rate have been inferred in the upper part of the loess sequence, above palaeosol layer S2. This study investigates the sources of the long-term dust supply to the MLP and explores the mechanism behind the sudden increase in sediment delivery and coarsening of the loess deposits since S2 (similar to 240 ka) by using end member modelling of the loess grain-size dataset and single-grain zircon U-Pb dating. Our results indicate that the lower Yellow River floodplain, directly north of the MLP, served as a major dust supply for the plateau at least since the deposition of loess unit L9 and indirectly suggest that the integration of the Yellow River and the disappearance of the Sanmen palaeolake took place before L9 (similar to 900 ka). The sudden change in sedi-mentology of the Mangshan sequence above palaeosol unit S2 may result from an increased fluvial sediment flux being transported to the lower reaches of the Yellow River because of tectonic movements (initiated) in the Weihe Basin around 240 ka. Furthermore, sediment coarsening can be explained by the gradual southward migration of the lower Yellow River floodplain towards the MLP since the deposition of palaeosol S2. The migration is evidenced by the formation of an impressive scarp, and is likely caused by tectonic tilting of the floodplain area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Necroptosis is a type of programed necrosis, which is executed by mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) upon its binding to the plasma membrane. Emerging evidence indicates that necroptosis plays a critical role in the development of AKI. However, it is unclear whether renal tubular cells undergo necroptosis in vivo and how the necroptotic pathway is regulated during AKI. Repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-b is a member of the RGM family. Our previous study demonstrated that RGMb is highly expressed in kidney tubular epithelial cells, but its biological role in the kidney has not been well characterized. In the present study, we found that RGMb reduced membrane-associated MLKL levels and inhibited necroptosis in cultured cells. During ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) or oxalate nephropathy, MLKL was induced to express on the apical membrane of proximal tubular (PT) cells. Specific knockout of Rgmb in tubular cells (Rgmb cKO) increased MLKL expression at the apical membrane of PT cells and induced more tubular cell death and more severe renal dysfunction compared with wild-type mice. Treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 or GSK'963 reduced MLKL expression on the apical membrane of PT cells and ameliorated renal function impairment after IRI in both wild-type and Rgmb cKO mice. Taken together, our results suggest that proximal tubular cell necroptosis plays an important role in AKI, and that RGMb protects against AKI by inhibiting MLKL membrane association and necroptosis in proximal tubular cells.

With newly synthesized N-arylphenothiazine catalysts, organocatalyzed photoredox polymerization has been developed with arylsulfonyl halides initiators using white or purple LEDs light sources. This method allows the preparation of poly(meth)acrylates and poly(meth)acrylamides possessing a broad scope of (hetero)aryl chain ends without metal-contamination concern. Investigations such as MALDI-TOF analysis, chain extension, and "ON/OFF" control experiments confirmed the fidelity of the polymer structure and reliability of this method. Moreover, this method facilitates the two-step preparation of brush polymers from polystyrene through an electrophilic aromatic substitution/organocatalyzed photopolymerization sequence.

Liver fibrosis can lead to the end stage of liver diseases (livercirrhosisand hepatocellularcarcinoma). Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, the shortage of organ donors, high cost of medical surgery, immunological rejection and transplantation complications severely hamper liver transplantation therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been regarded as promising cells for clinical applications in stem cell therapy in the treatment of liver diseases due to their unique multipotent differentiation capacity, immunoregulation and paracrine effects. Although liver fibrosis improvements by MSC transplantation in preclinical experiments as well as clinical trials have been reported, the in vivo fate of MSCs after transportation and their therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. In this present study, we isolated MSCs from the bone marrow of rhesus macaques. The cells exhibited typical MSC markers and could differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes, and adipocytes, which were not affected by labeling with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The harvested MSCs respond to interferon-gamma stimulation and have the ability to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. EGFP-labeled MSCs (1 x 10(6) cells) were transplanted into mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis via tail vein injection. The ability of the heterogenic MSC infusion to ameliorate liver fibrosis in mice was evaluated by a blood plasma chemistry index, pathological examination and liver fibrosis-associated gene expression. Additionally, a small number of MSCs that homed and engrafted in the mouse liver tissues were evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis. Our results showed that the transplantation of heterogenic MSCs derived from monkey bone marrow can be used to treat liver fibrosis in the mouse model and that the paracrine effects of MSCs may play an important role in the improvement of liver fibrosis.

Herein, we demonstrated SnO2 compact layer (c-SnO2), which prepared by spray pyrolysis using a solution of dibutyltin bisacetylacetonate in ethanol, could be an excellent alternative compact layer for efficient hole-conductor-free printable MPSCs. The best device with such a c-SnO2 has achieved an efficiency of 13.77%, which is very comparable to that obtained by the device based on c-TiO2. Furthermore, the device with c-SnO2 showed less pronounced hysteresis effect, probably because of the higher electron mobility of SnO2 and less charge accumulation at the interfaces. The simple preparation process and improved hysteretic behavior pave the way for industrialization of PSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Continued study showed that SJP-L-5 might hinder HIV capsid uncoating by blocking the completion of reverse transcription. However, to date, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, the effects of SJP-L-5 for reverse transcription were explored via quantitative PCR, DIG-labelled ELISA, fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and Southern blot assays. We also analyzed the resistance profile of this compound against reverse transcriptase. Our results show that SJP-L-5 preferentially inhibits PPT primed plus-strand DNA synthesis (EC50 = 13.4 +/- 3.0 mu M) over RNA primed minus-strand DNA synthesis (EC50 > 3,646 mu M), resulting in formation of five segmented plus-strand DNA and loss of HIV DNA flap, suggesting failure of both nuclear import and integration. Moreover, resistance study evidenced that SJP-L-5 requires the amino acid residues Val108 and Tyr181 to exert an inhibitory effect. These results indicate SJP-L-5 as a new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits HIV-1 polypurine tract primed plus-strand DNA synthesis, initiating HIV-1 down-stream plus-strand DNA synthesis at multiple sites under drug pressure.

The 3D framework of 1 experienced an intensive DRST process to form the 1D intermediate of 2, followed by a unique SCSC process to transform it into the 2D network of 3. Nevertheless, compound 3 can be obtained from compound 1 directly via another DRST. That is to say, a DRST process could be achieved by the combination of another DRST process and an SCSC process. To the best of our knowledge, this type of study is still scarce. And it provides a convenient strategy to investigate the mechanism of crystal transformation and construct advanced crystalline materials. Results have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Significant structural alterations were observed and these changes could be analyzed from the properties of center Cu(II) ions and the switch of chelating-bridging modes of MIPA. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that 1 and 3 exhibit anti-ferromagnetic interaction between adjacent Cu(II) centers. Additionally, complexes 1-3 have been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and infrared and PXRD studies.

"TOP-SCOPE" is a joint survey program targeting similar to 2000 PGCCs in J = 1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and similar to 1000 PGCCs in 850 mu m continuum emission. The objective of the "TOP-SCOPE" survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10 m, KVN 21 m, and NRO 45 m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data analysis, and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, length, and mean line mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are similar to 6200 M-circle dot, similar to 12 pc, and similar to 500 M-circle dot pc(-1), respectively. Ten massive clumps, including eight starless ones, are found along the filament. The most massive clump as a whole may still be in global collapse, while its denser part seems to be undergoing expansion owing to outflow feedback. The fragmentation in the G26 filament from cloud scale to clump scale is in agreement with gravitational fragmentation of an isothermal, nonmagnetized, and turbulent supported cylinder. A bimodal behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (beta) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed owing to large-scale compression flows evidenced by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud.

A critical challenge remains in the exploration of clinically potential noble metal nanoparticles for highly efficient cancer theranostics. Here, we introduce albumin-coordinated assembly of clearable Pt nanodots (Pt-NDs) with monodisperse nanostructure as high-performance theranostic agents for imaging-guided photothermal tumor ablation. We precisely manipulate the reduction and growth of tetravalent Pt ions into ultrasmall nanodots through albumin-directed growth kinetics, thereby leading to the synthesis of monodisperse 6.7 nm Pt-NDs with albumin molecules as the corona. Pt-NDs exhibit the surface plasmon resonance at 225 nm with enhanced near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, ideal resistance to photo-bleaching, distinct photoacoustic and X-ray signals, as well as remarkable photothermal effect through non-radiative relaxation under NIR light irradiation. In particular, Pt-NDs possess preferable tumor accumulation, and effective in vivo excretory capability. Thus, these nanodots promote preferable in vivo microscopic photoacoustics and spatially anatomic CT imaging with enhanced contrast, as well as potent hyperthermia-mediated tumor ablation. These findings represent a facile and general approach to fabricate high-performance noble metal nanostructures with clinical potential for cancer theranostics. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) (PACP) was not only used as C and N resources, but also as template to enlarge specific surface area during the preparation process. The PACP templated precursor calcined at 300 degrees C and 350 degrees C for 2 h were denoted as DBO-300 and DBO-350, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared samples were characterized by element analysis, XRD, TEM, BET, XPS and UV-vis DRS techniques. The N element mass ratios in DBO-300 and DBO-350 were 1.883 wt% and 0.913 wt%, respectively. While the C element mass ratio in DBO-300 and DBO-350 were 2.579 wt% and 0.512 wt%, respectively. The total removal ratio of EE2 over DBO-300 was 95.30% after only 2 min of visible-light irradiation. While the total removal ratio of EE2 over DBO-350 reached 98.86% after 20 min of visible-light irradiation. The reaction rate constant over DBO-300 and DBO-350 were 13.93, 5.68 times higher than BO-350 (pure beta-Bi2O3 without PACP template calcined at 350 degrees C) respectively. The adsorption ability for EE2 over DBO-300 and DBO-350 was attributed to the high specific surface area and the hydrophobic nature of carbon, and the good photocatalytic performance was attributed to the narrower band gap induced by C and N doping. The hydrophobic EE2 in water could be rapidly removed by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on C/N-doped beta-Bi2O3 nanosheets synergistically.

J	Dong, M; He, J				Dong, Min; He, Jun			Linking the past to the future: A reality check on cross-border timber trade from Myanmar (Burma) to China	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Governance; Market access; Middlemen; Timber value chain; South-east Asia; One Belt and One Road	FOREST-PRODUCTS; IMPORT; DEFORESTATION; GOVERNANCE; DYNAMICS; DEMAND	The rapid development of China's economy, changing of domestic forestry policy and economic globalization are gradually pushing China to the position of the largest timber importer worldwide. The issue of China's increasing timber imports is now receiving extensive attention from the international community. Existing studies that analyze China's global timber sourcing focus on international trade data or rules at a predominantly macro-level, while few empirical studies exist. This paper takes a grounded approach to empirically study the timber trade from Myanmar to China via Yunnan Province. Using a global value chain analysis, the research identifies the flow of timber along the value chain, the different actors involved in the trade, and the institutions that shape the actor's access to the value chain, before calculating the profits among the different actors. The results show the Sino-Burmese border timber trade originated from traditional border trade and was recently booming along with the economic development of China. Along the timber value chain, however, a few privileged actors parasitize the timber value by exploiting real market participants with the power entitled to them by both governments. The research argues the challenges to improve sustainable timber trade lie not only in national law enforcement, but also improving the governance structure of the value chain by improving the transparency and accountability of timber harvesting concessions and trade permits.

In this study, we functionally characterized a DREB2-like gene, OsDRAP1 conferring drought tolerance (DT) in rice. OsDRAP1, containing many cis-elements in its promoter region, was expressed in all organs (mainly expressed in vascular tissues) of rice, and induced by a variety of environmental stresses and plant hormones. Overexpressing OsDRAP1 transgenic plants exhibited significantly improved DT; while OsDRAP1 RNA interfering plants exhibited significantly reduced DT which also accompanied with significant negative effects on development and yield. Overexpression of OsDRAP1 has a positive impact on maintaining water balance, redox homeostasis and vascular development in transgenic rice plants under drought stress. OsDRAP1 interacted with many genes/proteins and could activate many downstream DT related genes, including important transcription factors such as OsCBSX3 to response drought stress, indicating the OsDRAP1 -mediated pathways for DT involve complex genes networks. All these results provide a basis for further complete understanding of the OsDRAP1 mediated gene networks and their related phenotypic effects.

Cells were facultatively anaerobic, terminal endospore-forming and motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Colonies were yellowish and the cells showed oxidase-negative and catalase-positive reactions. Strain EGI 80668(T) grew at pH 8.0-10.0 and with 0-10% (w/v) NaCl (optimally at pH 9.0 and with 1-2% NaCl) on marine agar 2216. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-17 : 0 and anteiso-C-15 : 0. The cellular polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, four unknown phospholipids and one unknown aminophospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 38.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 80668(T) was affiliated to the genus Bacillus. The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain EGI 80668(T) and a member of the genus Bacillus was 96.83% with Bacillus cellulosilyticus JCM 9156(T). A polyphasic taxonomic study based on morphological, physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic data indicated that strain EGI 80668(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus tamaricis sp. nov. (type strain EGI 80668(T)=KCTC 33703(T)=CGMCC 1.15917(T)) is proposed.

In addition, the charge transfer efficiency of the films prepared from these TiO2 nanocrystals was also evaluated by measuring the conductivity and charge transfer resistance. It was found that the concentration of Ti(SO4)(2) in the solution used for nanocrystal production has profound effects on particle size and charge transfer efficiency of the nanocrystals thus prepared. However, the same pattern was not observed in case of morphological features of the nanocrystals.

To improve the dispersion of graphene in ethanol, one possible strategy is to add different oxidizing agents to graphene. This leads to the formation of graphene dispersions in ethanol, and they have great stability. However, ultrasonication is required to bring about the synthesis of stable graphene dispersions in ethanol. In this paper, the surface-modified graphene was synthesized by two methods, which improved the dispersion of graphene in ethanol. In these methods, the modified graphene was incorporated into the carbon electrode in order to improve the conductivity of carbon electrode in perovskite solar cells. Thus, battery efficiency was improved significantly in solar cells by following this innovative strategy. We studied the conductivity effects of surface-modified graphene using different drying methods. Compared to the carbon electrode (without added graphene), the resistivity of grapheneincorporated carbon electrode significantly decreased from 1.130E-03 Omega.m to 8.429E-05 Omega.m when the carbon electrode was successfully subjected to carboxylation reaction; moreover, the resistivity of graphene-incorporated carbon electrode reduced to 1.163E-04 Omega.m when the electrode was successfully subjected to hydroxylation reaction. The value of R-Ct decreased sharply when we add modified graphene. The results indicate that when carbon electrode incorporated modified graphene, the resistivity became low and the electron transport properties of the electrode improved sharply. However, the efficiency of carboxylated graphene is much better than that of hydroxylated graphene.

As fluorescence of papain-Au NCs is quenched in the presence of dopamine under alkaline conditions, we were able to establish a simple, selective analytical method for dopamine determination. By studying the fluorescence lifetime and dynamic light scattering of the NCs before and after interaction with dopamine, we found that this fluorescence quenching mechanism was possibly due to dopamine self-polymerization that produced polydopamine that cross-linked papain-Au NCs. Based on this new phenomenon, we proposed a highly selective analytical method for dopamine detection. Other small organic molecules, such as amino acids, ascorbic acid and uric acid did not interfere with dopamine detection. Dopamine in the range 20-100M can be linearly detected by the fluorescence quenching ratio of gold nanoclusters. Dopamine detection could be visually realized by watching color changes of papain-Au NCs under UV light or daylight, as both fluorescence and absorption of the papain-Au NCs changed during dopamine polymerization.

Here, we explored their demographic history and genetic basis of adaptation to the tropical African environment using whole genome analyses of 19 African indigenous dogs from Nigeria. Demographic analysis suggests that the ancestors of these dogs migrated into Africa from Eurasia 14,000 years ago and underwent a severe founder effect before population expansion. Admixture analysis further reveals that African dog genomes contain about 1.88-3.50% introgression from African golden wolves (Canis anthus). Population genetic analysis identifies 50 positively selected genes linked with immunity, angiogenesis, ultraviolet protection, as well as insulin secretion and sensitivity that may contribute to adaptation to tropical conditions. One of the positively selected genes, adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1 (ADGRE1), has also been found to be association with severe malaria resistance in African human populations. Functional assessments showed that ADGRE1 provides protective host defense against Plasmodium infections. This result, together with the fact that the inflammatory response to canine babesiosis is similar to complicated falciparum malaria in humans, support the dogs as a model for the study of malaria control and treatment.

In particular, actuator failures and time-varying delay with a known upper bound on the sampling intervals are taken into account of the considered system. By using a matrix inequality approach and by constructing a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that utilizes the complete available information about the actual sampling pattern and time-varying delay, we formulate stability conditions and a control design procedure in the form of linear matrix inequalities for obtaining the required result. More precisely, a dissipative based non-fragile reliable sampled-data controller is designed such that the resulting closed-loop switched system is reliable in the sense that it is exponentially stable and satisfies certain dissipative performance index under the given conditions. It should be mentioned that the implemented Lyapunov functionals are more general since they incorporate the nonlinearities of the system model in its design. Further, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through a numerical example to show the validity and applicability of the proposed design technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We report the first dynamic covalent thermoset-based e-skin, which is connected through robust covalent bonds, rendering the resulting devices good chemical and thermal stability at service condition. By doping the dynamic covalent thermoset with conductive silver nanoparticles, we demonstrate a robust yet rehealable, fully recyclable, and malleable e-skin. Tactile, temperature, flow, and humidity sensing capabilities are realized. The e-skin can be rehealed when it is damaged and can be fully recycled at room temperature, which has rarely, if at all, been demonstrated for e-skin. After rehealing or recycling, the e-skin regains mechanical and electrical properties comparable to the original e-skin. In addition, malleability enables the e-skin to permanently conform to complex, curved surfaces without introducing excessive interfacial stresses. These properties of the e-skin yield an economical and eco-friendly technology that can find broad applications in robotics, prosthetics, health care, and human-computer interface.

Research has presented inconsistent conclusions regarding hearing impairment posing a risk for cognitive impairment. We aimed to assess this from published evidence via searching PubMed and Embase, from the inception of the databases indexed to December 2, 2016. For those high-quality studies retrieved, relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to estimate the risk of cognitive impairment. Eleven cohort studies were included in the present study. Pooled results found that elderly people with disabled peripheral and central hearing function had a higher risk of cognitive impairment (for moderate/severe peripheral hearing impairment: RR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.59 during a follow-up = 6 years. RR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.13-2.20 during a follow-up >6 years; for severe central hearing impairment, RR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.19-8.69) compared to those with normal hearing function. We also recorded a dose-response trend for cognitive impairment as hearing thresholds rose. No evident bias from potential confounding factors was found with one exception: the length for clinical follow-up. Although results are preliminary because qualifying studies were few, statistical findings were consistent with older people identified as having greater levels of hearing loss, having a corresponding higher risk of cognitive impairment.

Despite various approaches have been presented to improve the recognition accuracy, they are rarely extended to online recognition task in clutter scenes. In this paper, we propose an effective approach, which is insensitive to various temporal duration and adequate for complex background, for human action recognition using depth sequences. By embedding the skeleton information into depth maps, the human body is partitioned to a set of motion parts, which could take account of the geometrical structure of human body and contribute to the recognition task in complex background. A local spatio-temporal scaled pyramid is applied to obtain compact local feature representation. The simplified Fisher vector encoding method is introduced to aggregate local coarse features into a discriminative representation with unified form. The proposed approach is validated on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR Daily Activity 3D, MSR Action Pairs, and MSR Action 3D. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed approach for real-time applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The characterization results of the morphology, microstructure, and surface properties of the as-prepared products demonstrated that SnO2 nanosheets with a tetragonal rutile structure, were composed of oriented SnO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 6-12 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (FETEM) results demonstrated that the dominant exposed surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles was (101), but not (110). The growth and formation was supposed to follow the oriented attachment mechanism. The SnO2 nanosheets exhibited an excellent sensing response toward ethylene glycol at a lower optimal operating voltage of 3.4 V. The response to 400 ppm ethylene glycol reaches 395 at 3.4 V. Even under the low concentration of 5, 10, and 20 ppm, the sensor exhibited a high response of 6.9, 7.8, and 12.0 to ethylene glycol, respectively. The response of the SnO2 nanosheets exhibited a linear dependence on the ethylene glycol concentration from 5 to 1000 ppm. The excellent sensing performance was attributed to the present SnO2 nanoparticles with small size close to the Debye length, the larger specific surface, the high-energy exposed facets of the (101) surface, and the synergistic effects of the SnO2 nanoparticles of the nanosheets.

This study is the first to examine nonnative plant distribution in a popular eastern Himalayan national park. A total of 61 non-native plant species were found in roadside plant communities, which are frequently disturbed by hikers, pack animals, and recreational vehicles. These species were annual or biennial herbs, most of which originated in America or Europe. Non-native plant richness varied with the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. Specifically, greater numbers of non-native species were found at road heads and ends, which are generally subject to intense human activity. The average number of non-native species also varied according to the type of road and road use, with more present along motor roads and horse-riding trails than along hiking trails. These results highlight the role of vehicles and pack animals as dispersal vectors and provide a foundation for future invasion management decisions. To prevent the spread of non-native plants from park roads to the adjacent landscape, we also recommend the development of educational and monitoring programs that encourage tourist participation in conservation efforts.

We study the radiation characteristics of the generators based on radiation vector and antenna array theory. The behaviors of radiation patterns, field intensity and phase distribution are investigated in detail, and show classical features of OAM beams. The evolution of the generators performance versus the OAM state is also analyzed. The proposed generators can be realized by all kinds of microwave transmission lines, verified by two different prototypes. The discussions and conclusions drawn in this study are useful and meaningful for the radio OAM generator design.

It was found that the corrosion rate law of X70 steel in each studied soil tends to be different with the change of moisture content due to the combined effects between soil moisture content and chloride ion content. The values of the corrosion rate were maxima with soil moisture content of 20% except that for the Muse soil where the corrosion rate was minimal with moisture content of 20%. The values of E-corr were shifted to more negative values with increasing soil moisture content of up to 60%, and then there was an appreciable increase in the value of E-corr. However, the value of E-corr was shifted to more negative value with increasing Made Kyun soil moisture content of up to 80%. A good uniformity between the data obtained from polarization curves and EIS measurements results. X70 steel was serious corroded in Made Kyun beach and Made Kyun regions via the data of EIS, polarization curves and SEM result from the different content of chloride in different areas.

A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5 SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth. This achievement directly supports the Wrapper method of effective feature selection without the need to consider the problem of huge amounts of data; this is a novel innovation in this work.

Pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolating barriers can impede hybridization between closely related species to maintain their species integrity. In Northwest Yunnan, three Ligularia species (Ligularia cyathiceps, L. duciformis and L. yunnanensis) and four types of morphologically intermediate individuals were discovered growing together in an area subject to human disturbance. In this study, we used three low-copy nuclear loci to test the natural hybridization hypothesis and the hybridization direction was ascertained by three chloroplast DNA fragments. The results indicated there were two hybridization groups at the study site, L. cyathiceps x L. duciformis and L. duciformis x L. yunnanensis, and two types of morphologically intermediate individuals were produced by L. cyathiceps and L. duciformis, and another two types were produced by L. duciformis and L. yunnanensis, while no hybrids between L. cyathiceps and L. yunnanensis were observed. Both hybridizing groups showed bidirectional but asymmetric hybridization and the factors influencing the symmetry are discussed. Most hybrids produced by the two hybridization groups seemed to be F-1 generation. Hybrids with different morphologies within the same hybridization group showed similar genetic components. The results suggest that although human disturbance may promote natural hybridization among the three Ligularia species bringing them together, hybrids are limited to F(1)s and therefore species boundaries might be maintained.

Compounds 1 and 2 are the first seco-dendrobines possessing a seven membered lactam moiety, with 3 and 4 derived from the oxidative cleavage of the C-2-C-3 bond of dendrobine. The structures were established using spectroscopic methods and by comparison with literature data. The absolute configurations of 1-4 were confirmed via single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Cytotoxic activity assays against HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480 human cancer cell lines revealed IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 5.3 mu M for compound 7, from 19.4 to 34.4 mu M for 8, and from 49.4 to 96.8 mu g/mL for the EtOAc extract.

To summarize the patterns of phytoplankton community changes in rivers and to analyze the reasons for these patterns and differences, we sampled the three tributaries of the Dongjiang River at different latitudes in the dry and rainy season for three years. The results showed that the three rivers were mesotrophic, lightly eutrophic and moderately eutrophic respectively. From the south to the north, the water temperature and nutrition showed an increasing trend. In two different seasons, the differences in the water temperature and dissolved oxygen were clear. In the dry season, results of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated that the phytoplankton community structures in the Li River and Qiuxiang River were similar. Regardless of the number of species, the cell abundance or the dominance index, Bacillariophyta were found to be dominant. Chlorophyta was dominant in the Danshui River. In the rainy season, Bacillariophyta, Bacillariophyta-Chlorophyta and Chlorophyta-Cyanophyta became the dominant types in the Li River, Qiuxiang River and Danshui River, respectively. These different patterns in phytoplankton community variation were affected by both the water quality and temperature.

Therefore, it is very necessary to measure and evaluate the trustworthy degree of cloud service provider (CSP). In consideration of lacking the trustworthiness evaluation and measurement studies for CSP, besides this, a few research results have not considered uncertainty and relevance among trustworthiness factors in the measuring process. So, this paper summarizes factors affecting cloud service trustworthiness in terms of six aspects: controllability, visualization, security, reliability, provider viability and user satisfaction, constructs the trustworthy cloud service attribute model, based on this model, proposes to use the Information Entropy and Markov Chain as the trustworthiness evaluation method to establish a model and proves the scientificity and rationality of this method, as well as verifies the feasibility through case analysis.

Therefore, glacial lakes play an important role on the cryosphere, climate change and alpine hazards. In this paper, the issues of glacial lake were systematically discussed, then from the view of glacial lake inventory and glacial lake hazards study, the glacial lake was defined as natural water mainly supplied by modern glacial meltwater or formed in glacier moraine's depression. Furthermore, a complete classification system of glacial lake was proposed based on its formation mechanism, topographic feature and geographical position. Glacial lakes were classified as 6 classes and 8 subclasses, i.e., glacial erosion lake (including cirque lake, glacial valley lake and other glacial erosion lake), moraine-dammed lake (including end moraine-dammed lake, lateral moraine-dammed lake and moraine thaw lake), ice-blocked lake (including advancing glacier-blocked lake and other glacier-blocked lake), supraglacial lake, subglacial lake and other glacial lake. Meanwhile, some corresponding features exhibiting on remote sensing image and quantitative indices for identifying different glacial lake types were proposed in order to build a universal and operational classification system of glacial lake.

J	Sun, MP; Liu, SY; Yao, XJ; Guo, WQ; Xu, JL				Sun, Meiping; Liu, Shiyin; Yao, Xiaojun; Guo, Wanqin; Xu, Junli			Glacier changes in the Qilian Mountains in the past half-century: Based on the revised First and Second Chinese Glacier Inventory	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						glacier change; glacier inventory; glacier volume; climate change; Qilian Mountains	RECOMMENDATIONS	Glaciers are the most important fresh-water resources in arid and semi-arid regions of western China. According to the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI), primarily compiled from Landsat TM/ETM+ images, the Qilian Mountains had 2684 glaciers covering an area of 1597.81 +/- 70.30 km2 and an ice volume of similar to 84.48 km(3) from 2005 to 2010. While most glaciers are small (85.66% are < 1.0 km(2)), some larger ones (12.74% in the range 1.0-5.0 km(2)) cover 42.44% of the total glacier area. The Laohugou Glacier No.12 (20.42 km(2)) located on the north slope of the Daxue Range is the only glacier > 20 km(2) in the Qilian Mountains. Median glacier elevation was 4972.7 m and gradually increased from east to west. Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are distributed in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, which have 1492 glaciers (760.96 km(2)) and 1192 glaciers (836.85 km(2)), respectively. The Shule River basin contains the most glaciers in both area and volume. However, the Heihe River, the second largest inland river in China, has the minimum average glacier area. A comparison of glaciers from the SCGI and revised glacier inventory based on topographic maps and aerial photos taken from 1956 to 1983 indicate that all glaciers have receded, which is consistent with other mountain and plateau areas in western China. In the past half-century, the area and volume of glaciers decreased by 420.81 km(2) (-20.88%) and 21.63 km(3) (-20.26%), respectively. Glaciers with areas < 1.0 km(2) decreased the most in number and area recession. Due to glacier shrinkage, glaciers below 4000 m completely disappeared. Glacier changes in the Qilian Mountains presented a clear longitudinal zonality, i.e., the glaciers rapidly shrank in the east but slowly in the central-west. The primary cause of glacier recession was warming temperatures, which was slightly mitigated with increased precipitation.

Early detection of a highly invasive bivalve based on environmental DNA (eDNA)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						eDNA; Golden mussel; Invasive species; Limnoperna fortunei; Primer sensitivity; Sampling strategy	MUSSEL LIMNOPERNA-FORTUNEI; REAL-TIME PCR; MYTILIDAE; SURVEILLANCE; SENSITIVITY; PERSISTENCE; SPREAD	Management of non-indigenous invasive species (NIS) is challenging owing in part to limitations of early detection and identification. The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques provides an efficient way to detect NIS when their abundance is extremely low. However, eDNA-based methods often suffer from uncertain detection sensitivity, which requires detailed testing before applying these methods in the field. Here we developed an eDNA tool for early detection of the highly invasive golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI). Further, we tested technical issues, including sampling strategy and detection sensitivity, based on a laboratory experiment. We then applied the method to field samples collected from water bodies in China where this mussel has or is expected to colonize. Results showed that the detection limit varied extensively among our newly developed primer pairs, ranging from 4 x 10(-2) to 4 x 10(-6) ng of total genomic DNA. Laboratory detection was affected by the availability of eDNA (i.e., both mussel abundance and incubation time). Detection capacity was higher in laboratory samples containing re-suspended matter from the bottom layer versus that collected from the surface. Among 25 field sites, detection was 100% at sites with high mussel abundance and as low as 40% at sites with low abundance when tested using our most sensitive primer pair. Early detection of NIS present at low abundance in nature requires not only sensitive primers, but also an optimized sampling strategy to reduce the occurrence of false negatives. Careful selection and detailed testing of primer pairs ensures effective eDNA-based species detection in surveillance and management programs.	[Xia, Zhiqiang; Haffner, G.

The PREs occurring over China's low-latitude highlands (CLLH) in association with Bay of Bengal TCs were investigated from 1981 to 2012. Results indicate that about 19% of Bay of Bengal TCs produces PRE. The PREs frequently occur when TCs are active in the northern Bay of Bengal with northeastward paths. The PREs are more likely to appear in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, with peaks in May and October, respectively. The median lifetime of the PREs was approximately two days. The distances between PREs and parent TCs are ranged from 745 to 1849 km, with a median distance of 1118 km. Composite results of PREs suggested that deep moisture is advected from the TC vicinity to the remote CLLH region, which is situated beneath the equatorward entrance of the upper-level East Asia subtropical jet (EASJ). The lower-level southwesterly flow, which is associated with a strong pressure gradient between the western Pacific subtropical high and a trough in Bay of Bengal, steers TCs conveying abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal to the CLLH region. The enhancement of the ascent and frontogenesis within the equatorward entrance region of the EASJ is favorable for occurrence of PREs in CLLH. TCs may also have a dynamical role in occurrence of PREs by intensifying the upper-level EASJ.

Inference from analytical prediction of high signal-to-noise ratio convergence peaks	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; dark matter; large-scale structure of Universe	NONLINEAR CLUSTER INVERSION; LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DARK-MATTER; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; GRAVITATIONAL DISTORTIONS; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; GALAXY FORMATION; SHEAR PEAKS; MASS	This paper is the first of a series of papers constraining cosmological parameters with weak lensing peak statistics using similar to 450 deg(2) of imaging data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450). We measure high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR: nu) weak lensing convergence peaks in the range of 3 < nu < 5, and employ theoretical models to derive expected values. These models are validated using a suite of simulations. We take into account two major systematic effects, the boost factor and the effect of baryons on the mass-concentration relation of dark matter haloes. In addition, we investigate the impacts of other potential astrophysical systematics including the projection effects of large-scale structures, intrinsic galaxy alignments, as well as residual measurement uncertainties in the shear and redshift calibration. Assuming a flat Lambda cold dark matter model, we find constraints for S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.746(-0.107)(+0.046) according to the degeneracy direction of the cosmic shear analysis and Sigma(8) = s8(Omega(m)/0.3) 0.38 = 0.696(-0.050)(+0.048) based on the derived degeneracy direction of our high-SNR peak statistics. The difference between the power index of S-8 and in Sigma(8) indicates that combining cosmic shear with peak statistics has the potential to break the degeneracy in sigma(8) and Omega(m). Our results are consistent with the cosmic shear tomographic correlation analysis of the same data set and similar to 2s lower than the Planck 2016 results.

J	Fang, J; Yu, H; Zhang, L				Fang, Jun; Yu, Huan; Zhang, Li			An explanation of the formation of the peculiar periphery of Tycho's supernova remnant	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrodynamics; methods: numerical; ISM: individual objects: Tycho's SNR; ISM: supernova remnants	X-RAY; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; IA SUPERNOVAE; WHITE-DWARFS; EMISSION; EXPANSION; EVOLUTION; EJECTA; SHOCK; ENVELOPE	Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has a periphery that clearly deviates from a spherical shape, based on X-ray and radio observations. The forward shock from the south-east to the north of the remnant has a deformed outline with a depression in the east, although in the west it is generally round and smooth. Moreover, at some locations in the shell, the supernova ejecta is located close to the forward shock, resulting in protrusions. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we studied the dynamical evolution of the supernova ejecta in an inhomogeneous medium and the formation process of the profile of the forward shock. In order to reproduce the peculiar periphery of the remnant, we propose a model in which the supernova ejecta has evolved in a cavity blown by a latitude-dependent outflow. The results indicate that the depression to the east and the protrusion to the south-east on the observed periphery of the remnant can be generally reproduced if we assume a wind bubble driven by an anisotropic wind with a mass-loss rate of similar to 10(-7)M(circle dot) yr(-1), a pole velocity of similar to 100 km s(-1), a duration of similar to 10(5) yr prior to the supernova explosion, and a spatial velocity of similar to 30 km s(-1) of the progenitor with respect to the circumstellar medium. In conclusion, an explanation of the peculiar shape of the periphery of Tycho's SNR is that the supernova ejecta evolved in the cavity driven by a latitude-dependent wind.

Using an efficient machine-learning algorithm, we find these stars from more than 7 million spectra. As a by-product, 17 carbon-enhanced metal-poor turnoff star candidates are also reported in this paper, and they are preliminarily identified by their atmospheric parameters. Except for 176 stars that could not be given spectral types, we classify the other 2475 carbon stars into five subtypes: 864 C-H, 226 C-R, 400 C-J, 266 C-N, and 719 barium stars based on a series of spectral features. Furthermore, we divide the C-J stars into three subtypes, C-J(H), C-J(R), and C-J(N), and about 90% of them are cool N-type stars as expected from previous literature. Besides spectroscopic classification, we also match these carbon stars to multiple broadband photometries. Using ultraviolet photometry data, we find that 25 carbon stars have FUV detections and that they are likely to be in binary systems with compact white dwarf companions.

The framework now supports radial grid stretching in combination with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The advantages of this combined approach are demonstrated with one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional examples of spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, steady planar Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, and wind accretion in supergiant X-ray binaries. Another improvement is support for the generic splitting of any background magnetic field. We present several tests relevant for solar physics applications to demonstrate the advantages of field splitting on accuracy and robustness in extremely low-plasma beta environments: a static magnetic flux rope, a magnetic null-point, and magnetic reconnection in a current sheet with either uniform or anomalous resistivity. Our implementation for treating anisotropic thermal conduction in multi-dimensional MHD applications is also described, which generalizes the original slope-limited symmetric scheme from two to three dimensions. We perform ring diffusion tests that demonstrate its accuracy and robustness, and show that it prevents the unphysical thermal flux present in traditional schemes. The improved parallel scaling of the code is demonstrated with three-dimensional AMR simulations of solar coronal rain, which show satisfactory strong scaling up to 2000 cores. Other framework improvements are also reported: the modernization and reorganization into a library, the handling of automatic regression tests, the use of inline/online Doxygen documentation, and a new future-proof data format for input/output.

Here, we reanalyze the same set of XMM-Newton data observed on 2008 February 4 with the weighted-wavelet Z-transform method. In addition to confirming the previous findings, we also find another QPO signal with a frequency of similar to 1.2 x 10-4 Hz in a separated X-ray emission phase at the significance level of similar to 3.7 sigma. The signal is also found fitting an autoregressive model though at a lower significance. The frequency ratio between these two signals is similar to 2: 1. The analysis of other XMM-Newton measurements of 1H 0707-495 also reveals the presence of the similar to 2.6 x10(-4) Hz (similar to 1.2 x 10(-4) Hz) QPO signal on 2007 May 14 (2010 September 17) at the significance level of similar to 4.2 sigma (similar to 3.5 sigma). The QPO frequency found in this work follows the fQPO-MBH relation reported in previous works spanning from stellar mass to supermassive black holes. This is the first observation of two separated transient X-ray QPO signals in active galactic nuclei, which sheds a new light on the physics of accreting supermassive black holes.

To learn the BN-based uncertain knowledge incrementally in response to the new data is useful for analysis, prediction, decision making, etc. In this paper, we propose an approach for incremental learning of BNs by focusing on the incremental revision of BN's graphical structures. First, we give the concept of influence degree to describe the influence of new data on the existing BN by measuring the variation of BN's probability parameters w.r.t. the likelihood of the new data. Then, for the nodes ordered decreasingly by their influence degrees, we give the scoring-based algorithm for revising BN's subgraphs iteratively by hill-climbing search for reversing, adding or deleting edges. In the incremental revision, we emphasize the preservation of probabilistic conditional independencies implied in the BN based on the concept and properties of Markov equivalence. Experimental results show the correctness, precision and efficiency of our approach.

Many studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are crucial for cancer progression, during which they can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Previous research has shown that miR-335 is downregulated in breast cancer, and it has been shown to be a breast cancer suppressor. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4) is implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, little is known about the relationship between miR-335 and EphA4 in breast cancer. In the present study, we used bioinformatic and biochemical analyses to demonstrate that EphA4 is a direct downstream target of miR-335 in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-23 cells and revealed that miR-335 negatively regulates the expression of EphA4 in these cells. Further investigation revealed that miR-335 overexpression inhibits MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and that this inhibition is attenuated by EphA4 coexpression. Similarly, miR-335 overexpression also inhibited growth and downregulated EphA4 expression in tumors in nude mice. Moreover, our results demonstrated that miR-335 overexpression suppresses migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, an effect that was reversed by EphA4 overexpression. These findings confirmed that EphA4 is a direct target gene of miR-335 and that miR-335 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and motility in part by directly inhibiting EphA4 expression.

It is also a place where landscape has experienced dramatic evolution during the Holocene when both sea level and climate changed, such that it is an ideal place for studying human-environment interaction. This study investigated over 2000 sites of pre-history and Shang and Zhou Dynasties, with 655 of which being Neolithic ages, by using DEM and GIS methods. The results suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of Neolithic sites has largely been controlled by landscape evolution (particularly changes in coastal line), which ultimately governed by sea level changes. During early Holocene, Neolithic sites sparsely distributed in the intermountain basins of east Zhejiang Province, far from the influence of ocean. Over the period of 9-7 ka, the coastal plain (including the shelf) was largely submerged, only the feet of low hills to the south and southwest of the study area, and islands protruding the estuary, cradled limited number of settlements with characteristic "maritime components". At about 7 ka, sea level rise decelerated prominently, while sediments supply in the drainage remained high value, the combination of which led to land formation and propagation. Vast space during this period facilitated the growth of settlements in both size and number. In the mean time, however, the coastal plain was vulnerable to extreme environmental events such as storms and flooding owning to its geomorphic nature, which exerted great influence on the rise and fall of Neolithic culture.

China is one of the few regions in the world where the earliest complex society appeared; however, its driving mechanisms remain unresolved. On the base of available evidence from both archaeology and Holocene climate, in combination with agency theory, this study attempts to address the driving mechanisms for the simultaneous emergence of complex societies in multiple areas of China around 5.5 cal ka BP. It is hypothesized that three factors, including climate change, population growth, and circumscription, jointly act and cause regional population-resource imbalance and trigger inter-group conflicts and wars. Such competitions provide the opportunity for some power-pursuing agents to break the restriction of social leveling mechanism and to become the centralized decision-making leaders, which further lead to the emergence of incipient large-scale complex societies. Increase in extreme climate events during 6.0-5.0 cal ka BP cooling period causes frequent occurrence of resource stress and increase in the frequency of inter-group competitions, which creates conditions for the legitimation, institutionalization, and persistence of centralized leadership, and finally leads to the formation of persistent institutionalized inequity. Our research result can explain not only the process and mechanism of complex society formation, but also two phenomena which cannot be reasonably explained by previous theories, that are, why the earliest complex societies in China emerge around 5.5 cal ka BP, and why they appear simultaneously in multiple regions.

Although this variability is partly expressed in the specialization of the protopodite for a feeding function in the post-deutocerebral limbs, the origin of the former structure among Cambrian representatives remains uncertain. Here, we describe Alacaris mirabilis gen. et sp. nov. from the early Cambrian Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte in China, which reveals the proximal organization of fuxianhuiid appendages in exceptional detail. Proximally, the post-deutocerebral limbs possess an antero-posteriorly compressed protopodite with robust spines. The protopodite is attached to an endopod with more than a dozen podomeres, and an oval flap-shaped exopod. The gnathal edges of the protopodites form an axial food groove along the ventral side of the body, indicating a predatory/scavenging autecology. A cladistic analysis indicates that the fuxianhuiid protopodite represents the phylogenetically earliest occurrence of substantial proximal differentiation within stem-group Euarthropoda illuminating the origin of gnathobasic feeding.

The structure, morphology, and surface chemical states of the obtained Ni(OH)(2)@Ni foam were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The chemical formation mechanism is discussed. In addition, it was found that the loading amount and morphology of the deposited Ni(OH)(2) depend largely on the corrosion time. Furthermore, electrodes corroded for different times were then directly used as working electrodes to investigate the areal and specific capacitances of the deposited Ni(OH)(2) by using cyclic voltammetry, through which a relationship between the corrosion time, loading amount, morphology, and final capacitance is built up. The electrode with the highest areal capacitance was further studied with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge processes, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-prepared Ni(OH)(2)@Ni foam is a typical pseudocapacitance electrode. At a high current density of 5 mA cm(-2), the electrode exhibits an areal capacitance of 0.863 F cm(-2). For the deposited Ni(OH)(2), its specific capacitance reaches 693 F g(-1) at a current density of 4 A g(-1). After 3000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density as high as 10 A g(-1) (12.5 mA cm(-2)), the areal capacitance retains 77.3% of its initial value. The findings in this work could be meaningful for the corrosion preparation of related electrodes and the design of binder-free electrodes.

Host phylogeny and diet, especially long-term diet, both have great influence on the gut bacterial community. Other aspects of host, such as gender, age, and the geography and weather they lived, are also correlated to their gut bacterial community. Feces are usually used for gut bacteria study and fecal bacteria can represent the distal gut bacteria. In order to determine the influence of the host phylogeny and diet on the composition of distal gut bacterial community and to interpret bacterial population and diversity in the intestinal of animals, the distal gut bacterial community of four kinds of primates and five kinds of carnivora (including herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous) were investigated using high-throughput sequencing and the isolation of the Actinobacteria from fresh feces of several primates was processed. The results showed the host phylogeny had a greater influence on the distal gut bacterial community of the primates and carnivora than the host diet. A total of 44 bacteria phyla and two archaea phyla were detected, which indicated that the distal gut bacteria of these animals were abundant. The distal gut bacteria were relatively stable and wildly shared in primates and carnivora. The difference in distal gut bacteria of the two animal orders is mainly determined by relative abundance of most distal gut bacteria rather than by the taxa of these bacteria.

Meanwhile, the capacitance degradation is only 5% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles with a current density of 10 A/g. These excellent electrochemical performances can be attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity, the improved surface activity and the facilitated charge transportation during charging and discharging process, which are caused by the introduction of carbon sphere and the appropriate structure, respectively.

BL-LACERTAE; INTRADAY VARIABILITY; RAPID VARIABILITY; LIGHT CURVES; S5 0716+714; QUASARS; BEHAVIOR; TIME; MICROVARIABILITY; GALAXIES	We present long-term optical multi-band photometric monitoring of blazar 3C 273, from 2006 May 19 to 2015 March 31 with high temporal resolution in the BVRI bands. The source is in a steady state and showed very small variability, with the values of the fractional variability amplitude of F-var = 0.457 +/- 0.014%, 0.391 +/- 0.012%, 0.264 +/- 0.043% and 0.460 +/- 0.014% in B, V, R and I, respectively. The intra-night point-to-point fractional variability (F-pp) in each band is below 1.0%, and the F-pp variation amplitude increase from the B-band to the I-band. We find a variability with the timescale of 5.8 +/- 2.9 minutes in the I-band on 2009 March 11. This fast variability requires the comoving magnetic field strength in the jet above 18 G with a Doppler factor delta(D) similar to 10. Using the discrete correlation function (DCF), the B- and I-band light curves are examined for correlation on whole campaign. Low significance (similar to 99.73 percent confidence) correlations with the I-band lags the B-band variations are observed. The spectral behaviors in the different variability episodes are studied. "Bluer-when-brighter" spectral behavior is presented for the whole campaign, while there is an opposite tendency when F-V > 30.2 mJy. The weak of the correlation between B- and I-band and the spectrum analysis indicate that the optical radiation consists of two variable components.

Portable Cu2+ test papers were obtained through dipping filter papers in as-prepared ZnO sol possessing the Cu2+ quenching property. Based on grey level which is obtained through ordinary digital camera and computer, the detection function of the fabricated Cu2+ test paper is extended from qualitative detection relied on naked eyes to quantitative detection whose detection range is calculated to be 10-1000 mu M. The fabricated test papers also could resist the interruption of some competing ions and is a potential candidate for portable Cu2+ detection device with quantitative function. Since the strategy of replacing fluorescence intensity by grey level is based on the map relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the digital signal (grey level), it is promising to be applied to other fluorescent test papers to gain quantitative test papers aimed at corresponding chemicals. At the same time, the mechanism of Cu2+-induced fluorescence quenching was also investigated by fluorescence lifetime, UV-vis spectra, and photoluminescence spectra. And a static quenching mechanism based on the non-fluorescence complex formed by Cu2+ and O-x(-) is brought up. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ground-based observation with zenith-sky DOAS is carried out in order to validate the HCHO columns from OMI. It has a good correlation of 0.71678 between the HCHO columns from two sources. Then we use the OMI HCHO columns from January 2006 to December 2015 to indicate the interannual variation and spatial distribution in Xishuangbanna. The HCHO concentration peaks appeared in March or April for each year significantly corresponding to the intensive fire counts at the same time, which illustrate that the high HCHO columns are strongly influenced by the biomass burning in spring. Temperature and precipitation are also the important influence factors in the seasonal variation when there is nearly no biomass burning. The spatial patterns over the past ten years strengthen the deduction from the temporal variation and show the relationship with land cover and land use, elevation and population density. It is concluded that the biogenic activity plays a role in controlling the background level of HCHO in Xishuangbanna, while biomass burning is themain driving force of high HCHO concentration. And forests are greater contributor to HCHO rather than rubber trees which cover over 20% of the land in the region. Moreover, uncertainties from HCHO slant column retrieval and AMFs calculation are discussed in detail. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Androgens can regulate transcriptional expression including reference gene expression in prostate cancer. In this study, we evaluated ten mRNA and six non-protein coding RNA reference genes in five prostate cell lines under varied dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatments. We validated the effects of DHT-treatments using media containing charcoalstripped serum prior to DHT stimulation on the test samples by Western blot experiments. Reference gene expression stability was analysed using three programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper), and the recommended comprehensive ranking is provided. Our results reveal that ACTB and GAPDH, and miR-16 and miR-1228-3p are the most suitable mRNA and miRNA reference genes across all cell lines, respectively. Considering prostate cancer cell types, ACTB/GAPDH and ACTB/HPRT1 are the most suitable reference gene combinations for mRNA analysis, and miR-16/miR-1228-3p and RNU6-2/RNU43 for miRNA analysis in AR+, and AR-and normal cell lines, respectively. Comparison of relative target gene (PCA3 and miR-141) expression reveals different patterns depending on reference genes used for normalisation. To our knowledge, this is the first report on validation of reference genes under different DHT treatments in prostate cancer cells. This study provides insights for discovery of reliable DHT-regulated genes in prostate cells.

When to conduct an isotopic survey for lake water balance evaluation in highly seasonal climates	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						isotopic survey; lake water balance; optimal sampling date; seasonal climate	SOUTHERN TIBETAN PLATEAU; STABLE-ISOTOPE; MASS-BALANCE; HYDROGEN ISOTOPES; DEUTERIUM-EXCESS; NORTHERN CANADA; UNITED-STATES; EVAPORATION; DELTA-O-18; OXYGEN	One-time or short-term lake water isotopic surveys are often employed to evaluate regional lake water balance. However, it can be difficult to determine the optimal time-window for sampling to obtain a representative long-term perspective of lake water balance in settings influenced by seasonal variations in precipitation, evaporative loss, glacial/snow meltwater, and larger seasonal shifts in isotopic composition of precipitation. This is especially true for areas of the Tibetan Plateau that are influenced by the summer Indian monsoon. Although high-frequency sampling is always preferred as the most rigorous approach to characterize the water budget of lakes or watersheds, this may be impractical in remote regions and over large spatial scales. To assess the potential sensitivity of isotope balance characterization to seasonal variability, we used a weekly lake water isotope data set acquired over a period of 3years on the Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the potential inaccuracies that might have arisen from using isotopic data collected during narrower time-windows. For this assessment, we use weekly isotopic data collected during the study and assume that these sampling events were stand-alone one-time surveys. We then demonstrate the sensitivity of the isotope balance method in this setting, particularly for the rainy season that significantly underestimated the evaporation/inflow. In contrast, isotopic composition of the lake water was found to be more representative of long-term conditions when sampled in October on the Tibetan Plateau. To broaden our evaluation of seasonality effects over a range of climatic zones, published high-frequency isotopic data were also compiled, and a similar assessment was carried out for selected regions of the world. The synthesized data and model outputs, which confirm pronounced variations in lake water isotopic composition and evaporation/inflow across a range of seasonal climates, were used to determine optimal sampling windows for these specific regions.

The nonthermal radiative properties of 18 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are studied in the 1D leptonic model. Methods. The dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a nonradiative supernova remnant are self-consistently investigated in this model. The leptons (electrons/positrons) are injected with a broken power-law form, and nonthermal emission from a PWN is mainly produced by time-dependent relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton process. Results. Observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of all 18 PWNe are reproduced well, where the indexes of low-energy electron components lie in the range of 1.0-1.8 and those of high-energy electron components in the range of 2.1-3.1. Our results show that F-X/F-gamma > 10 for young PWNe; 1 < F-X/F-gamma <= 10 for evolved PWNe, except for G292.0 + 1.8; and F-X/F-gamma <= 1 for mature/old PWNe, except for CTA 1. Moreover, most PWNe are particle-dominated. Statistical analysis for the sample of 14 PWNe further indicate that (1) not all pulsar parameters have correlations with electron injection parameters, but electron maximum energy and PWN magnetic field correlate with the magnetic field at the light cylinder, the potential difference at the polar cap, and the spin-down power; (2) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, bolometric, and synchrotron luminosities, but does not correlate with gamma-ray luminosity; (3) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, and gamma-band surface brightness; and (4) the PWN radius and the PWN age negatively correlate with X-ray luminosity, the ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray luminosities, and the synchrotron luminosity.

The well-defined cage structure and thioether anchoring groups inside the cavity are critical for the formation of narrowly distributed PdNPs, offering a confined organic molecular environment and guiding PdNP nucleation and growth. The resulting encapsulated PdNPs are resistant to agglomeration and stable in solution exposed to air at room temperature. When provided with a protective cage shell with minimum surface coverage, such PdNPs are capable of catalyzing organic reactions, showing high catalytic activity in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions.

Among them, the compound 8d, 8e, 8f, 8g and 81 displayed potent thymidine phosphorylase inhibitory activities with the IC50 values ranging between 0.12 +/- 0.05 and 7.2 +/- 1.4 mu M. And the compounds 8a, 8h, 8i, 8j, 8m, 8n, 8o, 8q, 8s, 8t and 8u (IC50 is from 10.7 to 39.9 mu M) showed a good thymidine phosphorylase inhibition when compared to the standard 7DX and TPI. The most biologically active compound 81 was demonstrated to be a competition mode of enzyme inhibition. The Molecular docking analysis showed the interaction of these newly synthesized compounds at the active binding site of thymidine phosphorylase based on the experimental results. In general, these results indicated these compounds are promising inhibitors of thymidine phosphorylase for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our targets reside in different regions of M31, including halo streams and the dwarf satellite M32, and kinematically deviate from the extended disk. The temperature-sensitive [O III] lambda 4363 line is observed in all PNe. For four PNe, the GTC spectra extend beyond 1 mu m, enabling the explicit detection of the [S III] lambda 6312 and lambda lambda 9069, 9531 lines and thus determination of the [S III] temperature. Abundance ratios are derived and generally consistent with AGB model predictions. Our PNe probably all evolved from low-mass (< 2M(circle dot)) stars, as analyzed with the most up-to-date post-AGB evolutionary models, and their main-sequence ages are mostly similar to 2-5. Gyr. Compared to the underlying, smooth, metal-poor halo of M31, our targets are uniformly metal rich ([O/H] greater than or similar to -0.4), and seem to resemble the younger population in the stream. We thus speculate that our halo PNe formed in the Giant Stream's progenitor through extended star formation. Alternatively, they might have formed from the same metal-rich gas as did the outer-disk PNe but were displaced into their present locations as a result of galactic interactions. These interpretations are, although speculative, qualitatively in line with the current picture, as inferred from previous wide-field photometric surveys, that M31's halo is the result of complex interactions and merger processes. The behavior of the N/O of the combined sample of the outer-disk and our halo/substructure PNe signifies that hot bottom burning might actually occur at < 3M(circle dot) but careful assessment is needed.

J	Huang, Y; Yin, WJ; He, Y				Huang, Yang; Yin, Wan-Jian; He, Yao			Intrinsic Point Defects in Inorganic Cesium Lead Iodide Perovskite CsPbI3	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOLERANT SEMICONDUCTORS; HALIDE PEROVSKITES; SOLAR-CELL; EVOLUTION; STABILITY; ENERGY	Cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has recently emerged as a promising solar photovoltaic absorber. However, the cubic perovskite (alpha-phase) remains stable only at high temperature and reverts to a photoinactive nonperovskite (gamma-phase) CsPbI3 at room temperature. In this work, the formation energies and transition energy levels of intrinsic point defects in gamma- (more stable than alpha-phase) and delta-phases have been studied systematically by first-principles calculations. It is found that CsPbI3 exhibits a unipolar self-doping behavior (p-type conductivity), which is in contrast to CH3NH3PbI3. Most of the intrinsic defects induce deeper transition energy levels in delta-phase than in y-phase. This is due to the small Pb-I-Pb bond angles in delta-phase that results in the weak antibonding character of valence band maximum (VBM). However, the strong antibonding character of VBM plays a critical role in keeping defect tolerance in semiconductors. Therefore, these results indicate the importance of the large metal halide metal bond angle for the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Efficient exciton-to-photon and photon-to-electron conversion promote quantum yield in optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells. Exciton-related reaction products and defects in working devices have previously been viewed as fatal to stability. Here, the utilization of these excitonic reactions to create luminescent defects with extremely high (6.7%) external quantum efficiency in an operating device containing 1,1-bis((di-4-tolylamino)phenyl) cyclohexane (TAPC) is reported. Transient photoluminescence reveals a long delayed fluorescence lifetime (2.7 mu s) from these emissive defects, indicating that they exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence. It is shown that the functional group of tri-p-tolylamine (TPTA) follows similar processes as TAPC, suggesting that the chemical nature of the observed luminescent defects is directly related to TPTA.

The IncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is reported to be an oncogene in a variety of cancers. However, the roles of PVT1-5 and its related miRNAs in lung cancer are poorly understood. In this study, we found that PVT1-5 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. By using biotin-labeled IncRNA-PVT1-5 probe for miRNA in vivo precipitation (miRIP) in lung cancer cells and dual-luciferase reporterassays, we identified that miR-126 was associated with IncRNA-PVT1-5. Furthermore, knockdown of IncRNA-PVT1-5 in cells could down regulate the expression of SLC7A5, the target of oncogenic miR-126, resulting in the cell proliferation. Conversely, inhibiting the expression of miR-126 markedly increased the expression of SLC7A5 and alleviated cell proliferation inhibition. Thus, our results indicated that IncRNA-PVT1-5 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-126 to promote cell proliferation by regulating the miR126/SLC7A5 pathway, suggesting that IncRNA-PVT1-5 plays a crucial role in lung cancer progression and IncRNA-PVT1-5/miR-126/SLC7A5 regulatory network may shed light on tumorigenesis in lung cancer.

A total of 93 soil samples were examined with the concentration of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) contents by using geostatistical approaches combined with geographic information system (GIS) analysis. The mean values of heavy metals were determined to be 7.9 +/- 5.8, 12.8 +/- 14.1, 80.4 +/- 42.0, 34.4 +/- 45.0, 0.12 +/- 0.13 +/- 368.5 +/- 873.6, and 369.6 +/- 505.5 mg kg(-1) (mean +/- SD) for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn, respectively. Contents of all heavy metals present in the study area were considerably higher than their background values of provincial and national standards except for As. A principle component analysis revealed the main origin of heavy metals: soil parent materials for Cu, Pb, and Zn; atmospheric deposition during mining processes for Cr, and Hg; and human farming activities for Cd. Carcinogenic risk was assessed with an average value of 69.3 x 10(-6) mg kg(-1), suggesting an average of 69 individuals per million people being predisposed to cancer. Meanwhile, the identification of heavy metal sources in agricultural soils might be beneficial to local soil protection and soil quality improvement.

The crystal structure of NCA is relatively complete before and after coating. Surface modification by FePO4 improves the cycling and thermal stability of NCA materials effectively. The initial specific discharge capacity is 181 mAhg(-1), 180 mAhg(-1), 180 mAhg(-1), and 166 mAhg(-1), corresponding to the pristine and the coating contents of 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%. The capacity retention can keep over 85.82% for the sample coated content of 2 wt% after 100 cycles. It also exhibit good rate capacity performance even at 5C. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis reveals the charge transfer resistance is reduced by coating and the cycle performance is improved. Therefore, the NCA electrode coated with nano-FePO4 shows enhanced electrochemical performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Glacier mass loss in the Kangri Karpo is an important contributor to global mean sea level rise, and changes run-off distribution, increasing the risk of glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Because of its inaccessibility and high labour costs, information about the Kangri Karpo glaciers is still limited. Using geodetic methods based on digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from 1980 topographic maps from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (2000) and from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (2014), this study has determined glacier elevation changes. Glacier area and length changes between 1980 and 2015 were derived from topographical maps and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. Results show that the Kangri Karpo contained 1166 glaciers with an area of 2048 : 50 +/- 48 : 65 km(2) in 2015. Ice cover diminished by 679 : 51 +/- 59 : 49 km(2) (24 : 9 +/- 2 : 2%) or 0 : 71 +/- 0 : 06% a(-1) from 1980 to 2015, although nine glaciers advanced. A glacierized area of 788.28 km(2), derived from DEM differencing, experienced a mean mass loss of 0 : 46 +/- 0 : 08 mw : e : a(-1) from 1980 to 2014. Shrinkage and mass loss accelerated significantly from 2000 to 2015 compared to 1980-2000, consistent with a warming climate.

Glutathione reductase (GR) plays an important role in scavenging ROS in plants. Here, a GR gene, named SpGR, was cloned from Stipa purpurea and characterized. The full-length open reading frame was 1497 bp, encoding 498 amino acids. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that SpGR was localized to both the plasma membrane and nucleus. The expression of SpGR was induced by cold, salt, and drought stresses. Functional analysis indicated that ectopic expression of SpGR in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in greater tolerance to salt stress than that of wild-type plants, but no difference under cold or drought treatments. The results of GR activity and GSSG and GSH content analyses suggested that, under salt stress, transgenic plants produced more GR to reduce GSSG to GSH for scavenging ROS than wild-type plants. Therefore, SpGR may be a candidate gene for plants to resist abiotic stress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we construct four high-symmetry stacking models for bilayer MX to tune their electronic properties. We systematically explore the dynamical and thermal stabilities of all bilayer MX. It is found that five of them are possible at room temperature. Then, we perform first-principles calculations to study how the bilayer structure affects their electronic properties. The results demonstrate that the electronic properties of MX materials can be modulated by forming bilayer structures. Their bandgap can be tuned over a wide range from 0.789 to 1.617 eV, and an indirect-to-direct transition occurs in three cases. Considering the flexibility of bilayer MX, we utilize in-plane uniaxial tensile strain to adjust their band structures and achieve much more indirect-to-direct bandgap transitions. The realization of direct bandgaps will be helpful for their application in next-generation high-efficiency modern nano-optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. We also study the responses of different bilayer MX to an external vertical electric field. It is found that their bandgaps decrease rapidly with the increase of the electric field.

Theorem proving is based on rigorous logic and correct mathematics theory. Firstly, existent conditions and formal model of fractional calculus Caputo definition is established in higher order logic theorem prover. Then some properties are verified, including homogeneity, linearity property, fractional differential of constant and relationship between integer order differential and fractional differential. And formalization of Laplace transform based on fractional calculus Caputo definition is given and we apply it to illustrate advantages of fractional calculus Caputo definition. Initial values based on fractional calculus Caputo definition have exact physical meanings. And then formal modeling of fractional order PD controller is verified based on the above properties. We also verify the stability and other properties of fractional order PD controller by theorem proving method. Lastly, steady-state error is analyzed based on formalization of fractional calculus Caputo definition. It shows that fractional order PD controller can achieve a better control performance than integer order PD controller. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report the development of a metal-free photocontrolled radical polymerization of semifluorinated (meth)acrylates with a new visible-light-absorbing organocatalyst. This method enabled the production of a variety of semifluorinated polymers with narrow molar-weight distributions from semifluorinated trithiocarbonates or perfluoroalkyl iodides. The high performance of "ON/OFF" control and chain-extension experiments further demonstrate the utility and reliability of this method. Furthermore, to streamline the preparation of semifluorinated polymers, a scalable continuous-flow approach has been developed. Given the broad interest in fluorinated materials and photopolymerization, we expect that this method will facilitate the development of advanced materials with unique properties.

JC-J7 in Dendrobium nobile	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							FUNGUS; METABOLITES; DERIVATIVES	Eleven new polyketones named diaporthsins A-K (1-11) were isolated from the fermentation of Diaporthe sp. JC-J7. The chemical structures of compounds (1-11) were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including HRESIMS, 2DNMR, NMR and chemical methods. Compound 11 features an unusual acyclic polyketone-phenolic polyketone hybrid structure that integrates the characteristics of different fungal metabolites (cytosporone and multiplolide). Compound 3 was the only C-12-polyketone obtained in this research. These new polyketones showed inhibitory activity on triglycerides (TG) in steatosis hepatocyte L-02 cells. Among them, compound 5 and (4E)-6,7,9-trihydroxydec-4-enoic acid displayed inhibitory activities on TG in steatotic L-02 cells with inhibition ratios of 26% and 21% at concentration of 5 g mL(-1); also, inhibition ratios of 8-O-acetylmultiplolide A and phomopsisporone A at concentration of 5 g mL(-1) were calculated to be about 24% and 16%, respectively, which were equivalent to the antihyperlipidemic activity of lovastatin. The preliminary structure-activity relationship indicated that acetyl at C-8 can increase the antihyperlipidemic activity of multiplolide A and the glycol ester and hydroxyl at C-6 can also increase the corresponding activity of diaporthsin B.

Recently, motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) has become an active research field where a subject's active intent can be detected. The accurate decoding of MI-EEG signals is essential for effective BCI systems but also very challenging due to the lack of informative correlation between the signals and the brain activities. To improve the precision performance of a BCI system, accurate feature discrimination from input signals and proper classification are necessary. However, the traditional deep learning scheme is failed to generate spatio-temporal representation simultaneously and capture the dynamic correlation for an MI-EEG sequence. To address this problem, we propose a long short-term memory network combined with a spatial convolutional network that concurrently learns spatial information and temporal correlations from raw MI-EEG signals. In addition, spectral representations of EEG signals are obtained via a discrete wavelet transformation decomposition. In order to achieve even higher learning rates and less demanding initialization, we employ a batch normalization method before training and recognition. Various experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep learning architectures. Results indicate a high level of accuracy over both the public data set and the local data set. Our method can also serve as a useful and robust model for multi-task classification and subject-independent movement class decoder across many different methods.

The elucidation of membrane protein types provides clues for understanding the structure and function of proteins. With the fusion of various protein information including amino acid classification, physicochemical property, and evolutionary information, this paper proposes a system for predicting membrane protein types. In this system, a new feature selection method called MIC-GA is proposed to deal with the curse of high-dimensional features. The findings show that this approach is effective in reducing feature dimensions and improves prediction accuracy. Ensemble method based on stacked generalization is also used to solve the problem of feature heterogeneity. The performance of the present method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets. The overall prediction accuracies of eight types are 89.23% and 93.49% using jackknife test and independent test, respectively. The final experimental results show that our method is more effective than the existing methods for prediction of membrane protein types.

Here, we propose a novel multivariate time series clustering method using multi-nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) in multi-relational networks. Specifically, a set of multivariate time series is transformed from the time-space domain into a multi-relational network in the topological domain. Then, the multi-relational network is factorized to identify time series clusters. The transformation from the time-space domain to the topological domain benefits from the ability of networks to characterize both the local and global relationships between the nodes, and MNMF incorporates inter-similarity across distinct variates into clustering. Furthermore, to trace the evolutionary trends of clusters, time series is transformed into a dynamic multi-relational network, thereby extending MNMF to dynamic MNMF.

J	Ding, P; Zhou, XB; Zhang, XJ; Wang, J; Lei, ZF				Ding, Peng; Zhou, Xiaobing; Zhang, Xuejie; Wang, Jin; Lei, Zhenfeng			An Attentive Neural Sequence Labeling Model for Adverse Drug Reactions Mentions Extraction	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adverse drug reactions; biomedical text; deep learning; neural network; sequence labeling; social media	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; PHARMACOVIGILANCE	Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients. Extracting mentions of ADRs from the health-related text has important applications in biomedical research. Existing work mainly utilizes feature-based pipeline methods or neural network models that use only word embeddings as input features. These methods either require many efforts to design task-specific features or suffer misclassification on those words, which have not been seen before. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end neural sequence labeling model that labels words in an input sequence with ADRs membership tags. In addition to word-level embeddings, we also adopt character-level embeddings and combine them via an embedding-level attention mechanism. Through such an attention mechanism, our model can dynamically determine how much information to utilize from a word- or character-level component. In addition, we use the intermediate output of the model as an auxiliary classifier and combine it with the final output of the model to improve the overall performance. We evaluate different architectures on two ADRs labeling datasets. One is an ADRs-related Twitter corpus that includes many informal vocabularies and irregular grammar, and the other is a biomedical text extracted from PubMed abstracts with many professional terms and technical descriptions. Our model achieves approximate match F1 scores of 0.844 and 0.906 for ADRs identification on the Twitter and PubMed datasets, respectively. It presents the state-of-the-art performance on both the datasets. Our system is completely end-to-end, requires no task-specific feature engineering or hand-crafted features, and thus can be generalized to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks.

A silver thin film plays a determining role in the lithium insertion/extraction process and is incorporated between amorphous Si thin film layers (a-Si/Ag/a-Si), which results in not only high and stable capability, but also the best rate performance compared to that of other electrodes. For the electrode of a-Si/Ag/a-Si, a critical thickness of the silver layer (30 nm) is found; in this case, it exhibits the highest capacity retention of 70% after 200 cycles at a current density of 65.2 A cm(-2) within the voltage range of 0.01-1.5 V. It is demonstrated that for the a-Si/Ag/a-Si (140/30/140 nm) electrode, enhanced capacity (approximate to 59.1%) is derived from the buffer effect and excellent conductivity of silver layer. Silver interlayer may represent a universal platform for relieving stress in a silicon electrode. In addition, its excellent electrical conductivity will decrease the charge transfer resistance of Si electrode for lithium-ion batteries.

We found that the fluorescence of the guanine-enhanced silver nanoclusters is not increased with the guanine-rich DNA sequence closer to the silver nanoclusters. By studying the different numbers of mismatches in the linker sequences, we found that the presence of a single-nucleotide mismatch in the linker increases fluorescence more than the complementary nucleotide. Further study indicated the mismatch position of the linker sequence also affects the fluorescence of the hybridized DNA-Ag NCs. The evidence reported here indicated that the mismatch of the linker sequence affects the fluorescence enhancement of guanine-enhanced silver nanoclusters. We also found that DNA-Ag NCs is an excellent fluorescence sensor for cyanide, as cyanide effectively quenches the fluorescence of NCs at a very low concentration with high selectivity. Cyanide in the range from 0.10 M to 0.35 M could be linearly detected, with a detection limit of 25.6 nM.

In the one-step cascade reaction, C=C and C-N bonds were constructed, and the targeted compound can be efficiently obtained by filtering without column chromatography. This protocol describes a valuable route to concisely and feasibly obtain 1,3-diazaheterocycle-fused [1,2-a] quinoline derivatives.

It is located in the Hongliugou-Lapeiquan Au-CuFe polymetallic metallogenic belt, northern Altun Mountains. Although great achievements and breakthroughs have been made in its ore exploration, studies upon its mineralization are relatively lacking, and its ore genetic mechanism is still controversial. In this paper, trace elements of the sphalerite and galena in the Kaladaban Pb-Zn deposit were studied by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), LA-ICPMS together with elemental mapping analysis. The results show that sphaleriteis are relatively rich in Fe, Mn and Cd, and depleted in In, Sn, Ga, Cr, Ge and Co, while the contents of Cu and Pb vary greatly. Among them, Fe, Mn, Cd, In, Ga and Cr are in the lattice of sphalerite in the form of isomorphism, whereas Cu and Pb may exist in the forms of isomorphism and micro-inclusions. The galena is relatively rich in Bi, Sb, Ag and Tl, depleted in Cd, Cu, Sn and Te, among which the enriched elements occur as isomorphism in galena forms. The Dazan sphalerite is dominated by reddish brown, grayish white and beige, showing that its formation temperature is medium, which is also surpported by the calculated temperatures according to the Zn, Fe, Cd, Ga and In contents and Zn/Cd, Zn/Fe and Ga/In ratios of the sphaleritein this deposit. Based on the sphalerite-galena symbiotic mineral pairs, the formation temperature range obtained was 277 similar to 321 degrees C with an average value of 290 degrees C, which also shows that the Daban sulfide formation temperature is not high. Compared with the trace elements and related ratios of different genesis Pb-Zn deposits in the world, the trace element compositions of the sulfides in the Daban Pb-Zn deposit are more similar to that of the VMS deposits (such as Marketorp, Eskay Creek, Lancang Laochang, etc.). However, a large number of chalcopyrite "disease" structures exist in the sphalerite, and the characteristics of metamorphism and deformation of the ore body are obvious. Therefore, we think that the Daban Pb-Zn deposit is dominated by the VMS type, but does not exclude the late hydrothermal effect on it to a certain extent.

For a convenient understanding, the vertical velocities of 5 levels ranging from 700 hPa to 500 hPa within the area of 15.625 degrees N-24.375 degrees N and 90.625 degrees E-100.625 degrees E are multiplied by-1 and summed up into a time series involving each year from 1979 to 2012. The standardized value of the time series is defined as the index of India-Burma trough (IIBT). IIBT can reflect the characteristics of the annual strength and the interdecadal variation of the India-Burma trough. IIBT can also well reveal the relationship between the India-Burma trough and its upstream teleconnection. What is more, through a correlation analysis on the grid point precipitation field, respectively, with the IIBT and the India-Burma trough indices defined with vorticity and geopotential height, over southern Asia the correlation pattern between the IIBT and the precipitation field is found to nearly be the sum of the correlation patterns of the latter 2 indices with the precipitation. To the south of the TP, the correlation field between the IIBT and the grid point precipitation shows dipolar distribution, which is consistent with the correlation patterns of the IIBT with the vertical velocity, specific humidity, and the mid-level geopotential height in the same spatial location. IIBT is beneficial for more accurate study of the impact of the India-Burma trough on the associated weather and climate.

CG lightning activity was showed a typical positive dipole distribution of electric charges in the thunderstorm clouds. The average current intensity of negative CG lightning located in the lower layers was obviously weaker than that of the positive CG lightning located in the upper layers, and decreased initially and subsequently increased as the elevation increased, whereas the positive CG lightning had no significant variation. The CG lightning current intensity increased linearly with terrain slope, and the variation slope of positive CG lightning was smaller than that of negative CG lightning, variation of current intensity with latitude was inversely correlated with the variation of CG lightning densities. The CG lightning activity and variation of current intensity had the same characteristics in specific regions and in zonal and meridional cross-sections, but it was significantly affected by the topography in the low/high regions where elevation was <600 />3500 m.

As the hemp hurd grew, the thickness of the plants at different orientations also changed. The pectin and ash content in the wide areas were higher than those in the narrow areas. The lignin, holocellulose, alpha cellulose, and hemicellulose content in the wide areas were lower than those in the narrow areas (p = 0.05) in different hemp plants of different genders and plant densities. Additionally, the cell numbers in the wide areas were higher than those in the narrow areas in different locations of hemp plants, of different genders, and varied plant densities (p < 0.05). Thus, the formation of the narrow areas and wide areas in the hemp hurd were caused by the division difference of cambium. The plant hormones were the main influence on the division of cambium. Three particular plant hormones cytokinin (CTK), abscisic acid (ABA), and auxin (IAA) in the wide areas of hemp plants were higher than those in the narrow areas of plants of different genders and plant densities (p < 0.05). The eccentricity had a great influence on the physical and chemical properties of hemp hurd.

However, the functional roles of these transcripts and the mechanisms responsible for their deregulation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain elusive. Here, we identified a novel IncRNA (lncRNA 1308), which was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and investigated its biological function and potential molecular mechanism. Methods: Differences in the lncRNA expression profiles between NSCLC and tumor-adjacent normal tissues were assessed by IncRNA expression microarray analysis. The microRNA in vivo precipitation (miRIP) method was used to identify the targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) on IncRNA 1308, and luciferase reporter assays were performed. Loss-of-function studies were used to explore the effect of lncRNA 1308 on lung carcinogenesis in NSCLC cells. Results: The novel IncRNA 1308 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. By using biotin-labeled IncRNA 1308 for miRIP in NSCLC cells and dual-luciferase reporter assays, the results suggested that miRNA-124 was associated with IncRNA 1308. Furthermore, the expression of a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase 15 (ADAM 15) was downregulated in NSCLC cells when silencing of lncRNA 1308, the target of oncogenic miR-124, inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion. Conversely, the expression of ADAM 15 was significantly increased, when inhibiting the expression of miR-124, and alleviated cell invasion inhibition. Conclusion: The results suggested that IncRNA 1308 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-124 to regulate cell invasion through the miR-124/ADAM 15 signaling pathway, indicating that lncRNA 1308 plays an important role in the disease progression of NSCLC.

In particular, the network topology is assumed to follow a semi-Markov process such that it may switch from one to another at different instants. In this paper, the random gain variation is represented by a stochastic variable that is assumed to satisfy the Bernoulli distribution with white sequences. Based on these hypotheses and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, a new finite-time stochastic synchronization criterion is established for the considered network in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the control design parameters that guarantee the required criterion are computed by solving a set of linear matrix inequality constraints. An illustrative example is finally given to show the effectiveness and advantages of the developed analytical results.

However, our understanding of the spatial interactions among ESs is relatively limited, particularly in mountainous areas. Using the global biodiversity hotspot known as the Three Parallel Rivers Region in Southwest China as a case study, this paper systematically investigated the spatial trade-offs and synergies among 8 ESs (i.e. crop production, livestock-raising, water supply, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, soil retention, habitat support and nature recreation). We mapped the township-level distributions of the 8 ESs and measured their relationships using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and overlap analyses of ES hotspots/coldspots. Four types of ES bundles were identified by applying the K-means clustering analysis to the 8 ESs. Our results revealed high to moderate levels of interactions among most pairs of ESs. Most provisioning services showed trade-offs with ESs of the other categories, whereas most regulating services demonstrated synergies with other ESs. The ES bundles presented a reasonable set of ecological zones that were characterized by the provisions of different ESs. The spatial patterns of ESs and their interactions corresponded well to the regional socio-ecological gradients in topography, climate and human activities. Our results should have important applications in regional decision makings on economic development and environmental conservation. This study also provides a good case for demonstrating the complex relationships among ESs in a typical mountainous biodiversity hotspot.

So far, many algorithms of mining spatial co-location pattern and their corresponding expansions have been proposed. However, dynamic co-location patterns have not received attention such as the real meaningful pattern {Ganoderma lucidum(new), maple tree(dead)} means that "Ganoderma lucidum" grows on the "maple tree" which was already dead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the concept of spatial dynamic co-location pattern that can reflect the dynamic relationships among spatial features and then propose an algorithm of mining these patterns from the dynamic dataset of spatial new/dead features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results demonstrate that spatial dynamic co-location patterns are valuable and our algorithm is effective.

However, implementing cloud services is time consuming, costly, and error prone. Moreover, there are concerns about the isolation and flexibility of multitenancy cloud services. To solve these problems, we propose a novel and easy approach: CodingBlind, which automatically generates cloud services from the most commonly used printed forms and graphical business process modeling notation (BPMN). CodingBlind provides a natural solution for the deployment and migration of systems in clouds. First, printed forms are mapped onto entity-relationship models (ER models) to generate data services. States of data and a finite state machine (FSM) are constructed from the BPMN. Based on the FSM and the ER models, quadruple models for cloud services are generated. Then, a complete system package is generated according to the quadruple model. Finally, all of the components are packaged and deployed to a cloud. CodingBlind is easy to use because it only takes printed forms and BPMNs as inputs. Self- defining data and business logic make the generated cloud services flexible. Moreover, the business logic is strictly controlled by the FSM, which provides natural isolation for cloud applications. Case studies and experiments are conducted to assess the proposed approach, and the results show that it is feasible, convenient, and flexible.

Here, we propose an underwater image enhancement scheme for robotic visual systems. The proposed algorithm and its implementation enhances and outputs an image captured by an underwater robot in real time. In this scheme, pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)-based image enhancement and color transfer algorithms are combined to enhance the underwater image. To avoid color imbalance in the underwater image and enhance details while suppressing noise, color correction is first carried out on the underwater image before converting it into the hue-saturation-intensity domain and enhancing it by PCNN.

It remains very challenging due to large differences in pose, illumination, and viewpoint between images. To improve robustness to such variations, here we develop a joint asymmetric projection and dictionary-learning algorithm by adopting listwise similarity and identity consistency constraints. Benefiting from the listwise similarities, dictionary learning considers the similarity list between each pedestrian image, thus exploiting the large amount of discriminative information contained in the samples. This approach endows the dictionary with discriminative power. In addition, we impose an identity consistency constraint on the coding coefficients to further improve the discriminative ability of the dictionary. To overcome appearance variability across non -overlapping camera views, two asymmetric projection dictionaries are employed to map the pedestrian features into a unified subspace such that the correlation between data from the same people in different views is maximized Finally, by integrating the coding coefficient and classification results, we develop a fusion strategy with a modified cosine similarity measure to match the pedestrians. Experiments on different challenging data sets demonstrate that our method is effective and outperforms some current state-of-the-art approaches.

The formation of hotspots is strongly correlated with many features, i.e., time, space, and the distribution of points of interest; however, most studies have used qualitative analyses to describe the relevance of these features, and there is a lack of quantitative analyses. Therefore, we propose the concept and a model of the attractiveness index of a hotspot that is used to quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of the hotspots and determine the degree of attractiveness to the residents. In addition, a novel algorithm of hotspot similarity is designed and implemented to improve the efficiency of summarizing the hotspot data, which is usually performed manually. We mine the data and determine different hotspots using a one-week GPS trajectory dataset collected from 6599 taxis in Kunming. Furthermore, we calculate the attractiveness index of hotspots and visualize their characteristics. The research results provide a scientific basis and reference for public infrastructure planning, land-value evaluation, store location planning, consumption recommendations, and other applications.

The SIGW coupler design is comprehensively studied. It is found that SIGW conducting ridge vias play a significant role and have a strong impact on the cavity resonance, passband, and impedance matching. A prototype of the proposed SIGW coupler is fabricated and tested, and the measured agrees well with the simulated. The coupler, better than the reported, has a passband of similar to 5 GHz from 23.59 to 29 GHz with the isolation above 20 dB, covering the 24.25-27.5-GHz and 27.5-28.5-GHz frequency bands of 5G.

To support decision-makers in analyzing changes effects and finding the optimal improvements of software process in a given project, a process simulation model using the system dynamics modeling technique is proposed and used in the context of a case study with open source software. Details of the system dynamics model, its usage scenarios and simulation experiments are provided. With the help of the simulation model, the process quality attributes of the open source software Spring Framework with varying change effects was evaluated. The project effort, delivery time, productivity, schedule, and product quality are impacted as a result of changes. Three different process improvement strategies were evaluated to help decision-makers choose most cost-effective improvement strategies. The simulation models can be used as an effective tool to evaluate the impact of changes, reason about the process improvement, and support consensus building by visualizing dynamic views of the process.

However, for those traditional facial recognition algorithms, the facial images are reshaped to a long vector, thereby losing part of the original spatial constraints of each pixel. In this paper, a new tensor-based feature extraction algorithm termed tensor rank preserving discriminant analysis (TRPDA) for facial image recognition is proposed; the proposed method involves two stages: in the first stage, the low-dimensional tensor subspace of the original input tensor samples was obtained; in the second stage, discriminative locality alignment was utilized to obtain the ultimate vector feature representation for subsequent facial recognition. On the one hand, the proposed TRPDA algorithm fully utilizes the natural structure of the input samples, and it applies an optimization criterion that can directly handle the tensor spectral analysis problem, thereby decreasing the computation cost compared those traditional tensor-based feature selection algorithms. On the other hand, the proposed TRPDA algorithm extracts feature by finding a tensor subspace that preserves most of the rank order information of the intra-class input samples. Experiments on the three facial databases are performed here to determine the effectiveness of the proposed TRPDA algorithm.

The proposed method has three key processing steps. Firstly, DSWT is employed to decompose the important features of the source image into a series of sub-images with different levels and spatial frequencies. Secondly, DOT is used to separate the significant details of the sub-images according to the energy of different frequencies. Thirdly, LSF is applied to enhance the regional features of DCT coefficients, and it can be helpful and useful for image feature extraction. Some frequently-used image fusion methods and evaluation metrics are employed to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. The experiments indicate that the proposed method can achieve good fusion effect, and it is more efficient than other conventional image fusion methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents a penalized exponentially tilted (PET) likelihood for variable selection and parameter estimation for growing dimensional unconditional moment models in the presence of correlation among variables and model misspecification. Under some regularity conditions, we investigate the consistent and oracle properties of the PET estimators of parameters, and show that the constrained PET likelihood ratio statistic for testing contrast hypothesis asymptotically follows the chi-squared distribution. Theoretical results reveal that the PET likelihood approach is robust to model misspecification. We study high-order asymptotic properties of the proposed PET estimators. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite performance of the proposed methodologies. An example from the Boston Housing Study is illustrated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we describe the effects of different abundances of the invasive species Ageratina adenophora on the composition and structure of understory communities and on Pinus yunnanensis seedling growth under pine stands in mid-Yunnan, China. Our data show that the different abundances of A. adenophora altered species and functional diversity by changing the species composition and abundance in the understory community because of its higher specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf phosphorus concentration compared with native species. Meanwhile, the presence of A. adenophora led to changes in the patterns of species co-occurrence, with a shift from random to segregated patters as the invasion intensity increased. Furthermore, the order of species loss under invasion was nonrandom. The LNC could be an indicative functional trait predicting the order of species loss, suggesting that species with a lower LNC were lost first with increasing invasion intensity. In addition, a high abundance of the invader A. adenophora suppressed the growth of the seedlings of native canopy trees. Our results indicate that the effect of the invasive herb A. adenophora on the understory community is associated with the nonrandom loss of species with different LNCs and that invasion also suppresses the growth of native canopy dominants.

The physical and chemical properties of alpha-Bi2O3 photocatalyst were characterized based on XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDS, UV-Vis DRS, and PL techniques. The influence of preparation conditions on the formation of alpha-Bi2O3 photocatalyst was investigated, and the effect of catalyst dosage and pH value on the EE2 removal rate was also investigated. The synthesized porous platelet-shaped alpha-Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and 97.8% of EE2 was removed after 75 min of visible light irradiation using alpha-Bi2O3 as photocatalyst. The reaction rate constant over the porous platelet-shaped alpha-Bi2O3 photocatalyst was 11.6 and 11.4 times of that of traditional alpha-Bi2O3 and N-TiO2, respectively. The possible photocatalytic mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the theoretical calculation and the experimental results. The porous platelet-shaped alpha-Bi2O3 was a stable and efficient photocatalyst, proving that it is a promising photocatalyst.

The effect of variation of the number and length of the terminal alkyl chains as well as the dendritic generation, linkage group on their properties have been investigated by polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and photoluminescence measurements. It is found that these compounds can self-assemble into hexagonal columnar and micellar cubic phases in their pure states, as well as organogels in organic solvents. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopic studies demonstrate that they can act as chemosensor of metal ions.

The effects of Cd doping on the gas sensing properties of the ZnO nanoparticles were studied. The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD); scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), respectively. The results reveal that all the products are the high crystalline hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal structure. The gas-sensing characteristics of the Cd doped ZnO nanoparticles for volatile organiccompounds (VOCs) were investigated. At its optimal operation temperature of 300 degrees C, the sensing properties of the Cd doped ZnO nanoparticles for n-butanol gas exhibit a high-performance gas sensing performances including high gas response, good selectivity, response/recovery time, and repeatability as well as stability. Especially, its response reaches 130 for 100 ppm n-butanol of ZnO nanoparticles with 2.5% Cd doping. Those values demonstrate the potential of using as-prepared Cd doped ZnO nanoparticles for n-butanol gas detection, making them to be promising candidates for practical detectors to n-butanol gas. Apart from these, the mechanism related to the advanced properties was also investigated and presented.

In order to better preserve the interesting region and its corresponding detail information, a novel multiscale fusion scheme based on interesting region detection is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the MeanShift is used to detect the interesting region with the salient objects and the background region of IR and VI. Then the interesting regions are processed by the guided filter. Next, the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is used for background region decomposition of IR and VI to get a low-frequency and a series of high-frequency layers. An improved weighted average method based on per-pixel weighted average is used to fuse the low-frequency layer. The pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) is used to fuse each high-frequency layer. Finally, the fused image is obtained by fusing the fused interesting region and the fused background region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can integrate more background details as well as highlight the interesting region with the salient objects, which is superior to the conventional methods in objective quality evaluations and visual inspection.

However, the NCA cathode still has the following disadvantages such as harsh synthesis conditions, cation mixing and poor thermal stability. A spherical fluorine modified gradient NCA is successfully prepared by a simple solid phase method. The F-modification NCA has a good spherical shape which shows a gradient distribution with high surface F and Al contents, and high nickel content in the core. XRD results reveal that F-modification NCA sample has well-ordered layer structure. However, there is a slight decrease in the cell parameters and interlayer spacing with the F doping into the NCA crystal lattice, due to the small F-radius and the largest electronegativity. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis reveals that fluorine ions are successfully substituted in the lattice. The cycling stability of the F-modification NCA samples are enhanced, especially at high rates. At 2C rate, the initial discharge specific capacity is 142.34 mAh g(-1), and compared with that of 107.73 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, the capacity losses only 24%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further indicates that F-modification could help inhibit the increasing of polarization and change the kinetics of NCA cathode.

To better understand topographic influences on the vegetation structure in the landscape mosaic and interpret the ecological implications of spatial patterns, the relationships between topographic features and landscape pattern indices (LPIs) should be addressed. The objective of this study is to address the effects of topography on LPIs (both planimetric and surface LPIs) by integrating spatial analysis and gradient analysis. To fulfill these objectives, two different mountain research sites located in the Lancang River watershed were chosen, both planimetric and surface landscape metrics were used to quantify natural category (NC) and anthropogenic category (AC) patterns, and the redundancy ordination gradient method was used to address the relationship between LPIs (planimetric and surface metrics) of NC and AC patterns and topographic attributes. The results suggest that topographic attributes play a prominent role in structuring the landscape mosaic. Elevation is a key factor for NC and AC patch patterns in the study area. The results indicate that the fragmentation and isolation of NC patterns increase as elevation decreases. In contrast, the fragmentation and isolation of AC patterns decrease as elevation decreases.

According to the calculated results, the electronic structure and optical properties of Cu(2)Qand CuQ present certain similarities and tendencies, with the increase of atomic number ofQelements: the interactions between Cu-Q, Cu-Cu, andQ-Qare gradually enhancing; the value of band gap is gradually decreasing, due to the down-shifting of Cu-4p states; the covalent feature of Cu atoms is gradually strengthening, while their ionic feature is gradually weakening; the absorption coefficient in the visible-light region is also increasing. Onthe other hand, some differences can be found, owing to the different crystal structure and component, for example: CuOpresents the characteristics of multiband gap, which is very favorable to absorb infrared-light; the electron transfer in CuQ is stronger than that in Cu2Q; the absorption peaks and intensity are very strong in the ultraviolet-light region and infrared-light region. The findings in the present work will help to understand the underlying physical mechanism of binary copper-based chalcogenides, and available to design novel copperbased chalcogenides photo-electronics materials and devices.

An electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous determination of nitrophenol isomers (o-nitrophenol, o-NP; p-nitrophenol, p-NP) using SH-CD and NH2-beta-CD functionalized Au@SiC (Au@CSiC-SH/NH2-CD) nanocomposite was successfully constructed. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to quantify o-NP and p-NP within the concentration range of 0.01-150 mu M under the optimal conditions. The detection limit (S/N = 3) of the sensor was 0.019 and 0.023 mu M for o-NP and p-NP, respectively, indicating a low detection limit. Interference study results demonstrated that the sensor was not affected in the presence of similar aromatic compounds during the determination of NP isomers, showing high selectivity. The proposed electrochemical sensing platform was successfully used to determine NP isomers in tap water. The low detection limit and high selectivity of the proposed electrochemical sensor were caused by the high surface area, the excellent conductivity, and the more recognized (enriched) NP isomer molecules by SH-beta-CD and NH2-beta-CD of the Au@CSiC-SH/NH2-CD nanocomposite.

The synthesis included a one-pot, three-component, domino reaction of (E)-3-(2-nitrovinyl)-indoles, isatins and chiral polycyclic a-amino acids under catalyst-free conditions at room temperature in EtOH-H2O. The salient features of this methodology are eco-friendliness, high yields and the ease of obtaining target compounds without the involvement of toxic solvents and column chromatography. These novel polycyclic pyrrolidine-fused spirooxindoles provide a collection of structurally diverse compounds that show promise for future bioassays and medical treatments.

However, the mechanism underlying hUCMSC-induced cancer cell death is not clear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of secreted factors of hUCMSCs on the breast cancer cell line MCF7 by exposing them to the conditioned medium (CM) of hUCMSCs. We evaluated the morphological changes, cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) secretion of CM-exposed MCF7 cells. The results showed that the secreted factors of hUCMSCs could cause MCF7 cell death by inducing pyroptosis. We also sequenced the total RNA, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. A total of 2597 (1822 upregulated and 775 downregulated) genes were identified and 14 pathways were significantly enriched. The results showed that the expression of the pyroptosis-related genes NLRP1 and CASP4 and the inflammation-related pathways changed significantly in MCF7 cells exposed to the CM. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that the secreted factors of hUCMSCs can cause MCF7 cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, it is the first to examine the global gene expression in MCF7 cells exposed to CM. These results will provide valuable information for further studies on the mechanism of MCF7 cell pyroptosis induced by the secreted factors of hUCMSCs. It will also help understand the effect of hUCMSCs on cell-based breast cancer therapy.

Specifically, using the statistical methods of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and wavelet analysis, the data were processed into anomaly data to study their spatial and temporal distributions and the characteristics of each pattern's periodicity after EOF analysis of the whole country's visibility and surface wind speed. Correlation analysis and composite analysis were then used to elucidate the relationship between the two variables on different time scales. The results showed a gradual reduction in visibility nationally, with the nine-point moving mean implying decadal variability of the visibility with a downward trend. However, an irregular oscillation was found for the inter-annual variability of visibility. For the anomaly series of visibility during the 50-year period, a long-period oscillation of around 32 years was apparent. Up until the 1990s, there was an approximate 16-year medium-term oscillation period, whereas, after the 1990s, an approximate 8-year oscillation period was generated. In terms of high correlation between the two variables, for the decadal variability, the changes in visibility and surface wind speed at this time scale were almost in agreement. Meanwhile, with respect to the serious pollution in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone, the correlation between the two variables was reasonably high, suggesting that surface wind had a significant influence on the scattering of aerosol particles. However, in the Sichuan Basin, the correlation was relatively low, possibly on account of its landscape limiting the variation of wind speed.

GCNT3 aberrant expression is known to promote the progression of several human cancers. However, its role in tumorigenesis and the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been well-characterized. Our study investigated the functional mechanisms of GCNT3 regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) in NSCLC. Methods: The differential expression of mRNAs in NSCLC tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous lung tissues from patients in Xuanwei, Yunnan province, China, was screened via mRNA microarray. The expression of GCNT3 and its correlation with NSCLC progression was measured in 92 paired tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The functions of GCNT3 in NSCLC cells and its underlying mechanisms were measured using siRNA and GCNT3-expression vectors. The miRNA immunoprecipitation (miRIP) method was used to identify the miRNAs targeting GCNT3. The protein were measured using western blot assay, and the mRNAs were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Cell proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and a colony forming assays; cell migration and invasion assays were performed using 24-well Transwell chambers with 8-mu m pores filter, and analyses of the cell cycle and apoptosis were performed via flow cytometric analysis. The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm whether GCNT3 gene was a direct target of miR-302b-3p. Results: GCNT3 was found to be highly expressed in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and higher expression correlated significantly with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival. Knockdown of GCNT3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of NSCLC cells, while overexpression facilitated these activities. Further mechanistic experiments using miRIP and dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that GCNT3 was a direct target of miR-302b-3p. Low expression of miR-302b-3p was found in NSCLC cells and negatively correlated with GCNT3 levels, while miR-302b-3p overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Co-transfection with miR-302b-3p and the expression vector of GCNT3 abrogated the effects of mir-302b-3p, confirming that miR-302b-3p inhibited NSCLC progression by targeting GCNT3. Western blotting revealed that E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, p-Erk and cyclin D1 were downstream molecules of miR-302b-3p/GCNT3 pathway. Conclusion: miR-302b-3p/GCNT3 axis regulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the Erk signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was identified as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

With optimization of the experimental conditions, nano alpha-FeOOH modified carbon paste electrode (alpha-FeOOH@CPE) was obtained by mixing 0.03 g of nano alpha-FeOOH and 0.02 g graphite powder in n-eicosane as an adhesive and then embedding them in a Teflon tube. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and high resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to check and confirm the presence of nano alpha-FeOOH on the carbon paste electrodes. According to the results, alpha-FeOOH@CPE showed a considerably higher response to As(III) in comparison with the bare CPE, indicating the alpha-FeOOH has well selective enrichment for As(III). The developed modified electrode showed a linear range of 1.0 X 10(-8) similar to 2.0 X 10(-5) mol.L(-1 )and detection limit of 5.0 nmol.L-1 (S/N = 3). The newly prepared carbon paste electrode was successfully applied for As(III) determination in Yangzonghai Lake water with RSD of less than 3.6 % (n = 3) and recovery in the range of 100.7 similar to 115.0 %.

Specifically, to reduce the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks, it is assumed that the signal is not transmitted at each instant and the transmission process is stochastic. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing discrete-time Jensen's inequality, a new set of sufficient conditions is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the augmented filtering system is stochastically finite-time bounded with a prescribed dissipative performance level. Meanwhile, the desired dissipative-based filter gain matrices can be determined by solving an optimization problem. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the less conservatism of the proposed filter design technique.

Two types of unprecedented skeletons of obscurolide dimer and an obscurolide-type compound with an aromatic polyketide of pentanone substituted at the benzene ring were determined by spectral data analysis. Compound 11 was the first evidence of two nitrogens in streptazolin-type structures. Compound 1 indicated an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production in LPS-activated macrophages with an inhibition ratio of 51.7% at 50 M, and on anticoagulant activity on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation with an inhibition ratio of 26.0 +/- 9.1% at 200 g mL(-1). 11 had anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with an inhibition ratio of 27.2% at a concentration of 50 M. Mechanistic aspects of the non-enzymatic reaction as well as a more detailed picture of the biosynthetic relationships of the streptazolin- and obscurolide-type metabolites are described. Acidic and basic conditions can inhibit the growth of Streptomyces, and -butyrolactones were found to be hormones controlling antibiotic production in Streptomyces. In the pH fermentation tests, acylation of -butyrolactones was successfully used to explain the mechanism of influence on the growth of Streptomyces.

First, the Riemann problem of the pressureless type system with a flux perturbation is considered. A parameterized delta-shock and generalized constant density solution are obtained. Then we rigorously prove that, as the flux perturbation vanishes, they converge to the delta-shock and vacuum state of the pressureless type system, respectively. Secondly, by adding an artificial pressure term in the pressureless type system, we solve the Riemann problem of the system with a double parameter flux approximation including pressure. It is shown that, as the flux perturbations vanish, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the pressureless type system; any two-rarefaction-wave Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the pressureless type system and the intermediate nonvacuum state in between tends to a vacuum state.

Existing information retrieval-based change impact analysis methods select a single method to transform the source code corpus into vectors in a process known as indexing. The single method is chosen from two primary methods, known as the bag-of-words and word embedding models, each having their specific advantages and disadvantages. The bag-of-words model records every word in the source code but ignores contextual information in the corpus. The word embedding model records the contextual information but loses detail for individual words. To address this problem, we propose a structure-driven method for information retrieval-based change impact analysis (named SDM-CIA). SDM-CIA integrates the bag-of-words and word embedding models based on the software's structure. Our experiments using a standard benchmark shows that when compared with the existing methods, SDM-CIA improves on precision performance, recall performance, F-score performance, and MRR performance by an average of 3.65%, 3.82%, 3.6%, and 10.28%, respectively. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of SDM-CIA.

Several podophyllotoxin-derived antitumor agents, including etoposide, are currently in clinical use; however, their therapeutic efficacy is often limited due to side effects and the development of resistance by cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that 4 beta-1,2,3-triazole derivatives of podophyllotoxin exhibit more potent anticancer activity and better binding to topoisomerase-II than etoposide. The effect of dimerization of such derivatives on the anticancer activity has not been studied. Methods: Two moieties of podophyllotoxin were linked at the C-4 position via 1,2,3-triazole rings to give a series of novel dimeric podophyllotoxin derivatives. 4 beta-Azido-substituted podophyllotoxin derivatives (23 and 24) were coupled with various dipropargyl functionalized linkers by utilizing the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction to provide dimeric products in very good yield. The in vitro anticancer activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated by MTT assay against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480). The normal BEAS-2B (lung) cell line was also included for study in order to evaluate the cancer selectivity of the most active compound as compared with normal cells. Results: A group of 16 dimeric podophyllotoxin derivatives with different linkers were synthesized and structurally characterized. Most compounds do not show significant cytotoxicity (IC50 > 40 mM) against all five cancer cell lines. However, one compound (29) which bears a perbutyrylated glucose residue on the glycerol linker is highly potent against all five cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 0.43 to 3.50 mu M. This compound (29) also shows good selectivity towards cancer cell lines as compared with the normal BEAS-2B (lung) cell line, showing selectivity indexes from 4.4 to 35.7. Conclusion: The anticancer activity of dimeric podophyllotoxin derivatives is generally speaking not improved as compared to their monomeric counterparts, and the potency of these dimeric derivatives can be largely affected by the nature of the linker between the two moieties. Among the synthesized derivatives, compound 29 is significantly more cytotoxic and selective towards cancer cells than etoposide and cisplatin, which are currently in clinical use. Compound 29 is a promising anticancer drug and needs further studies.

It is a typical quadripartite structure, containing a large single copy (LSC) region of 89,858 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 3569bp separated by a pair of extremely extensive inverted repeats (IRs) of 40,943 bp. A total of 142 genes were annotated, including 94 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree on plastid genomes revealed that C. kweichowensis is close to Annamocarya sinensis. The newly characterized complete plastid genome of C. kweichowensis will provide essential data for further studies of this endangered species.

Optim., 10 (2000), pp. 580{604] and the fully Holder stable minimum by Mordukhovich and Nghia [SIAM J.

Under weak( BCQ) (a new constraint qualification), by using the techniques of variational analysis, we establish relationships among these notions and provide several characterizations for fully stable (q, s)-minima, which improve and generalize some existing results in the recent literature.

It essentially focuses on extracting or learning feature representations followed by a matching model using a distance metric. In fact, person reidentification is a difficult task because, first, no universal feature representation can perfectly identify the amount of pedestrians in the gallery obtained by a multicamera system. Although different features can be fused into a composite representation, the fusion still does not fully explore the difference, complementarity, and importance between different features. Second, a matching model always has a limited amount of training samples to learn a distance metric for matching probe images against a gallery, which certainly results in an unstable learning process and poor matching result. In this paper, we address the issues of person reidentification by the ensemble theory, which explores the importance of different feature representations, and reconcile several matching models on different feature representations to an optimal one via our proposed weighting scheme. We have carried out the simulation on two well-recognized person reidentification benchmark datasets: VIPeR and ETHZ. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In order to overcome the difficulty of the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication, we first decompose the system under consideration into four real-valued systems. Then by using the exponential dichotomy theory of linear differential equations and Banach's fixed point theorem, we establish sufficient conditions to ensure the existence and global exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for this class of neural networks. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.

PA-44 (VPR), mesophilic Engyodontium album (Tritirachium album) (PRK), and thermophilic Thermus aquaticus (AQN) using multiple-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with continuum electrostatics calculations. The results reveal that although salt bridges are not a crucial factor in determining the overall thermostability of these three proteases, they on average provide the greatest, moderate, and least electrostatic stabilization to AQN, PRK, and VPR, respectively, at the respective organism growth temperatures. Most salt bridges in AQN are effectively stabilizing and thus contribute to maintaining the overall structural stability at 343 K, while nearly half of the salt bridges in VPR interconvert between being stabilizing and being destabilizing, likely aiding in enhancing the local conformational flexibility at 283 K. The individual salt bridges, salt-bridge networks, and calcium ions contribute differentially to local stability and flexibility of these three enzyme structures, depending on their spatial distributions and electrostatic strengths. The shared negatively charged surface potential at the active center of the three enzymes may provide the active-center flexibility necessary for nucleophilic attack and proton transfer. The differences in distributions of the electro-negative, electro-positive, and electro-neutral potentials, particularly over the back surfaces of the three proteases, may modulate/affect not only protein solubility and thermostability but also structural stability and flexibility/rigidity. These results demonstrate that electrostatics contributes to both heat and cold adaptation of subtilisin-like serine proteases through fine-tuning, either globally or locally, the structural stability and conformational flexibility/rigidity, thus providing a foundation for further engineering and mutagenesis studies.

The proposed method is based on an image patch that is decomposed into three different independent parts: contrast extraction, structure preservation, and intensity adjustment. For structure preservation and intensity adjustment, which are very important, this paper exploits three weight measurements, i.e., local weight, global weight, and saliency weight. Using those weights, the final fused image is better guided by not only the exposure level of a single image but also the relative exposure level between differently exposed images. Then, the three parts are fused, respectively. The desired patch is reconstructed and fed back to the fused image. Unlike the conventional patch algorithms, the proposed approach preserves more details of the input sequence images due to the three weight maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully produces pleasing fused images with better color appearance and more texture details than other existing exposure fusion techniques.

We are particularly interested in effective tests for monitoring multiple quality indices in forestry products. Our search reveals that there are many effective statistical methods in the literature for normal data, and that they can easily be used to test hypotheses regarding parameter values permitting asymptotically normal estimators. We find that the classical likelihood ratio test is unsatisfactory, because to control the size, it must cope with the least favorable distributions at the cost of power. In this article, we find a novel way to slightly ease the size control, obtaining a much more powerful test. Simulation confirms that the new test retains good control of the Type I error and is markedly more powerful than the likelihood ratio test as well as many competitors based on normal data. The new method performs well in the context of monitoring multiple quality indices.

The ACs were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical testing. Results showed that ACs from cultivation sites in Pingyi (ASPY), possessed many micropores, a dominant amount of mesopores, and few macropores. They achieved a value of 1615 m(2)/g of specific surface area calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with numerous oxygen-containing functional groups. Electrodes fabricated with ASPY particles exhibited excellent double-layer specific capacitance (245 F/g), while the other two marked as ASFC (ACs from Fangcheng) and ASZJ (ACs from Zhongjiang) reached values of 163 F/g and 81 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 1 A/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolytes. Electrodes made by ASPY had a good cyclic stability for 1000 cycles at a potential range from -1 V to 0 V and lower equivalent series resistance (ESR). Meanwhile, the authors found that roots of Danshen that grew in different cultivation sites were remarkably different while they were activated, which was the same with electrochemical properties of the electrodes fabricated by ACs.

Trypsin-like serine proteases have many physiological and pathophysiological functions. There is therefore extensive interest in generating specific inhibitors for pharmacological intervention in their enzymatic activity. We study here if it is possible to use halogenated compounds as the P1 group to bind to the S1 specificity pocket of trypsin-like serine proteases to avoid the low bioavailability of the amidine or guanidine P1 group that is typically used in many inhibitors. We used 4-chlorobenzylamine (ClBA), 4-bromobenzylamine (BrBA) and 4-iodobenzylamine (IBA) as probes to test their binding modes to a trypsin-like serine protease, urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA), which has been recognized as a marker for breast cancer and an important target for inhibitor development. The results showed that these compounds inhibited uPA with stronger efficacies compared with their non-halogenated analogues. We also determined the highresolution crystal structures of uPA in complex with BrBA and IBA, respectively. The structures revealed that BrBA bound to the S1 pocket of uPA via halogen bonds, but IBA did not make halogen bonds with uPA, demonstrating that the iodine may not be the best choice as a target moiety for serine proteases. These results advocate halogen bonding, especially bromine bonding, as an efficient strategy for the future design of novel inhibitors against trypsin-like serine proteases to provide strong potency and promote bioavailability.

However, most of them suffer from problems with dissolution resulting in poor electrochemical performance. In this work, we adapt a sodium salt of tetracyanoquinodimethane (NaTCNQ) to work as a high redox potential cathode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). A porous carbon coated separator is demonstrated to be an adsorption layer and prevents the dissolved active material from migrating to the anode side. The NaTCNQ cell assembled with a carbon layer containing 5% activated carbon (AC) exhibits a higher initial capacity and greatly improved cycling stability. Using a conductive adsorption layer in organic redox batteries is a promising pathway to develop high performance organic electrode materials for SIBs.

Herein, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) chromophore (tetraphenylethane, TPE) attached to a benzimidazole group (tetra-benzimidazole, TBI-TPE) is synthesized and utilized to detect Ag+ in the environment. The strong chelating effect between the benzimidazole group and Ag+ leads to the formation of aggregates, and strong yellow fluorescence signals were observed after adding Ag+ into a TBI-TPE solution. The stoichiometry of the complex of TBI-TPE and Ag+ was established to be 1:2 using photochemical and mass spectra measurements. The detection limit of the Ag+ assay is 90 nM with a linear range from 100 nM to 6 M. This study provides a facile method to determine Ag+ in real environmental samples with satisfactory results.

Here, pilot-scale comparisons of three duckweed species (Spirodela polyrhiza K1, Lemna minor K2 and Landoltia punctata K3) in monoculture and polyculture were investigated. Results showed that the TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total phosphorus) in wastewater decreased from 6.0 and 0.56 mg L-1 to below 0.5 and 0.1 mg L-1, respectively. Namely, the water quality improved to Grade II under the Chinese standard. The highest TN and TP removal efficiencies were found to be 99.1% and 90.8% in the polyculture. Besides, the starch content of S. polyrhiza K1, L. minor K2, L. punctata K3 and the polyculture reached 24.8%, 32.3%, 39.3% and 36.3%, respectively. Accordingly, their average starch accumulation rates were 1.65, 2.15, 3.11 and 2.72 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Our results suggested that L. punctata K3 was a promising energy feedstock due to it having the highest starch production. The advantages of different duckweed species were investigated. In the polyculture, the pollutants were efficiently removed from wastewater, with a high starch accumulation. This study supplies a new insight into the application of duckweed in eutrophic water advanced treatment coupled with starch production.

DNA sequence variation in Iranian native dogs	MITOCHONDRIAL DNA PART A			English	Article						Mitochondrial DNA; dog; Iran; population structure	SOUTHERN EAST-ASIA; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; DOMESTIC DOG; ORIGINS; HISTORY; MULTIPLE; GENOMES; MODELS	The dog mtDNA diversity picture from wide geographical sampling but from a small number of individuals per region or breed, displayed little geographical correlation and high degree of haplotype sharing between very distant breeds. For a clear picture, we extensively surveyed Iranian native dogs (n=305) in comparison with published European (n=443) and Southwest Asian (n=195) dogs. Twelve haplotypes related to haplogroups A, B and C were shared by Iranian, European, Southwest Asian and East Asian dogs. In Iran, haplotype and nucleotide diversities were highest in east, southeast and northwest populations while western population had the least. Sarabi and Saluki dog populations can be assigned into haplogroups A, B, C and D; Qanderijani and Kurdi to haplogroups A, B and C, Torkaman to haplogroups A, B and D while Sangsari and Fendo into haplogroups A and B, respectively. Evaluation of population differentiation using pairwise F-ST generally revealed no clear population structure in most Iranian dog populations. The genetic signal of a recent demographic expansion was detected in East and Southeast populations. Further, in accordance with previous studies on dog-wolf hybridization for haplogroup d2 origin, the highest number of d2 haplotypes in Iranian dog as compared to other areas of Mediterranean basin suggests Iran as the probable center of its origin. Historical evidence showed that Silk Road linked Iran to countries in South East Asia and other parts of the world, which might have probably influenced effective gene flow within Iran and these regions. The medium nucleotide diversity observed in Iranian dog calls for utilization of appropriate management techniques in increasing effective population size.

This assumption may be inappropriate in some applications. This paper proposes a new SDPDM by assuming that response variables and random effects follow the multivariate skew-normal distribution. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to evaluate Bayesian estimates of unknown parameters and random effects in skew-normal SDPDM by combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. A Bayesian local influence analysis method is developed to simultaneously assess the effect of minor perturbations to the data, priors and sampling distributions. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodologies. An example is illustrated by the proposed methodologies.

J	Smith, RJ; Zhai, D; Savatenalinton, S; Kamiya, T; Yu, N				Smith, Robin J.; Zhai, Dayou; Savatenalinton, Sukonthip; Kamiya, Takahiro; Yu, Na			A review of rice field ostracods (Crustacea) with a checklist of species	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY			English	Review						Ostracoda; agriculture; Oryza sativa; invasive species; food security	BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; HETEROCYPRIS-INCONGRUENS OSTRACODA; CYPRIS-SUBGLOBOSA SOWERBY; FRESH-WATER OSTRACODA; NITROGEN-FIXATION; INCLUDING DESCRIPTIONS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PASSIVE DISPERSAL; AQUATIC ORGANISMS; GENUS	Ostracods are very common in rice fields and they can have a significant influence on the rice field ecosystem. They can reach very high densities, often higher than other meiofauna, and their activities can have both positive and negative effects on rice harvests. They directly affect nutrient recycling through excretion, and indirectly by physically disturbing the soil and releasing minerals, thus improving rice growth. On the other hand, ostracods grazing on nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria potentially reduce rice yields. Rice is a primary staple food for over half of the worlds population, and therefore ostracods can have a significant impact on human food supply. The origin of the rice field ostracod fauna is poorly known, but many rice field ostracods are considered invasive, especially in southern Europe, and from rice fields they have the potential to spread to surrounding natural habitats. Despite their invasive potential and ecological effects on the rice field ecosystem, very little is known about the diversity, ecology and impacts of rice field ostracods in many rice-producing countries. One hundred and ninety-two named ostracod species/subspecies have been reported from rice fields in 26 countries and states worldwide in the published literature; for over three-quarters of rice-producing countries, no data are readily available, and for most of the countries that have available data, diversity is clearly under-reported. Most species that have been documented from rice fields belong to the Cyprididae (78%), a family that makes up approximately 43% of the 2500+ non-marine ostracod species. A further six families (Candonidae, Darwinulidae, Entocytheridae, Ilyocyprididae, Limnocytheridae and Notodromadidae) form the remainder of rice field ostracods. Twenty-two percent of the species reported from rice fields are sexually reproducing, 18% have mixed reproduction, but are mostly asexual, and for 60% males are unknown, and are probably entirely asexually reproducing species. This review and checklist of rice field ostracods are presented to facilitate further research on this group in rice field habitats, research that is crucial for food security in many regions.

Previous studies have reported the involvement of mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG-6) as a negative regulator in tumor formation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the development of different types of cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of miRNAs in HCC are poorly understood. This study was aimed to investigate the role of miR-374a in HCC and its role in the regulation of expression of MIG-6. The results showed that MIG-6 overexpression significantly inhibited cell viability of HepG2 cells after 4 days post-transfection. Moreover, MIG-6 was a direct target of miR-374a, and the expression of MIG-6 was remarkably downregulated by the overexpression of mi R-374a in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-374a promoted cell viability; however, the protective effect was abolished by MIG-6 overexpression. In addition, overexpression of miR-374a activated the EGFR and AKT/ERK signaling pathways by regulation of MIG-6. Our findings suggest that miR-374a could promote cell viability by targeting MIG-6 and activating the EGFR and AKT/ERK signaling pathways. These data provide a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.

By virtue of the exponential dichotomy of linear differential equations, Banach's fixed point theorem, Lyapunov functional method, and differential inequality technique, some sufficient conditions are established for assuring the existence and global exponential synchronization of almost periodic solutions of the delayed quaternion-valued neural networks, which are completely new. Finally, we give one example with simulation to show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results.

By facilely tuning the etching time and the weight ratio of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O to eHA, the morphology, specific surface area and the supported Co2+ content of the mesoporous material can be tuned. The method for mesoporous material is scaled up and can be extended to other clay minerals. The mesoporous eHA supported Co2+ is used as catalyst for the selective catalytic oxidation of cyclohexene in solvent-free reaction system with O-2 as oxidant. The results shows the catalytic activity is dependent on etching time, weight ratio of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O to eHA, calcination treatment and reaction time/temperature. Among them, mesoporous eHA supported Co2+ prepared with 18 h etching time and 2:1 Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O/eHA weight ratio without calcination (HA/HCl-18 h/Co2+-2:1) demonstrates the highest catalytic activity under 75 degrees C reaction temperature and 18 h reaction time (58.30% conversion and 94.03% selectivity to allylic products). Furthermore, HA/HCl-18 h/Co2+-2:1 has exhibit superior cycling stability with 37.69% conversion and 92.73% selectivity to allylic products after three cycles.

Although structures of prefusion Env have been determined and phenotypes relevant to the CD4 dependency and the neutralization sensitivity for various HIV-1 isolates have been identified, the detailed structural dynamics and energetics underlying these two phenotypes have remained elusive. In this study, two unliganded structural models of gp120, one from the CD4-dependent, neutralization-resistant isolate H061.14 and the other from the CD4-independent, neutralization-sensitive R2 strain, were constructed, and subsequently were subjected to multiple-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by free energy landscape (FEL) construction. Comparative analyses of MD trajectories reveal that during simulations R2-gp120 demonstrated larger structural fluctuations/deviations and higher global conformational flexibility than H061.14-gp120. Close comparison of local conformational flexibility shows that some of the structural regions involving direct interactions with gp41 and adjacent gp120 subunits in the context of the closed trimeric Env exhibit significantly higher flexibility in R2-gp120 than in H061.14-gp120, thus likely increasing the probability for R2-Env to open the trimer crown and prime gp41 fusogenic properties without induction by CD4. Collective motions derived from principal component analysis (PCA) reveal that R2-gp120 is prone to spontaneous transition to the neutralization-sensitive CD4-bound state while H061.14-gp120 tends to maintain the neutralization-resistant unliganded state. Finally, comparison between FELs reveals that R2-gp120 has larger conformational entropy, richer conformational diversity, and lower thermostability than H061.14-gp120, thus explaining why R2-gp120 is more structurally unstable and conformationally flexible, and has a higher propensity to transition to the CD4-bound state than H061.14-gp120. The present results reveal that the differences in dynamics and energetics between R2-gp120 and H061.14-gp120 impart Env trimers with distinct capacities to sample different states (i.e., R2-Env samples more readily the open state while H061.14-Env is more inclined to maintain the closed state), thus shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying the HIV-1 phenotype associated with CD4 dependency/neutralization sensitivity.

The present study focused on interspecific correlations of exotic and native species in 8-year-old artificial wetland forests. Four large plots (each 1500 m(2)) were established to record the species and abundance of all plants; 160 quadrats (1 x 1 m) were set to record the number, height and coverage of each plant species. In the large plots, 78 species (6 trees, 11 shrubs and 61 herbs) were recorded. The interspecific relationships of major species (frequency >3%) from quadrats were analysed using the Chi-Square test and Spearman rank correlation coefficient index. Of 253 species pairs, 49 and 45 were significant (P < 0.05), with positive and negative correlations respectively, showing intense interspecific competition. Ward's method of hierarchical clustering was used to divide the major species from quadrats into three and five ecological species groups at a rescaled distance cluster combine of 20 and 10 respectively. Dominant invasive species (Solidago canadensis, Ageratina adenophora and Bidens pilosa) formed monodominant patches; however, species of different sizes and ecological demands, whether exotic or native, could coexist. These findings imply that exotic species can coexist with native species and become a common species composition when they have existed for a sufficient period time in artificial wetland forests.

The flowers of many Habenaria species are often characterised by long spurs and are mostly pollinated by long-tongued hawkmoths or butterflies. Unlike the flowers of other Habenaria species, the flowers of Habenaria malintana (Blanco) Merr. have very short spurs with no nectar or scent; however, this species is able to maintain high fecundity in south-west China. Breeding system experiments suggested that H. malintana is an obligate agamospermous orchid. Seed set did not need to be triggered by pollen grain deposition on stigmas, and similar to 100% fruit set was found in different populations and years. In pollen germination experiments, hand-deposited pollen failed to germinate on stigmas. The flowers of H. malintana failed to attract any pollinators, as we did not observe any floral visitors, and no pollinia removal or deposition occurred in both 2013 and 2014 at two study sites. These results strongly suggested that H. malintana has completely abandoned sexual reproduction and has adopted obligate agamospermy to achieve high reproductive output. We suggest that this strategy may have evolved to provide reproductive assurance and reduce the cost of flowers in response to unreliable pollinator service.

Endophytic bacteria might be beneficial for plant growth and yield. However, bacterial diversity in pitaya is poorly characterized. In this study, fruits of white and red pitayas from three different origins (Thailand, Vietnam and China) were chosen for endophytic bacteria diversity investigation by using Illumina HiSeq second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. Large number of endophytic bacteria were detected and 22 phyla, 56 classes, 81 orders, 122 families and 159 genera were identified. Endophytic bacteria diversity was uneven among pitaya fruits from different origins and bacteria structure was different between white pitaya group and red pitaya group. Phylum Bacteroidetes, classes Bacteroidia and Coriobacteriia, orders Bacteroidales and Coriobacteriales, families Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alcaligenaceae and Coriobacteriaceae, genera Prevotella, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Sutterella were statistically significant different species (P < 0.05) between white and red pitayas. These findings might be useful for growth improvement, fruit preservation and processing of different pitaya species from different origins.

Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer, personal digital assistant, automated analyzer, and other medical devices, they are raw, simple, weak-content, and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enrich IoT-based medical records by linking them with the knowledge in linked open data. A case study is conducted on a real-world IoT-based HIS system in association with our approach, the experimental results show that medical records in the local HIS system are significantly enriched and useful for healthcare analysis and decision making, and further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach for knowledge accessing.

The supplement of volcanic rock and charcoal could significantly shorten the start-up time of the anammox process, which primarily occurred in the activity-enhanced phase, with ammonium and nitrite removal efficiencies stabilized above 92.5% and 93.4% after an operation period of 145, 105 and 121 d for R1, R2 and R3, respectively. After the successful anammox start-up, R2 performed significantly better in TN removal (p < .05), achieving an average rate of 91.0% and 191.5 g N m(-3) d(-1) compared to R1 of 88.4% and 172.1 g N m(-3) d(-1), and R3 of 89.9% and 180.1 g N m(-3) d(-1) in the steady running phase. The ratios of consumed NO2--N/NH4+-N and generated NO3--N/consumed NH4+-N after anammox start-up were lower than the theoretical values, probably suggesting the simultaneous existences of anammox, denitrification as well as nitrification processes in the reactors. A reddish brown biofilm was wrapped on the carriers and morphological detection of biofilm displayed the presentations of thick and compact floc aggregates and some filamentous bacteria on the sponge, and spherical-, ovoid-and shortrod-shaped microorganisms on the volcanic rock and charcoal. Using porous material as carrier for biofilm development is an effective strategy for practical application of the anammox reactor.

As well known, aromatase mediates the production of estrogen. Thus, inhibition of aromatase with chemical molecules has been considered to be an effective treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of novel non-steroidal molecules containing 2-phenylindole scaffold and moiety of either imidazole or 1,2,4-triazole to enhance their binding capacity with the aromatase. Among these molecules, a compound named as 8o was confirmed experimentally to have the highest inhibitory activity to aromatase. Further cell activity assay proved that compound 8o has low cytotoxicity and is a promising lead for developing novel aromatase inhibitors. Molecular modeling and simulation techniques were performed to identify the binding modes of letrozole and 8o with the aromatase. Analysis of energy of the two compound-aromatase complexes revealed that the 8o has low binding energy (strong binding affinity) to the aromatase as compared to letrozole, which was in accordance with the experimental results. As concluded, a combination of experimental and computational approaches facilitates us to understand the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action and discover more potent non-steroidal AIs against aromatase, thereby opening up a novel therapeutic strategy for hormone-dependent breast cancer.

However, these models can have millions of parameters and many layers, which are difficult to train, and sometimes several days or weeks are required to tune the parameters. Within this paper, we present the usage of a trained deep convolutional neural network model to extract the features of the images, and then, used the AdaBoost algorithm to assemble the Softmax classifiers into recognizable images. This method resulted in a 3% increase of accuracy of the trained CNN models, and dramatically reduced the retraining time cost, and thus, it has good application prospects.

Pectinase pre-treatment reduced the amount of pectin in both fibers (p < 0.0001) and this reduction was associated with improved tensile strength, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity (p < 0.001) of bamboo, or eucalyptus fiber-based composites. Pre-treatment had no consistent effects on the thickness swell or water absorption. The addition of a coupling agent produced similar improvements in panel properties (p < 0.05), but also markedly reduced moisture absorption and thickness swell (p < 0.05). Sodium hydroxide pre-treatment had no consistent effects on panel properties, although it did appear to affect thickness swell. Short pectinase pretreatment might be useful for enhancing the properties of woody tissue/PP composites while reducing but not completely eliminating the need for coupling agents.

However, the role of genetic polymorphisms in ADRB2 on COPD has not been evaluated yet. Methods: In this study, SNaPshot genotyping, luciferase assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time polymerase chain reaction were adopted to investigate the association between ADRB2 genetic polymorphisms and COPD, comprehensively. Results: One single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12654778), located upstream of ADRB2, showed a significant association with COPD by the logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex and smoking history (p=0.04) in 200 COPD patients and 222 controls from southwest Chinese population. Furthermore, the luciferase assay indicated that rs12654778-A allele reduced the relative promoter activity by similar to 26% compared with rs12654778-G allele (p=0.0034). The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that rs12654778 modulated the binding affinity of transcription factor neurofibromin 1. In addition, a significantly reduced expression of ADRB2 in COPD patients was observed, compared with normal controls (p=0.017). Conclusion: Our findings suggest a previously unknown mechanism linking allele-specific effects of rs12654778 on ADRB2 expression to COPD onset, for the first time.

In this study, the methanol extract of Artemisia scoparia was evaluated for its protective potential against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic toxicity. Seven groups of mature albino rats were used in the course of the experiment and each group was treated with specific doses of plant extract and CCl4. Silymarin was used as a standard protective drug. The results of the experiment revealed that Artemisia scoparia plant extract was successful in fighting CCl4 toxicity as it clearly reduced the elevated levels of liver serum markers (alkaline phosphatase and alkaline aminotransferase), lipid peroxidation, nitrite content, and H2O2 on one side while enhancing the levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-s-transferase, gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase, and glutathione reductase) and protein content.

The approach integrates a bag-of-words based IR technique, where each class or method is abstracted as a set of words, and a neural network based IR technique to derive conceptual couplings from the source code of a software system. We report rigorous empirical assessments of the changes of three open source systems: jEdit, muCommander, and JabRef. The impact sets obtained are evaluated at the method level of granularity, and the results show that our integrated approach provides statistically significant improvements in accuracy across several cut points relative to the accuracies provided by the individual methods employed independently. Improvements in F-score values of up to 7.3%, 10.9%, and 17.3% are obtained over a baseline technique for jEdit, muCommander, and JabRef, respectively.

Wu & D.Z. Li, which is a controversial species in Opiliaceae, is treated as a variety of Champereia manillana (Blume) Merrill in the Flora of China and morphological analysis has produced conflicting results regarding its affinity to Melientha and Champereia. To determine the systematic position of Yunnanopilia in Opiliaceae, we selected two nuclear regions (internal transcribed spacer [ITS4-ITS5] and 18S rDNA) and four chloroplast regions (rbcL, matK, psbA-trnH, and trnS-trnG) to test the phylogenetics of the family Opiliaceae using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analysis. Morphological characteristics were also examined to clarify the similarities and differences among Y. longistaminea and two closely related species. Agonandra was located at the basal position in the family Opiliaceae; in the large clade including other remaining genera, two main clades were clearly identified and correlated with inflorescence morphological characteristics. All samples of Y. longistaminea formed a clade. Yunnanopilia, Melientha, and Champereia were more closely related than other genera of Opiliaceae. Yunnanopilia longistaminea was sister to M. suavis Pierre and was more closely related to M. suavis than to C. manillana. Morphological analysis also showed that differences in the inflorescences and flowers between Y. longistaminea and M. suavis were substantial enough to warrant the retention of Y. longistaminea in its current genus. Thus, we suggest that the monotypic Yunnanopilia be treated as a distinct genus and that the name Y. longistaminea should be adopted.

An EM algorithm is proposed to evaluate the penalized likelihood estimations of parameters. The ICQ criterion is employed to select the optimal penalty parameter. Under some regularity conditions, we show some asymptotic properties of parameter estimators such as oracle property. It can be shown that the proposed local linear kernel estimator of the nonparametric component is an estimator of a least favorable curve. The consistency of the ICQ-based selection procedure is obtained. Simulation studies are conducted, and a real data set is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

Compound 2 indicated significant inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production in LPS-activated macrophages, anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with the inhibition ratios of 92.5, 38.2% at 50M, and cytotoxicity to HL-60, A-549, SMMC-7721, MCF-7 and SW480 with the range of inhibition ratio at 51-96% for a concentration of 40M. Compounds 1, 2 showed weak anticoagulant activity with PT at 16.8 s. Few work was reported on the anti-acetylcholinesterase, and anticoagulant activities of aureonitol, and cytochalasan derivatives. The preliminary structure-activity relationship stated that the oxidation ring-opening in yamchaetoglobosin A can retain the inhibitory effect against NO production and tumor cell. [GRAPHICS] .

In Tian and Li (2015), the equality of risk difference based on a 2 x 2 table is tested at the presence of non-response. In this paper, we derive the joint distribution of multiple contingency tables with non-response. Consequently, we propose a new homogeneity test statistic for the risk difference among multiple contingency tables. The limiting distribution of the proposed test statistic is established along with inferential procedures. Upon rejection of the global null hypothesis of homogeneity, to identify contingency tables with discordance, a multiple comparison procedure is proposed. Numerical studies corroborate theoretical results. We illustrate our method with dataset from a psychiatric study.

How the underlying molecular mechanisms contributed to this process are poorly defined. In the present study, we sought to identify the role of miR-124 in hyperoxia-induced cell apoptosis and excessive inflammatory response in pulmonary epithelial cell. Methods: The miR-124 levels in pulmonary epithelial cell were assayed by qRT-PCR. MiR-124 mimics and inhibitors were transfected to gain or loss of miR-124 function. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK8 assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The targeted genes were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. The protein levels were assayed by western blotting. Results: The results showed that miR-124 was significantly down-regulated in Beas2B cells and primary LECs upon hyperoxia exposure conditions. However, overexpression of miR-124 dramatically attenuated hyperoxia-provoked TLR4, NF-kappa B and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In vitro, the cell viability and apoptosis was significantly reversed following transfection with miR-124 mimics in the presence of hyperoxia. Furthermore, the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CCL2 was bound by miR-124. Conclusion: It was concluded that miR-124 inhibited hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and excessive inflammatory response in Beas2B cells and primary LECs, at least partially, through the inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappa B/CCL2 signaling cascades.

One of the main sources of evidence that stimuli that do not reach conscious awareness-and are thus "invisible'' are still processed to some degree by the visual system comes from studies using continuous flash suppression (CFS). Why and how CFS works may provide more general insight into how stimuli access awareness. As spatial and temporal properties of stimuli are major determinants of visual perception, we hypothesized that these properties of the CFS masks would be of significant importance to the achieved suppression depth. In previous studies however, the spatial and temporal properties of the masks themselves have received little study, and masking parameters vary widely across studies, making a metacomparison difficult. To investigate the factors that determine the effectiveness of CFS, we varied both the temporal frequency and the spatial density of Mondrian-style masks. We consistently found the longest suppression duration for a mask temporal frequency of around 6 Hz. In trials using masks with reduced spatial density, suppression was weaker and frequency tuning was less precise. In contrast, removing color reduced mask effectiveness but did not change the pattern of suppression strength as a function of frequency. Overall, this pattern of results stresses the importance of CFS mask parameters and is consistent with the idea that CFS works by disrupting the spatiotemporal mechanisms that underlie conscious access to visual input.

Moreover, we considered changing the features of the N-ligands (length), which are expected to alter the structural diversities and properties of the resultant CPs. We used 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpe) to replace bpy; and obtained four new coordination polymers (CPs), namely, {[Zn(EtOip)(bpe)].H2O}(n) (5), {[Zn(PrOip)(bpe)].H2O}(n) (6), {[Zn((n)BuOip)(bpe)].0.5DMF}(n) (7) and [Zn((n)PeOip)(bpe)](n) (8). All of these compounds were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and powder X-ray diffraction measurements. Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that the structure of complexes 14 are very similar, although different functionalized-isophthalate ligands are employed. Complexes 5, 6 and 7 possess a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure, and the 2D framework of complexes 5 and 7 can be rationalized to be a threefold interpenetrating four-connected {4(4).6(2)} topological sql network, while 6 exhibits a twofold interpenetrating 4-connected 2D framework. Compound 8 features a 6-connected 3D topology net based on a novel bimetallic unit [(Zn)(2)(CO2)(2)] linked by mixed (n)PeOip and bpe ligands. Moreover, thermal and photoluminescence properties of the synthesized complexes were also studied in detail.

Luteolin/epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and SY were selected as the probe and target molecules, respectively. When luteolin or EGCG entered the CB7 host, its fluorescence significantly improved. However, upon the presence of SY in the performed luteolin center dot CB7 or EGCG center dot CB7 complex, this led to a remarkable decrease in fluorescence. This result was due to the fact that the binding constant of CB7/SY (4.9x10(4) M-1) was greater than that of CB7/luteolin (3.2x10(3) M-1) or CB7/EGCG(4.8x10(3) M-1). The fluorescence intensities of CB7/luteolin and CB7/EGCG complexes decreased linearly with increased SY concentration ranges of 0.5-50.0 and 2.0-50.0 mu M. The proposed method had detection limits of 0.12 and 0.45 mu M and was successfully used to determine SY samples with good recoveries ranging from 96.3% to 103.8%. This competitive mode provided a promising fluorescence assay strategy for potential applications in food safety.

In the present study, the cytotoxicity of the defensive secretion (TDS) of B. rynchopetera against AGS Caco-2, HepG2 U251 and Bel-7402 was tested, and the results revealed that TDS had potent cytotoxicity against testing cells with IC50 values of 45.8, 17.4, 53.6, 98.4 and 23.4 g/mL, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was employed to clarify the cytotoxic constituents in TDS of B. rynchopetera and five volatile compounds, including 2-ethyl-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione (3, 31.00%), 1-tridecene (5, 28.02%), 2-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione (2, 22.86%), hydroquinone (4, 1.33%), and p-benzoquinone (1, 1.01%), were identified. Chemical constituent investigation on TDS further supported the presence of 5 above compounds. A cytotoxic assay indicated that compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the testing cell lines, implying that benzoquinones and hydroquinone played important roles in the cytotoxicity of TDS of B. rynchopetera. TDS is a cytotoxic natural material and further studies investigating mechanisms and inhibitory activities on other cell lines is warranted.

In this study, cultured anammox sludge was immobilized using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-sodium alginate (SA) gel and put into a lab-scale column reactor at a packing ratio of 20%, and nitrogen removal performance was evaluated at two hydraulic retention times (HRTs). Anammox was rapidly initiated in the reactor, with ammonium and nitrite removal efficiency reaching 82.3% and 84.7% after an operation period of 10 d. Nitrogen removal efficiency declined greatly after the reduction of IIRT from 24 h to 12 h, but then recovered quickly, with an average TN removal rate of 84.5% and 0.43 kg.m(-3).d(-1 )achieved under the steady operational state. The immobilized anammox reactor performed significantly better and was more stable in nitrogen removal than that with anammox sludge inoculated directly, indicating the superiority of cell entrapment of anammox biomass in addition to its easy reservation. Nitrogen removal in the reactor increased after stable operation with the HRT. It has potential to apply immobilized anammox sludge entrapped by PVA-SA gel for the convenient establishment of an anammox reactor with stable and high nitrogen removal rates.

In Arabidopsis, a major determinant of natural variation in flowering time is FRIGIDA (FRI). In the present study, we show that overexpression of the functional FRIGIDA gene in wild type Col background (ColFRI) positively enhances the drought tolerance by activating P5CS1 expression and promoting proline accumulation during water stress. Furthermore, no significant changes in FRI gene and protein expression levels were observed with drought treatment, whereas P5CS1 protein expression significantly increased. In contrast, vernalization treatment efficiently reduced P5CS1 expression levels and resulted in a decrease in drought tolerance in the ColFRI plants. The flc mutants with a functional FRI background also relieved FRI-mediated activation of P5CS1 during drought tolerance. Taken together, our findings reveal the novel function of FRI in enhancing drought resistance through its downstream P5CS1 pathway during water-deficit stress, which is dependent on its target, the FLC gene.

It has been widely applied to several fields including mineralogy, oceanography and astronomy. However, multispectral images (MSIs) are often corrupted by various noises. In this paper, we propose a MSI denoising model based on nonlocal multitask sparse learning. The nonlocal self-similarity across space and the high correlation of the MSI along the spectrum via multitask sparse learning are fully exploited in the proposed model. A nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than several existing state-of-the-art denoising methods.

This study presented a geostatistical downscaling-calibration procedure to derive the high spatial resolution maps of precipitation over a mountainous watershed affected by a monsoon climate. Based on the relationships between precipitation and other environmental variables, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM), a regression model with a residual correction method was applied to downscale the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product from coarse resolution (25 km) to fine resolution (1 km). Two methods, geographical difference analysis (GDA) and geographical ratio analysis (GRA), were used to calibrate the downscaled TRMM precipitation data. Monthly 1 km precipitation data were obtained by disaggregating 1 km annual downscaled and calibrated precipitation data using monthly fractions derived from original TRMM data. The downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against ground observations measured by rain gauges. According to the comparison of different regression models and residual interpolation methods, a geographically-weighted regression kriging (GWRK) method was accepted to conduct the downscaling of TRMM data. The downscaled TRMM precipitation data obtained using GWRK described the spatial patterns of precipitation reasonably well at a spatial resolution of 1 km with more detailed information when compared with the original TRMM precipitation. The results of validation indicated that the GRA method provided results with higher accuracy than that of the GDA method. The final annual and monthly downscaled precipitation not only had significant improvement in spatial resolution, but also agreed well with data from the validation rain gauge stations (i.e., R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 161.0 mm, MAE = 127.5 mm, and Bias = 0.050 for annual downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015; and R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 22.2 mm, MAE = 13.5 mm, and Bias = 0.048 for monthly downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015). In general, the downscaling-calibration procedure is useful for complex mountainous areas with insufficient ground gauges.

The response of fish exposed to these cyanobacterial chemicals, however, remains largely unknown. In this paper, we employed an endangered fish species (Sinocyclocheilus grahami) in Dianchi Lake, China to evaluate the risks of cell-free exudates (MaE) produced by a dominant cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) on embryo development, as well as the molecular mechanisms responsible. MaE (3d cultured) caused a reduction of fertilization (35.4%) and hatching (15.5%) rates, and increased mortality rates ( 90.0%) and malformation rate (27.6%), typically accompanied by heart failure. Proteomics analysis revealed that two greatest changed proteins - protein S100A1 (over-expressed 26 times compared with control) and myosin light chain (under-expressed 25 fold)- are closely associated with heart function. Further study revealed that heart failure was due to calcium ion imbalance and malformed cardiac structure. We conclude that harmful secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria may adversely affect embryo development in this endangered fish, and possibly contribute to its disappearance and unsuccessful recovery in Dianchi Lake. Hazardous consequences of substances released by cyanobacteria should raise concerns for managers addressing recovery of this and other imperiled species in affected lakes.

After that, a differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was developed for determination of Ce(III) by the obtained sensor. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor possesses good reproducibility and storage stability. Furthermore, it can be used directly for determination of Ce(III) in the concentration range of 3.0 x 10(-12)-1.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1 with the limit of detection of 1.0 x 10(-15) mol L-1. Since over 50-fold excess concentration of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ will produce some interferences in the direct determination of Ce(III), an extraction method was adopted when it be used in food. After extraction of the samples with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-benzopyrazolone (PMBP), Ce(III) can be determined by Ce(III)-IIM/PC/GCE in the presence of > 500-fold excess concentration of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ with the limit of detection of 4.7 x 10(-9) mol L-1. The sensor was successfully applied to determine cerium in food after extracted by PMBP with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of < 3.3% (n = 4) and recoveries in the range of 94.9-102.2%.

The settlement history of modern humans on the Pamirs remains still opaque. Herein, we have sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of 382 individuals belonging to eight populations from the Pamirs and the surrounding lowlands in Central Asia. We construct the Central Asian (including both highlanders and lowlanders) mtDNA haplogroup tree at the highest resolution. All the matrilineal components are assigned into the defined mtDNA haplogroups in East and West Eurasians. No basal lineages that directly emanate from the Eurasian founder macrohaplogroups M, N, and R are found. Our data support the origin of Central Asian being the result of East-West Eurasian admixture. The coalescence ages for more than 93% mtDNA lineages in Central Asians are dated after the last glacial maximum (LGM). The post-LGM and/or later dispersals/admixtures play dominant roles in shaping the maternal gene pool of Central Asians. More importantly, our analyses reveal the mtDNA heterogeneity in the Pamir highlanders, not only between the Turkic Kyrgyz and the Indo-European Tajik groups, but also among three highland Tajiks. No evidence supports positive selection or relaxation of selective constraints in the mtDNAs of highlanders as compared to that of lowlanders. Our results suggest a complex history for the peopling of Pamirs by multiple waves of migrations from various genetic resources during different time scales.

Two types of unprecedented skeletons, benzene-cyclopentanone complex and linear polyketide, and an unusual dimer structure were determined by spectral analysis. Compound, 3 alpha-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L showed moderate activity against HMG-CoA reductase, with an inhibition ratio of 34% at the concentration of 50 mu M, while lovastatin and dihydromonacolin K ethyl ester presented much stronger activity against HMGR with inhibition rates of 85% and 90% at the concentration of 50 mu M, respectively. Aspereusin A was active against AChE with a ratio of 62% at the concentration of 50 mu M, while its stereomers did not showed obvious inhibition (<10%). The configuration at C-4 of these three diastereoisomers was crucial in the inhibition against AChE, and the beta-orientation of substituted methoxyl acrylic acid should be beneficial to the combining with AChE.

By studying mitochondrial DNA variants of 240 Bengali speakers in Bangladesh, among which 23 mitogenomes are completely sequenced, we found a high proportion of South Asian components in this group. By contrast, only a small proportion of lineages can be traced back to western Eurasia, which could be attributed to recent gene flow.

Chromosomal instability (CIN), usually results from defective spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), is a major contributor to many diseases. While it's recently recognized that RSV exhibits a nonlinear dose response for disease prevention, whether it's the case for its role in CIN remains unknown. Here, we investigated the potential of a broad range of RSV concentrations (0.01-100 mu M) on CIN and the underlying mechanisms in human normal colon epithelial NCM460 cells. CIN was measured by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay; mitotic fidelity was determined by aberrant mitosis analysis; SAC activity was assessed by nocodazole-challenge assay, and the expression of SAC genes was examined by RT-qPCR. We found that 0.1 pM RSV significantly reduced CIN (P < 0.01), while 100 pM RSV significantly induced it (P < 0.05). Mitotic infidelity was significantly prevented by 0.1 M RSV but promoted by 100 pM RSV (P < 0.05 for both). Moreover, the function of SAC was sustained and impaired by 0.1 pM and 100 M RSV, respectively. Several SAC genes, including Aurora-B, Aurora-C, Plk-1 and CENP-E, were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated by 0.1 M and 100 M RSV, respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, RSV exhibited a biphasic dose-dependent effect on CIN that was exerted via the regulation of mitotic fidelity through the SAC network. The health implications of these findings were summarized.

This model describes layers with not only characteristics of echo distributions conforming to clinical ones but also varying thicknesses, axial, and radial displacements with pulsatile blood pressure during a cardiac cycle. Methods: The modeling process is as follows: first, a geometrical model according with the clinical structure size of a CCA is built based on the preset layer thicknesses and the diameter of lumen. Second, a three-dimensional scatterer model is constructed by a mapping with a Hilbert space-filling curve from the one-dimensional scatterer distribution with the position and amplitude following Gamma and Gaussian distributions, respectively. The characteristics of three layers and blood are depicted by smoothly adjusting the scatterer density, the scale, and shape parameters of the Gamma distribution as well as the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. To obtain the values of parameters of scatterer distributions, including the shape parameter, density, and intensity, for arterial layers and blood, the envelope signals simulated from different configurations of scatterer distribution are compared with those from different kinds of tissue of CCAs in vivo through a statistic analysis. Finally, the dynamic scatterer model is realized based on the blood pressure, elasticity modulus of intima-media (IM) and adventitia, varying IM thickness, axial displacement of IM as well as blood flow velocity at central axis during a cardiac cycle. Then, the corresponding radiofrequency (RF) signals, envelope signals, and B-mode images of the pulsatile CCA are generated in a dynamic scanning mode using Field II platform. Results: The three arterial layers, blood, and surrounding tissue in simulated B-mode ultrasound images are clearly legible. The results based on a statistical analysis for the envelope signals from 30 simulations indicate that the echo characteristics of blood, intima, media, and adventitia are in accordant with clinical ones. The maximum relative errors between the preset geometrical sizes and the measured ones from the simulated images for the diameter of the lumen and the thicknesses of the intima, media, and adventitia are 0.13%, 3.89%, 1.35%, and 0.06%, respectively. For the dynamic parameters, the variation in IM thickness, the radial displacements of lumen and adventitia as well as the axial displacement of IM and blood flow velocity are measured with the mean relative errors of 68.03%, 9.27%, 2.10%, 4.93%, and 17.34%, respectively. Conclusion: The simulated results present static sizes and dynamical variations according with preset values; echo distributions conforming to clinical versions. Therefore, the presented simulation model could be useful as a data source to evaluate the performance of studies on measurements of ultrasound-based tissue structures and dynamic parameters for the CCA layers.

J	Li, G; Shum, KP				Li, Gang; Shum, K. P.			A General Representation Theorem of a Kind of Super B-Quasi-Ehresmann Semigroups	BULLETIN OF THE MALAYSIAN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES SOCIETY			English	Article						Quasi-Ehresmann semigroup; Super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroups; Right regular triple; Left semiregular band; Spined products	ASTERISK-INVERSE SEMIGROUPS; ABUNDANT SEMIGROUPS; ADEQUATE SEMIGROUPS	We first study the structure of a special generalized regular semigroup, namely the B-semiabundant semigroup which can be expressed as the join of the pseudo-varieties of finite groups and finite aperiodic groups. In the literature, the weakly B-semiabundant semigroups have recently been thoughtfully investigated and considered by Wang. One easily observes that the class of good B-semiabundant semigroups is a special class of semigroups embraces all abundant (and hence regular) semigroups. In particular, a super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroup is an analogy of an orthodox semigroup within the class of B-semiabundant semigroups. Thus, the class of super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroups is obviously a subclass of the class of good B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroups which contains all orthodox semigroups. Thus, the super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroup behaves similarly as the Clifford subsemigroups within the class of regular semigroups. Consequently, a super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroup is now recognized as an important generalized regular semigroup. Our aim in this paper is to describe the properties and intrinsic structure of a super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroup whose band of projections is right regular, right normal, left semiregular, left seminormal, regular, left quasinormal or normal, respectively. Hence, our representation theorem of the super B-quasi-Ehresmann semigroups improves, strengthens and generalizes the well-known "standard representation theorem of an orthodox semigroup" established by He et al. (Commun. Algebra 33:745-761, 2005). Finally, a general representation theorem in the category of Ehresmann semigroups is given.

Results indicated that annual mean air temperature showed a significant warming trend, which is equivalent to a rate of 0.17 A degrees C/decade during the past 50 years. Seasonal mean air temperature presents a rising trend, and the trend was more significant in winter (0.31 A degrees C/decade) than in other seasons. Annual/seasonal mean air temperature tends to increase in most areas, and higher warming trend appeared in urban areas, notably in Kunming city. The regional mean air temperature series was significantly impacted by urban warming, and the urbanization-induced warming contributed to approximately 32.3-62.9 % of the total regional warming during the past 50 years. Meantime, the urbanization-induced warming trend in winter and spring was more significant than that in summer and autumn. Since 1985, the urban heat island (UHI) intensity has gradually increased. And the urban temperatures always rise faster than rural temperatures on the CYP.

Here we investigated the effects of 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone on urate levels, xanthine oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase (XOD/XDH) activities in hypoxanthine-induced hyperuricemic mice, as well as the effects of 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone on the mRNA expression levels and content of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PRPPAT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). Our results demonstrated that 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg) reduced the uric acid levels in serum of the hyperuricemic mice in dose-and time-dependent manners. The activities of XOD/XDH in serum and liver were also significantly inhibited by 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone; In addition, 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone decreased the mRNA expression of HGPRT in brain and content of PRPS and PRPPAT in liver. These findings demonstrated that 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone suppresses uric acid production by affecting the critical enzymes, XOD/XDH, PRPS, PRPPAT and HGPRT in purine nucleotide metabolism.

NOV.; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; SEQUENCES; TREES	A novel aerobic, Gram-positive, non-motile halotolerant actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 96448(T), was isolated from a saline soil sample collected from the south bank of Aiding Lake in Xinjiang Province, northwest China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YIM 96448(T) is closely related to Phytoactinopolyspora endophytica EGI 60009(T) (98.0%) and Phytoactinopolyspora alkaliphila EGI 80629(T) (97.0%). Optimum growth of the strain was observed at 28-37 degrees C, pH 7-9 and in the presence of 5-8% NaCl (w/v). The respiratory quinone of strain YIM 96448(T) was determined to be MK-9(H-4). The major fatty acids (> 10%) were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and summed feature 4 (iso-C-17:1 I and/or anteiso-C17:1B). The polar lipid profile was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified aminophospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol, two phosphatidylinositol mannosides, three unidentified phosphoglycolipids and four unidentified phospholipids. The DNA G+C content was determined to be 68.7 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain YIM 96448(T) should be classified as a novel species in the genus Phytoactinopolyspora, for which the name Phytoactinopolyspora halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 96448(T) (=CCTCC AB 2017055(T) = KCTC 39924(T)).

The radio SNR shows the typical radio continuum spectrum of a mature supernova remnant with a spectral index of alpha = -0.55 +/- 0.02 and moderate polarized intensity. Magnetic field vectors indicate a tangential magnetic field, expected for an evolved SNR, in one part of the SNR, and a radial magnetic field in the other. The latter can be explained by an overlapping arc-like feature, perhaps a pulsar wind nebula, emanating from the magnetar. The presence of a pulsar wind nebula is supported by the low average braking index of 1.2, which we extrapolated for the magnetar, and the detection of diffuse X-ray emission around it. We found a distance of 12.5 kpc for the SNR, which identifies G57.2+0.8 as a resident of the Outer spiral arm of the Milky Way. The SNR has a radius of about 20 pc and could be as old as 41,000 yr. The SNR has already entered the radiative or pressure-driven snowplow phase of its evolution. We compare independently determined characteristics like age and distance for both the SNR and the soft gamma repeater SGR 1935+2154, and conclude that they are physically related.

In this study, we sequenced whole genomes of 110 wild brown rats with a diverse world-wide representation. We reveal that brown rats migrated out of southern East Asia, rather than northern Asia as formerly suggested, into the Middle East and then to Europe and Africa, thousands of years ago. Comparison of genomes from different geographical populations reveals that many genes involved in the immune system experienced positive selection in the wild brown rat.

In most cases, germination-enhancing fungi have been isolated from roots of mature plants for conservation and cultivation purposes. To understand the germination biology of Dendrobium devonianum, an over-collected medicinal orchid, the seeds of D. devonianum were inoculated with a fungal strain (FDd1) isolated from naturally occurring protocorms of D. devonianum and two other germination-enhancing fungal strains (FDaI7 and FCb4) from D. aphyllum and Cymbidium mannii, respectively. The fungal strain was isolated from five protocorms of D. devonianum and identified as a species of the genus Epulorhiza. In germination trials, treatments with all of the three fungal strains showed a significant promoting effect on seed germination and protocorm formation, compared with the control treatment (no inoculation). However, FDd1 fungal strain showed the greatest effectiveness followed by FDaI7 and FCb4. For all inoculation and control treatments, seeds developed to protocorms regardless of the presence of illumination, whereas protocorms did not develop to seedlings unless illumination was provided. The results of our manipulative experiments confirmed the hypothesis that mycorrhizae associated with orchid seedlings are highly host-specific, and the degree of specificity may be life stagespecific under in vitro conditions. The specific mycorrhizal symbionts from protocorms can enhance restoration efforts and the conservation of orchids such as D. devonianum.

However, besides social rewarding, antisocial rewarding is also ordinary. Thus, we study the evolution of cooperation on prison dilemma game with strategy-neutral rewarding, namely a mechanism including social and antisocial rewarding. Two additional strategies, rewarding cooperators (RC) and rewarding defectors (RD), which establish union-like support to aid akin players are introduced. We show that the new mechanism greatly promotes the evolution of cooperation even in the presence of antisocial rewarding. The rewarding cooperators can enjoy both the benefits of their prosocial contributions and the corresponding rewards, thus they can form cooperative clusters to resist the aggression of defectors. On the other hand, due to their inherent greedy, rewarding defectors fail to secure a sustainable future. Our research might provide valuable insights into further exploring the nature of cooperation in the real world. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the traditional framework of mining prevalent co-location patterns produces numerous redundant co-location patterns, which makes it hard for users to understand or apply. To address this issue, in this paper, we study the problem of reducing redundancy in a collection of prevalent co-location patterns by utilizing the spatial distribution information of co-location instances. We first introduce the concept of semantic distance between a co-location pattern and its super-patterns, and then define redundant co-locations by introducing the concept of delta-covered, where delta (0 <= d <= 1) is a coverage measure. We develop two algorithms RRclosed and RRnull to perform the redundancy reduction for prevalent co-location patterns. The former adopts the post-mining framework that is commonly used by existing redundancy reduction techniques, while the latter employs the mine-and-reduce framework that pushes redundancy reduction into the co-location mining process. Our performance studies on the synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the size of the original collection of closed co-location patterns by about 50 percent. Furthermore, the RRnull method runs much faster than the related closed co-location pattern mining algorithm.

The high performance in detecting butane were achieved for the well-adhered products with unique porous surface appearance on the sensors fabricated using indirect heating method, which demonstrated the superiority of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) in synthesizing complex oxides. The possible explanations of the high butane gas-sensing characteristics of these sensors were based on the results of BET and XPS. The large surface area could provide sufficient interface between the materials and butane gas, and the adsorbed oxygen species having strong oxidation activity could break the butane molecules into CO2 and H2O. The gas-sensing properties of Pt-modified AZO were investigated by testing the gas responses towards butane. The maximum response of the 5% PtAZO based gas sensor reached 56.52-3000 ppm butane at 200 degrees C. What's more, the sensor also exhibited good short-and long-term stability, repeatability and selectivity, which made it a potential candidate in the application of monitoring butane. In the end, the possible mechanisms of gas-sensing properties were discussed.

Marshal			Non-fragile filtering for singular Markovian jump systems with missing measurements	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Singular Markovian jump systems; Non-fragile filter; Missing measurement phenomenon; Time-varying delay	H-INFINITY CONTROL; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; TIME-DELAY; PASSIVE CONTROL; FUZZY-SYSTEMS; OUTPUT; STABILITY	In this paper, the issue of an non-fragile filter design is addressed for a class of discrete-time singular Markovian jump systems subject to time-varying delay and missing measurements based on the extended passivity theory. In particular, the missing probability is assumed to be affected by norm-bounded uncertainties. Moreover, the proposed filter design is more general and realistic since it unifies the mode independent and mode-dependent characteristics in a single framework. By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory and Abel lemma, a new set of sufficient conditions is established which ensures the stochastic admissibility of the resulting error system with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. Based on the sufficient conditions, the explicit expression of the desired filter gain matrices is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-fragile filter design, wherein it is showed that the proposed method yields less conservative results over some existing methods.
