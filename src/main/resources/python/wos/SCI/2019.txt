Herein, a sophisticated concentration ratio of HI and HCl additives were investigated to improve the V-oc of the all-inorganic PSCs devices. The SEM and XRD results showed that perovskite thin films with fewer pinholes and higher crystallinity are fabricated. Furthermore, we found that the best V-oc of 0.92 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.69% were obtained with formed using a HCl volume percentage of 6 vol%, which is higher than alpha-CsPbI3 solar cells with pristine HI additives (0.87 V of V-oc). It is believed that take a minute quantity HCl doping at least for high-quality inorganic perovskite thin films growth and improves the V-oc of PEDOT:PSS/alpha-CsPbI3 PSCs device.

The optimal complementary conservation areas are often identified by implementing two approaches in systematic conservation planning, i.e., unlocking or locking existing PAs. However, evidence-based studies are lacking for clarifying the efficiencies of these two planning approaches. With Sichuan in southwest China - part of a global biodiversity hotspot - as one case, this study first assessed the ecological representativeness of existing nature reserves (NRs). Using 32 natural vegetation types as the conservation features, we then implemented a systematic conservation planning process by running Marxan software with NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. A human disturbance index was also included as a penalty function in Marxan for achieving cost-effective planning. We finally investigated the efficiencies of the unlocking and locking planning approaches by comparing the outcomes of the NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. We found that existing NRs were geographically biased towards the western mountainous regions with high elevations and low human disturbance levels. For achieving the same quantitative conservation targets, the total area of the NR-locked priority conservation areas was 18.6% larger than that of the NR-unlocked areas, whereas the area of NR-locked complementary areas to existing NRs was 15.3% smaller than that of NR-unlocked ones. Moreover, the NR-locked priority conservation areas had higher ecological representativeness than NR-unlocked areas. The results suggest that if a completely new PA system is to be established without considering existing PAs, the unlocking approach could more efficiently achieve the full conservation targets at lower costs of land area and with better connected habitats. When existing PAs must be used as focal areas for expansion, the locking approach is more cost-effective for filling conservation gaps by requiring smaller amounts of complementary areas. Our analysis provides evidence-based support for expanding the current PA systems in a cost-effective manner. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although thioredoxin has been characterized as playing important roles in many cellular processes in other species, its function in nematophagous fungi has not been studied. Here, the function of a thioredoxin homolog, Aotrx1, was investigated in A. oligospora. Methods The encoding gene of Aotrx1 in the nematophagous fungus A. oligospora was knocked out by homologous recombination; strain growth was assessed. Results The Delta Aotrx1 strain of A. oligospora showed a significant decrease in growth rate on different media (PDA, CMY, and TG), a 70% decrease of conidia production, and a lower germination rate compared with the wild type. The mutant strain was unable to form traps to capture nematodes and was more sensitive to SDS and H2O2. Conclusion Thioredoxin is involved in conidia development, trap formation, normal mycelial growth, and resistance to environmental stresses in the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora.

Most of the recovered specimens are referred to a relatively advanced and large species of Suinae, Propotamochoerus hyotherioides, based on dental dimensions and morphology. Detailed morphological comparisons were made between the Shuitangba Pr. hyotherioides and other Asian Miocene suines. From these comparisons, we suggest that Pr. hyotherioides from Shuitangba and northern China may be relatively derived compared to the specimens from Lufeng and Yuanmou, southern China and that Pr. hyotherioides and Pr. wui represent separate branches of the genus in China. Furthermore, Microstonyx differs from Pr. hyotherioides in p4/P4 and m3/M3 characters. Molarochoerus is suggested to represent a relatively derived taxon due to the uniquely molarized upper and lower fourth premolars. Miochoerus youngi is suggested to have a closer relationship to Sus and Microstonyx than to Propotamochoerus due to its small size and p4 morphology. Hippopotamodon ultimus, Potamochoerus chinhsienense, Dicoryphochoerus medius, and D. binxianensis exhibit complex morphologies that variously resemble Propotamochoerus, Microstonyx, and Sus and are suggested to be possible transitional forms between Propotamochoerus, Microstonyx, and Sus. However, the resolution of their classification requires further analysis when more material is recovered.

A library of 23 compounds has been synthesized based on the highly conserved active site of VEGFR-2. Several title compounds exhibited selective inhibitory activities against VEGFR-2, which also displayed selective anti-proliferation potency against HepG2 cell. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for anti-angiogenesis capability. Compound 7o showed the most potent anti-angiogenesis ability, the efficient cytotoxic activities (in vitro against HUVEC and HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.58 and 0.23 mu M, respectively). The molecular docking analysis revealed 7o is a Type-II inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase. In general, these results indicated these arylamide-5-anilinoquinazoline-8-nitro derivatives are promising inhibitors of VEGFR-2 for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis.

Understanding of the hydrological variability of these rivers is still limited, however, because of the lack of long-term streamflow records. Tree-ring width chronologies from six sites are applied to reconstruct annual streamflow of the Salween River, the last remaining large free-flowing transboundary river draining the southern TP, and a critical water source for countries of Southeast Asia. Response function analysis shows that precipitation is the main factor limiting the radial growth of the sampled trees. Linear regression of annual (September-June) Salween River streamflow on the first principal component of tree-ring chronologies explains 53.4% of the streamflow variance, 1958-2011, and yields a reconstruction for the interval 1500-2011 CE. A tally of droughts and wet periods emphasizes the severity of droughts before the start of the gauged records, and a tendency toward wetter conditions in recent decades. Regional temperature is negatively associated with the reconstructed streamflow. Cold wet summers controlled by the Asian summer monsoon are responsible for an increasing trend in streamflow over the last decades. Reconstructed hydrological change is linked to the history of mainland Southeast Asia through the impact of water shortages on Burma society. In particular, prolonged periods of low flow of the Salween River coincide with the falls of the Toungoo Empires and the First Anglo-Burmese War. This tree-ring reconstruction provides a long-term perspective on hydrological changes in the Upper Salween River Basin that can give insight for sustainable water management on the TP and in Myanmar.

We describe a newly-discovered habitat for B. lidderdalii in Yunnan, China. We report the life history of B. lidderdalii, observed from 2016 to 2018, both in the butterfly's natural habitat and in captive breeding. We contrast the life cycle of B. lidderdalii in Yunnan with that of other populations recorded in Bhutan and India, as well as that of other species in the genus. In its natural habitat, the major threats to the larval stages of B. lidderdalii include inclement weather and parasitization. We add Aristolochia ovatifolia (Hwang, 1981) to the list of recorded hostplants of this species. Our biometric measurement of 419 A. ovatifolia hostplants within the study habitat shows that although B. lidderdalii is locally abundant, hostplants preferred for oviposition are <38 cm in height and are only found within broadleaf forests with abundant nectar plants. We suggest that the conservation management of B. lidderdalii and other butterfly species that rely on patchily distributed Aristolochia hostplants focus on assessing the distribution of isolated broadleaf forest habitats within temperate pine forests and studying the species' dispersal ability across patches.

Members of sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), which is a family of plant-specific Ser/Thr kinases, are important components of signaling pathways involved in plant developmental processes and responses to stresses. There are 10 members of the SnRK2 family in rice; however, their functions are poorly understood, as are the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results In this study, we found that OsSAPK9, which belongs to the SnRK2 family, positively regulated salt-stress tolerance and strain-specific resistance to bacterial blight in rice. RNA sequencing revealed that there were 404 and 1324 genes differentially expressed in OsSAPK9-RNAi in comparison with wild-type plants under salt-stress conditions and after Xoo inoculation, respectively, which participate in basic metabolic processes. In total, 65 common differentially expressed genes involved mainly in defense responses were detected both under salt-stress conditions and after Xoo inoculation. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that OsSAPK9 forms a protein complex with the molecular chaperones OsSGT1 and OsHsp90, and transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1 exhibited decreased tolerances to salt stress and significantly increased resistance levels to bacterial blight. Thus, OsSAPK9 may function as a center node regulator of salt-stress responses and disease-resistance pathways through its interaction with OsSGT1 in rice. Conclusion This study confirms that OsSAPK9 functions as a positive regulator of salt-stress responses and disease resistance through its interaction with OsSGT1 in rice.

NOV.; MEMBER	A novel strain, YIM 131921(T), was isolated from a Physcia sp. lichen collected from the South Bank Forest of the Baltic Sea. The strain is Gram-negative, catalase positive and oxidase negative, strictly aerobic, asporogenous, non-motile and reddish brown in colour. The temperature and pH for growth were found to be 20-30 degrees C (optimum 28 degrees C) and pH 6.5-12.0 (optimum pH 7.0 +/- 0.5). No growth was observed in the presence of NaCl. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain YIM 131921(T) shares high similarities with Rubellimicrobium roseum YIM 48858(T) (98.3%), followed by Rubellimicrobium mesophilum MSL-20(T) (96.8%), Rubellimicrobium aerolatum 5715S-9(T) (96.1%) and Rubellimicrobium thermophilum DSM 16684(T) (96.0%). Phylogenetic trees showed YIM 131921(T) forms a cluster with type strains of the genus Rubellimicrobium. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>20%) were identified as summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c) and C-16:0. Q-10 was found to be the predominant respiratory ubiquinone. The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, glycolipid, phospholipids and an unidentified aminolipid. The DNA G+C content of the draft genome sequence is 66.6 mol%. Strain YIM 131921(T) showed an average nucleotide identity value of 80.3% and a digital DNA-DNA hybridizations value of 26.1% with the reference strain R. roseum YIM 48858(T) based on draft genome sequences.

The taxonomic position of the isolate was investigated by a polyphasic approach. The novel isolate was found to be aerobic and rod-shaped. Colonies were observed to be pale yellow and circular. The strain was found to grow at pH 7.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0), 45-65 degrees C (optimum, 55 degrees C) and in the presence of up to 1.5% NaCl. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YIM 78456(T) and other members of the genus Thermus showed sequence similarities ranging from 90.3 to 97.3%, with strain YIM 78456(T) showing close sequence similarity to Thermus caliditerrae YIM 77925(T) (97.3%). The phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 78456(T) forms a distinct clade with T. caliditerrae YIM 77925(T). The predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-8 and the DNA G+C content was determined to be 65.1 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids (>10%) were identified as iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:0. The polar lipids were found to consist of an aminophospholipid, a phospholipid and glycolipids. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, as well as genotypic data, it is proposed that strain YIM 78456(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermus, for which the name Thermus caldilimi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78456(T) (=KCTC 52948(T)=NBRC 113036(T)).

By viewing the number of seeds per pod as a quantitative measure of successful pollination, we examined seed pods in 4637 herbarium specimens of 109 obligately outcrossing legumes collected over the past century. We found that only 13 species showed significant temporal change with nine of those as an increase. None of the three subfamilies of legumes showed a consistent trend, and the subfamily Papilionoideae with the most specialized flowers, had increasing seed number per pod more often than decreasing. We conclude that legume pollination in China shows no sign of disruption and the effects of plant-pollinator disruption may be more complicated than simplistic predictions have allowed.

When applying the popular empirical likelihood to data with nonignorable nonresponses, Wilks's phenomenon does not hold. This paper unveils that this is caused by the extra estimation of the nuisance parameter in the nonignorable nonresponse propensity. Motivated by this result, we propose an adjusted empirical likelihood for which Wilks's theorem holds. Asymptotic results are presented and supplemented by simulation results for finite sample performance of the point estimators and confidence regions.

Although soil microbes play a key role in ecosystem functioning, their response to grassland degradation has not been fully investigated. In particular, degraded patch formation is the main feature of alpine meadow degradation, but little is known about its effect on soil microbes. In this study, soils were collected from three patch-degraded Tibetan alpine meadows to examine the effects of degraded patch formation on soil microbial communities. The alpine meadows at the three sites were in the third to fifth stages of degradation, respectively. Soil microbial abundance and community structure were determined through real-time PCR and MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the degraded patch formation significantly decreased microbial respiration rates, changed the interaction patterns among microbial taxa, and increased fungal diversity, but did not significantly affect microbial abundance. Additionally, both prokaryotic and fungal community composition was significantly altered by the degraded patch formation. The functional predictions based on FAPROTAX and FUNGuild suggested that degraded patch formation significantly increased the proportion of nitrifiers, plant pathogenic fungi, and saprotrophic fungi, especially when mattic epipedons were eroded. The increased relative abundance of nitrifiers and pathogenic fungi can aggravate the risk of nitrogen leaching and plant diseases, respectively. Therefore, degraded patch formation can impede the recovery of degraded alpine meadows by changing soil microbial community composition.

Current FPS assessment methods mainly depend on regional census statistical data and do not take the local variability in slope and SWC measures into consideration, which may lead to errors. Based on field monitoring, this study qualified the relationship between slopes, SWC measures, and crop yields, and proposed a data downscaling method (DDM) to estimate FPS in a mountainous region. The results showed that corn yield per hectare (CYPH) was negatively related to slope; a one-degree increase in slope resulted in a 267 kg.ha(-1) decrease in CYPH on farmland without SWC measures (FWOM) and a 336 kg.ha(-1) decrease in farmland with SWC measures (FWM). Although FWOM accounted for 52.47% of the total farmland in the study area, it only provided 29.86% of FPS. FWM on a slope < 15 degrees was the key area for providing FPS, which indicated that the traditional FPS assessment method (using the census statistical data) was inaccurate compared with DDM. DDM can help to improve the accuracy of ecosystem services assessment and trade-off analyses, and thus contribute to more targeted land use planning in a mountainous region.

Static tests showed that the scale inhibition efficiency (SI%) was close to 87.60% for CaCO3 at the concentration of 80 mg/L s-EPS. Electrochemical technique results showed that s-EPS inhibition efficiencies, in relation to 316L stainless steel (SS), and at the concentration of 40 mg/L, reached 91.05% at 10 d and 91.16% at 30 d, respectively. The high anti-scale and anti-corrosion performance of s-EPS was related to their chelating, adsorption, and biomineralization abilities. s-EPS integrated with metal ions on the SS surface, resulting in formation of a thin but dense biomineralized film, which exhibited lasting corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, s-EPS controlled the kinetic pathway of CaCO3 biomineralized nucleation and crystal growth, which inhibited CaCO3 crystal precipitation. This finding suggests that B. cereus s-EPS may offer a green, sustainable, and economic strategy for anti-corrosion and anti-scale application in industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the ideal electrocatalysts are noble metal based catalysts. Their high cost and scarcity in earth seriously restrict the large deployments. NiFe-based materials have attracted great attention in recent years due to their excellent catalytic properties for OER and HER. Nevertheless, their conductivity and electrochemical stability at high current density are unsatisfactory, resulting in ineffective water splitting due to high impedance and low stability. Recently, a series of catalysts coating NiFe-based materials on 3D nickel foam were found to be extremely stable under the circumstance of high current density. In this review, we summarized the recent advances of NiFe-based materials on nickel foam for OER and HER, respectively, and further provided the perspectives for their future development.

Here we investigate dominant climatic drivers and test actively-discussed hypotheses of Southeast China delta(18)Op variability over multiple timescales, using an 8-yr-long daily delta(18)Op record from Guangzhou and updated GNIP dataset from Hong Kong. Our moisture source diagnostic analyses suggest that the primary moisture of Guangzhou precipitation essentially comes from the proximal northern South China Sea (SCS). Convective activities over the primary moisture source regions, measured by cumulative precipitation along back-trajectory, regional precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, play a key role in regulating delta(18)Op variability across different timescales. These effects can be related to the direct changes of convection intensity over the SCS or the indirect changes associated with the shift of moisture source. In consequence, delta(18)Op records seasonal monsoon dynamics associated with the intertropical convergence zone migration and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Further tests of different hypotheses and their links to the ENSO via the 2015 strong El Nino event support the above conclusions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Southeast China delta(18)Op represents a spatial-temporally integrated measure of precipitation and convection tracing from the measured site to moisture sources, shedding light on the interpretation of paleo-isotope data in the monsoon domain.

Although WEU is recognized as an important hydrological feature, little is known about its effects on aquatic ecosystems. Herein, two laboratory experiments were conducted to test the effects of WEU on 1) environmental conditions in the absence of plants, and 2) both environmental conditions and plant growth in the presence of two wetland macrophytes Phalaris arundinacea and Polygonum hydropiper. A two-factor factorial design comprising WEU (low-, intermediate-, and high-level of unevenness) and burial depth (0 and 5 cm) was used for both experiments. Compared to turbidity, pH, and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration of the waterbody, dissolved oxygen concentration showed the highest sensitivity to WEU, which decreased significantly with increasing WEU regardless of the absence or presence of plants. For the sediment, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), NO3-N, total N, available P, and total P decreased consistently with increasing WEU, regardless of burial depth and the absence or presence of plants. Furthermore, deeper burial led to further decreases in soil ORP for all three WEU levels. Biomass accumulation decreased with increasing WEU and burial depth in both plant species. Additionally, plants developed shorter and thicker roots, and the root alcohol dehydrogenase activity increased, but there was a decrease in the root mass ratio, likely due to the plants adapting to anaerobic stress under higher WEU levels and/or deeper burial conditions. However, under deeper burial conditions, increased WEU generally did not lead to further root adjustments due to the limited nutrient absorption capacity. Consequently, plant biomass decreased by 49.82% for P. arundinacea and 76.94% for P. hydropiper from low to high WEU levels at 5 cm burial depth compared to values of 39.68% and 45.71% at 0 cm burial depth, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrated that WEU strongly influences the performances of wetland macrophytes through modulation of oxygen and nutrient availability. Considering that anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are markedly altering the WEU of lake ecosystems, we call for more research into this hydrological element to assess its potential ecological impacts.

The XRD and XPS patterns showed that the nanocrystals crystallize in the wurtzite structure with F and Na codoping without any secondary phases. The ferromagnetic state of Zn0.95Na0.025F0.025O revealed an almost monotonic increase with increasing oxygen vacancy concentration below 2.5 mol% doping of Na. Meanwhile, the magnetization showed an inverse trend with increased Na ions, indicating that the oxygen vacancy mediated by Na+ exchange antiferromagnetic state is predominant. It is very interesting that the variation trend of magnetic and gas sensing properties of Zn0.95-xNaxF0.025O nanocrystals mostly conforms to that of the photoluminescence in our experiments. The gas sensing results demonstrate that oxygen vacancy has a significant effect for as gas-sensitive materials rather than nanoparticle/crystallite size in this work. And it is meaningful to explore the potential relationship of nanocrystal defects on the optical, magnetic, and gas sensing properties of Zinc oxide-based multifunctional nanomaterials.

It has been shown that M-tensors, Hilbert tensors and stochastic tensors can be positive definite under proper conditions. However, there are still many positive definite tensors that can not be determined by the above criteria. In this paper, we provide a new class of positive definite tensors whose non-diagonal entries can be positive compared to (strong) M-tensors, and we call it strong Mz-tensors, which can arise from discretizing differential equations, since it is based on Z-eigenvalues rather than H-eigenvalues traditionally. Moreover, we show that an even-order (strong) M-tensor must be an (a strong) Mz-tensor, which reflects the inclusion relationship between even-order M-tensors. We also introduce (strong) Hz-tensors, as a generalization of (strong) Mz-tensors, and its positive semi-definiteness (positive definiteness) has been studied. Finally, some conditions are given for a tensor to be an (a strong) Mz-tensor and we use it to study the stability of a high-order nonlinear system.

Fossil remains of Mamenchisaurus are primarily found in the Upper Shaximiao Formation and less frequently in the overlying Suining Formation in the Sichuan Basin. An accurate absolute age for Mamenchisaurus is critical for understanding the evolution and radiation of the mamenchisaurids. However, reliable age determinations for the Mamenchisaurus-bearing formations are lacking. In this study, we provide robust detrital zircon U/Pb ages (mean ages of 114.4 +/- 1.1 Ma; Aptian) for rocks from the classic fossil outcrops of the Suining Formation in the Sichuan Basin. Our data indicate an extremely long chronological gap between M. anyuensis (114.4 +/- 1.1 Ma) and the earlier Mamenchisaurus (Late Jurassic). This indicates mamenchisaurids may have lived at least 30 million years longer than previously thought. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose the coevolution of popularity and strategy and explore potential reasons that how this setup affects the evolution of cooperation in structured population. The popularity of each individual is defined as a function of parameter alpha and vertex weight that evolves by delta overtime. Through simulation, we find that our mechanism enables the survival of cooperation when b is relatively large. For the above results, we provide a detailed explanation through systematic analysis of typical configuration patterns.

Herein, we have constructed series of samarium activated sodium lanthanum metaphosphate NaLaP4O12 (abbreviated as: NLP) phosphors via the high-temperature solid phase synthesis process. The crystalline phase composition, micromorphology, ionic valence states, diffuse reflectance absorption performance and concentration quenching mechanism were solved in detail. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) behavior of the as-prepared samples is closely dependent on the doping Sm3+ concentration. The optimized PL strategy is as following: the strongest excitation line is located at 401 nm, and the optimal doping concentration is 7 mol%. NLP:7%Sm3+ displays intense orange-red visible luminescence with the dominant (4)G(5/2 )-> H-6(7/2) transitions located at 596 and 605 nm. The detailed investigation on CIE chromaticity coordinates, color purity (CP), correlated color temperature (CCT), internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and fluorescence lifetime suggests that we may use NLP:Sm3+ micropowder as alternative ingredient for phosphor-converted near UV-based warm white LEDs.

In this paper, a maximum latewood density (MXD) chronology of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana) was constructed from the Tien Shan, Central Asia. Correlation analyses indicate that the MXD variations of spruce trees in the Tien Shan are mainly limited by summer temperature variations. The July-August mean temperature was reconstructed for the Tien Shan back to 1615 CE. The temperature reconstruction explained 42.9% of the instrumental variance (1930-2005). This reconstruction successfully captured the past temperature variabilities in the Tien Shan and enabled visualization of the cool climate before 1850s and the climatic warming after the 1850s. Agreement among the temperature series of the Tien Shan and regional temperature records based on MXDs from Eurasia suggested that our reconstruction had good reliability, captured some warm/cold periods, and first principal component of these MXD records showed that there are strong large-scale temperature forcings in Eurasia. Our study also showed that there is a linkage between temperature changes in Central Asia and the atmospheric circulations of the middle-high latitude westerly region and the sea surface temperatures of both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. The positive correlations among the principal component time series of regional temperature reconstructions based on MXDs and Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions revealed that the MXD chronologies from Central Asia have the potential for developing large-scale temperature reconstruction.

The hierarchical MFI zeolites containing Fe and/or Cu were characterized with XRD, FT-IR, SEM, UV-Vis and N-2-sorption techniques. UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy demonstrated that some of the Fe and Cu cations were incorporated into the zeolite framework. Direct amination of benzene to aniline with H2O2 and NH3 was studied using a series of Fe and/or Cu doped ZSM-5 catalysts. The effect of Fe and/or Cu incorporation into ZSM-5 catalyst and crystallite size of the catalyst on the benzene conversion, product distribution and aniline selectivity in the direct amination reaction was investigated. Nanocrystallite hierarchical Fe,Cu/ZSM-5 exhibited the best catalytic oxido-amination performance (conversion of benzene was 23.7% and selectivity for aniline was 74.1%). [GRAPHICS] .

To address this problem, we focus on the uncertainty of turnover risk of software developer (TRSD) and its loss incurred to projects. To tackle this problem, we propose a method to quantify the uncertain risks related to developer turnover, including resignation and replacement. Additionally, to calculate the extent of loss caused by TRSD, we employed machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining techniques to identify software development activities and establish the importance of developers by mining and analyzing the commit event logs. Moreover, based on the information entropy theory, we established a risk measurement model of TRSD that can be used to measure the risk level of each developer and the holistic risk of ongoing software projects. Finally, we validated the feasibility and efficacy through a case study.

Northern Tibet represents a key area to decipher the structural and kinematic links between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic evolution of Tibet. Nonetheless, the Mesozoic tectonic setting of the North Tibet and the role that the Paleozoic inherited Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) shearing zone played in controlling the regional tectonic pattern during the deposition of the Mesozoic strata remain controversial. This study is based on seismic reflections, isopach maps of the Mesozoic strata in the Qaidam Basin, and provenance analysis using detrital zircon geochronological and heavy mineral contents. Seismic reflections and isopach maps demonstrate that sustained strike-slip motion along the ATF during the Early to Late Jurassic induced transtensional basin formation. Further away from the main ATF (eastern parts of the Qilian Shan and the northern Qaidam Basin), transtension also occurred along major faults, although local transpression developed in relay zones. Rotation in the regional stress field induced compression and basin inversion during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. The Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in these regions display widespread growth strata and angular unconformities characteristic of compression. This is consistent with topographic changes marked by sediment source variation evidenced by detrital zircon geochronology and heavy mineral analysis. We propose that the mechanism driving the Jurassic extension/transtension in North Tibet could be related to far-field effects of subduction processes along the southern margins of the continent.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						ballast water treatment; chlorine; colonization pressure; invasive species; non-indigenous species; relative propagule pressure; zooplankton	PROPAGULE PRESSURE; SPECIES INTRODUCTIONS; COLONIZATION PRESSURE; DIAPAUSING EGGS; TRANSPORT STAGE; ZOOPLANKTON; RISK; SURVEILLANCE; COMMUNITIES; ATTENUATION	Ballast water has been identified as a leading vector for introduction of non-indigenous species. Recently, the International Maritime Organization implemented management standards-D-2-where all large, commercial ships trading internationally are required to adopt an approved treatment system using technologies such as ultraviolet radiation or chlorination. However, current management regulations are based only on the total abundance of viable taxa transported (i.e. total propagule pressure), largely ignoring species richness (i.e. colonization pressure). To determine the efficacy of chlorine treatment in reducing invasion risks and changes in transported biological communities inside ballast tanks, we used DNA metabarcoding-based approaches to estimate colonization pressure (here, the number of species/operational taxonomic units [OTUs] introduced) and relative propagule pressure (relative abundance of each species/OTU) of zooplankton communities in control and chlorine treated tanks during four transatlantic voyages. Our study demonstrated that transport itself did not significantly reduce colonization pressure of zooplankton species, nor did chlorine treatment. Chlorine treatment altered community structure by reducing relative propagule pressure of some taxa such as Mollusca and Rotifera, while increasing relative propagule pressure of some Oligohymenophorea and Copepoda species. Synthesis and applications. Chlorine treatment may not reduce invasion risks as much as previously thought. Reduction in total propagule pressure does not mean reduction in abundance of all species equally. While some taxa might experience drastically reduced abundance, others might not change at all or increase due to hatching from dormant stages initiated by chlorine exposure. Therefore, management strategies should consider changes in total propagule pressure and colonization pressure when forecasting risk of new invasions. We therefore recommend adopting new approaches, such as DNA metabarcoding-based methods, to assess the whole biodiversity discharged from ballast water. As species responses to chlorine treatment are variable and affected by concentration, we also recommend a combination of different technologies to reduce introduction risks of aquatic organisms.

This peculiar body plan dates at least as early as the first undoubted occurrence of the group, 425 million years ago in the Silurian. All extant species belong to the order Pantopoda, characterized by cylindrical legs and an unsegmented abdomen. Palaeozoic fossils are much more diversified and exhibit features very different from pantopod morphology such as a segmented abdomen, limbs specialized to swim, or even a flagellum. The few Mesozoic fossils from the single Jurassic palaeoenvironment of La Voulte-sur-Rhone (south-eastern France) instead have strong affinities to Pantopoda. Here, we investigate the morphology of nine sea spider fossils using a new photographic protocol to document morphology, combining focus stacking and differential colourization. We also describe two new species of fossil pycnogonids from the Late Jurassic of Solnhofen (southern Germany): Colossopantopodus nanus sp. nov. is closely allied to a large species from La Voulte-sur-Rhone, but distinct in its smaller size; the other, ?Eurycyde golem sp. nov., is the first known fossil representative of the extant family Ascorhynchidae. Seven additional specimens, too poorly preserved for taxonomic description, are illustrated. The comparisons reveal that the shallow lagoons of Solnhofen contained a diverse assemblage of pantopods. Altogether with the fauna of La Voulte-sur-Rhone, the results suggest that Pantopoda became the dominant pycnogonid taxon of both deep and shallow marine waters after the Jurassic.

Our motivation being analysis of the effect of the 2008 financial crisis on Asian markets. For this purpose, we apply the linear correlations coefficient, the mutual information and the transfer entropy between U.S. stock market indices and eleven major Asia stock market indices. Then, with the overlapping windows for whole sample, and non-overlapping windows for three sub-samples, we quantify the dynamically evolving results of correlation structure between U.S. markets and Asian markets, and study the effect of the 2008 financial crisis on Asian markets by measuring the adherence between post and pre-crisis. Subsequently, for each blue-chip, we propose to study the 2008 financial crisis by measuring the adherence between post and pre-crisis. From this analysis, we can get a dependent structure map of Asian markets and U.S. markets, as well as may better forecasting of risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we use the Heston model to give the series describing the return and volatility. Considering the limited data of CSI 300 index, the Bayesian estimation parameters of the proposed model are given by combining Bayesian parameter estimation and realized volatility. The characteristic correlation time (CCT) and normalized fluctuations of pulse durations R-p are employed to further explore the coherent resonance behavior of stock market price returns and volatility. Based on the stochastic simulation of the estimated parameters, we can observe the phenomena of coherent resonance-like and anti-coherent resonance in CCT and R-p as a function of long-run variance and amplitude of volatility. We can also observe the critical phenomenon, there is a critical mean reversion of volatility. On both sides of the critical value, the opposite characteristics of coherent and anti-coherent resonance can be observed. The enhanced long-run variance of volatility and weakened amplitude of volatility both cause coherent-like resonance in CCT and R-p vs. the mean reversion of volatility. In addition, it can be seen that the market efficiency is lower when coherent resonance occurs, and higher when anti-coherence resonance occurs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the poor cyclic stability, originating from the large volumetric changes during charge/discharge process, hinder their practical utilization. Herein, we have successfully prepared a Sn-based metal-organic framework (MOP, Sn-PMA), and explored as potential anode materials in LIBs. Benefiting from its layered structure and efficient electron transport channels, Sn-PMA electrodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1567 mAh g(-1), at 100 mA g(-1), and maintained a reversible capacity of 707 mAh g(-1), at 800 inA g(-1), after 400 cycles. Furthermore, the detailed post-electrochemical structural, morphological and compositional analysis is carried out to unveil the structural changes and Li-ion storage mechanism of electrodes. Ex-situ XRD and XPS results revealed that, in Sn-PMA electrode, O atom, coordinated to the Sn atom, exhibited higher electronegativity, served as major Li-ion storage site and rendered excellent cyclic stability due to a stable structure. Kinetic analyses reveal that the excellent performance of the Sn-PMA is typical attributed to the pseudocapacitive contribution induced by the special porous structure.

With the design of a class of reactive and stereoselective organocatalysts, acyclic chiral secondary amines, a method for achieving the enantiodivergence is developed simply by changing the secondary N-i-Bu- to N-Me-group within the catalyst architecture while maintaining the same absolute configuration of the catalysts, which modulates the catalyst conformation. This catalyst-controlled enantiodivergent method not only enables challenging asymmetric transformations to occur in an enantiodivergent manner but also features a high level of stereocontrol and broad scope that is demonstrated in eight different reactions (90 examples), all delivering both enantiomers of a range of structurally diverse products including hitherto less accessible, yet important, compounds in good yields with high stereoselectivities.

Previous research and clinical applications have shown that V. taliense had significant analgesic activity. Jevine-type alkaloids were shown to be one of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents from V. taliense. However, other types of compounds from V. taliense related to its traditional use remains unknown. Aim of the study: To identify veratramine-type steroidal alkaloids with analgesic effects from the roots and rhizomes of V. taliense. Materials and methods: Compounds were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of V. taliense by chromatographic separation. Their structures were elucidated based on UV, IR, NMR and MS spectra data. Analgesic activity was assessed with acetic acid-induced writhing in mice model. Results: Seven new veratramine-type alkaloids were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of V. taliense. They all exhibited significant analgesic activity, of which alkaloids 1 and 4 were more potent antalgic than the well-known analgesic drug, pethidine. Conclusions: The veratramine-type alkaloids from V. taliense may serve as new leads for the discovery of analgesic drugs.

The structures differed in sulfation types of FucS, namely, most of FucS in AmFG was Fuc(3S4S), but the FucS in SvFG was Fuc(2S4S), while the FucS in HaFG was Fuc(3S4S), Fuc(2S4S) and Fuc(4S). However, all FucS branches attached to C-3 of GlcA as monosaccharides. Anticoagulant and anti-iXase assays showed the octasaccharide is the minimum fragment for potent anticoagulant activity via anti-iXase irrespective of FucS types. Among FG fragments with same degree of polymerization, oligosaccharides containing Fuc(2S4S) had more potent anti-iXase activity.

J	Li, GQ				Li, Guangquan			S wave attenuation based on Stokes boundary layer	GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING			English	Article; Early Access						Permeability; S waves; Attenuation	ELASTIC WAVES; PROPAGATION; VELOCITY; SQUIRT; MODELS; ROCKS	Biot theory was based on two ideas: the coupling factor to quantify the kinetic energy of fluid and Darcy permeability to quantify the dissipation function. As Biot theory did not well predict attenuation of ultrasonic S wave, we modify the theory to better characterize the S wave attenuation. The range of the coupling factor is at first estimated in view of fluid mechanics. Application of the original theory to water-saturated Boise sandstone and brine-saturated Berea sandstone shows that the model prediction significantly underestimates the S wave attenuation ultrasonically measured. For this reason, we replace Darcy permeability with variable permeability to improve the fluid momentum equation. The new model yields predictions of phase velocity and the quality factor both close to the ultrasonic measurements. The reason why the improved model is superior to Biot theory is that variable permeability is based on the Stokes boundary layer at the fluid-solid interface, thus accurately quantifying the viscous stress between the two phases. Finally, the length scale of the viscous stress is calculated in the mesoscopic sense.

Here we provide sensitive but noninvasive methods that can not only directly correlate luminescence with the underlying structure, but also distinguish point defects from embedded nanostructures. We first use correlated Raman-PL as a passive structure-property method to identify the difference between emissive and nonemissive Cs4PbBr6 crystals and reveal the existence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in emissive Cs4PbBr6. We then employ a diamond anvil cell to probe the response of luminescence centers to hydrostatic pressure. The observations of fast red-shifting, diminishing, and eventual disappearance of both green emission and Raman exclude Br vacancies as possible luminescent centers. The resolution of this long-lasting controversy paves the way for further device applications of low dimensional perovskites, and our techniques are applied to other emerging materials.

We document this pattern in the in situ development of Dendrobium moniliforme, where the diversity of cultivable Tulasnella species drops from the early germinating stage (6 Tulasnella species) to that of emergence of the second leaf (2 species), with species discontinuance and no new species appearing. We investigated the functional aspects of this decay by germinating seeds in vitro with the different strains available and observed, over 60 and 120 days, a perfect match between the stages at which Tulasnella spp. occur in situ and the ability to support in vitro development to this stage. The taxonomic bottleneck during germination may result, at least in D. moniliforme, from inability of the fungus to support seedling growth beyond a specific stage. Moreover, the isolated Tulasnella strains that best supported D. moniliforme development did not cluster together phylogenetically. Thus, the interaction between partners, rather than intrinsic fungal traits, may be involved in bottleneck of fungal symbionts during orchid germination.

There has been a plenty of interesting results on fractional-order chaotic systems or integer-order delayed chaotic systems, but the problem of synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems with time delays is in the primary stage. Combination synchronization of three different fractional-order delayed chaotic systems is investigated in this paper. It is an extension of combination synchronization of delayed chaotic systems or combination synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems. With the help of stability theory of linear fractional-order systems with multiple time delays, we design controllers to achieve combination synchronization of three different fractional-order delayed chaotic systems. In addition, numerical simulations have been performed to demonstrate and verify the theoretical analysis.

The pollination biology of the critically endangered D. wangliangii was investigated in this study. A fruit set rate of 33.33 +/- 4.71% was observed after bagging treatment in 2017 and a high fruit set rate (65.72 +/- 4.44% in 2011; 50.79 +/- 5.44% in 2017) was observed under natural conditions, indicating that D. wangliangii is characterized by spontaneous self-pollination. The anther cap blocked the growing pollinium; thus, the pollinium slid down and reached the stigmatic cavity, leading to autogamous self-pollination. Specifically, 51.50% of 162 unopened flowers (total 257 flowers) of this Dendrobium species under extreme water-deficit conditions developed into fruits, suggesting the presence of cleistogamy in D. wangliangii. Here, cleistogamy may represent the primary mode of pollination for this orchid. Spontaneous self-pollination and specific cleistogamous autogamy could represent major adaptions to the drought and pollinator-scarce habitat in the Jinshajiang dry-hot valley.

Although TNIP1 and the TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B axis play key roles in immune diseases and inflammatory responses, their relationship and role in glioma remain unknown. Here, we revealed high levels of TNIP1 and TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B in glioma tissue. Glioma cell proliferation was activated with TNF-alpha treatment and showed extreme sensitivity to the TNF receptor antagonist. Furthermore, loss of TNIP1 disbanded the A20 complex responsible for I kappa B degradation and NF-kappa B nucleus translocation, and consequently erased TNF alpha-induced glioma cell proliferation. Thus, our investigation uncovered a vital function of the TNIP1-mediated TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B axis in glioma cell proliferation and provides novel insight into glioma pathology and diagnosis.

The majority of Pb-Zn deposits hosted in Devonian carbonates are characterized by low delta S-34 values, causing debates on their ore genesis. To address this issue, the Yunluheba Pb-Zn deposit is chosen as a case study. Ore bodies of this deposit are hosted in middle Devonian carbonates. Ore minerals are sphalerite, galena and pyrite. Sphalerite Rb-Sr dating yields an isochron age of 206.2 +/- 4.9 Ma, consistent with ages of most Pb-Zn deposits in the SYG province, arguing for a regional intensive Pb-Zn mineralization event during the late Indosinian orogeny. Sulfides have Pb isotopic compositions that form a linear trend above the average crustal Pb growth curve in the Pb-207/Pb-204 vs.Pb-206/(204)Fb plot. Moreover, Pb isotopic ratios are consistent with the Devonian to Permian carbonates' age-corrected Pb isotopic ratios, suggesting mixed crustal Pb sources with the majority of Pb derived from country rocks. Combined with initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of sphalerite, approximately equal to Sr-87/(88)Srzoolvto ratios of the D-P carbonates, ore-forming metals are considered to have been derived mainly from ore-hosting rocks. Sulfides' delta S-34(CDT) values range mainly from - 2.0 parts per thousand to 2.9 parts per thousand, interpreted to be a result of mixing by syn-sedimentary pyrite originated biogenic S and thermochemically reduced S. We conclude that the Yunluheba deposit and other Pb-Zn deposits in the SYG province should belong to Mississippi Valley-type deposits.

However, the use of magnetic COFs in electrochemical immunosensors has rarely reported. Herein, a novel electrochemical assay for the determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was developed using black phosphorene (BPene) as a platform and magnetic COFs for signal amplification. BPene was prepared via water-phase exfoliation. BPene nanocomposite (Au@BPene) was prepared by depositing Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto BPene. This nanocomposite was utilized as an immunsensing platform to bind primary antibodies and improve electron transfer. Subsequently, an Au NP-loaded magnetic COF was used to immobilize the secondary antibodies and abundant electronic signals of methylene blue (MB). The fabricated sensor exhibited linearity ranging from 0.0001 ng mL(-1) to 10 ng with the detection limit of 30 fg mL(-1). The sensor could determine the PSA in a real sample with excellent specificity, good stability, and desirable reproducibility. The effective signal amplification of the proposed sensor is attributed to the good electron transfer of Au@BPene, excellent enrichment capacity of signal molecules (MB) of the COF, and efficient catalytic activity of Fe3O4. This work not only provides an effective electrochemical assay to detect PSA in real sample, but also broadens the utilization scope of magnetic COFs in immunosensing.

Recently, much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this article, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task and this new analysis techniques can guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5) in the case of a single task. Furthermore, the proposed analysis techniques are also extended to the case of multiple DAG tasks under GEDF and federated scheduling. Finally, through empirical evaluation, we justify the out-performance of our schedulability tests compared to the state-of-the-art in general.

Herein, we report the rational molecular design on twisted all ortho-linked carbazole/oxadiazole (Cz/OXD) hybrids with tunable D-A interactions by adjusting the numbers of donor/acceptor units and electron-donating abilities. Singlet-triplet energy bandgaps (Delta E-ST) are facilely tuned from similar to 0.4, 0.15 to similar to 0 eV in D-A, D-A-D to A-D-A type compounds. This variation correlates well with triplet-excited-state frontier orbital spatial separation efficiency. Non-TADF feature with solid state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) < 10% is observed in D-A type 2CzOXD and D-A-D type 4CzOXD. Owing to the extremely low Delta E-ST for efficient reverse intersystem crossing, strong TADF with PLQY of 71%-92% is achieved in A-D-A type 4CzDOXD and 4tCzDOXD. High external quantum efficiency from 19.4% to 22.6% is achieved in A-D-A typed 4CzDOXD and 4tCzDOXD.

Compared with the conventional method that the graphite is firstly oxidized, exfoliated to graphene oxide and then reduced to graphene sheets, the present proposed method is directly exfoliated from graphite by one-step process without using any strong oxidizing agents, such as H2SO4 or KMnO4. More importantly, the graphene obtained by this environmentally friendly method possesses excellent crystalline structure. Besides, the prepared graphene could be stabilized through pi-pi stacking interaction between graphene and the hydrophobic segments of benzene rings in PP6, and PP6 functionalized graphene (PP6@graphene) simultaneously combines the fluorescence quenching property of graphene and molecular recognition capability of PP6. Therefore, we construct a competitive fluorescence assay based on the molecular recognition interaction between PP6@graphene and acridine orange (AO) for determination of paraquat (PQ), a nonselective herbicide with high toxicity to humans. The fluorescence of AO is completely quenched by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) interaction between AO and PP6@graphene, and the quenched fluorescence recovers upon the successive addition of PQ, because the inclusion capability of PP6 towards PQ is stronger than that of AO. Linear response ranges of 0.2-2 mu M and 2-18 mu M are obtained for determination of PQ and the detection limit is 0.06 mu M (S/N = 3). The constructed sensing platform is also used to detect PQ in three water samples with satisfying results, which indicates that the competitive host-guest supermolecular recognition method has potential application in practical environmental risk assessment of PQ.

We identified six forest types: Carpinus kweichowensis-Liquidambar formosana-Lithocalpus glaber-Dipentodon sinicus forest (Type 1); Illicium simonsii-Salix matsudana-Schima khasiana-Dipentodon sinicus forest (Type 2); Dipentodon sinicus forest (Type 3); Dipentodon sinicus-Schima khasiana forest (Type 4); Dipentodon sinicus-Tetracentron sinense forest (Type 5); Pterocarya macroptera var. delavayi-Tetracentron sinense-Populus yunnanensis-Salix matsudana forest (Type 6). Among the six forest types, D. sinicus forest (Type 3) had the lowest values in species richness, Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's diversity indices. The maximum age of D. sinicus was 54 years, reaching 34 cm DBH, with 14 m maximum height. Its frequency distribution in DBH-and age-class displayed a sporadic pattern in various forests. Its regeneration was more active in D. sinicus forest (Type 3), Dipentodon sinicus-Tetracentron sinense forest (Type 5), and Carpinus kweichowensis-Liquidambar formosanaLithocarpus glaber-Dipentodon sinicus forest (Type 1) than that in the other forests (Types 2, 4 and 6). D. sinicus' growth rate generally fluctuated from 1.15 to 5.62 mm/year. Its regeneration modes were seedlings and sprouts. Its seedling establishment depends on forest gaps formation by disturbances. It is clear that the population persistence of D. sinicus was maintained in habitats where natural disturbances were frequent.

These comparisons showed that the glacier area and ice volume decreased by 524.8 km(2) and 37 km(3), respectively. The majority of the glacier area loss was concentrated in the area class of 1-5 km(2), between 5300 m and 5500 m in elevation, on north and east facing slopes and in the Dam Qu River basin. These glacier changes exhibited spatial and temporal differences. The glacier retreat rate gradually increased from 1969 to 2015, and the rate in the east was higher than that in the west. From 1969 to 2015, the warming rate in the Tanggula Mountains was 0.38 degrees C/10a, while the annual precipitation only increased by 0.4%. The slight increase in the amount of precipitation made a limited contribution to glacier change, while the change in temperature led to noticeable shrinkage of the glaciers. Contrary to the retreat or stagnation of most glaciers in the study area, there were 10 glaciers that experienced clear advance in 1986-2015 with noticeable increases in both area and length. Whether or not these 10 glaciers are surge glaciers requires further study.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Dyella tabacisoli sp. nov.; polyphasic taxonomy; Nicotiana tabacum L.	GEN.-NOV.; ACID; HYBRIDIZATION; SEQUENCE; WELLS	A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain L4-6(T), was isolated from an arable soil sample of tobacco in Huize, south-western China and subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization. The cells showed oxidase-positive and catalase-positive reactions. Growth occurred at 20-35 degrees C, at pH 5.0-8.0 and with 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl, optimally at 30 degrees C, pH 6.0-7.0 and 0-1 % (w/v) NaCl. The major respiratory lipoquinone was ubiquinone-8. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>10.0 %) were identified as summed feature 9 (iso-C-17:1 omega 9c or C-16:0 10-methyl), iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-1(7:)0. The polar lipid profile contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids, two unidentified aminophospholipids and five unidentified aminolipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 60.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain L4-6(T) should be affiliated to the genus Dyella and formed a Glade with the most closely related organism Dyella soli JS12-10(T). 16S rRNA gene sequences similarity analysis showed that strain L4-6(T) was mostly closely related to a soil JS12-10(T) (98.73 %) and Dyella lipolytica DHOBO7(T) (98.02 %). DNA-DNA hybridization data indicated that strain L4-6(T) represented a novel genomic species belonging to the genus Dyella. The polyphasic taxonomic characteristics indicated that the strain L4-6(T) represents a novel species of the genus Dyella, for which the name Dyella tabacisoli sp. nov. (type strain L4-6(T)=CGMCC 1.16273(T)=KCIC 62035(T)) is proposed.

The traditional co-location mining algorithms treated the spatial proximity relationship between the instances as unanimous by binary logic, which weakened the accuracy and effectiveness of the results. In this paper, the co-location pattern mining based on fuzzy neighbor relationship is studied. Firstly, fuzzy neighbor relationship (FNR) is defined to measure the proximity level between instances, and then the fuzzy participation ratio and the fuzzy participation index are defined. Secondly, the algorithm for spatial co-location pattern mining based on FNR (CPFNR) is proposed by the basic idea of the Join-less algorithm. Moreover, optimizing strategy is adopted for the CPFNR algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the CPFNR algorithm is verified by experiments on the real datasets, and the performance of our algorithm is evaluated on the synthetic datasets.

The feasibility and efficiency of phosphorus removal using ferric chloride are reported. The factors that influence the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates formed during the phosphorus removal process (including temperature, pH, coexisting ions, fast mixing speed (FMS), and fast mixing time (FMT)) were studied in detail. Results show that ferric chloride can efficiently remove phosphorus, and Fe-P coprecipitate exhibits high stability. In a water temperature range of 10-35 degrees C and pH range of 3-11, the phosphorus in the Fe-P coprecipitates is stable and is not released. The maximum phosphorus release efficiency is 9.2% at a pH of 3, and 16.10% at a pH of 11. The presence of Ca2+ and CO32- has little effect on the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates, and the differences in fast mixing speed and time have little effect on the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates. Furthermore, on the basis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, adsorption and ligand exchange were identified as the main phosphorus removal mechanisms by ferric chloride. These findings demonstrate that ferric chloride is a promising candidate for highly efficient and stable phosphorus removal from water of Dianchi Lake. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Recently, efficient water distillation has attracted significant attention. The fresh water productivity depends on how efficiently the system harvests the incoming solar energy and converts it into useful heat. An ideal blackbody is capable of perfectly absorbing all wavelengths. The absorbed incident photons are converted into thermal energy. To approach the maximum solar absorption of a blackbody, efficient nanomaterials were developed with enhanced absorption in ultraviolet (UV)-visible to near infrared (NIR). Nanomaterials with broadband absorption, efficient heat transfer, minimum surface energy loss, and energy storage have recently emerged exhibiting accelerated the evaporation rate. These nano-enabled materials direct attention back towards traditional solar stills for future sustainable water evaporation for clean water production. Herein, novelty of the review includes (1) direct solar steam generation of highly efficient broadband materials, (2) energy exchange materials including nanoparticles & nano-fluids, (3) energy storage materials including phase change materials & nano-enabled-phase change materials and (4) other sensible energy storage materials for desalination. One result was that the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in plasmonic metals and efficient heat trapping capabilities of carbon materials show high evaporation rates.

A large amount of intelligent terminals occupy the radio spectrum, resulting in the reduction of radio spectrum resources. Cognitive radio, which requires rapid and exact spectrum sensing, is considered the most effective method to resolve this problem. This paper applies bistable stochastic resonance to polarization antenna spectrum sensing. To adhere to its requirements, frequency re-scaling is adopted to degrade high frequency to low frequency. Differential computing is used to wipe the direction current component from the output signal. Three algorithms including differential energy detection, generalized likelihood ratio test, generalized Hadamard ratio test, are then employed for spectrum sensing. The simulation experiment compares the three algorithms above in various channel conditions including additional white Gaussian noise, Rayleigh-fading, and partial polarized noise. The results indicate that bistable stochastic resonance can drastically enhance detection probability in low signal-to-noise-ratio, and partial polarized noise degenerates the accuracy of spectrum sensing.

In order to investigate simultaneously controlling these two air pollutants, two simulation-based regional emission control experiments were designed using a nested air quality prediction model system (NAQPMS). One emission control scenario ("Conventional Control") implemented the strictest control measures in Jinan and surrounding areas and resulted in a 15.7% reduction of O-3 and a 21.3% reduction of PM2.5 on days polluted by O-3 and PM2.5, respectively. The other emission control scenario ("Source-tagging Control"), by contrast, used online source-tagging modeling results from NAQPMS to select emission reduction regions based on their source contributions to the O-3 and the PM2.5 in Jinan and resulted in a 16.2% reduction of O-3 and a 22.8% reduction of PM2.5 on days polluted by O-3 and PM2.5, respectively. Compared to Conventional Control, this scheme produced smaller reductions in emissions from areas with low contributions to the O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations in Jinan as well as in the total emissions of primary pollutants (the reduced emissions was only 61% of that needed by Conventional Control), and the area and the population affected by these reductions decreased by 12% and 31%, respectively. However, this study demonstrates that Source-tagging Control is more efficient than Conventional Control in reducing simultaneous pollution by O-3 and PM2.5 through regional measures.

In this study, three tidal flow (flooded/drained time ratio of 16/8 h) biofilters with combined substrates of ceramsite/volcanics and fibrous carrier were used to remediate heavily polluted river water. Good removal performance for NH4+-N, COD and P was achieved, with mean efficiencies of 77.8%-97.4%, 80.0%-81.0% and 62.3%-94.9%, respectively. But TN removal was inefficient (30.5%-36.5%) primarily because nitrate removal was restricted mainly by deficiency of organic carbon in the influent. Thus wood pieces were added to the biofilters as exogenous carbon source for heterotrophic denitrification. TN removal was largely enhanced with mean removal efficiency of 65.7%-70.5% during the initial 20 operation days because of decreased effluent nitrate concentration, despite of the gradual decrease of TN removal efficiency and release of pollutants from the wood during the first several operation days. The biofilter with combined substrates and additional plant biomass as carbon source is a promising eco-technology for the remediation of polluted surface water with high nitrate content and low C/N ratio.

However, late Mesozoic post-collisional exhumation is poorly understood due to lack of surface evidence for Paleo-Pacific subduction and associated effects. This paper interprets the tectonic history of the SOB using detrital zircon age data from Early Cretaceous sedimentary units along with previously published geochronologic and geochemical data to reconstruct sedimentological and tectonic history. Detrital zircon age distributions obtained from sedimentary units include a 2.0 Ga subpopulation that appears only in turbidite units to the southeast. This sediment probably derived from the Yangtze Block. Terrestrial facies from the Jiao-Lai basin to the northwest appear to derive from the North China Block. Geochronologic and geochemical data indicate that Early Cretaceous, post-collisional volcanism was compositionally bimodal (mafic-felsic) with associated intrusive activity that peaked at 120 Ma. Seismic images of northerly regions of the study area indicate this occurred in an extensional setting. Sedimentary facies and field structural analyses revealed an unconformity interpreted to reflect rapid uplift with NW-SE compression to the south. Given observed sinistral movement along the Tan-Lu fault, we interpret northwest and southeast regions of the SOB as experiencing transtensional and transpressional tectonics, respectively, driven by continuous subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Intrusion of the Late Yanshannian granitoids marked the final formational stage of this unique tectonic setting. (C) 2019, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

However, the correlation coefficient between them do not always pass the significance test, which makes it difficult to interpret the monsoon variability using speleothem delta O-18. In this study, regression analysis and corresponding significance test method are employed to investigate the relationship between the Asian summer monsoon circulation and speleothem delta O-18 of Xiaobailong cave using CERA-20C, speleothem delta O-18 of Xiaobailong cave, and precipitation and temperature data from 8 meteorological stations around the cave. Diagnostic results indicate that the speleothem delta O-18 of Xiaobailong cave can reflect the variability of Asian summer monsoon circulation via the rainout effect from the nearest upstream sources to destination. The stronger (weaker) ASM circulation causes isotopically depleted (enriched) water vapor via enhancing (reducing) the Rayleigh distillation processes during the transport of water vapor from the northern Bay of Bengal and the northern South China Sea to the region around the cave. The lower (higher) isotope value in water vapor further leads to depleted (enriched) speleothem delta O-18 of Xiaobailong cave. The numerical experiments using isotope-incorporated spectral model substantiate the key physical process revealed in the observational analysis. These results provide an efficient way for reconstructing the paleomonsoon circulation with delta O-18 in speleothems, ice cores, and tree ring cellulose.

Unsustainable irrigation is driven by domestic and international demand for agricultural products. Research on the environmental consequences of trade has often concentrated on the global displacement of pollution and land use, while the effect of trade on water sustainability and the drying of over-depleted watercourses has seldom been recognized and quantified. Here we evaluate unsustainable irrigation water consumption (UWC) associated with global crop production and determine the share of UWC embedded in international trade. We find that, while about 52% of global irrigation is unsustainable, 15% of it is virtually exported, with an average 18% increase between year 2000 and 2015. About 60% of global virtual transfers of UWC are driven by exports of cotton, sugar cane, fruits, and vegetables. One third of UWC in Mexico, Spain, Turkmenistan, South Africa, Morocco, and Australia is associated with demand from the export markets. The globalization of water through trade contributes to running rivers dry, an environmental externality commonly overlooked by trade policies. By identifying the producing and consuming countries that are responsible for unsustainable irrigation embedded in virtual water trade, this study highlights trade links in which policies are needed to achieve sustainable water and food security goals in the coming decades.

It generates an all-in-focus image through multiple partly focused source images. There are common schemes that are based on focused region detection and activity-level measurement, and fusion rule. We found that it is difficult to directly map between source images and focus maps. In this paper, we investigate the use of U-shape networks for the end-to-end modeling of MFIF. The novelty of our framework is two-fold. First, it uses a U-shaped network as a feature extractor that captures low-frequency information through feature extraction and high-frequency texture information through high-frequency texture extraction. Compared with the common convolutional neural network, the proposed network has better representation ability so that the most visually distinctive features can be extracted, fused, and enhanced. Second, the hybrid objective with l1 and perceptual losses enables the framework to yield fused results that are consistent with human beings' perception. In addition, we employ a weighted strategy to merge the chrominance components in the YCbCr color space so that color distortion is almost eliminated in the color fused result. We investigate the performance through extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Through qualitative and quantitative assessment, the proposed method has performance comparable to the recent state-of-the-art methods.

This ancestral mode of fertilization has, however, generally been considered to have been lost during the evolutionary history of terrestrial flowering plants. We investigated reproductive mechanisms in the subtropical ginger Cautleya gracilis (Zingiberaceae), which has two pollen conditions - granular and filiform masses - depending on external conditions. We tested whether rain transformed granular pollen into filiform masses and whether this then promoted pollen-tube growth and fertilization of ovules. Using experimental manipulations in the field we investigated the contribution of water-mediated fertilization to seed production. Rain caused granular pollen to form filiform masses of germinating pollen tubes, which transported sperm to ovules, resulting in fertilization and seed set. Flowers exposed to rain produced significantly more seeds than those protected from the rain, which retained granular pollen. Insect pollination made only a limited contribution to seed set because rainy conditions limited pollinator service. Our results reveal a previously undescribed fertilization mechanism in flowering plants involving water-mediated fertilization stimulated by rain. Water-mediated fertilization is likely to be adaptive in the subtropical monsoon environments in which C. gracilis occurs by ensuring reproductive assurance when persistent rain prevents insect-mediated pollination.

The combination of experimental results and theoretical insights was used to describe the effect of Sc doping on the electronic and structural properties of ZnO. Sc(III)-doped ZnO materials with different Sc(III) contents were deposited on white carbon black (WCB) by a facile sol-gel method. The Sc(III) doped antibacterial materials were characterized by FESEM, EDX, FIR-TEM, BET, XPS, XRD, ICP-OES, UV-visible spectroscopy, Fastsage and Materials Studio (MS). The antibacterial activities of Zn WCB and Zn-Sc WCB were determined by counting Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonies on bacterial culture plates. The results show that the specific surface area of Sc-doped Zn on WCB was increased by 31.9 m(2)/g compared to Zn WCB. The optimum doping ratio of Zn and Sc was determined in Zn0.9574SC0.0426O cut from hexagonal wurtzite structure ZnO. Moreover, pure ZnO and Zn0.9574Sc0.0426O models were established by density functional theory (DFT). The experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrated that ZnO WCB possessed excellent antibacterial properties after doping with Sc. This improved antibacterial activity was due to the effects of Sc2O3 on the ZnO lattice, which resulted in the generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The structural investigation indicates that NLP:Er3+ crystalline products are purely monoclinic phase with micron particles. Trivalent erbium ions with the substitution for lanthanum are successfully inserted into NLP host lattice. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption performance, doping Er3+ content-dependent downconversion photoluminescence, content quenching mechanism were reported in this paper. Upon near UV (378 nm) excitation, yellow/yellow-green visible light with the dominant S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) emission of trivalent erbium is displayed. Yellow-green emitting NLP:2%Er3+ sample has the maximum intensity and main luminescent peaks at 541 and 549 nm. The content quenching is related to the dipolar interaction. Additionally, the detailed investigation on CIE chromaticity coordinates, CP and CCT reveals that the title product has promising application in the field of white LEDs excited by near UV light.

Hypertension is a complex multifactorial disease involving multiple biological pathways and interactions between genetic and environmental factors. By combining network approach with biological knowledge, this study constructs a pathway-based weighted network model of hypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationships between genes; in this network model a weight is assigned to each edge in terms of the number of the same pathways in which the two nodes (genes) connected to the edge are involved. Analysis of statistical and topological characteristics shows that the edge weights are correlated to the network topology, and the edge weight distribution decays as a power-law. The disparity of the weights indicates that the edge weight distribution for the nodes with the same degree is of approximately equal weights; and the edges with the larger weights tend to connect with the higher degree nodes. By introducing an integrated ranking index that comprehensively reflect the contribution of the three indices of nodes (strength, degree, and number of pathways), eight key hub genes are identified by the threshold of integrated ranking index larger than 0.60: Jun, Cdk4, RT1-Da, Pdgfra, Fn1, Actg1, Cycs, and Creb3l2. These genes can be regarded as candidate genes or drug targets for further biological and medical research on their functions. This study provides a new strategy for exploring the underlying mechanisms of hypertension, and further evidences again that complex network is an excellent tool for the study of complex diseases.

Carbon films are an effective strategy to conquer this challenge by fabricating silicon/carbon (Si/C) multilayer thin film electrodes. Here, a multi-layered Si/C thin film structure was directly fabricated by magnetron sputtering method without applications of any binders. Carbon-covered Si/C multilayer structural electrode (*C/Si/C/Si/C) attains an initial discharge specific capacity up to 2316.0 mAh g(-1) and a high cyclability with retention of 90.1% (1220.9 mAh g(-1)) after 200 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2C (797.1 mA g(-1)). The carbon film layer acts as a strong and flexible buffer during cycling process and form a stable SEI, which is beneficial to achieving fast Li+ migration and abating the volume expansion of Si active film. Moreover, the relatively moderate growth temperatures from 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C are proved to play a major role to effectively improve the specific capacity of these film electrodes. These results yield fruitful insights into the nanostructured design of a binder-free Si/C-based high cycling performance electrodes via mature magnetron sputtering technology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They grow quickly, and are therefore important substitute for timber. Bamboo forest management and cultivation often include removing competitive trees; thus these shifts in forest composition should cascade to impact soil communities and the processes they mediate. Using a long-term (12 year) bamboo forest management study, we determined the impact of bamboo forest management on soil microbial and nematode community composition through time (2008-2010). Surprisingly, we found that conversion from a mixed and relatively diverse bamboo forest to a pure bamboo forest did not affect bamboo biomass. However, the soil fungal:bacterial ratio, nematode diversity index, and fungivores:bacterivores all declined within and across years. Taken together, our results suggest that conversion from mixed to pure bamboo forest can cause a switch from the fungal-based to the bacterial-based energy channel, i.e., accelerate the energy flow and reduce the stability of the soil ecosystem. The findings suggest that managing for a mixed bamboo forest may increase forest diversity and health overtime.

J	Huang, Y; Liang, C; Duan, XW; Chen, H; Li, DJ				Huang, Yong; Liang, Chao; Duan, Xingwu; Chen, Hao; Li, Dejuan			Variation of microbial residue contribution to soil organic carbon sequestration following land use change in a subtropical karst region	GEODERMA			English	Article						Microbial residue; Amino sugar; SOC sequestration; Land use change; C:N imbalance; Microbial residue contribution	PARTICLE-SIZE FRACTIONS; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; AMINO-SUGARS; MATTER; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS; FUNGAL; NITROGEN; ACCUMULATION; BACTERIAL	Microbial residues are an important constituent of persistent soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, how microbial residue contribution to bulk SOC sequestration changes following land use conversion remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the variation of soil microbial residue C and its contribution to SOC following conversion of maize-soybean field to mulberry, forage grass and sugarcane fields in southwest China, with forest used as reference. Microbial residue C contents were estimated based on microbial cell wall biomarker amino sugars. The contents of fungal, bacterial and total microbial residue C were lowest in the sugarcane, maize-soybean and mulberry fields, intermediate in the forage grass field and highest in the forest. Fungal to bacterial residue C ratios were comparable among the five land use types, implying that the relative contribution of fungi and bacteria residues to SOC sequestration remained unchanged. Conversion of maize-soybean field to mulberry and sugarcane fields had no significant effect on microbial residue contribution to SOC sequestration. Nevertheless, the contribution of total microbial residues to SOC sequestration was marginally (p < 0.1) and significantly (p < 0.05) higher, respectively, in the forage grass field and forest than in the maize-soybean field. Levels of SOC and living microbial biomass were the major factors determining the dynamics of microbial residue contents. Stoichiometric imbalance of carbon: nitrogen ratios between soil organic matter and microbial biomass (i.e., C:N imbalance) was found to negatively correlate with the contribution of microbial residues to SOC sequestration. Our results suggest that increase of C:N imbalance may explain lowered microbial residue contribution to SOC sequestration following land use change.

J	Guan, HT; Chung, DDL				Guan, Hongtao; Chung, D. D. L.			Effect of the planar coil and linear arrangements of continuous carbon fiber tow on the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness, with comparison of carbon fibers with and without nickel coating	CARBON			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; MATRIX; COMPOSITE; THICKNESS; MESH; NANOCOMPOSITES; PERMITTIVITY; BEHAVIOR	The effect of macroscale planar arrangement (planar coil, unidirectional and crossply arrangements, with a gap between tow segments) of continuous polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber (7.0-mu m diameter) 12 K tow on the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness for normal-incident unpolarized plane wave is reported at frequencies ranging from 200 to 2000 MHz. The planar coil configuration, which favors magnetic interaction, has not been previously reported for shielding with any material. For all arrangements, the total shielding effectiveness (SET) is dominated by the absorption loss (SEA), whether the fiber is nickel-coated or not. The nickel coating (0.25-mu m thick) increases SET from 2-6 dB to 13 -26 dB for the planar coil configuration, but has little effect for the crossply/unidirectional configuration. Both SET and SEA are greatly increased by the nickel coating, which also reduces SEA's frequency dependence and increases the absorption's fractional contribution to shielding, particularly for the planar coil configuration below 1000 MHz (from 53%-78% to 83%-94%). The advantage of the crossply configuration over the unidirectional configuration is greater without the nickel coating. Increasing the tow size from 12 K to 24 K (with the gap decreased from 3.0 to 2.0 mm) raises SEA for planar coil and unidirectional arrangements. The results agree essentially with electromagnetic theory. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Guan, Hongtao; Chung, D. D.

Lake Dianchi, one of the most eutrophicated lakes in China, has epitomized this issue. Clear understandings of phosphorus (P) mitigation efforts, the evolution of P budgets, and possible risks in the Dianchi system will benefit future eutrophication control, providing valuable lessons for other plateau freshwater lakes. In this study, we applied systematic review methodology to investigate the above questions, and then compared the results with other lakes worldwide. Generally, meta-analytical approaches have indicated P levels remain a key factor in causing algal blooms. Post-2015, the P budget of the Dianchi system, especially in Caohai section, was modified. However, it's still experiencing high pressures from P enrichment (Caohai: 0.4 mg.l(-1); Waihai: 0.2 mg.l(-1)). The flux of P in Dianchi remains high, both through the external P load (556 ton.a (1)), and an internal cycle (304 ton.a (1) associated with the absorption, deposition and removal of algae biomass; and 380 ton.a(-1) associated with sediment exchange). Meanwhile, significant P retention has been observed in the lake, in particular within the Waihai section (211 ton.a(-1)). Currently, water diversion (from external watersheds), sewage diversion, and sediment-dredging projects have benefited Dianchi. However, continuous urbanization and GPMn ecological degradation could introduce hundreds of tons of additional P, leading to subsequent algal blooms. Furthermore, beyond Lake Dianchi, other lakes and reservoirs in southwest China are facing similar issues regarding P mitigation, especially in GPMn regions, though corresponding knowledge is still limited. Therefore, effective and flexible sub-regional protection strategies and research related to external and internal P mitigations have become key requirements for Lake Dianchi management. Meanwhile, ecologically sensitive approaches to GPMn regions, as well as city development within basin and market driven treatments, should be incorporated into regional water source protection for southwest China.

There are two important issues for predicting gully erosion which have often been ignored in previous studies: 1) the same gully erosion rates may induce by completely different development processes and dynamics and 2) how to indicate the gully erosion rate. In this study, the topographic changes of five active gullies (two valley floor gullies and three hillslope gullies) that formed between 1997 and 2002 in Heshan farm were continuously monitored for three to six years. Although all of the gullies showed significant growth in volume and the average erosion rates ranged from 47.71 to 213.07 m(3).a(-1), the development processes were quite different for the valley floor and hillslope gullies. The valley floor gullies showed intensive headcut retreat and were prone to show deposition in the years with moderate rainfall. The widening and deepening in the middle parts were the key locations of soil loss in the hillslope gullies, and the volumes increased steadily during the periods observed. Four different indexes were adopted to indicate the gully erosion rates in terms of volume: the volume change per year (GER(V)), volume change per length/area changes (Delta V/Delta L, Delta V/Delta A) and the increasing ratio (IRv). All the indexes of the valley floor gullies showed significant parabolic relationships with the maximum rainfall (R-max), except for Delta V/Delta L (0.93 < R-2 < 0.99, P < 0.01, n = 10), while for the hillslope gullies, IRv, GER(v) and Delta V/Delta A showed exponential growth relationships with a compound index Rg being equal to the product of the logarithmic values of the snowfall (Sf), erosivity of the runoff generation rainfall (EI30runoff) and the R-max of each year (R-2 = 0.58, 0.50 and 0.60 respectively, P < 0.01, n = 14). The IR, showed a better ability than the other indexes to indicate gully erosion rates, which reflected the gully erosion rates directly, and reduced the influence of the different initial sizes of the gullies.

A SiO2-assisted polybenzoxazine (PB) coating strategy is used to synthesize highly monodispersed Si@C microspheres. After thermal carbonization of PB layers and selective removal of the SiO2 layers, Si@C microspheres were prepared. The resultant Si@C microspheres exhibit uniform spherical morphology and clearly double-shelled yolk-shell structures. The obtained Si@C microspheres are employed to prepare the chemically modified electrode for the sensitive determination of Cd(II) and Pb(II). By the method of anodic stripping voltammetry, the Si@C-based electrode shows a very wide linear dynamic range for target ions (e.g., 0.5-400 mu g L-1 for Cd(II) and Pb(II)) and low limit of detections (e.g., 0.068 mu g L-1 for Cd(II) and for 0.105 m mu g L-1 Pb(II)). The remarkable results, such as excellent resistance to interference ions, good repeatability, and reproducibility were also obtained. Furthermore, compared with those Cd(II) and Pb(II) sensors known in the literature, the analytical performance of Si@C-based electrode is better. Finally, when further used to determine Cd(II) and Pb(II) in tap water and lake water, the results of fabricated electrode successfully achieve good consistency with the data obtained from inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The antagonistic relationship was examined by studying metabolite production. The production of compounds 6 and 8 by I. lacteus after the induction of coculture indicated significant selectivity for antifungal activity against phytopathogenic N. oryzae, with MICs of 16 mu g/mL; compounds 6 and 8 also exhibited antifungal activities in vivo against Cerasus cerasoides infected by N. oryzae at concentrations of 100 mu g/mL. New compounds 2 and 4 showed antifungal activities against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, with MICs of 8 mu g/mL, and compound 4 showed antifungal activity against Didymella glomerata with an MIC of 1 mu g/mL. These results indicate that the mutually antagonistic relationship in the coculture of the phytopathogen and the endophyte can result in antibiotics that inhibit the phytopathogen and downregulate the production of phytotoxins by phytopathogenic N. oryzae. New compound 5 from I. lacteus showed weak activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), with an inhibition ratio of 16% at a concentration of 50 mu M.

The effects of zeolite particle size, WPA5 concentration, adsorption time, initial concentration, and pH on the removal of methyl orange (MO) were studied. The SEM and XRD results revealed a strong interaction between WPA5 and natural zeolite, and the modified composites showed novel microscopic morphology and structural properties. TG analysis indicated excellent thermal stability of the composite. MO was removed via electrostatic adsorption, and the removal efficiency was 84% at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L. Increase in the initial dye concentration enhanced the adsorption capacity of WPA5/zeolite and decreased the removal of MO. Based on the adsorption kinetics, the pseudo-second-order model (R-2 = 0.998) described the kinetic behavior of MO on WPA5/zeolite. In addition, UV and fluorescence spectra revealed that MO and WPA5 are complexed by a 1:1 complex ratio, and the binding constant between them was 12 595 L.mol(-1). NMR and molecular docking also verified their interaction. Therefore, the potential application of the prepared composite includes removal of organic anionic dyes.

Here we describe a foot with digital proportions unlike any previously described enantiornithine or Mesozoic bird. No bones are preserved in the new specimen but the outline of the foot is recorded in a detailed skin surface, which is surrounded by feather inclusions including a partial rachis-dominated feather. Pedal proportions and plumage support identification as an enantiornithine, but unlike previous discoveries the toes are stout with transversely elongated digital pads, and the outer toe appears strongly thickened relative to the inner two digits. The new specimen increases the known diversity and morphological disparity among the Enantiornithes, hinting at a wider range of habitats and behaviours. It also suggests that the Burmese amber avifauna was distinct from other Mesozoic assemblages, with amber entrapment including representatives from unusual small forms.

Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, illegal commercialised capture, and exploitation of larval food plants are believed to be the four major causes of population decline of B. thaidina in the recent decade. However, little attention was paid to the impact of climate change. This study used ecological niche factor analysis and species distribution model to analyse the current suitable areas for B. thaidina with BioClim variables as well as its future suitable areas under four future climate scenarios (represented by four Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Statistical analysis was carried out to compare the possible area and altitude changes to the distribution of B. thaidina under changing climate. Our analyses showed that the suitable areas for B. thaidina are fragmented under the current climate, with four suitable centres in northwestern Yunnan, northeastern Yunnan and northwestern Guizhou, the western margin of Sichuan Basin, and Qinling mountains. Apart from further habitat fragmentation under climate change, slight range expansion (average 6.0-8.9%) was detected under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, while more range contraction (average 1.3-26.9%) was detected under the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with the two southern suitable centres suffering most. Also, a tendency of contraction (2,500-3,500 m) and upslope shift (similar to 600 m) in suitable altitude range were detected. The findings of this study supported the climate-vulnerable hypothesis of B. thaidina, especially under future climate like the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, in terms of contraction in suitable areas and altitude ranges. Conservation priority should be given to northwestern Yunnan, northeastern Yunnan, and northwestern Guizhou to alleviate the stress of massive habitat loss and extinction. Refugial areas should be established in all four suitable centres to maintain genetic diversity of B. thaidina in China.

Hot rolling, a process of the combination of deformation and heat, remains an attractive method to thin the solder strips for bulk ingots of Au-Sn eutectic alloys, but the mechanisms governing the hot rolling process of Au-Sn eutectic alloys is not yet clear. Solder strips thinning is thus not reached easily. In this study, the heat induced coarsening origin and spheroidization mechanisms in Au-Sn eutectic alloys were uncovered in terms of the microstructural evolution and orientation relationship. Microstructure evolution of lamellar colony of Au-Sn eutectic alloy revealed that the initiation sites of coarsening occurs at the boundary of the lamellar colony structure and the end of the lamellar fault inside the colony structure. Termination migration was found to dominate the origin of coarsening mechanism of Au-Sn eutectic alloy, with involving large scale nano-lamellae, paired lamellar faults and a large number of coarsening structure. And another new coarsening mechanism, lamellae splitting, was proposed based on "groove" morphology, interface structure and crystallographic orientation relationship, to create massive lamellar faults for termination migration. The mechanisms will provide a new insight into coarsening origin. And the results pave the way of hot rolling Au-Sn eutectic alloys in terms of parameter selection, microstructure evolution and coarsening mechanisms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(31)PMAS NMR using trimethylphosphine as the probe molecule was employed to study the acidic properties of samples. It was found that the total acidic density of samples increases evidently after sulfation compared with the pristine cuprous oxide microcrystals. During sulfation, new {100} facets are formed at the expense of {111} facets and lead to the generation of two Lewis acid sites due to the different binding states of SO42- on {111} and {100} facets. Moreover, DFT calculation was used to illustrate the binding models of SO42- on {111} and {100} facets. Also, a Pechmann condensation reaction was applied to study the acidic catalytic activity of these samples. It was found that the sulfated {111} facet has better activity due to its higher Lewis acid density compared with the sulfated {100} facet.

To obtain clear images, we proposed an image fusion method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) for the microscopic image sequence. The CNN was designed to discriminate clear and blurred pixels in the source images according to the neighborhood information. To train the CNN, a training set that contained correctly labeled clear and blurred images was created from an open-access database. The image sequence to be fused was aligned at first. The trained CNN was then used to measure the activity level of each pixel in the aligned source images. The fused image was obtained by taking the pixels with the highest activity levels in the source image sequence. The performance was evaluated using five microscopic image sequences. Compared with other two fusion methods, the proposed method obtained better performance in terms of both visual quality and objective assessment. It is suitable for fusion of the SLM image sequence.

The characteristics, processes, regional differentiation and forcing mechanisms of the elements of the natural environment (e.g. geomorphology, climate, hydrology, soil, etc.) are the main objects of research in physical geography. China has a complex natural environment and huge regional differentiation and therefore it provides outstanding reserach opportunities in physical geography. This review summarizes the most important developments and the main contributions of research in the physical geography and human living environment in China during the past 70 years. The major topics addressed are the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the evolution of its cryosphere, the development of fluvial systems, the acidification of the vast arid region of the Asian interior, variations in the monsoon and westerly climate systems on multiple timescales, the development of lakes and wetlands, the watershed system model, soil erosion, past human-environment interactions, biogeography, and physical geographic zonality. After briefly introducing international research developments, we review the history of research in physical geography in China, focusing on the major achievements and major academic debates, and finally we summarize the status of current research and the future prospects. We propose that in the context of the national demand for the construction of an ecological civilization, we should make full use of the research findings of physical geography, and determine the patterns and mechanisms of natural environmental processes in order to continue to promote the continued contribution of physical geography to national development strategies, and to further contribute to the theory of physical geography from a global perspective.

Here, we investigated the role of the DGUOK in the self-renewal of lung cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Our data support that DGUOK overexpression strongly correlates with cancer progression and patient survival. The depletion of DGUOK robustly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth, metastasis, and CSC self-renewal. Mechanistically, DGUOK is required for the biogenesis of respiratory complex I and mitochondrial OXPHOS, which in turn regulates CSC self-renewal through AMPK-YAP1 signaling. The restoration of mitochondrial OXPHOS in DGUOK KO lung cancer cells using NDI1 was able to prevent AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of YAP and to rescue CSC stemness. Genetic targeting of DGUOK using doxycycline-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 was able to markedly induce tumor regression. Our findings reveal a novel role for mitochondrial dNTP metabolism in lung cancer tumor growth and progression, and implicate that the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide salvage pathway could be potentially targeted to prevent CSC-mediated therapy resistance and metastatic recurrence.

For this new type of time scale, a class of piecewise functions with double-almost-periodicity is proposed and studied. Based on these, concepts of weighted pseudo-double-almost-periodic functions (WPDAP) in Banach spaces and a translation-almost-closed set are introduced. Further, we prove that the function space WPDAP(0) affiliated to WPDAP is a translation-almost-closed set. Then, by introducing the concept of almost-uniform convergence for piecewise functions on ACCTS and using measure theory on time scales, some composition theorems of WPDAP and the completeness of the function space are proved.

Here, two TADF molecules were designed and synthesized by introducing 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene as the acceptor unit and carbazole derivatives as the donor unit. The thermal, photophysical, electrochemical, and electroluminescence (EL) properties of the two emitters were systematically investigated. Both emitters exhibit reasonably small single-triplet energy gap and relatively high photoluminescence quantum yield values. Solution-processable yellow OLEDs exhibited a maximum current efficiency, a power efficiency, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 53.2 cd A(-1), 45.6 lm W-1, and 20.6%, respectively. Vacuum-deposited devices employing the same emitter also showed high efficiencies of 54.8 cd A(-1), 50.7 lm W-1, and 20.8%, with similar EL spectra to those of solution-processable OLEDs. The maximum EQE of solution-processable red devices was 13.6%, with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.63, 0.37). These results are among the best values for long-wavelength TADF OLEDs, demonstrating that highly efficient solution-processable TADF OLEDs can be realized through effective material design and device optimization.

In this paper, we develop a fully Bayesian adaptive Lasso approach for quantile regression models with nonignorably missing response data, where the nonignorable missingness mechanism is specified by a logistic regression model. The proposed method extends the Bayesian Lasso by allowing different penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm that combined the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is implemented to simulate the parameters from posterior distributions, mainly including regression coefficients, shrinkage coefficients, parameters in the non-ignorable missing models. Finally, some simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Our method allows overidentified estimating equation systems and is applicable to both smooth and non-differentiable estimating functions. Our proposed Bayesian estimator is design consistent for general sampling designs and the Bayesian credible intervals are calibrated in the sense of having asymptotically valid design-based frequentist properties under single-stage unequal probability sampling designs with small sampling fractions. Large sample properties of the Bayesian inference proposed are established for both non-informative and informative priors under the design-based framework. We also propose a Bayesian model selection procedure with complex survey data and show that it works for general sampling designs. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is described for the required computation of the posterior distribution for general vector parameters. Simulation studies and an application to a real survey data set are included to examine the finite sample performances of the methods proposed as well as the effect of different types of prior and different types of sampling design.

By conveniently conditioning dopant acids/synthesis temperature and etching time in the fabrication, the doping degree/redox states (Q/B) of PANI growing on eHA nanorods and the specific surface area of eHA can be respectively controllable. eHA@PANI is characterized by TEM, FT-IR, UV-vis, XPS, XRD, EIS and organic elemental analysis. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of eHA@PANI is assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD). It indicates that eHA@PANI electrodes prepared with eHA/18 h as support, HCI as doping acid and 0 degrees C reaction temperature (eHA/18 h-PANI-HCl-0 degrees C) achieve the highest specific capacitance (711.1 Fg(-1)) at the current density of 1 A g(-1). The specific capacitance matches well with the doping degree of PANI in eHA@PANI and electrical conductivity of eHA@PANI. Furthermore, it also shows good cycling stability (specific capacitance retention ratio can achieve 77.6% after 300 charge-discharge cycles), demonstrating it is a potential electrode material for high-performing supercapacitors.

The adsorbent was characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, zeta potential and VSM. From the experimental results, the optimum adsorption pH, adsorbent dosage and adsorption time were 4, 1 g/L and 120 min, respectively. The percentage removal of Cr(VI) was 93% and the reduction efficiency of Cr(VI) was 74.3% when the concentration was 2 mg/L. After 5 cycles, using 0.1 mol/L NaOH as the regeneration agent, the removal rate of Cr(VI) did not decrease significantly. Furthermore, the mechanism of deep reduction and adsorption, the process of regeneration, the kinetics and adsorption isotherms were also explored. This paper can provide theoretical and technical support for reducing the toxicity and the advanced treatment of hexavalent chromium. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structures were elucidated based on the spectral data. Compounds 1-4 showed different antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, Alternaria panax, and Phoma herbarum, which caused root-rot disease of Panax notoginseng with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 16-64 mu g/mL; compared with compound 4, compounds 1-3 showed better antifungal activity against some of these pathogenic fungi with MICs of 16-32 mu g/mL, while compound 4 showed antifungal activity against F. oxysporum, P. cucumerina, and A. panax with the same MICs of 64 mu g/mL. Thus, strain YIM PH20095 provides new sources for the development of biological control agents to prevent the infection of pathogenic fungi of P. notoginseng.

Obtaining the subcellular localization information of apoptosis proteins is helpful to understand the mechanism of diseases and to develop new drugs. At present, the researchers mainly focus on the primary protein sequences, so there is still room for improvement in the prediction accuracy of the subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins. In this paper, a new method named ERT-ECT-PSSM-IS is proposed to predict apoptosis proteins based on the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). First, the local and global features of different directions are extracted by evolutionary row transformation (ERT) and cross-covariance of evolutionary column transformation (ECT) based on PSSM (ERT-ECT-PSSM). Second, an improved isometric mapping algorithm (I-SMA) is used to eliminate redundant features. Finally, we adopt a support vector machine (SVM) to classify our results, and the prediction accuracy is evaluated by jackknife cross-validation tests. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only extracts more abundant feature expression but also has better predictive performance and robustness for the subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins in ZD98, ZW225, and CL317 databases.

The deterioration process of the RMU cable joint is multivariable and nonstationary over time. Existing fault detection models for the RMU cable joint are single-variable and static over time. A novel algorithm of adaptive time neighborhood preserving embedding (ATNPE) is proposed in this paper, a multivariable time series statistical algorithm with online learning ability to improve the robustness and generalization ability of cable joint fault detection. This method combines an approximate linear dependence (ALD) condition with the time neighborhood preserving embedding (TNPE). New independent samples were determined by calculating the ALD value between new samples and modeling samples. In addition, the new independent samples were used to update the TNPE model. The offline training module was used to update RMU fault detection based on the TNPE model by training new samples with historical offline data. The online updating module trained the historical model to ensure the correct rate of online detection. The experimental results indicated that the method has the ability to adapt to new samples and the squared prediction error statistic limit responded to changes in statistical characteristics of monitoring data. The method can effectively reduce the false alarm rate and has the same fault detection rate compared to the existing model.

The Moho depth, Curie depth, and thermal lithospheric thickness are found to be 38-52 km, 32-50 km, and 120-260 km, respectively. The Moho and Curie surface present a rough inverse correspondence between each other. In the Tianshan and Altai Mountain Ranges, Moho interface is deep but Curie surface is shallow. In the Junggar Basin, Turpan Basin, and Yili Basin, the situation is in reverse. The uppermost mantle in the Central Depression and Eastern Uplift of the Junggar Basin, the Turpan Basin, the Yili Basin, as well as the north-west area off Fuhai is investigated to have been magnetized. The aeromagnetic anomalies and the Curie surface in the Junggar Basin surprisingly reveal that the northward subduction of the north Tarim block/slab under the Junggar Basin accompanied by the uplift of the Tianshan Mountain Range. Also, in response to the northward movement, the rigid Central Depression of the Junggar Basin extruded from its east and west sides. The westward extrusion is manifested by the West Uplift of the western Junggar Mountain Range.

In this study, we used Pis and Pms arrival times on P receiver functions to determine the anisotropy of the crust from the seismic data recorded by 285 temporary broadband stations and 3 permanent stations deployed in the southeast margin of Tibet. First we measured the splitting parameters of the upper crust by fitting the Pis phase arrival, and then we adjusted the Pms phase arrival to obtain the splitting parameters of the lower crust after correcting for the effect of the anisotropic upper crust on the Pms arrivals. So, we achieved 75 double-layer splitting measurements. In the upper crust the splitting times vary between 0.05 s and 1.34 s with an average of 0.53 s +/- 0.29 s, while in the lower crust they range from 0.06 s to 1.42 s with an average of 0.62 s +/- 0.33 s. The results confirm that the crust is remarkably anisotropic in the southeastern margin of Tibet. In the upper crust, the fast wave polarization directions clearly show a clockwise rotation around the Eastern Himalayan Syntax, suggesting that the extensional fluid-saturated microcracks induced by rigid extrusion from central Tibet are mostly responsible for the observed anisotropy. In contrast, the lattice preferred orientation of anisotropic minerals induced by a channel flow is the main contributor to the lower crust anisotropy.

The ozone effective absorption coefficients of the Dobson and Brewer instruments at Kunming in the low-latitude stations and Hohenpeissenberg in the middle-latitude stations were calculated. The test of the total ozone column (TOC) from different ozone absorption cross-section data sets shows that in the Dobson and Brewer retrieval algorithms, the effect of temperature on the Brewer instrument is smaller than that for the Dobson instrument. The temperature sensitivity of the two instruments to the SAC is -0.005%degrees C-1 and 0.102%degrees C-1, respectively, indicating that the differences in the temperature sensitivity result in differences in the TOC measurements between the two instruments, as well as in systematic seasonal differences. Using BPQ, DBM and SER to retrieve TOC will increase the overall deviation of the two instruments by 2.5%, -2.77% and -1.89%, respectively. The consistency of the TOC retrieval in the two instruments is the best when using the SAC, which shows a deviation of only 0.03%. The systematic seasonal deviation can also be effectively improved. In addition, this work makes up for the lack of relevant research in low-latitude areas. The rangeability of the monthly mean value of the instrument system deviation at a low-latitude station is about one-half of that at the mid-latitude station (Kunming: 0.2%-1.1%, Hohenpeissenberg: 0.2%-2.0%). This is because the vertical distribution of the ozone and temperature varies in different latitudes, the seasonal variation in the middle and high latitudes is significant, and the effective temperature of ozone (T-eff) in low latitudes changes little.

However, several problems still exists towards this goal, such as the generally low concentration of the target molecules disturbed in the complex samples that undergo analysis during criminal investigations. In this work, the sensitive and selective detection of ketamine was accomplished by molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor. The molecularly imprinted membrane as a biomimetic recognition element was fabricated by the UV-induced polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) on a metal-organic framework/graphene nanocomposite (MOFs@G) modified screen-printed electrode. The screen printed electrode (SPE) provided good adhesion for the formation of the imprinted membranes and increased the stability of the sensor. The morphology and performance of the imprinted films were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The experimental results demonstrated that the imprinted sensor had excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and long-term stability. It offered a low detection limit (4.0 x 10(-11) mol L-1) and had a dynamic range from 1.0 x 10(-10) mol L-1 to 4.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1. Furthermore, the established method was successfully applied for the determination of ketamine in urine and saliva samples.

J	Li, XZ; Liu, WG; Xu, LM				Li, Xiangzhong; Liu, Weiguo; Xu, Liming			Evaluation of lacustrine organic delta C-13 as a lake-level indicator: A case study of Lake Qinghai and the satellite lakes on the Tibetan Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Terrestrial plants; Submerged plants; Algae; TOC/ON ratio; Dissolved inorganic carbon Lake Qinghai	CARBON ISOTOPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOCHEMICAL PROXIES; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; EARLY HOLOCENE; N-ALKANES; SEDIMENTS; OXYGEN; MATTER; CHINA	In recent years, the sedimentary delta(13)Corg values have been recognized to be indicative of lake-level changes in lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, the sensitivity of sedimentary delta(13)Corg to lake-level changes and the potential relationship between lake-level variations and climatic forces are still unknown in this particular region. Here, we systematically evaluate sedimentary delta(13)Corg as a proxy of lake-level changes in lakes with different sizes on the TP. Consistent with previous studies, the total organic matter of sediments was mainly contributed by aquatic plants in lakes on the TP. In the studied lakes, sedimentary delta C-13 values mainly reflect lake-level changes, as the species of aquatic plants with different delta(13)Corg values strongly respond to lake level. However, sedimentary delta C-13 values are much more sensitive to lake-level changes in a moderate-depth lake (similar to 10 m) than those in a deep lake (27 m) or a shallow lake (< 3-5 m). In other words, the sedimentary delta(13)Corg may not effectively record lake-level changes on the TP when the lakes are deep (not sensitive) or shallow (only submerged plants). This relationship can be clearly seen in the case study in cores HY15 and GH02. The sedimentary delta(13)Corg trend in core HY15 was well correlated with the observed lake-level changes over the past 50 yr in Lake Qinghai. Based on the hypothesis that delta(13)Corg is indicative of lake-level changes, the lake-level change showed obvious millennial-scale oscillations in Lake Gahai (moderate lake) during the Holocene, but there were no obvious lake-level oscillations in Lake Qinghai (deep lake). In addition, the variation in the TOC/ON ratio suggested that sedimentary delta(13)Corg was often influenced by the contribution of terrestrial plants in Lake Gahai during the Holocene. Therefore, although delta(13)Corg was a very sensitive proxy of lake-level changes in lakes with maximum water depths ranging from 5 m to 20 m in lakes on the northeastem TP, we should consider the possible contribution of terrestrial plants when the sedimentary delta(13)Corg value is used as indicator of lake-level changes.

The comment by Pasqualetti a al. [3] confirms the need to go beyond the methodology and approach presented in Gu a al.'s original work. In fact, they recognize that "the source of confusion is due to the fact that assessing controllability via numerical analysis typically leads to ill-conditioned problems, and thus often generates results that are difficult to interpret". This is indeed the first warning we discussed in [1]: our work was not meant to prove that brain networks are not controllable from one node, rather we wished to highlight that the one node controllability framework and all consequent results were not properly justified based on the methodology presented in Gu a al. [2]. We used in our work the same method of Gu a al. not because we believe it is the best methodology, but because we extensively investigated it with the aim of replicating, testing, and extending their results. The warning and caveats we have proposed are the results of this investigation. Indeed, on the basis of our controllability analyses of multiple human brain networks datasets, we concluded: "The lambda(min)(W-K) are statistically compatible with zero and thus the associated controllability Gramian cannot be inverted(1). These results show that it is not possible to infer one node controllability of the brain numerically". Hence both groups agree that one node controllability cannot be inferred numerically.

However, it remains a great challenge to design well-defined P-N heterojunctions, which hinders the achievement of high-performance P-N heterojunction gas sensors as well as the recognition of the P-N-heterojunction-enhanced gas-sensing mechanism. In this work, an alpha-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite with well-defined core@shell P-N heterojunction nanobelts was prepared via a facile method. Benefitting from a well-defined P-N heterojunction construction, the alpha-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite exhibited the highest response (R-g/R-a = 20.3) towards 100 ppm acetone, which was 17.2 times higher than that of pristine alpha-MoO3 (R-a/R-g = 1.18) and 6.6 times higher than that of pristine NiO (R-g/R-a = 3.07). Gas-sensing measurement revealed that the response of n-type alpha-MoO3 could be greatly improved by anchoring p-type NiO nanosheets. The main mechanism for the enhanced acetone sensing properties of the alpha-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite was investigated. The well-defined alpha-MoO3@NiO P-N nanocomposite offered abundant Mo-O-Ni bonds at the heterointerfaces, which could induce the large hole depletion regions in p-type NiO and hence benefit oxygen adsorption and gas-sensing reactions at the interfaces. This work not only demonstrates that the alpha-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite is a promising material for fabricating acetone sensors but also provides useful guidance for designing well-defined core@shell P-N heterojunctions in gas-sensing applications.

Due to the resistance and serious side effects from using VLB and its derivatives, there is a need to discover and develop novel VLB derivatives with high activity against cancer cells. In order to better discover and develop new VLB derivatives, we need to study the structural basis of VLB's anti-cancer cytotoxicity and the mechanism of its interaction with alpha,beta-tubulins. Based on the crystal structure of alpha,beta-microtubule complex protein, the molecular dynamics method including the sampling PMF method was used to study the variation of dissociation free energy (Delta G) of alpha,beta-tubulins under different system conditions, and then from which to study the mechanism of the interaction between VLB and alpha,beta-tubulins. The obtained results show that the dissociation of pure alpha,beta-tubulins requires 197.8 kJ center dot mol(-1) for Delta G. When the VLB molecule exists between the interface of alpha,beta-tubulins, the dissociation Delta G of alpha,beta-tubulins reaches 220.5 kJ center dot mol(-1), which is greater than that of pure alpha,beta-tubulin. The VLB molecule is formed by connecting a vindoline moiety (VM) molecule with a catharanthine moiety (CM) molecule through a carbon-carbon bond, which is a larger molecule. When the CM molecule exists in the middle of alpha,beta-tubulin interface, the dissociation Delta G of alpha,beta-tubulins is 46.2 kJ center dot mol(-1), during which the CM moves with beta-tubulin. When the VM molecule exists between the middle of alpha,beta-tubulin interface, the dissociation Delta G of alpha,beta-tubulins is 86.7 kJ center dot mol(-1), during which it moves with alpha-tubulin. Therefore, the VLB molecule is like a double-sides tape to stick alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin together. The VLB molecule intervenes the dynamic equilibrium between dissociation and aggregation of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin by a double-sides sticking mechanism to exert high activity with toxicity against cancer cell. Besides, our results demonstrate that VLB has its structural basis for anticancer cytotoxicity due to its two compositions composed of a CM molecule and a VM molecule although they have little toxicity against cancer cell alone.

Water supply in early spring depends upon the snow accumulation in the winter and the subsequent temperature. Seasonal temperature variations corroborate the contemporary dynamics of snow and glaciers. Recently, there has been increasing evidence of accelerated warming in high mountain areas, termed as elevation-dependent warming (EDW). We have identified trends, analyzed inconsistencies, and calculated changes in the maximum, minimum, mean and diurnal temperature range (T-max, T-min, T-mean, and DTR) at 20 weather stations during four-time series: 1961-2013 (first), 1971-2013 (second), 1981-2013 (third), and 1991-2013 (fourth). We employed the Mann-Kendall test to determine the existence of a trend and Sen's method for the estimation of prevailing trends, whereas homogeneity analysis was applied before trend identification using three different tests. This study revealed that the largest and smallest magnitudes of trends appeared in the winter and summer, respectively, particularly during the fourth data series. T-max revealed robust warming at ten stations, most remarkably at Gupis, Khunjrab, and Naltar at rates of 0.29, 0.36, and 0.43 degrees C/decade, respectively, during the fourth series. We observed that T-min exhibits a mixed pattern of warming and cooling during the second and third series, but cooling becomes stronger during the fourth series, exhibiting significant trends at twelve stations. Khunjrab and Naltar showed steady warming during the fourth series (spring), at rates of 0.26 and 0.13 degrees C/decade in terms of T-mean. The observed decreases in DTR appeared stronger in the fourth series during the summer. These findings tend to partially support the notion of EDW but validate the dominance of cooling spatially and temporally.

Here, we generate three chromosome-level reference genomes of C. carpio and compare to related diploid Cyprinid genomes. We identify a Barbinae lineage as potential diploid progenitor of C. carpio and then divide the allotetraploid genome into two subgenomes marked by a distinct genome similarity to the diploid progenitor. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors diverged around 23 Mya and merged around 12.4 Mya based on the divergence rates of homoeologous genes and transposable elements in two subgenomes. No extensive gene losses are observed in either subgenome. Instead, we find gene expression bias across surveyed tissues such that subgenome B is more dominant in homoeologous expression. CG methylation in promoter regions may play an important role in altering gene expression in allotetraploid C. carpio.

The scalar potential respects a softly broken global symmetry, which makes the imaginary part of the singlet become a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson acting as a dark matter candidate. The pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone nature of the boson leads to the vanishing of its tree-level scattering amplitude off nucleons at zero momentum transfer. Therefore, although the interaction strength could be sufficiently large to yield a viable relic abundance via thermal mechanism, direct detection is incapable of probing this candidate. We further investigate the constraints from Higgs measurements, relic abundance observation, and indirect detection.

RESULTS Caterpillars (Spodoptera exigua) fed Glycine max had high viral loads and low melanization rates together with low melanization enzyme [PO, DDC, TH] activities and gene expressions. Caterpillars fed Ipomoea aquatica had low viral loads and high melanization, gene activities and gene expressions while those fed Brassica oleracea or artificial diet had intermediate levels of each. Melanization rates were negatively correlated with viral loads and positively correlated with activity and expression of each of the three enzymes. Some diet effects on enzymes were constitutive because the same diets led to low (G. max) or high (I. aquatica) melanization related gene activities and expressions without infection. CONCLUSION Diet influences the interactions between insect herbivores and viruses by shaping the innate immune response both at the onset of infection and afterwards as viral loads accumulate over a period of days. In addition, diets that lead to low viral loads are associated with high activities and gene expressions of a variety of melanization related enzymes suggesting a common causative mechanism.

The original land use patterns changed significantly by the formation of the WLFZ, which possibly affected the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and local carbon cycle. However. little is known about the effects of land uses before dam construction on the SOC stocks in the WLFZ. To address this, we chose the Nuozhadu mega reservoir built in 2014 in the upper Mekong River basin as our study area. We established five sampling transects around the reservoir and sampled them in 2015. Each transect contained three vertical sampling lines representing three land-use types: natural forest, farmland, and rubber plantations. SOC stocks were determined in the WLFZ and in the infralittoral reference zone (IRZ), and the interactions among SOC, land uses, soil erosion, inundation, and other soil physicochemical properties were analyzed to establish the factors controlling SOC in the WLFZ. The average soil organic carbon density (SOCD) was not significantly different between the WLFZ and IRZ, but it differed significantly among the three types of land uses. The SOC stocks in natural forests of the WLFZ and IRZ were significantly greater than those in the other land use types. The SOCD decreased with increasing elevation in the natural forest and rubber plantation in the WLFZ, while no significant trend was found in farmland. These results indicated that the construction of a large dam in south-western China may not lead to significant changes in regional SOC stocks, but it can result in the redistribution of SOC in the large-scale and high-dropout WLFZ. Land use before dam construction can affect the background concentrations of SOC, soil physicochemical properties, and soil erosion rate in the WLFZ, which controlled the redistribution of SOC.

Col(hex)/p6mm mesophases were displayed by all bisthiophene based 4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives, whereas both Col(hex)/p6mm and Cub(1)/pm (3) over barn mesophases could be formed by corresponding triazole based 4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives. Evidence for the formation of the extra H-bonding between central triazole units and terminal 4,6-diaminotriazine groups which was responsible for the formation of cubic phases in triazole based compounds was obtained based on FT-IR measurements. Additionally, these triblock polyphiles can form organogels with interesting morphologies in different solvents. The influence of the alkyl chain length and the polarities of the heterocycles (bisthiophene/triazole) on the self-assembly of these compounds was systematically studied. Finally, these triblock polyphiles showed dual selectivities towards Pb2+ and Fe3+ ions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two classes of event-triggered communication and control strategies with fixed sampling period are considered. By designing different event conditions, the communications amongst neighbouring vehicles are allowed at each sampling time instant in the first strategy, whereas the control input of each vehicle is updated only when its own or neighbours' event conditions are violated. Furthermore, both communication and control update are allowed only when the events of itself or neighbours are triggered in another strategy. To this end, an unified event-triggered and distributed observer-based controller with globally asymptotic convergence rate is proposed. And corresponding sufficient conditions are derived regarding to two types of event conditions, based on Lyapunov technique, matrix analysis and algebraic graph theory. It is worth noting that the Zeno-behaviour of systems with the presented controllers and event conditions is naturally avoided for all the vehicles due to the advantageous property of sampled-data control. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

It can simultaneously perform the photometric imaging and spectroscopic slitless surveys, and will probe weak and strong gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering, individual galaxies and galaxy clusters, active galactic nucleus, and so on. It aims to explore the properties of dark matter and dark energy and other important cosmological problems. In this work, we focus on two main CSS-OS scientific goals, i.e., the weak gravitational lensing (WL) and galaxy clustering surveys. We generate the mock CSS-OS data based on the observational COSMOS and zCOSMOS catalogs. We investigate the constraints on the cosmological parameters from the CSS-OS using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias, velocity dispersion, and systematics from instrumental effects in the CSST WL and galaxy clustering surveys are also included, and their impacts on the constraint results are discussed. We find that the CSS-OS can improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters by a factor of a few (even one order of magnitude in the optimistic case), compared to the current WL and galaxy clustering surveys. The constraints can be further enhanced when performing joint analysis with the WL, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing data. Therefore, the CSS-OS is expected to be a powerful survey for exploring the universe. Since some assumptions may be still optimistic and simple, it is possible that the results from the real survey could be worse. We will study these issues in detail with the help of simulations in the future.

J	Yang, YP; Zhu, JP; Zhang, B				Yang, Yuan-Pei; Zhu, Jin-Ping; Zhang, Bing			Relativistic Astronomy. III. Test of Special Relativity via Doppler Effect	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational		The "Breakthrough Starshot" program is planning to send transrelativistic probes to travel to nearby stellar systems within decades. Because the probe velocity is designed to be a good fraction of the light speed, Zhang & Li recently proposed that these transrelativistic probes can be used to study astronomical objects and to test special relativity. In this work, we propose some methods to test special relativity and constrain photon mass using the Doppler effect with the images and spectral features of astronomical objects as observed in the transrelativistic probes. We introduce more general theories to set up the framework of testing special relativity, including the parametric general Doppler effect and the Doppler effect with massive photons. We find that by comparing the spectra of a certain astronomical object, one can test Lorentz invariance and constrain photon mass. Additionally, using the imaging and spectrograph capabilities of transrelativistic probes, one can test time dilation and constrain photon mass. For a transrelativistic probe with velocity v similar to 0.2c, aperture D similar to 3.5 cm, and spectral resolution R similar to 100 (or 1000), we find that the probe velocity uncertainty can be constrained to sigma(v) similar to 0.01c (or 0.001c), and the time dilation factor uncertainty can be constrained to Delta gamma = vertical bar(gamma) over cap - gamma vertical bar less than or similar to 0.01 (or 0.001), where (gamma) over cap is the time dilation factor and gamma is the Lorentz factor. Meanwhile, the photon mass limit is set to m(gamma) less than or similar to 10(-33) g, which is slightly lower than the energy of the optical photon.

Quantifying the trade in wild-collected ornamental orchids in South China: Diversity, volume and value gradients underscore the primacy of supply	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						CITES; Consumer preferences; Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD); Illegal wildlife trade; Market surveys; Supply-side regulation	INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; SPECIES RICHNESS; ILLEGAL TRADE; CONSERVATION; CONSUMPTION; AWARENESS; TUBERS	Despite the grave threat illegal wildlife trade poses to species survival, few studies have attempted to link supply and demand data for the same wildlife product. All ca. 29,000 orchid species are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and many are protected under domestic legislation too, but a growing body of evidence suggests that orchids continue to be subject to unsustainable harvesting and undocumented trade. South China is a known black spot for trade in wild-collected ornamental orchids but understanding of the drivers determining the flow of species diversity, volume and value remains wanting. We conducted systematic monthly surveys at five markets along a West-East transect from Yunnan to Hong Kong for one year, recording variables including species, numbers of individuals, weight and price. Although wild orchid diversity is highest in Yunnan, the diversity of orchids in trade increased eastwards and mean price per stem rose more than four-fold, albeit always significantly cheaper than that for artificially produced hybrids. Part of this trade appears to be in breach of CITES. Few orchids in trade conformed to six criteria highlighted in prior demand-side studies as being of higher utility value, but most conformed to a combination of four or more, suggesting that vendors can readily offer products that meet a majority of consumer preferences. Effective supply-side regulation, through government intervention and social media campaigns, is needed to facilitate behavioural change and allow artificially propagated plants to compete in the market-place.

Especially, the unidirectional absorption is demonstrated when the propagation direction of acoustic waves is reversed. These high absorptions stem from the excitations of the strong resonances, which depend on not only the low loss in this composite but also the huge impedance mismatch at the outgoing interface. To further investigate those selective absorption, we construct an equivalent structural model, and our calculations show that these absorption peaks have the extraordinary response to the imaginary part of the effective mass density and bulk modulus. The results exhibit that the imaginary part of the effective mass density and bulk modulus at the frequencies of the absorption peaks abruptly appear, in the meanwhile the real part of those become zero. Based on these theoretical results, an unidirectional absorption device with multiple selection of frequencies can be designed. (c) 2019 Author(s).

However, the mechanisms underlying spur length variation remain unclear. Interspecific comparisons of spur length suggest that both cell division and anisotropic expansion could explain the changes of spur length, and that hormone-related genes contribute to the process of spur formation. In contrast, little is known about intraspecific spur length variation. In Aquilegia rockii, spur length varies strikingly, ranging from 1 mm to 18 mm. To examine the potential mechanisms underlying spur length variation in A. rockii, we observed cell morphology and analyzed RNA-seq of short- and long-spurred flowers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that at two positions on spurs there were no differences in either cell density or cell anisotropy between short- and long-spurred flowers, suggesting that in A. rockii changes in cell number may explain variations in spur length. In addition, we screened transcriptomes of short- and long-spurred flowers for differentially expressed genes; this screen identified several genes linked to cell division (e.g., F-box, CDKB2-2, and LST8), a finding which is consistent with our analysis of the cellular morphology of spurs. However, we did not find any highly expressed genes involved in the hormone pathway in long-spurred flowers. In contrast to previous hypotheses that anisotropic cell expansion leads to interspecific spur variation in Aquilegia, our results suggest that cell number changes and related genes are mainly responsible for spur length variations of A. rockii. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of similar floral traits in morphology may be quite different, enriching our understanding of the mechanisms of flower diversity in angiosperms.

To explore what governs the coexistence of these three sexual phenotypes, we investigated the DNA contents, pollen and ovule production, pollen deposition, and performed hand-pollination in both hermaphroditic and dioecious individuals of D. fruticosa. Flow cytometry confirmed that the DNA content of males and females were almost twice as much as that of the hermaphrodites. Male and female flowers produced more pollen grains and ovules than hermaphroditic flowers. Hand-pollinated treatments showed that unisexual flowers were sterile in one sexual function and bisexual flowers were fertile for both functions, but no sterile seeds were produced between unisexual and bisexual flowers. Our findings imply that polyploidy is related to gender dimorphism, and both are likely to play a strong role in the coexistence of two cryptic biological species of D. fruticosa (low ploidy hermaphroditic species and high ploidy dioecious species) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

J	Li, BQ; Chen, D; Yang, YP; Li, X				Li, Boqun; Chen, Di; Yang, Yongping; Li, Xiong			Effects of soil properties on accumulation characteristics of copper, manganese, zinc, and cadmium in Chinese turnip	PLANT DIVERSITY			English	Article						Turnip; Heavy metal; Bioconcentration; Phytoremediation; Soil composition	HEAVY-METALS; SOLANUM-NIGRUM; PHYTOREMEDIATION; GROWTH; BIOACCUMULATION; BIOAVAILABILITY; PHYTOTOXICITY; CONTAMINATION; STRATEGIES; TOLERANCE	Clarifying the mechanisms of heavy metal (HM) accumulation and translocation from soil-root-leaf is crucial to coping with soil HM pollution. In this study, we analysed copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) accumulation characteristics in Chinese turnips and the effect of soil physicochemical properties on both HM accumulation and translocation. Our results indicate that Chinese turnips absorb and translocate Mn, Zn, and Cd at much higher levels than they do Cu. When we measured bioconcentration factors in Chinese turnips for different HMs in the same soil, we found Chinese turnip capacities for HM accumulation decrease from Zn > Mn > Cd > Cu. In addition, the translocation factor for these HMs decreases from Mn > Cd > Zn > Cu. Correlation analysis indicates that soil pH and various soil components are either negatively or positively correlated with Mn, Zn, and Cd accumulation; also, soil properties are correlated with Mn translocation from root to leaf. These findings may help evaluate HM accumulation and translocation mechanisms as well as artificially regulate HM uptake levels from soils to turnips.

J	Fan, XM; Luo, X				Fan, Xuemei; Luo, Xian			Precipitation and Flow Variations in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin and the Implications of Monsoon Fluctuation and Regional Topography	WATER			English	Article						monsoon fluctuation; WNPSM; ISM; regional topography; river flow; the Lancang-Mekong River Basin	SOUTHEAST-ASIA; SUMMER MONSOON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGY; PRODUCTS; GANGES; CYCLE; ENSO	In the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, monsoon fluctuation affects profoundly the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation, which is the major cause of the uncertainty in hydrological processes and water resources. This study investigated the implications of monsoon fluctuation and regional topography on precipitation variation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, and it examined the potential link between monsoons and river flow. The results indicated that the fluctuations of the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) played different roles in precipitation variation. The areas in which precipitation variation was found synchronous with the WNPSM were much larger than those associated with the ISM. Significant positive correlation was found between precipitation during June-September (JJAS) and the WNPSM index (WNPMI) and the ISM index (IMI) over 29.3% and 12.8% of the basin, respectively, and that these areas were distributed mainly on the left and right bank downstream, respectively. A strong (weak) WNPSM was found to increase (decrease) moist westerlies that caused excess (deficient) orographic precipitation through the interaction with the Annamite Mountains. During strong (weak) WNPSM years, observed river flow during JJAS at the Mukdahan, Pakse, and Stung Treng stations in the downstream area were 8.0% (5.0%), 8.2% (12.6%), and 12.1% (19.5%) higher (lower) than the mean, respectively, showing that downstream river flow is modulated by the WNPSM intensity. These findings could support long-term hydrological predictions, and be beneficial for optimal flood control and water resource utilization in the basin.

The interactions on water between China and India are key to realizing water-related 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets in the basin. Using a series of secondary literature information, and the method of event studies, we created a timeline of the Sino-Indian relation events since the 1950s, analyzed the correlations among the contents, the duties by each side, the events of water cooperation, and the diplomatic events between them. We found the following dilemmas hamper water cooperation: (1) The scopes of, and steps towards, transboundary water cooperation are hampered by patchy Sino-Indian diplomatic relations; and (2) there is a lack of motivation for China to cooperate with India without benefits sharing, given that China has undertaken more duties and has often received negative feedback. However, we also found the following pathways toward improving water cooperation: (1) A national cooperation mechanism on transboundary rivers has been established, which may be beneficial for further water cooperation; and (2) a channel for interdisciplinary dialogue should be encouraged to bridge the disparate outlooks and improve interactions between policymakers and scientific experts.

The New World monkeys (NWMs, Platyrrhini) comprise 3 families and 7 subfamilies, which radiated within a relatively short time period. Accordingly, their phylogenetic relationships are still largely disputed. In the present study, 56 nuclear non-coding loci, including 33 introns (INs) and 23 intergenic regions (IGs), from 20 NWM individuals representing 18 species were used to investigate phylogenetic relationships among families and subfamilies. Of the 56 loci, 43 have not been used in previous NWM phylogenetics. We applied concatenation and coalescence tree-inference methods, and a recently proposed question-specific approach to address NWM phylogeny. Our results indicate incongruence between concatenation and coalescence methods for the IN and IG datasets. However, a consensus was reached with a single tree topology from all analyses of combined INs and IGs as well as all analyses of question-specific loci using both concatenation and coalescence methods, albeit with varying degrees of statistical support. In detail, our results indicated the sister-group relationships between the families Atelidae and Pitheciidae, and between the subfamilies Aotinae and Callithrichinae among Cebidae. Our study provides insights into the disputed phylogenetic relationships among NWM families and subfamilies from the perspective of multiple non-coding loci and various tree-inference approaches. However, the present phylogenetic framework needs further evaluation by adding more independent sequence data and a deeper taxonomic sampling. Overall, our work has important implications for phylogenetic studies dealing with rapid radiations.

However, the dynamic processes involved in the evolution and deformation of the region remain poorly understood due to a lack of reliable geophysical observations. We collected abundant seismic data recorded by 108 permanent broadband stations deployed in the SE margin of Tibet since 2000, and obtained 4536 pairs of P-wave receiver functions (PRFs) with high signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we have implemented a novel two-step data inversion procedure that can reduce the dependence of the inversion results on the initial model. We first use low-frequency PRFs obtained by iterative deconvolution in the time domain, and then an initial model consisting of a series of 2-km-thick isotropic layers to fit velocity models, and thus determine an overall statistical solution by means of the bootstrap resampling technique. This statistical solution is then regarded as a new initial model to adjust high-frequency PRFs. Hence, the same resampling process is executed again to estimate the optimal S-wave velocity structure below each station. The results provide an accurate 3D image of the crust and uppermost mantle in the SE margin of Tibet. We infer a wide intra-crustal low-velocity zone that varies laterally and in depth, which is thinner or even absent in the most southern part of Yunnan. Our hypothesis is that this low-velocity zone is the result of the accumulation of lower crustal flow coming from central Tibet. Furthermore, we show that this lower crustal flow extends largely through the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond-shaped block, and that there are significant variations in both crustal velocity structure and deformation mechanism across the great strike-slip faults of the Jinshajiang-Red River and Xiaojiang fault systems.

This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to predict the TWSA derived from GRACE. We designed a case study in six regions in China (North China Plain (NCP), Southwest China (SWC), Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), Tianshan Mountains Region (TSMR), Heihe River Basin (HRB), and Lishui and Wenzhou area (LSWZ)) using GRACE RL06 data from January 2003 to August 2016 for inversion, which were compared with Center for Space Research (CSR), Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam-German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s Mascon (Mass Concentration) RL05, and JPL's Mascon RL06. We evaluated the accuracy of SSA prediction on different temporal scales based on the correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), which were compared with that of an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were predicted using SSA, which was verified using Mascon RL06, the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and GRACE-FO results. The results show that: (1) TWSA derived from GRACE agreed well with Mascon in most regions, with the highest consistency with Mascon RL06 and (2) prediction accuracy of GRACE in TRHR and SWC was higher. SSA reconstruction improved R, NSE, and RMSE compared with those of ARMA. The R values for predicting TWS in the six regions using the SSA method were 0.34-0.98, which was better than those for ARMA (0.26-0.97), and the RMSE values were 0.03-5.55 cm, which were better than the 2.29-5.11 cm RMSE for ARMA as a whole. (3) The SSA method produced better predictions for obvious periodic and trending characteristics in the TWSA in most regions, whereas the detailed signal could not be effectively predicted. (4) The predicted TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were basically consistent with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) results, and the predicted TWSA during June 2018 to May 2019 agreed well with GRACE-FO results. The research method in this paper provides a reference for bridging the gap in the TWSA between GRACE and GRACE-FO.

Past East Asian monsoon evolution controlled by paleogeography, not CO2	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CENTER COUPLED MODEL; TIBETAN PLATEAU; LATE MIOCENE; SOUTHERN TIBET; LUNPOLA BASIN; QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; MIDDLE EOCENE; LATE PLIOCENE; CLIMATE VARIABILITY	The East Asian monsoon plays an integral role in human society, yet its geological history and controlling processes are poorly understood. Using a general circulation model and geological data, we explore the drivers controlling the evolution of the monsoon system over the past 150 million years. In contrast to previous work, we find that the monsoon is controlled primarily by changes in paleogeography, with little influence from atmospheric CO2. We associate increased precipitation since the Late Cretaceous with the gradual uplift of the Himalayan-Tibetan region, transitioning from an ITCZ-dominated monsoon to a sea breeze-dominated monsoon. The rising region acted as a mechanical barrier to cold and dry continental air advecting into the region, leading to increasing influence of moist air from the Indian Ocean/South China Sea. We show that, apart from a dry period in the middle Cretaceous, a monsoon system has existed in East Asia since at least the Early Cretaceous.

After considering the characteristics of consumers, we propose that the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital promote consumers' perceptions of utilitarian and idea shopping value, and that those perceived values increase loyalty to online outshopping platforms. The survey data of 291 Chinese consumers with online outshopping platform experience are used to test the model. The results show that different dimensions of consumers' social capital influence their loyalty through different values. Utilitarian value mediates the effects of structural capital and cognitive capital on loyalty, whereas hedonic value (ideal shopping value) mediates the effects of structural and relational capital on loyalty.

These Paleoproterozoic stratigraphic units are exposed sporadically (in Baishan and Tonghua) beneath a thick cover of Quaternary basalts, meaning that only limited information can be obtained by traditional geological methods. Therefore, using geophysical techniques in this region is pertinent. Here we present new data on the petrophysical properties (density, magnetic susceptibility, and specific resistivity) obtained from 2D cross-gradient joint inversion profiles. The results allow us to establish the relationships between the Laoling and Ji'an groups, interpret the tectonic setting of deposition, and locate the subsurface margins of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt. Petrophysical parameters from the Dataishan Formation (density of 2.58 g/cm(3), zero magnetic susceptibility, and specific resistance of 10(3.04)Omega m) indicate that these rocks were derived predominantly from the Longgang Block in the north. For the Zhenzhumen Formation, the petrophysical parameters (high density, weak magnetic susceptibility, and high specific resistivity) are consistent with deposition in a passive margin that received detrital material sediments from the Longgang Block and the Liaoji granitoids. The Mayihe and Huangchagou formations (intermediate to high density, strong magnetic susceptibility, and intermediate specific resistivity) were deposited closer to a magmatic arc, with the detritus derived from the Liaoji granitoids. The low to intermediate density, stronger magnetic susceptibility, and intermediate specific resistivity of the Huashan-Linjiang, Dalizi, and Dadongcha formations indicate that these rocks were deposited in a pre-orogenic setting, with the detritus derived from the Longgang Block, Liaoji granitoids, and other felsic igneous rocks. Based on the geophysical profiles, we conclude that the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt extends under Quaternary basalt, from Linjiang to Baishan, and eastward towards North Korea. Two basincontrolling faults (F1 and F2) represent the northern and eastern boundaries between the Longgang Block and the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt. We interpret geophysical anomalies and variations in the petrophysical parameters in the context of subduction and collision processes.

This work investigated the spatiotemporal variabilities of drought across Yunnan province from 1961 to 2015. The drought conditions were identified according to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at various timescales based on the monthly precipitation and air temperature data collected at 122 meteorological stations. Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were adopted to analyze the trends and change points in the time series. The results showed that (1) the mean annual precipitation decreased by 15 mm/decade (p < 0.1), and the temperature increased significantly by 0.19 degrees C/decade (p < 0.01), indicating that Yunnan province has experienced a warming-drying climatic trend. (2) The annual SPEI exhibited a significant decreasing trend at a rate of - 0.16/decade (p < 0.01), and a change point was detected in 2002 (p < 0.05). Significant downward trends were found in the summer (p < 0.01) and autumn (p < 0.05) for the seasonal SPEI, with rates of - 0.13 and - 0.11/decade, respectively. Spatially, significant drying trends were observed in the Lancang and Pearl River Basins. (3) Higher frequencies of extreme and severe drought occurred with the extension of the timescale, particularly in central, northwestern, eastern, and northeastern Yunnan. With regard to inter-decadal variations, the drought frequencies at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month timescales generally increased and displayed fluctuating behavior. Moreover, the extent of the drought coverage area gradually expanded during the study period, especially after the early 2000s. (4) Increasingly frequent droughts have had substantial impacts on streamflow and agriculture over the past decade. The increase in droughts is associated with the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon, which has resulted in less precipitation in Yunnan. These results could be employed as references for the assessment of droughts and mitigation of drought disasters in Yunnan province.

"X-type hexagonal ferrites" with concentrations of "x = 0.0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.1 and y = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5" are taken and the substitution impact of trivalent Dy3+ and divalent Co2+ is observed on the physical and magnetic properties of X-HFs. The XRD result, the refinement of which is accomplished using CelRef software validates the existence of pure single phase in these ferrites. Morphological structure of the crystal grains is calculated using electron microscopy and it is found that the grain has varying size in the range of 0.75-1.001 mm. FTIR analysis is done with and without the sintering process to examine the changes relevant to the structure and the chemistry of the material and the phases existed in the material. Thermogravimetric analyzer is used to measure the TGA and DSC quantities. All FTIR, DSC, and TGA results show that they are in good harmony with the results outcomes from XRD. "Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)" is used to quantify the magnetic properties of the sample under observation. It is observed that with an increase in the concentration of Dy-Co, M-r (Remanence) value decreases this could be reasoned by spin canting effect. The value of coercivity (H-c) changes from 317 to 158 G which follows the inverse relation between grain size and coercivity. The future use of the material may be in the microwave absorption devices.

Here, we aimed to identify fungal strains that efficiently hydrolyze DG and explored the possibility to further improve the hydrolysis of DG and other agricultural wastes by co-culturing these fungi. The tested fungal strains included 11 strains that were isolated from DG (Maotai Town, Guizhou, China) and 19 strains that were selected from the CBS collection of Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. Aspergillus niger CBS 110.42 and CBS 554.65 and Phanerochaete chrysosporium CBS 246.84 showed overall best cellulose and xylan degrading activity, whereas high laccase and peroxidase activities were detected for Oidiodendron echinulatum CBS 113.65 and Bjerkandera adusta CBS 143380, respectively.

In addition to FLC, other FRI targets also exist in Arabidopsis. Although leaves sense environmental cues to modulate flowering time, it is not known if roots also regulate the floral transition. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal effect of FRI on flowering time. Local expression of FRI in the phloem and leaves activated FLC to delay flowering. Furthermore, we found that local expression of FRI in the roots also delayed flowering by activating other targets, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) and MAF5, in the roots. Graft and genetic experiments revealed that the spatial expression of FRI in the root might generate a mobile signal, which is transmitted from roots to shoot and antagonizes the FT signal to delay flowering. Specifically expressing FRI in the embryo efficiently delayed flowering, even expressing FRI as early as the pro-embryo stage is enough to up-regulate FLC expression to delay flowering. Together, our findings demonstrate the spatio-temporal effect of FRI on delaying flowering, and we propose that root tissue also perceives the flowering signal to fine-tune the flowering time through MAF4/5 as novel targets of FRI.

J	Su, Q; Dong, BW				Su, Qin; Dong, Buwen			Projected near-term changes in three types of heat waves over China under RCP4.5	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Heat wave; Heat wave type; Future change; China; Coupled models	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; ATMOSPHERIC CONTROLS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; AEROSOLS; HOT; EXTREMES; WEATHER; GASES; CIRCULATION	The changes in three aspects of frequency, intensity and duration of the compound, daytime and nighttime heat waves (HWs) over China during extended summer (May-September) in a future period of the mid-21st century (FP; 2045-2055) under RCP4.5 scenario relative to present day ( PD; 1994-2011) are investigated by two models, MetUM-GOML1 and MetUMGOML2, which comprise the atmospheric components of two state-of-the-art climate models coupled to a multi- level mixed-layer ocean model. The results show that in the mid-21st century all three types of HWs in China will occur more frequently with strengthened intensity and elongated duration relative to the PD. The compound HWs will change most dramatically, with the frequency in the FP being 4-5 times that in the PD, and the intensity and duration doubling those in the PD. The changes in daytime and nighttime HWs are also remarkable, with the changes of nighttime HWs larger than those of daytime HWs. The future changes of the three types of HWs in China in two models are similar in terms of spatial patterns and area-averaged quantities, indicating these projected changes of HWs over the China under RCP4.5 scenario are robust. Further analyses suggest that projected future changes in HWs over China are determined mainly by the increase in seasonal mean surface air temperatures with change in temperature variability playing a minor role. The seasonal mean temperature increase is due to the increase in surface downward longwave radiation and surface shortwave radiation. The increase in downward longwave radiation results from the enhanced greenhouse effect and increased water vapour in the atmosphere. The increase in surface shortwave radiation is the result of the decreased aerosol emissions, via direct aerosolradiation interaction and indirect aerosol-cloud interaction over southeastern and northeastern China, and the reduced cloud cover related to a decrease in relative humidity.

Previous studies attributed the above change to La Nina-like decadal mean sea surface temperature (SST) cooling associated with a positive to negative phase switch of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Results of numerical experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model reveal that both the interdecadal and interannual components of SST variations contribute to the late 1990s' precipitation reduction over the equatorial central Pacific in all the four seasons and the precipitation increase around the Maritime Continent in winter and summer. The accompanying precipitation increase over the Central America is mainly induced by the interdecadal components of SST variations. The contribution of interannual SST variations to the equatorial central Pacific precipitation decrease mostly stems from a larger rate of precipitation change with SST in positive than negative SST anomaly years, which leads to a residual decadal mean precipitation being larger during the period before than after the late 1990s. The moisture budget decomposition demonstrates that the dynamic effect associated with the vertical motion change dominates the tropical decadal mean precipitation changes in all the four seasons and the thermodynamic effect associated with the moisture change is small. This applies to the equatorial central Pacific, the Maritime Continent, and the Central America in both interdecadal and interannual SST forced simulations.

The characterization results show that the as-prepared products are composed of numerous small nanocrystallines with irregular shapes. XPS analysis reveals the adsorbed oxygen on the surface of ZnO, which can react with the detected gas molecules and improve the sensor response. The gas-sensing properties of the sensors made from the Ag-decorated ZnO nanocrystallines are tested for hydrogen detection at 260 degrees C. The results show that the sensor made from 1 mol% Ag-decorated ZnO nanocrystallines exhibits excellent gas-sensing properties, demonstrating a high gas response of 59.35 toward 3000 ppm hydrogen, a fast response time (5 s) and recovery time (6 s) (with 1000 ppm hydrogen), good repeatability and stability. The improved hydrogen sensing properties can be attributed to the catalytic effect of Ag nanoparticles, which offer more active sites for the reaction and facilitate the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen on the surface of ZnO nanocrystallines.

Most lacunarity measures have been obtained from greyscale or binary (0 and 1) data for an entire study area or fixed rectangular windows, and a zonal lacunarity tool for discrete raster data is still lacking in current geographic information systems. Objectives This short communication presents the development of a free zonal lacunarity analysis tool for ArcGIS to support applications involving scale-dependent analysis of spatial heterogeneity, including landscape ecology. The application of the tool is also demonstrated using 2001 and 2011 land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Methods Based on the gliding-box algorithm for lacunarity estimation, a tool for zonal lacunarity analysis of discrete raster data is developed using ArcPy and the Python programming language. The tool uses discrete raster data as input, an optional zone feature class as zone data to partition the input raster data into different zones, and a spreadsheet with zonal lacunarity values as output. Results As a demonstration, lacunarity measurements of grasslands in Corinth and Lake Dallas, Texas were calculated from the 2001 and 2011 NLCD data using box sizes (scales) of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The results show that measures of grassland lacunarity in Lake Dallas were higher than Corinth at all scales, and the measures of grassland lacunarity in 2011 were higher than 2001 for both cities because of the increasing gap sizes in grasslands. The increasing gap sizes in grasslands were caused by converting the grasslands into developed areas. Conclusions The results suggest that the zonal lacunarity analysis tool can provide important information on the spatial distribution of gaps in the input discrete raster data at different scales. It is hoped that the zonal lacunarity analysis tool can be further evaluated using different datasets in landscape ecology.

The chemical composition and structure of synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), element map, UV visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The prepared samples were used to remove 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) under visible light irradiation, which has most potent estrogenic activity and resists to biodegradation. The results show that the B-type TiO2 (TiO2(B)) nano-belts are crosslinked with CdS nano-rods to form heterojunction with higher removal rate (92.00%) than pure CdS nanorods (55.67%) for 3 mg/L EE2 within 120 min when the mass ratio of CdS nanorods to TiO2 (B) nanobelts is 1:15. The degradation rate constant of EE2 over CdS-NR/TiO2 (B)-NB (0.001763 min(-1)) is 3 times higher than pure CdS-NR (0.00567 min(-1)) under visible light irradiation. Charge generation, migration and possible photocatalytic mechanism of EE2 on CdS-NR/TiO2 (B)-NB photocatalyst has been proposed based on the theoretical calculation and reactive species trapping experimental results.

One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at 5'-untranslated region of SCGB1A1, rs3741240. has been suggested to be associated with reduced protein expression and further asthma susceptibility. However, it was still unclear whether there were other cis-regulatory elements for SCGB1A1 that might further contribute to pulmonary diseases. Allele-specific expression (ASE) is a novel approach to identify the functional region in human genome. In the present study, we measured ASE on rs3741240 in lung tissues and observed a consistent excess of G allele over A (P < 10(-6)), which indicated that this SNP or the one(s) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) could regulate SCGB1A1 expression. By analyzing 1000 Genomes Project data for Chinese. one SNP locating similar to 10.2 kb away and downstream of SCGB1A1, rs2509956, was identified to be in strong Li) with rs3741240. Reporter gene assay confirmed that both SNPs could regulate gene expression in the lung cell. By chromosome conformation capture, it was verified that the region surrounding rs2509956 could interact with SCGB1A1 promoter region and act as an enhancer. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation and overexpression assay, the related transcription factor RELA (RELA proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit) was recognized to bind the region spanning rs2509956. Our work identified a novel long-distance cis-regulatory SNP for SCGB1A1, which might contribute to multiple pulmonary diseases.

This new species is characterized by having phialidic conidiogenous cells with conspicuous collarettes, and aseptate, verrucose, ellipsoidal to sometimes ovoid, olivaceous brown to dark brown conidia. Morphologically, M. sinensis is similar to M. dichroa, but can be easily distinguished due to its hyaline conidiophores and smaller conidia. Phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences at five loci showed that our strain grouped together with M. dichroa and M. oenanthes. Here, the new species is described and illustrated, and a key to the species of the genus Memnoniella is provided.

S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS): survey description and maps	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						magnetic fields; polarization; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; methods: observational; Galaxy: structure; diffuse radiation	HIGH GALACTIC LATITUDE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; LINEAR-POLARIZATION; FARADAY-ROTATION; RADIO-SOURCES; EMISSION; GALAXY; GHZ	We present the S-Band Polarization All Sky Survey (S-PASS), a survey of polarized radio emission over the southern sky at Dec. <-1 degrees taken with the Parkes radio telescope at 2.3 GHz. The main aim was to observe at a frequency high enough to avoid strong depolarization at intermediate Galactic latitudes (still present at 1.4 GHz) to study Galactic magnetism, but low enough to retain ample signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at high latitudes for extragalactic and cosmological science. We developed a new scanning strategy based on long azimuth scans and a corresponding map-making procedure to make recovery of the overall mean signal of Stokes Q and U possible, a long-standing problem with polarization observations. We describe the scanning strategy, map-making procedure and validation tests. The overall mean signal is recovered with a precision better than 0.5 per cent. The maps have a mean sensitivity of 0.81 mK on beam-size scales and show clear polarized signals, typically to within a few degrees of the Galactic plane, with ample S/N everywhere (the typical signal in low-emission regions is 13 mK and 98.6 per cent of pixels have S/N > 3). The largest depolarization areas are in the inner Galaxy, associated with the Sagittarius Arm. We have also computed a rotation measure map combining S-PASS with archival data from theWilkinsonMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck experiments. A Stokes I map has been generated, with sensitivity limited to the confusion level of 9 mK.

We analyse the archival Chandra data for M87, and identify 14 flares in the nucleus and nine flares in HST-1. The peak intensity (IP) and the flaring duration time (Tfl) for each flare are obtained. It is found that the distributions of both IP and Tfl for the nucleus obey a power law form with a similar index. A similar result is also obtained for HST-1, and no significant inconsistency between the nucleus and HST-1 is found for the indices. Similar to solar X-ray flares, the power-law distributions of the flare event parameters can be well explained by a self-organized criticality system, which are triggered by magnetic reconnection. Our results suggest that the flares from nucleus and HST-1 are possibly triggered by magnetic reconnection process. The consistent indices for the distributions of IP and Tfl in the nucleus and HST-1 indicate that the dimensions of the energy dissipation of the magnetic reconnection are identical in the two regions. A strong correlation between the flares in the two regions also suggests a similar physical origin for the flares.

In this disease, failure of remyelination could cause persistent disability. Cordycepin, also known as 3'-deoxyadenosine, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidic, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects. The cuprizone (CPZ) model has been widely used to study MS as it mimics some characteristics of demyelination disease. To determine whether cordycepin promotes remyelination and functional recovery after CPZ-induced demyelination, we administered cordycepin to the CPZ-induced demyelination mice. Cordycepin reversed CPZ-induced loss of body weight and rescued motor dysfunction in the model mice. Cordycepin effectively promoted remyelination and enhanced MBP expression in the corpus callosum. Cordycepin also inhibited the CPZ-induced increase in the number of Iba1-positive microglia, GFAP-positive astrocytes and Olig2-positive oligodendroglial precursor cells in the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1 beta and IL-6) was inhibited while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and neurotrophic factor BDNF release was elevated in the corpus callosum and hippocampus after cordycepin treatment. In addition, we also found that cordycepin ameliorated CPZ-induced body weight loss, motor dysfunction, demyelination, glial cells activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Our results suggest that cordycepin may represent a useful therapeutic agent in demyelination-related diseases via suppression of neuroinflammation.

Yet, few have examined whether grazing-induced changes in soil food webs and their ecosystem functions can be extrapolated to a regional scale. We investigated how large herbivore grazing affects soil micro-food webs (microbes and nematodes) and ecosystem functions (soil C and N mineralization), using paired grazed and ungrazed plots at 10 locations across the Mongolian Plateau. Our results showed that grazing not only affected plant variables (e.g., biomass and C and N concentrations), but also altered soil substrates (e.g., C and N contents) and soil environment (e.g., soil pH and bulk density). Grazing had strong bottom-up effects on soil micro-food webs, leading to more pronounced decreases at higher trophic levels (nematodes) than at lower trophic levels (microbes). Structural equation modeling showed that changes in plant biomass and soil environment dominated grazing effects on microbes, while nematodes were mainly influenced by changes in plant biomass and soil C and N contents; the grazing effects, however, differed greatly among functional groups in the soil micro-food webs. Grazing reduced soil C and N mineralization rates via changes in plant biomass, soil C and N contents, and soil environment across grasslands on the Mongolian Plateau. Spearman's rank correlation analysis also showed that grazing reduced the correlations between functional groups in soil micro-food webs and then weakened the correlation between soil micro-food webs and soil C and N mineralization. These results suggest that changes in soil micro-food webs resulting from livestock grazing are poor predictors of soil C and N processes at regional scale, and that the relationships between soil food webs and ecosystem functions depend on spatial scales and land-use changes.

Previous studies have generally focused on stemflow volume, efficiency and influential factors but have failed to depict stemflow processes and quantify their relations with rainfall characteristics within events, particularly for xerophytic shrubs. Here, we measured the stemflow volume, intensity, funneling ratio and time lags to rain at two dominant shrub species (Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) and rainfall characteristics during 54 events at the semiarid Liudaogou catchment of the Loess Plateau, China, during the 2014-2015 rainy seasons. The funneling ratio was calculated as the ratio between stemflow and rainfall intensities at the inter- and intra-event scales. Our results indicated that the stemflow of C. korshinskii and S. psammophila, on average, started at 66.2 and 54.8 min, maximized 109.4 and 120.5 min after rain began, and ended 20.0 and 13.5 min after rain ceased. The two shrubs had shorter stemflow duration (3.8 and 3.4 h) and significantly larger stemflow intensities (517.5 and 367 3 mmh(-1) ) than those of rain (4.7h and 4.5 mm h(-1) ). As branch size increased, both species shared the decreasing funneling ratios (97.7-163.7 and 44.2-212.0) and stemflow intensities (333.8-716.2 and 197.2-738.7 mm h(-1) ). Tested by the multiple correspondence analysis and stepwise regression, rainfall amount and duration controlled stemflow volume and duration, respectively, at the event scale by linear relations (p < 0.01). Rainfall intensity and raindrop momentum controlled stemflow intensity and time lags to rain for both species within the event by linear or power relationships (p < 0.01). Rainfall intensity was the key factor affecting stemflow process of C. korshinskii, whereas raindrop momentum had the greatest influence on stemflow process of S. psammophila. Therefore, rainfall characteristics had temporally dependent influences on corresponding stemflow variables, and the influence also depended on specific species.

The atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased from 280 ppm to 404 ppm since the Industrial Revolution and is projected to exceed 900 ppm by 2100 (ref.(2)). In terrestrial ecosystems, elevated CO2 typically stimulates C-3 plant photosynthesis and primary productivity leading to an increase in plant size(3). However, compared with woody plants or crops(4), the morphological responses of clonal non-woody plants to elevated CO2 have rarely been examined. We show that 30 years of experimental CO2 enrichment in a brackish marsh increased primary productivity and stem density but decreased stem diameter and height of the dominant clonal species Schoenoplectus americanus. Smaller, denser stems were associated with the expansion of roots and rhizomes to alleviate nitrogen (N) limitation as evidenced by high N immobilization in live tissue and litter, high tissue C:N ratio and low available porewater N. Changes in morphology and tissue chemistry induced by elevated CO2 were reversed by N addition. We demonstrate that morphological responses to CO2 and N supply in a clonal plant species influences the capacity of marshes to gain elevation at rates that keep pace with rising sea levels.

NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES; WELLS; SOIL	A novel Gram-negative bacterium, non-motile and short rod-shaped, designated strain GY511(T), was isolated from the intestines of fish collected from Maowei Sea, China. Growth occurred at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum 7.0), 4-37 degrees C (optimum 28 degrees C) and at 0-2.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1.0%). The result of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain GY511(T) is closely related to O. oryzae NBRC 113109(T) (97.6%), O. konkukae DSM 105395(T) (97.4%), Ottowia beijingensis CGMCC 1.12324(T) (95.9%), Ottowia pentelensis DSM 21699(T) (95.2%) and Ottowia thiooxydans DSM 14619(T) (95.0%). The DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain GY511(T) with O. oryzae NBRC 113109(T) and O. konkukae DSM 105395(T) were 35.4 +/- 3.1% and 26.3 +/- 1.8%, respectively. The major fatty acids (> 10%) were identified as summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c), C-16:0 and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) and the major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8). The polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and an unidentified phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 62.9 mol%. Thiosulfate could be utilized as co-substrate for aerobic growth and was oxidised to sulfate. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular data, strain GY511(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Ottowia, for which the name Ottowia flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GY511(T) (= NBRC 113500(T) = DSM 107425(T) = CGMCC 1.13650(T)).

Under the assumption that the viscous coefficient is given as a power function of the density, we prove that, for any positive power index of the viscous coefficient, if the amplitude of the corresponding outgoing viscous shock wave is suitably small and the initial data are close to the outgoing viscous shock wave which is far from the boundary, then a global solution exists uniquely in time and tends towards the properly shifted viscous shock wave as the time goes to infinity. The proof is given by an elementary energy method.

A library of thirty-seven 6-amide-2-aryl benzoxazole/benzimidazole derivatives has been designed and synthesized based on the highly conserved active site of VEGFR-2. Several title compounds exhibited selective inhibitory activities against VEGFR-2 than EGFR kinases, which also displayed selective anti-proliferation potency against the HUVEC and HepG2 than the A549 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for anti-angiogenesis capability by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Among them, compounds 9d showed the most potent anti-angiogenesis ability (79% inhibition at 10 nM/eggs), the efficient cytotoxic activities (in vitro against the HUVEC and HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 1.47 and 2.57 mu M, respectively), and excellent VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition (IC50 = 0.051 mu M). The molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 9d is a Type 11 inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase. These results indicated that the 6-amide-2-arylbenzoxazole and 6-amide-2-aryl benzimidazole derivatives are promising inhibitors of VEGFR-2 kinase for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis.

Their antiangiogenic capabilities were evaluated using a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The compound, XCF-37b, was selected as the most potent antiangiogenic inhibitor with noncytotoxicity to evaluate the pharmacological effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that XCF-37b inhibited HT29-cell colon tumor growth in vivo, without showing cytotoxicity against the five other cancer cell lines in vitro. Experiments confirmed that XCF-37b had obvious antiangiogenic activity by HUVEC migration and invasion and rat aortic ring angiogenesis ex vivo. Mechanism studies showed that XCF-37b inhibited the AKT/mTOR and VEGFR2 signaling pathways, as evidenced by decreased expressions of phosphor-AKT (p-AKT), p-mTOR, p-VEGFR2 (Tyr175), p-Src (Tyr416), p-FAK (Tyr925), and p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204). Moreover, XCF-37b significantly decreased the protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). XCF-37b generally regulated angiogenic inhibition through several regulatory pathways, without significantly interfering with colorectal cancer cell growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

With opposite changes of the two cores in radius dimension, matching the effective refractive index between the fundamental mode (LP01) in one core and one desired high-order mode in the other core is obtained, and the fundamental mode power is gradually converted to the high-order mode. The simulation results show that the mode conversion of LP01 to any high-order mode of LP11, LP21, LP31, LP12, LP41, LP22, LP32, LP42 and LP23 modes can be obtained with a conversion efficiency of similar to 99%, similar to 96%, similar to 92%, similar to 93%, similar to 82%, similar to 92%, similar to 84%, similar to 85% and similar to 81% at the working wavelength of 1550 nm, respectively, and also conversion bandwidth ( >80% conversion efficiency) is 265, 125, 130, 130, 100, 35 and 30 nm, respectively. Compared to the previously reported works, the proposed mode converter structure is more universal to support any of higher-order mode conversions with wider bandwidth.

Fern fronds are common in Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata. Large tri- or multipinnate fronds are mainly preserved as impression/compressions, while anatomically preserved specimens are typically smaller and comprise dispersed petioles, rachides, ultimate pinna, and pinnules. Here, we describe a large, anatomically preserved tripinnate frond from the latest Permian of southwest China that provides the first detailed histological information for a Cathaysian marattialean with pinnule morphology of the cosmopolitan Carboniferous-Permian pecopteriod type, but with different frond anatomy. Methodology. Specimens were prepared by the cellulose acetate peel technique and studied by light microscopy. Pivotal results. The tripinnate frond has a main rachis and a primary pinnae rachis with many (>70) small vascular bundles arranged in cycles and abundant tanniferous cells. Pinnules are small, and their bases are entirely attached to the ultimate rachis. Abundant vascular bundles in the rachises are distinct from previously recognized marattialean genera, justifying the establishment of Rothwellopteris pecopteroides gen. et sp. nov. Comparison of pinnule morphology with impression/compression fossils shows the specimen to be an anatomically preserved equivalent of Pecopteris marginata Li et al. Conclusions. Rothwellopteris pecopteroides displays a novel combination of marattialean characters from the extinct Paleozoic family Psaroniaceae and the extant family Marattiaceae. Its frond morphology resembles Psaroniaceae including Psaronius but differs from extant Marattiaceae that are monopinnate, palmate, or, as in Angiopteris, bipinnate and that have large pinnules with contracted bases. By contrast, its anatomy, with abundant vascular bundles, is similar to Marattiaceae, especially Angiopteris, but it is distinct from members of the Psaroniaceae in which the rachis possesses one or two tangentially elongate vascular bundles. Pecopteris marginata shows that, by the latest Permian, Marattiales had already evolved frond anatomy typical of extant genera, demonstrating that the stem group to crown group transition commenced prior to the Triassic.

The improvement of service performance and low-power consumption are the two challenges for these medical WBANs, because those energy-limited wireless medical sensors must transmit the monitoring data to the personal server (PS) via intra-WBAN in time. Further, precise mathematical modeling combining with the sleeping state to measure this improvement theoretically is still lack. Therefore, a polling control with exhaustive service using the sleeping schema is proposed to address the problems in WBANs communication for smart health. Based on the managed access phase (MAP) specified in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, it has been attempting to improve the energy efficiency through a self-managing sleeping schema for both the sensor nodes and the PS according to the load in intra-WBANs, in which the node will soon turn to sleep upon completion of transmitting all its current data packets. Additionally, by employing the embedded Markov chain and probability generating function, the proposed model is established, and the performance characteristics-the mean cyclic period and queue length at the polling moment-were accurately obtained to justify the service performance can be guaranteed. In addition, the expressions of the quantitative relationship among sleeping time, performance characteristics and network parameters were derived in closed form, which can easily evaluate the energy efficiency. Simulations were carried out to justify this model.

Enormous medical images are constantly generated by various health monitoring and sensing devices, such as ultrasound, MRI machines. Hence, based on pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) and the classical visual receptive field (CVRF) with the difference of two Gaussians (DOG), a contrast enhancement of MRI image is suggested to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis for smarter mobile healthcare. As one premise, the parameters of DOG are estimated from the fundamentals of CVRF; then the PCNN parameters in image enhancement are estimated eventually with the help of DOG. As a result, the MRI images can be enhanced adaptively. Due to the exponential decay of the dynamic threshold and the pulses coupling among neurons, PCNN effectively enhances the contrast of low grey levels in MRI image. Moreover, because of the inhibitory effects from inhibitory region in CVRF, PCNN also effectively preserves the structures such as edges for enhanced results. Experiments on several MRI images show that the proposed method performs better than other methods by improving contrast and preserving structures well.

However, p-xylene was oxidized rarely to other oxygen-containing derivatives. On the other hand, current methods for synthesis of 4-hydroxymethylenzoic acid suffer from multistep reactions, long reaction time, high temperature, high pressure, and lower selectivity. In this work, p-xylene was directly oxidized into 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid using Cu-MOF as the catalyst, acetonitrile as the solvent, and 30% H2O2 as the oxidant under mild conditions. Very high selectivity (99.2%) of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and good substrate conversion (85.5%) of p-xylene were achieved at 30 degrees C for 5 h. Fast hot catalyst filtration experiments proved that Cu-MOF acted as a heterogeneous catalyst. It can be reused three times without losing its activity. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid and the conversion of p-xylene were 97.6% and 84.8% even though the experiment was amplified 15-folds. The efficiency of H2O2 was also up to 92.0%. The reaction mechanism was proposed combined with the analysis of XRD, FT-IR and XPS. All data displayed that Cu-MOF shows great potential as a catalyst for highly selective oxidation of stable C-H to high value-added compounds containing two diverse C-O bands under mild conditions. It also opens a new way to use of p-xylene.

NSST has many advantages such as multi-scale features and sparse representation. Moreover, the visual saliency map can improve the low frequency fusion strategy, and SCM has coupling and pulse synchronization properties. Firstly, NSST is utilized to decompose the source image into a low-frequency subband and a series of high-frequency subbands. Secondly, the low-frequency subband is fused by SCM, where SCM is motivated by the edge saliency map of the low-frequency subband of the source image, and then the high-frequency subbands are also fused by SCM, where the modified spatial frequency of the high-frequency subbands of the source image is adopted as the input stimulus of SCM, the parameters of SCM are optimized by the novel multi-objective artificial bee colony technique. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse NSST. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme performs well and has obvious superiorities over other current typical ones in both subjective visual performance and objective criteria.

Rubus is one of the most species-rich and most taxonomically challenging genera in Rosaceae. Pollen morphology of Rubus species has been described by many researchers but never in a comprehensive study. In this study, pollen morphology of 155 species and 13 varieties representing all 12 subgenera of Rubus was examined using scanning electron microscope to investigate whether pollen characters can help elucidate the challenging taxonomy in this genus. The results showed that the pollen grains of studied Rubus species are tricolporate, and pollen shape varies from suboblate, spheroidal, subprolate and prolate to perprolate. Exine ornamentation of examined pollen grains can be divided into six types and three subtypes. The pollen cluster analysis tree, which was performed using nine pollen characters, does not agree well with the traditional macromorphological classification and molecular phylogenetic trees based on DNA fragments. Except for subg. Chamaemorus and subg. Comaropsis, pollen morphology seems difficult to distinguish at subgeneric or sectional level, and consequently it lacks significant taxonomic value at these levels. Pollen morphology may not be considered a diagnostic feature for the division of subgenera and sections in Rubus. Though pollen morphology alone is not sufficient to elucidate or reconstruct the taxonomic relationships within Rubus, it can provide some useful information for the taxonomic treatment at specific level.

J	Wei, F				Wei, Fan			Conch size evolution of Silurian-Devonian tentaculitoids	LETHAIA			English	Article						Tentaculitoids; conch size; macroevolution; Devonian; Silurian	BODY-SIZE; TEMPERATURE; EXTINCTION; ECTOTHERMS; ECOLOGY; CRISIS; GROWTH	Conch size changes of tentaculitoids are reported from the Silurian and Devonian strata. The combination of measurements of diameters and apical angles allows the reconstruction of tentaculitoid volumes. The conch wall thickness and number of septa can be investigated through observations of thin sections. Within the examined groups, the average conch volume (including the adult part and the whole conch) of tentaculitids increased from the Llandovery to the Pragian and then decreased until the Frasnian. A similar trend was observed in the Devonian dacryoconarids, which peaked for average conch volume in the Emsian. Sea-level change was probably the main factor controlling the conch volume of tentaculitids and dacryoconarids. The continuous decrease in the average number of septa and the average volume of tentaculitid and dacryoconarid juvenile part from the Pragian (or the Emsian) to the Frasnian indicates a reduction of juvenile duration and earlier reproductive behaviour. The ratio of adult part to juvenile part volumes increased from the Emsian to the Frasnian in tentaculitids, suggesting that the angle between the conch and the water-sediment interface decreased. The conch volume and thickness of the juvenile part and the adult part in all tentaculitoid groups demonstrated similar trends. The average volume of the initial chamber and the adult part of dacryoconarids changed synchronously, with the peak value in the Emsian. Homoctenids, with the smallest conch and the thinnest wall, probably lived in deeper water than dacryoconarids.

J	Ou, XY; Ma, QZ; Wang, YJ				Ou, Xinyu; Ma, Qianzhi; Wang, Yijin			Improving person re-identification by multi-task learning	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Person re-identification; Multi-Task learning; Identity; Attribute; Identification; Verification		We propose a novel Multi-Task Learning Network (MTNET) with four different subtasks for person re-identification mission. At the same time, the attribute recognition mission can be implemented by the same network. We achieve multi-mission by integrating four subtasks, such as identity identification, identity verification, attribute identification, attribute verification. Identity loss and attribute loss can provide complementary information on a different perspective by integrating multi-context information. Identity focuses on the overall contour and appearance, while attribute focuses on local aspects and dresses of one person. Identification loss and verification loss are used to optimize the distance of samples. Identification loss used to construct a robust category space, while verification loss used to optimize the space by minimizing the distance between similar images, and maximizing the distance between dissimilar images. Moreover, an effective verification loss named constraint contrast verification (CCV) is proposed to restrict the distance between feature pair to a foreseeable range that ensures the network has better convergence. The MTNet is an end-to-end deep learning framework, all the parameters and losses can be jointly optimized. We evaluate our approach with the state-of-the-art methods on two famous dataset Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. Experiments demonstrate that our MTNet achieves the very competitive results.

J	Yuan, JP; Gao, Y; Feng, D; Yang, YL				Yuan, Junpeng; Gao, Yong; Feng, Dian; Yang, Yali			The Zonal Dipole Pattern of Tropical Cyclone Genesis in the Indian Ocean Influenced by the Tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Atmosphere; Indian Ocean; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Cyclogenesis; cyclolysis; Interannual variability	EL-NINO; ENSO; BAY; IOD; VARIABILITY; MODULATION; IMPACTS; MODE	From a basinwide perspective, the dominant mode of Indian Ocean tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) in September-November (SON) shows an equatorially symmetric east-west zonal dipole pattern, which can explain approximately 13% of the SON TCG variance. This zonal dipole TCG pattern is significantly related to the tripole pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean (IPT). The IPT, which is a combined interbasin mode and presents a dipole pattern of SSTAs in the tropical Indian Ocean and El Nino-like SSTAs in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can influence the local Walker circulation and zonal dipole TCG pattern over the tropical Indian Ocean. Associated with a positive IPT phase, abnormal ascending (descending) motions are induced and favorable for more (less) water vapor transport to the lower-middle level in the western (eastern) tropical Indian Ocean; significant anticyclonic vorticity anomalies are evoked in the lower level over the eastern tropical Indian Ocean, and weak easterly vertical wind shear appears over the tropical Indian Ocean. Thus, abnormally strong upward motion, abundant water vapor in the lower-middle level, and weak vertical wind shear are favorable for more TCG in the western tropical Indian Ocean, while the combined negative contributions of the vertical motion, lower-level vorticity, and humidity terms result in less TCG in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean.

Analysis of measurements of air pollutants form a fundamental basis for understanding the characteristics of air pollution and are important references for policy-making. In this study, five-year measurements of air pollutants at 6 sites in Lhasa, a typical high altitude big city in southwestern China, were analyzed from January 2013 to December 2017. Air pollutants at all the 6 sites in Lhasa generally displayed similar patterns of both diurnal and monthly variations, indicating the mixed atmospheric environment and the overall effect of the meteorological conditions in the city. Spatially, the air pollutant concentrations at the 6 sites were generally characterized by high concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 at urban sites and high O-3 concentrations at suburban sites. In comparison with other provincial capital cities in China, Lhasa has low concentrations of air pollutants, except for O-3 , and thus, better air quality. Although Lhasa has experienced rapid urbanization and economic development, air pollution conditions have remained rather stable and even decreased slightly in term of particular air pollutants. We suggested that the relatively isolated location, low air pollutant emissions associated with its industrial structure and renewable energy consumption, and effective air pollution control measures, collectively contributed to the synchronous improvement of the economy and air quality in Lhasa. Such "Lhasa pattern" may serve as a positive example for other regional hub cities in China and beyond that experience socioeconomic development and simultaneously seek to improve air quality.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of ethanol extract from Bidens pilosa L. (EEBP) on spontaneous activity, learning and memory in aged rats. Methods: Forty aged (21.90 +/- 0.22 months) and 10 young (10 weeks) adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups, which were respectively treated orally with 0 mg/kg (young and aged control), 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of EEBP for 30 days consecutively. Then, the animals were examined with open-field, passive avoidance and Morris water maze tasks. Results: In the open-field task, compared with the aged control, the EEBP animals exhibited more rearing (50 mg/kg, P < 0.01) and urination (50 mg/kg, P < 0.01), but less defecation (P < 0.05). In the passive avoidance task, the retention latencies were longer than those in the training phase in all other groups (P < 0.01) except the aged control (P > 0.05). Compared with the young control, the retention latency of the aged control decreased (P < 0.01), but that of the EEBP animals increased again (P < 0.05 vs. aged control). In the Morris water maze, the EEBP animals had shorter latency (100 mg/kg) and had more crossing times (25 mg/kg) in seeking the platform position (P < 0.05, vs. aged control). Conclusion: The results suggested that EEBP could affect the spontaneous activity and improve memory in aged animals and could have potential advantages for cognition improvement in aged populations.

Although the phenomenon has a distinct similarity to gravitational lensing, particularly in its mathematical description, plasma lensing introduces other additional features, such as wavelength dependence, radial rather than tangential image distortions, and strong demagnification of background sources. Axisymmetrical models of plasma lenses have been well studied in the literature, but density distributions with more complicated shapes can provide new and exotic image configurations and increase the richness of the magnification properties. As a first step towards non-axisymmetrical distributions, we study two families of elliptical plasma lens, softened power law, and exponential plasma distributions. We perform numerical studies on each lens model, and present them over a parameter space. In addition to deriving elliptical plasma lens formulae, we also investigate the number of critical curves that the lens can produce by studying the lens parameter space, in particular the dependence on the lensing ellipticity. We find that the introduction of ellipticity into the plasma distribution can enhance the lensing effects as well as the complexity of the magnification map.

The stem comprises well-preserved tissues of the pith, primary and secondary xylem. Pith is divided into a thick-walled parenchymatous peripheral zone and an inner parenchymatous part. Primary xylem strands are numerous and indistinct with mesarch maturation. Secondary xylem is pycnoxylic with scalariform bordered pits on radial tracheid walls, with rays normally uniseriate or partly biseriate. Cross-field pits are mixed and including circular, elliptical and scalariform pitting. Comparisons indicate a close affinity with the contemporaneous plant Xuanweioxylon scalanforme, but differences with it lead to the erection of Xuanweioxylon damogouense sp. nov. We evaluate the systettiatic affinity of both species of Xuanweioxylon and conclude they represent conifers based on features of their wood anatomy. We consider the Xuanwei Formation includes at least four species of conifer, and show that X. damogouense possessed weak growth rings and false rings that suggest it grew in a climate with low seasonality and occasional periods of drought.

The reaction carrier magnetic beads (MBs) effectively reduced the toxicity of the complex sample to the working electrode, and the signal carrier bi-AuNP probes loaded a large amount of signal molecules, both of which enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio and further improved the detection sensitivity. A detection limit as low as 0.11 pg/mL was achieved for CEA detection based on the immunomagnetic separation and bi-AuNP probe-based multiamplification strategy, and the strategy was further successfully applied in human serum samples. The transducer was regenerated via a simple washing procedure, which enabled the detection of all samples on a single electrode with high reproducibility. The proposed strategy, which has the merits of high sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility exhibits great potential for detection in complex samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, owing to the visual ambiguities arising from the variability in viewing angles and illumination, and the presence of occlusions, PRID continues to present many challenges, especially when only a single image per view is available for each person. To overcome this problem, we propose a top distance regularized projection and dictionary learning (DL) model for PRID. The model incorporates both projection and DL to form a unified optimization framework to enhance the effectiveness of both these types of learning. Thus, the dictionary and projection matrix are jointly learned within this framework. In particular, the learned projection maps the coding coefficient into a discriminative space and minimizes the distance between the same persons across non-overlapping views such that the dictionary and projection can be discriminated. Moreover, we exploit listwise distances to capture all pairwise similarities. Based on this design, we derive a top distance regularization term to refine the solution space of the DL model such that the discriminative ability of the learned projection matrix and dictionary are further improved. Experiments on different challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over a few current state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have explored anxiety in drug naive (FEDN) patients with MDD and those presenting with a first episode. The objective of this current study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD in order to understand the relationship between MDD and anxiety in the acute early phase and provide important implications for therapeutic interventions. Methods: A total of 1718 FEDN patients with MDD were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Their anthropometric and clinical data, including suicide attempt and psychotic symptom, were collected. The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety for all the patients in this study. Results: Overall, we found that the prevalence of anxiety in FEDN MDD patients was 80.3%. Correlation analysis showed that anxiety was associated with suicide attempt and psychotic symptom in FEDN patients with MDD. The rate of suicide attempt and psychosis in above patients with anxiety was 24.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that suicide attempt and psychotic symptom were significant predictors for anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD is very high. We also found that two clinical variables, suicide attempt and psychosis, are risk factors for comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD.

It is still a big challenge to directly convert crop straws into clean products by thermoplastic processing methods due to their none thermal meltability. Herein, clean and sustainable WS-based biocomposites (SWTPs) with fascinating thermal meltability, mechanical property, and dimensional stability after water absorption have been for the first time prepared by novel supramolecular interactions induced thermoplasticization technique under solvent-free condition, wherein supramolecular interactions stands for that the initial hydrogen bondings of WS have been effectively replaced by new interactions between chlorine atoms of the developed supramolecular inducer and hydroxyl groups of WS. Microstructure, thermoplastic behavior, thermal stability, morphology, and related thermoplascitization mechanism of the SWTPs have been extensively assessed. Relevant results reveal that the initial intense hydrogen bondings of WS can be significantly reduced resulting from the newly formed supramolecular interactions between WS powders and the used supramolecular inducers. The obtained SWTPs show outstanding thermal meltability in the temperature range of 130-180 degrees C and excellent thermal stability in the temperature range of 25-240 degrees C. Industrialization value and economy value of the produced biocomposites have been briefly discussed. The developed SWTP productions show large potential application in replacing unsustainable and ecounfriendly petroleum based polymers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various techniques were used to analyze the structure, morphology and specific surface area of the as-synthesized samples. The sensor responses for volatile organic compounds (acetone, ethanol, n-butanol and xylene) at the various concentrations under the different operating temperatures were studied. Under the operating temperature of 240 degrees C, the sensor has good response, linear correlation, repeatability and long-term stability. In particular, the 2.5% Sn/TiO2 nanoparticles show a high gas response with the highest response to 100 ppm VOCs (21.19). These values demonstrate the potential application of 2.5% Sn/TiO2 nanoparticles for VOCs detection. In addition, the mechanism related to advanced performance was studied and proposed.

The dielectric behavior of the samples, and the contribution of the grains and the grain boundary regions to the electric response of the samples were observed using impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 20 Hz to 2 MHz. The DC conduction behavior was studied by measuring current density J against electric field E. It was observed that the grains and grain boundaries both contribute equally to the variation in electric response caused by changing the dopant concentration of cobalt in MgAl2O4. The combined Z '' and M '' spectroscopic plots indicated the presence of small polaron hopping conduction in the grain region of the samples. Moreover, the 25% doped sample showed minimum conductivity among all samples, which was two orders of magnitude less than that of the pure sample.

Humans are fulfilling their needs by depleting natural resources. Currently, exploring plant species that can fulfill the life requirements of both humans and animals without degrading natural resources has become a major challenge. Therefore, research on underutilized crops is of high interest among plant scientists. Ramie, an ancient plant with a long history, is being researched because of its vigorous growth, high nutritional value and multipurpose applications in Textiles, livestock feed, environmental conservation and medicine. It can be cultivated in versatile conditions including tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. The present review article provides a detailed discussion on the multipurpose utilization and nutritional importance of ramie as well as potential applications and constraints, and the outlook for the future.

However, the long-term effect of this deposition on soil biodiversity and its ecological functions remains poorly understood. In this study, we established a 10-year-long field experiment examining the effect of simulated N deposition on soil bacterial diversity and litter decomposition processes in a subtropical Chinese fir forest. The N levels were 0 (control), 6, 12, and 24 g m(-2) yr(-1). Soil bacterial diversity was measured by high throughput sequencing analysis, while litter decomposition was investigated by a microcosm experiment with a reciprocal soil and litter design. Our long-term experimental results demonstrated that N addition significantly changed soil pH, NH4+ -N, available P and soil moisture; reduced soil bacterial diversity; and changed soil microbial community composition at the phyla and class levels. Meanwhile, the rate of litter decomposition decreased in treatments with high doses of N addition. The decreased soil pH and changes in understory plants were significantly correlated with the altered soil microbial diversity and community composition according to the structure equation model analysis. Our results showed that changes in soil microbial community composition (but not soil microbial diversity) mainly contributed to the decline in litter decomposition in higher doses of N addition. Our findings conclude that global change phenomena such as N deposition would depress both aboveand below-ground biodiversity and would strongly affect ecosystem functions and processes in subtropical forests.

We investigated the individual and interactive effects of drought and nitrogen addition on growth and leaf physiology of Pinus massoniana seedlings. Seedlings were grown in growth chambers with two soil water (i.e. well watered and drought stress) and two nitrogen conditions (i.e. 0 and 40 kg N hm(-2) a(-1)). Biomass accumulation and allocation, leaf relative water content (RWC), free leaf water content (FWC), leaf chlorophyll (Chl(a+b), Chl(a), Chl(b), Chl(a/b)), contents of carotenoid (Car), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline (Pro), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were examined throughout the entire experimental period. This study showed that the contents of MDA and Pro, SOD activity, root shoot ratio (R/S) and root mass ratio (RMR) were increased significantly in the drought treatment, while Chl(a+b), Chl(a), RWC and growth of seedlings were significantly decreased. In contrast, nitrogen addition had positive impacts on leaf chlorophyll content, leaf RWC and growth of seedlings. Leaf chlorophyll content had positive relationship with RWC irrespective of nitrogen supply, while MDA and Pro content had opposite trends. We also found that nitrogen addition could substantially ameliorate the negative impact of drought on P. massoniana, by increasing growth and limiting accumulation of MDA, Pro and SOD activity. This short term study suggests that current ambient nitrogen deposition in southern China may be helpful for establishment of P. massoniana seedlings in bare lands with limited water availability.

The effect of the flexible polyaromatic backbone, as well as the length, number and branching or linearity of the lateral chain on their self-assembly was investigated. The backbone flexibility led to the formation of structures intermediate between the well defined honeycombs of the rigid bolapolyphiles and the conventional flexible amphiphiles. T-shaped bolapolyphiles with one lateral chain occupied small volume (one branched chain or one short linear chain) display triangular honeycomb phases. Whereas T-shaped or pi-shaped bolapolyphiles with one or two lateral chain occupied larger volume (one longer linear or two linear chain) display square honeycomb phases with diffused or less defined cylinder wall structures. Further these compounds can self assemble into organogels in organic solvents. Their photophysical properties are affected greatly by the type of lateral chains, and they can act as chemosensors towards Fe3+.

The structure, morphology, and microwave absorption performances of the Fe3O4/PJBC composites were investigated in detail. Due to the porous structure and large interfaces between Fe3O4 and PJBC, the Fe3O4/PJBC composites show excellent microwave absorption performances. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of -39.5 dB is obtained for the Fe3O4/PJBC composites at the frequency of 6.4 GHz. When the thickness is only 1.6 mm, an effective absorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) for 5 GHz is achieved from 13.8 to 17.8 GHz. The excellent microwave absorption performances for the Fe3O4/PJBC composites are rooted in enhanced impedance matching, large interfaces, ionic polarization, eddy loss, natural resonance, and multiple reflection and scattering. Consequently, considering market applications and the cost, the Fe3O4/PJBC composite in this work can be a promising candidate for microwave absorber. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

COLI; ELONGATION; MECHANISM	Codon usage bias is a universal feature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and plays an important role in regulating gene expression levels. A major role of codon usage is thought to regulate protein expression levels by affecting mRNA translation efficiency, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. By analyzing ribosome profiling results, here we showed that codon usage regulates translation elongation rate and that rare codons are decoded more slowly than common codons in all codon families in Neurospora. Rare codons resulted in ribosome stalling in manners both dependent and independent of protein sequence context and caused premature translation termination. This mechanism was shown to be conserved in Drosophila cells. In both Neurospora and Drosophila cells, codon usage plays an important role in regulating mRNA translation efficiency. We found that the rare codon-dependent premature termination is mediated by the translation termination factor eRF1, which recognizes ribosomes stalled on rare sense codons. Silencing of eRF1 expression resulted in codon usage-dependent changes in protein expression. Together, these results establish a mechanism for how codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency.

In this paper, we consider variational principles in topological spaces. We adopt gauge-type functions on a topological space X and introduce the notion of the Cantor compatibility for X and gauge-type functions on X. In terms of the Cantor-compatibility, we provide strong variational principles on a topological space, which further extend both the Ekeland variational principle and the Borwein-Preiss smooth variational principle.

UJN-1 is composed of both Ag-9 clusters and Ag-5 subunits, of which the Ag-9 clusters are bonded with Ag-5 subunits by sharing the ditiocarb ligand to form a microporous 3,4-connected topological framework. The chemically reduced nano-sized derivative of UJN-1 exhibits highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) towards 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) signal molecules, which is ascribed to the porosity as well as the distribution of abundant crystalline Ag-0 active sites. This work sheds light on a new bottom-up approach to construct SERS-active silver(i)-cluster-based 3D materials by disulfur ligand stabilization.

Based on this reaction, a series of highly functionalized PMAPs were obtained through a novel cascade reaction accompanied by a decarboxylation mechanism. As a result, the pyridin-2-ylmethyl was successfully introduced in the target compounds, and a library of PMAPs were easily constructed using the cascade reaction described in this study. This protocol demonstrated that the most important feature was the decarboxylation reaction of the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)acetates 1, which can be used in the synthesis of pyridin-2-ylmethylsubstituted heterocycles, including pyrroles, pyridines, quinolones, and other heterocyclic compounds resembling those found in nature.

Ag nanoparticles (with an average size of 3-4 nm) were uniformly dispersed on the surface of SWCNT via the anchoring effect of PP6. PP6 provided a coordination environment between Ag and -PO32- groups in PP6, and there were the pi-pi interactions between SWCNT and benzene rings of PP6. The obtained hybrid nano-material Ag@PP6@SWCNT was characterized using UV-vis absorption spectrum, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Compared to commercial Pd/C and Ag@SWCNT catalysts, Ag@PP6@SWCNT exhibited higher catalytic activity for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction and methylene blue (MB) degradation, respectively. Moreover, because of the excellent supramolecular host-guest recognition capability of PP6, a sensitive and convenient electrochemical sensing platform for detecting paraquat (PQ) was constructed, and had potential applications in sensing highly toxic herbicides.

Herein we describe the first rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric ring-opening reaction of P-ylides utilizing oxabicyclic alkenes as the electrophilic partner. Various P-ylides including ester-, ketone- and amide-style P-ylides are all applicable. This asymmetric reaction occurs through the cleavage of two bridgehead C-O bonds and the formation of two C-C bonds, and oxabenzonorbornadienes are used as 1,4-biselectrophiles, thus providing access to benzonorcaradienes in good yields with high enantioselectivity and perfect diastereoselectivity. The present protocol also constitutes the first highly enantioselective direct catalytic asymmetric cyclopropanation of stabilized P-ylide nucleophiles.

The ORR has been associated with expensive noble metal catalysts that facilitate the O-2 adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent electron transfer. Single- or few-atom motifs based on earth-abundant transition metals, such as Fe, Co, and Mo, combined with nonmetallic elements, such as P, S, and N, embedded in a carbon-based matrix represent one of the most promising alternatives. Often these are referred to as single atom catalysts; however, the coordination number of the metal atom as well as the type and nearest neighbor configuration has a strong influence on the function of the active sites, and a more adequate term to describe them is metal-coordinated motifs. Despite intense research, their function and catalytic mechanism still puzzle researchers. They are not molecular systems with discrete energy states; neither can they fully be described by theories that are adapted for heterogeneous bulk catalysts. Here, recent results on single- and few-atom electrocatalyst motifs are reviewed with an emphasis on reports discussing the function and the mechanism of the active sites.

SYSTEMATICS, PRESERVATION AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF RADIODONTS FROM THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN, USA, DURING THE UPPER DYERAN (CAMBRIAN SERIES 2, STAGE 4)	PAPERS IN PALAEONTOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Radiodonta; Great Basin; Latham Shale; Pioche Formation; Anomalocaris; Ramskoeldia	BURGESS SHALE; PIOCHE FORMATION; ANOMALOCARIS; TRILOBITES; ARTHROPOD; LAGERSTATTE; AFFINITY; ANIMALS; NEVADA; RECORD	Anomalocaris, the most well-known genus of the diverse stem euarthropod group Radiodonta, was first reported over 100 years ago from the Burgess Shale (Canada). This large Cambrian apex predator was later treated as occurring in the southern Great Basin (California and Nevada, USA). We re-evaluate the systematic affinities of previously described material from the Pioche Formation, Nevada, and the Latham Shale, California, and describe the first radiodonts from the Pyramid Shale Member, Carrara Formation, California. Latham Shale (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 4, upper Dyeran) specimens previously assigned to Anomalocaris are reinterpreted as Ramskoeldia consimilis?, an amplectobeluid previously known only from the Chengjiang biota (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 3). Younger material from the Pioche and Carrara Formations (Series 2, Stage 4) is described as a new Anomalocaris species, A. magtuzbasis. This new species sheds light on the two-part structure of Anomalocaris ventral endites, a potentially important character for distinguishing species, and reveals a sequence of five disarticulation stages for frontal appendages. The oldest Hurdia from Laurentia is also reported from the Pioche Formation (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 4). A changeover in taxonomic composition of the Radiodonta in the southern Great Basin is recognized: Anomalocaris replaces Ramskoeldia in the upper Dyeran, but it is not associated with a replacement of local olenelloid trilobites or seen in radiodonts elsewhere in Laurentia. These new data, combined with a summary of known radiodont occurrences, suggest that Anomalocaris species did not have large geographical distributions, when compared with other radiodonts such as Hurdia and Caryosyntrips.

Mountain regions provide an excellent opportunity to understand how closely related species may adapt to the conditions that rapidly change with elevation. We investigated the morphological and physiological responses of two Himalayan alpine gingers (Roscoea alpina and R. purpurea) along two different vertical transects of 400 m, R. purpurea between 2,174-2,574 m a.s.l and R. alpina between 2,675-3,079 m a.s.l. We measured the variables of plant height, leaf length, leaf area, specific leaf area, and stomata density at five plots, along the vertical transect at an elevational gap of ca. 100 m. Results revealed that with increased elevation plant height, and leaf area decreased while stomata density increased, whereas changes in specific leaf area, were not correlated with the elevation. Our results reveal that these alpine gingers undergo local adaptation by modifying their plant height, leaf area and stomata density in response to the varying selection pressure associated with the elevational gradient. Thus, the findings of this research provide valuable information on how a narrow range of elevational gradient affects the herbaceous plants at the alpine habitat of the Himalayas.

Confined electron states in two-dimensional HgTe in magnetic field: Quantum dot versus quantum ring behavior	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SIZE; EMISSION; GROWTH; ARRAYS; SHAPE	We investigate the electron states and optical absorption in square- and hexagonal-shaped two-dimensional (2D) HgTe quantum dots and quantum rings in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The electronic structure is modeled by means of the sp(3)d(5)s* tight-binding method within the nearest-neighbor approximation. Both bulklike and edge states appear in the energy spectrum. The bulklike states in quantum rings exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in magnetic field, whereas no such oscillations are found in quantum dots, which is ascribed to the different topology of the two systems. When magnetic field varies, all the edge states in square quantum dots appear as quasibands composed of almost fully flat levels, whereas some edge states in quantum rings are found to oscillate with magnetic field. However, the edge states in hexagonal quantum dots are localized like in rings. The absorption spectra of all the structures consist of numerous absorption lines, which substantially overlap even for small line broadening. The absorption lines in the infrared are found to originate from transitions between edge states. It is shown that the magnetic field can be used to efficiently tune the optical absorption of HgTe 2D quantum dot and quantum ring systems.

Leucogranites in Yuanyang, Southeast Yunnan province, are composed of quartz (similar to 30%), alkali feldspar (similar to 45%), plagioclase (similar to 5%), muscovite (similar to 13%) and biotite (similar to 3%) and other minor silicate minerals (similar to 3%, garnet, tourmaline). U-Pb dating of zircon from leucogranites yields a weighted mean age of 27.4 +/- 0.5 Ma, suggesting a late Oligocene anatexis event. These leucogranites are strongly peraluminous with A/CNK values of 1.01-1.19 and have high SiO2 (73.3-77.0 wt%) and K2O + Na2O (7.87-10.08 wt%), and low CaO (0.41-0.99 wt%), MgO (0.04-0.21 wt%), TiO2 (0.01-0.06 wt %) and Fe2O3T. (0.44-0.86 wt%) contents. They are geochemically similar to Himalayan leucogranites and are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (e.g. Rb), and depleted in high-field-strength elements (e.g. Nb, Zr, and Hf). They have low Zr/Hf (12.3-22.5) and Nb/Ta (2.54-12.73) with negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* =0.05-0.45), indicative of extensive fractional crystallization of plagioclase and zircon. In addition, these rocks have low Sr-87/Sr-86 (t) (0.7072-0.7111), high epsilon(Nd) (t) (-1.53 to -3.61). They contain zircon grains with epsilon(Hf) (-5 to +1.8) and old two-stage Hf model ages of 1.24-1.02 Ga, implying that they were probably derived from partial melting of amphibolite (old crustal material) within the lower crust. In combination with previous studies of metamorphism of the ASRR shear zone, our study demonstrates that the leucogranites may have been generated in a highly dynamic setting involving both extrusion and extension that defined the beginning of left-lateral slip-strike movement of the ASRR shear zone at 27 Ma.

Little is known about the respective contributions of soil variables to these changes in bacterial communities. For this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to measure the change in bacterial community compositions under the effects of soil variables across three land-use types (i.e., reference, degraded, and agricultural wetlands) in the Napahai plateau. Compared with the reference wetland, a pronounced decrease (1.5-5.3 times) in soil water content, soil organic matter, and total and available nitrogen was observed in degraded and agricultural wetlands. However, a conspicuous increase (1.3-5.7 times) was found for the total and available phosphorus, and potassium. Land use also strongly affected the taxonomic composition of soil bacterial assemblages, changing the normalized ratio of Acidobacteria to Proteobacteia, or to delta-proteobacteia. Soil properties had different contributions to the variations in abundance composition of bacterial community. Soil available phosphorus and potassium were the best predictors for changes in bacterial community composition, explaining 80.9% and 82% of the variations, respectively. In contrast, soil organic matter, carbon/nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total and available nitrogen accounted for 58.7-72.7% of the variations in bacterial community composition. Soil pH (24.6%) and soil water content (40.4%) had a minor contribution. Our data suggested that the compositional alterations of microbial communities following land-use change were likely realized through modifications in the availability of primary soil nutrients in the Napahai plateau wetlands.

It is interesting how invasive plants interact with the local soil microbial community and establish the soil bacterial community in the endosphere of these plants in the short term. In this study, we compared the bacterial community in the rhizosphere with that in the root endosphere of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the roots of A. adenophora selectively accumulated the genera Clostridium and Enterobacter, which are rarely distributed in the rhizosphere. This selective accumulation caused a switch in the bacterial composition at the phylum level from Bacteroidetes predominant in the rhizosphere to Proteobacteria dominant in the root endosphere of A. adenophora. Our data indicated the potential existence of a highly conserved signal recognition in which hosts, either invasive or native, enrich the endosphere bacteria, such as Clostridium, Enterobacter, etc., from the rhizosphere. Moreover, the accumulated bacteria were physiologically and genetically different at the strain level and displayed distinct roles in growth between invasive and native plants. The assembly of the bacterial community in the roots may be an advantageous strategy for A. adenophora in competition with native plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we extend the assumption of a constant dispersion parameter (homogeneity) to varying dispersion parameter (heterogeneity) in Simplex regression model, and present the B-spline to approximate the smoothing unknown function within the Bayesian framework. A hybrid algorithm combining the block Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented for sampling observations from the posterior distribution. The procedures for computing model comparison criteria such as conditional predictive ordinate statistic, deviance information criterion, and averaged mean squared error are presented. Also, we develop a computationally feasible Bayesian case-deletion influence measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Several simulation studies and a real example are employed to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

But, in many applications, these assumptions may be questionable because the true distributions of heterogeneity parameters are usually unknown. To this end, this paper relaxes these assumptions imposed on heterogeneity parameters to develop a nonparametric approach to purchase model and lifetime model, in which unknown distributions of heterogeneity parameters are approximated by a truncated Dirichlet process prior. A nonparametric empirical Bayesian method is developed to obtain Bayesian estimations of unknown parameters in the proposed nonparametric models. The blocked Gibbs sampler is presented to draw observations required for Bayesian inference from the corresponding posterior distributions of the components of parameters. Extensive simulation studies and a CDNOW data set are presented to illustrate the newly developed methodologies.

However, the post-dissemination role of the actin cytoskeleton dysregulation is poorly understood. Here, we report that fascin, an actin-bundling protein, promotes lung cancer metastatic colonization by augmenting metabolic stress resistance and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Fascin is directly recruited to mitochondria under metabolic stress to stabilize mitochondrial actin filaments (mtF-actin). Using unbiased metabolomics and proteomics approaches, we discovered that fascin-mediated mtF-actin remodeling promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS by increasing the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I. Mechanistically, fascin and mtF-actin control the homeostasis of mtDNA to promote mitochondrial OXPHOS. The disruption of mtF-actin abrogates fascin-mediated lung cancer metastasis. Conversely, restoration of mitochondrial respiration by using yeast NDI1 in fascin-depleted cancer cells is able to rescue lung metastasis. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated actin cytoskeleton in metastatic lung cancer could be targeted to rewire mitochondrial metabolism and to prevent metastatic recurrence.

J	Zeng, HD; Yan, DH				Zeng, Houdun; Yan, Dahai			Using the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background to Constrain the Hubble Constant and Matter Density of the Universe	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: jets; gamma rays: diffuse background; gamma rays: galaxies	LIGHT	The attenuation produced by extragalactic background light (EBL) in gamma-ray spectra of blazars has been used to constrain the Hubble constant (H-0) and matter density (Omega(m)) of the universe. We propose to estimate H-0 and Omega(m) using the well-measured > 10 GeV extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). This suggestion is based on the fact that the > 10 GeV EGB is totally explained by the emissions from blazars, and an EBL-absorption cutoff occurs at similar to 50 GeV in the EGB spectrum. We fit the > 10 GeV EGB data with modeled EGB spectrum. This results in H-0 64.9(-4.3)(+4.6) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) and Omega(m) = 0.31(-0.14)(+0.13). Note that the uncertainties may be underestimated due to the limit of our realization for EBL model. H-0 and Omega(m) are degenerate in our method. Independent determination of Omega(m) by other methods would improve the constraint on H-0.

Depending on their electrode configurations, FSESDs can contain five differently structured electrodes, including parallel fiber electrodes (PFEs), twisted fiber electrodes (TFDs), wrapped fiber electrodes (WFEs), coaxial fiber devices (CFEs), and rolled electrodes (REs). Various rational methods have been devised to incorporate these fiber-shaped electrodes into multifunctional FSESDs, including fiber-shaped supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-air batteries, zinc-air batteries, and aluminum-air batteries. Although significant progress has been made in FSESDs, it remains a major challenge to make high-performance fiber-shaped devices at low cost. A focused and critical review of the recent advancements in fiber-shaped supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries is provided here. The pros and cons for each of the aforementioned electrode configurations and FSESDs are discussed, along with current challenges and future opportunities for FSESDs.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthases (HCSs) are responsible for beta-alkylation of the growing polyketide intermediates in AT-less type I PKSs. In this study, we discovered a large group of HCSs, closely associated with the characterized and orphan AT-less type I PKSs through in silico genome mining, sequence and genome neighbourhood network analyses. Using HCS-based probes, the survey of 1207 in-house strains and 18 soil samples from different geographic locations revealed the vast diversity of HCS-containing AT-less type I PKSs. The presence of HCSs in many AT-less type I PKSs suggests their co-evolutionary relationship. This study provides a new probe to study the abundance and diversity of AT-less type I PKSs in the environment and microbial strain collections. Our study should inspire future efforts to discover new polyketide natural products from AT-less type I PKSs.

Some members have been identified in partial ascomycetes. In this study, the APSES protein StuA (AoStuA) of the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora was characterized. Compared with the wild-type (WT) strain, three Delta AoStuA mutants grew relatively slowly, displayed a 96% reduction in sporulation capacity and a delay in conidial germination. The reduced sporulation capacity correlated with transcriptional repression of several sporulation-related genes. The mutants were also more sensitive to chemical stressors than the WT strain. Importantly, the mutants were unable to produce mycelial traps for nematode predation. Moreover, peroxisomes and Woronin bodies were abundant in the WT cells but hardly found in the cells of those mutants. The lack of such organelles correlated with transcriptional repression of some genes involved in the biogenesis of peroxisomes and Woronin bodies. The transcript levels of several genes involved in the cAMP/PKA signalling pathway were also significantly reduced in the mutants versus the WT strain, implicating a regulatory role of AoStuA in the transcription of genes involved in the cAMP/PKA signalling pathway that regulates an array of cellular processes and events. In particular, AoStuA is indispensable for A. oligospora trap formation and virulence.

However, the fabrication of these semiconductor SERS-active substrates commonly requires complicated processes, and these methods normally result in non-uniform and isolated particles/flakes, which have fundamental difficulties in meeting the practical needs in high performance and reliable SERS substrates. Herein, we demonstrate that SnSe2 nanoplate arrays (NPAs) via self-assembled growth can serve as uniform, highly sensitive and reliable SERS substrates. The cavity formed by the SnSe2 NPAs can trap light efficiently (similar to 96%) and thus improve the enhancement factor. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the charge-transfer process and enhanced light trapping, the resulting SERS substrates based on pure SnSe2 NPAs show an ultralow detection limit (1 x 10(-12) M), a high enhancement factor (6.33 x 10(6)) and excellent uniformity (relative standard deviations down to 7.7%), demonstrating one of the highest sensitivities amongst the reported semiconductor SERS substrates. Furthermore, the effects of different SnSe2 structural configurations (planar vs. cavity), the height and tilt angle of the SnSe2 NPAs on the performance of SERS detection are systematically investigated. It is discovered that the SERS performance is strongly dependent on both the light-trapping ability and the absorption loss. We believe that our results not only provide an effective strategy to obtain tunable, uniform and high performance SERS substrates, but also lead to further understanding of designing 3D light trapping architectures.

For this purpose, this work adopted autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) through a dynamic simulation process. The estimation outcomes indicate that the nexus of the economic growth and energy consumption are diversified in fossil energy consumption and renewable consumption, respectively. The results are consistent with the fact that renewable energy is an alternative to fossil fuels, and traditional energy is still in the dominant position. This work is expected to serve as a first-hand examination on Lancang-Mekong Cooperation by adding innovative perspectives into existing research. Meanwhile, policy implications will also be discussed in this work.

These silver CPs show different one- and two-dimensional topologies including cross-helical chains, planar network, and parallel helical chains for Ag1-iah, Ag2-iah, and Ag3-iah, respectively. The combination of experimental and computational results reveals the critical role in the space distribution of the coordination site of silver clusters and ligands in controlling the silver CPs' dimensionality and packing arrangement and modulating the optical properties and stability. Luminescent investigations reveal that Ag3-iah can selectively detect dichloromethane or trichloromethane in tetrachloromethane. These silver CPs provide a good model to study the influence of the space distribution of the coordination site of ligands on their packing arrangement and properties.

The CQDs attached by N, S, and P elements are synthesized via pyrolysis of a mixture of citric acid and NH3H2O, H2SO4, and H3PO4, respectively. Thus, part of -COOH at the edges of CQDs can be converted into -C=O and functional groups such as -NH2, -SO2, -HSO3, and -H2PO4 can connect to the carbon bonds. We find that the formation of the N/S/P-CQDs can reduce the amount of -COOH that attaches to the edges of sp(2)-conjugated pi-domains located at centers of these CQDs. This effect can result in the reduction of the non-radiative recombination for electronic transition in these CQDs. As a result, the quantum yield (QY) for fluorescence from the CQDs can be efficiently enhanced. We demonstrate experimentally that the QYs for N/S/P-CQDs can reach up to 18.7%, 29.7%, and 10.3%, respectively, in comparison to 9% for these without functional group modulation. This work can provide a practical experimental approach in improving the optical properties of fluorescent CQDs.

The current ecological compensation standards (ECS) do not well reflect the differences in ecological, social, and economic development. Thus, we took a typical urbanization area (the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou region) in China as an example, because of its prominent contradiction between rapid socio-economic development and fragile ecosystem. Combined with the ecological, economic, and social conditions, the methods of ecosystem service value (ESV) evaluation, cluster analysis, and scenario analysis were used to propose an optimized spatial zoning method and optimal development scenario. Then, the ECS by different zones were determined by using ESV assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and contingent valuation method. The results showed that (1) the regions were divided into two categories, with a total of four zones: ESV output areas (synergetic development zones (SDZ) and ecological conservation zones (ECZ)) and ESV input areas (ecological degradation zones (EDegZ) and economic development zones (EDevZ)); (2) among five scenarios, the best development mode in the future was the protection and development scenario, which was consistent with the existing planning; and (3) the ECS for the SDZ should be paid about 1.94 billion Yuan/year, the ECZ should be paid about 0.80 billion Yuan/year, the ECS for the EDegZ should pay about 2.20-2.25 million Yuan/year, and the EDevZ should pay about 0.06-7.33 million Yuan/year. By feasibility analysis, the ESV input areas were fully capable of inter-regional compensation, which could promote the effective purchase of ecological services. The developed evaluation framework of ECS in this study can accurately provide a scientific basis for the determination of ecological compensation regulations and policies in the future.

Firstly, to avoid the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication, we decompose QVHHNNs into an equivalent real-valued system. Secondly, we use the Banach fixed point theorem to obtain the existence of almost automorphic solutions of QVHHNNs. Thirdly, by designing a novel state-feedback controller and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we obtain that the drive-response structure of QVHHNNs with almost automorphic coefficients can realize the exponential synchronization. Our results are completely new. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our results.

In this work, Zn-doped gamma-Al2O3 supported Au nanoparticles was demonstrated as highly active and selective heterogeneous catalyst for a series of imine productions with good to excellent yields, from alcohols and amines via direct oxidative coupling under air atmosphere without extra base additives. Various physicochemical techniques, including ICP-MS, XRD, N-2 physisorption, TEM, XPS and CO2-/NH3-TPD, were used to study the properties of the catalysts. Well-dispersed Au-0 nanoparticles with a mean size of ca. 2.9 nm were found highly effective in activating alcohols in the presence of reactive amines. The amount of Zn2+ dopant and the calcination temperature of support during catalyst preparation showed crucial impact on tuning the intrinsic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (i.e., the rate-determining step for the model reaction), which was disclosed to be related with the active surface oxygen species and the acidic-basic property of support. The 0.4% Au/Zn0.02Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 400 degrees C exhibited the highest TOF (39.1 h(-1)) at 60 degrees C based on a >99% yield to benzylideneaniline among all the ever-reported Au-based catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst could afford 98% yield to benzylideneaniline at only 30 degrees C and work effectively for the gram-scale synthesis. It also showed considerable stability after five consecutive recycling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the absence of a sequenced avocado reference genome has hindered investigations of secondary metabolism. For next-generation high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we obtained 365,615,152 and 348,623,402 clean reads as well as 109.13 and 104.10 Gb of sequencing data for avocado mesocarp and seed, respectively, during five developmental stages. High-quality reads were assembled into 100,837 unigenes with an average length of 847.40 bp (N50 = 1725 bp). Additionally, 16,903 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, 17 of which were related to carotenoid biosynthesis. The expression levels of most of these 17 DEGs were higher in the mesocarp than in the seed during five developmental stages. In this study, the avocado mesocarp and seed transcriptome were also sequenced using single-molecule long-read sequencing to acquired 25.79 and 17.67 Gb clean data, respectively. We identified 233,014 and 238,219 consensus isoforms in avocado mesocarp and seed, respectively. Furthermore, 104 and 59 isoforms were found to correspond to the putative 11 carotenoid biosynthetic-related genes in the avocado mesocarp and seed, respectively. The isoform numbers of 10 out of the putative 11 genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were higher in the mesocarp than those in the seed. Besides, alpha- and beta-carotene contents in the avocado mesocarp and seed during five developmental stages were also measured, and they were higher in the mesocarp than in the seed, which validated the results of transcriptome profiling. Gene expression changes and the associated variations in gene dosage could influence carotenoid biosynthesis. These results will help to further elucidate carotenoid biosynthesis in avocado.

China has been implementing numerous massive ecological sustainability and protected area (ES&PA) programs across the entire country. These programs have greatly restored degraded ecological environments, improved provisions of critical ecosystem services and increased rural livelihoods. However, despite the general improvements in environmental quality, the trend of rapid biodiversity loss has not been significantly reduced. We found that most of the current ES&PA programs lack explicit biodiversity goals, and thus have limited contributions to the conservation of biodiversity. Given the limited resources available for and huge investments associated with these programs, achieving greater biodiversity gains under them is the most cost-effective way to conserve biodiversity. We recommend six strategies for strengthening the country's biodiversity conservation, that is, strengthening biodiversity in ES&PA programs, PAs as the core, integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services, delivering effective monitoring, broad inclusiveness of stakeholders and mainstreaming biodiversity. These strategies also highlight China's priorities for achieving significant progresses toward the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, and should be important options for developing China's post-2020 biodiversity framework.

In this study, a Cr(VI)-resistant bacterial strain, DC-B3, which was identified as Pseudomonas sp. by 16S rDNA gene sequencing, was isolated from heavy metal-contaminated mine soil, and its performance in Cr(VI) removal from wastewater in terms of Cr(VI) reduction and total Cr adsorption was assessed. This strain exhibited a high capability to reduce Cr(VI) to less toxic Cr(III) without the addition of an external electron donor at low pH (2.0). The Cr(VI) reduction capacity and rate both increased linearly with increasing Cr(VI) concentration, with a reduction capacity of 32.0 mg Cr(VI)center dot g(-1) achieved at an initial concentration of 135.0 mg L-1 over 75 h. In addition, 41.0% of the total Cr was removed from the solution by biosorption, and equilibrium was reached within approximately 5 h. The total Cr sorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Desorption assays indicated that NaOH was the most efficient agent for total Cr desorption, and Cr(VI) and generated Cr(III) were both loaded on the DC-B3 biomass. The bacterial cells after Cr treatment were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. Strain DC-B3 showed high potential for possible application in the remediation of Cr(VI) contamination in mine areas.

The larvae of wood-boring beetles hatch and excavate tunnels in wood during their development. The origin and evolutionary history of this life habit, however, remain poorly understood to date, as the fossil record is scarce. We present new silicified conifer wood specimens containing complex borings from the lowermost Permian Manebach Formation of the Thuringian Forest Basin in central Germany and the lower Permian Donnersberg Formation of the Saar-Nahe Basin in southwestern Germany. Additionally, this distinctive type of wood boring is recorded from the Carboniferous/Permian of the Czech Republic, Poland and China. For these borings, the new fodinichnion or agrichnion Pectichnus multicylindricus igen. et isp. nov. is established. It is characterised by several parallel cylindrical tunnels in a longitudinal arrangement, branching from a tangential primary tunnel oriented perpendicularly. The borings contain frass as coprolites made up of undigested wood cells. The conifer trees responded to the borings with callus production that subsequently filled or enclosed the tunnels. This is the earliest record of this specific life habit of ancient insects. The novel wood-boring strategy required structural modification and physiological adaptation; it probably emerged when insect diversity expanded considerably as terrestrial environments changed dramatically.

The results indicate that the synthesis process is optimal when hydrothermal reaction time, temperature and the molar ratio of Mn2+/Co2+ are 10 h, 100 degrees Cand 1:3, respectively. Under this condition, Mn(x)Co(3-)xO(4) possesses an optimal electrocatalytic performance for OER. Moreover, after treated in the mixed alkali solution of 1 M NaBH4 and 3 M NaOH, the catalytic performance of MnxCo3-xO4 for OER has been enhanced furtherly. The unique architecture and its corresponding morphology after alkalization treatment, such as highly exposed active sites and high surface roughness, are mainly responsible for its excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER process.

Here we report 3-4% NaCl reducing the antimicrobial activity of Lb. plantarum strain YM-4-3, owing to the decrease of bacterial growth, plantaricin activity and expression levels of plantaricin biosynthesis-related genes (PBGs). Meanwhile, 1% NaCl promoted slightly the growth of YM-4-3 and up-regulated the expression of PBGs to the greatest level. The results from a spoilage experiment of fermented soybean products revealed that the 1% NaCl and YM-4-3 treatment group had the longest shelf life representing the minimum number of pathogenic bacteria and the lowest degree of mildew. Therefore, a combination of Lb. plantarum with a low concentration of salt, such as 1% NaCl, is a recommended condition for preparing fermented foods.

First, each class of the training data was preprocessed by Procrustes analysis. Second, the new test data were aligned with each class of the training data by Procrustes analysis. Then, all the data were reduced to a low-dimensional space using Fisher discriminant analysis. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the test data and the training data after the Procrustes analysis was calculated, and the class recognition was achieved based on the discriminant principle of Fisher discriminant analysis. Two case studies show that the proposed Procrustes analysis-based Fisher discriminant analysis is superior to the traditional method based on Fisher discriminant analysis, and it can be used for fault recognition in a new and efficient way.

However, the microbial diversity and community composition of alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains remain largely unknown. Therefore, based on the Illumina MiSeq platform, high-throughput sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on 15 alpine lake sediments collected at different locations in the Hengduan Mountains. The abundance-based coverage estimate (ACE), Chao1, and Shannon indices indicated that the microbial abundance and diversity of these sediments were high. There are some differences in the composition of microbial communities among sediments. However, in general, Proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion of all sediments (22.3%-67.6%) and was the dominant phylum. Followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. In addition, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) interactions network had modular structures and suggested more cooperation than competition in the microbial community. Besides, we also found that temperature has a significant contribution to the sample-environment relationship. This study revealed the diversity and composition of microbial communities in alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains, and describe the correlation between microbial community structure and different environmental variables.

Here we present whole-rock major and trace elements and Nd-Hf isotopic data for felsic volcanic rocks from the Bikou Group. These ca. 820-810 Ma volcanic rocks consist of dacite and rhyolite with SiO2 ranging from 64.4 to 77.0 wt%. Most rocks show decreasing P2O5 with increasing SiO2 and Th and have I-type granite affinities (metaluminous volcanic rocks). However, four rhyolites from the lower part of the Bikou Group show A-type granite affinities (alkaline rhyolites), characterized by high 10,000*Ga/Al and FeOt/(FeOt + MgO) ratios and high (Zr + Nb + Ce + Y) contents. The felsic volcanic rocks commonly have relatively high Zr saturation temperature (up to 960 degrees C) and most of the felsic volcanic rocks have epsilon(Nd) (t) and epsilon(Hf) (t) values lower than the contemporaneous basalts in the Bikou Group, but higher than the basement rocks in the study area. Among them, four alkaline rhyolites have epsilon(Nd) (t) and epsilon(Hf) (t) values higher than the metaluminous volcanic rocks in the lower Bikou Group. We propose that the metaluminous volcanic rocks were likely produced by partial melting of newly underplated basaltic crust, with involvement of different proportions of basement rocks, whereas a two-stage model is proposed for the formation of the alkaline rhyolites, i.e. partial melting of newly underplated basaltic crust forming early granitoids, followed by low pressure partial melting of these granitoids to generate the alkaline rhyolitic magma. Combined with previous studies, the bimodal occurrence of volcanic rocks within the Bikou Group, and the A-type granite affinity of some rhyolites, as well as the presence of ocean island (OIB)-type basalts in the upper part of Bikou Group, suggest an extensional setting. This is consistent with opening of the Kangdian rift basin to the southwest at this time. We thus propose that the ca. 820-810 Ma Bikou bimodal volcanic rocks formed in response to the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent.

Environment main effects accounted for 25.7% of the total sum of squares (SS), with genotype 33.8% and GxE 37.7%. Cluster analysis identified 6 genotype x 6 environment groups, which accounted for 77.9% of the GxE-SS. Principal component axes 1, 2 and 3 accounted for 54.7%, 25.1% and 9.4% of the GxE-SS, respectively, with PCA1 indicating yield potential, PCA2 performance over ratoon cycles, and PCA3 ratoon percentage. Environment groups differed in yield potential, which related to site favourability and whether it was low or high in the ratoon cycle. Genotype groups differed in yield potential and how well they performed in higher ratoon cycles. The medium-maturity (125 days) seasonally-replanted annual rice check BN21 was highest yielding (6.13 t ha(-1)). Perennial rice PR23 was high yielding and stable (5.25 t ha(-1)), with earlier maturity (119 days) and strong regrowth (82%). Ratooned annual rice RD23 was high yielding in original crops but poor yielding in ratoon crops, with a low ratoon percentage (16.5%). Similarly, perennial Bt71 and ratooned BN21 were high yielding in original crops and low-cycle ratoons under favourable conditions, but yielded poorly in high-cycle ratoons and less favourable conditions, with moderate regrowth (59.6%). Despite strong regrowth (77.5%), perennials 264 and Bt69 had low yield, as did perennial 139A and mutant TZ, and both these groups were late maturity. A combination of high yield potential, strong regrowth and earlier maturity resulted in higher performance of perennial rice over environments and regrowth cycles, with PR23 outstanding, and able to perform similarly to the seasonally-replanted annual check, BN21, over up to six growth cycles. Ratoon performance and trade-offs need to be examined further.

The agonists and inhibitors of ROR gamma t are potential agents for tumor immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases, respectively, and sometimes share similar scaffolds. Although the widely distributed triterpenoid ursolic acid (UA) has been identified as a ROR gamma t inhibitor, the report of a triterpenoid ROR gamma t agonist is still absent. By screening an in-house triterpenoid library, we uncovered a novel ROR gamma t agonist, betulinaldehyde (1), together with an inhibitor (2, 3 beta, 28-Dihydroxy-lupan-29-oic acid). Compound 1 showed a good ROR gamma t activating effect with the EC50 of 11.4 mu M in Alpha Screen assay, and altered the thermal stability of ROR gamma t by directly binding to the protein in vitro. Combined with the SPR assay, the Kd value of compound 1 was examined as 2.99 mu M. The modulation mechanism of triterpenoid agonists and inhibitors were discussed by molecular docking. Herein, we firstly discovered compound 1 as a triterpenoid agonist of ROR gamma t. The co-distribution of triterpenoid ROR gamma t agonist and inhibitors in the same plant, might be related to the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous bioactivity of the plant extract.

The organism had chemotaxonomic and morphological properties consistent with its classification in the genus Streptomyces. Strain Z022(T) showed high similarity value to Streptomyces lucensis NBRC 13056(T) (98.87 %) and S. achromogenes subsp. achromogenes NBRC 12735(T) (98.68 %) based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Z022(T) based on the genome sequence was 72.16 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain Z022(T) and strain Streptomyces lucensis NBRC 13056(T) was 23.7 +/- 1.3% and significantly lower than 70 %. Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain Z022(T) possessed MK-9 (H-8) and MK-9(H-6) as the predominant menaquinone, LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and galactose, glucose, xylose and ribose as whole cell sugars. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were the predominant polar lipids; anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, and anteiso-C-17:0 were the major fatty acids. On the basis of these genotypic and phenotypic data, it is proposed that isolate Z022(T) (=JCM 31053(T)=CGMCC 4.7273(T)) should be classified in the genus Streptomyces as Streptomyces dangxiongensis sp. nov.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						DSM 7029; Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov.; polyphasic taxonomy; genome	GEN.-NOV.; GLIDOBACTIN-A; HETEROLOGOUS PRODUCTION; THERMOPHILIC BACTERIUM; ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS; MINOR COMPONENTS; CLASSIFICATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; SEQUENCES; STRAINS	Strain DSM 7029, isolated from a soil sample in Greece, can produce antitumour glidobactins, and has been found, as a heterologous host, to produce useful nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase hybrid molecules known as epothilones. This strain was originally named 'Polyangium brachysporum' of the family Polyangiaceae and the order Myxococcales. However, phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DSM 7029 indicated that it was clustered with members of Schlegelella. Significant growth occurred at 25-42 degrees C, pH 5.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-0.2% (w/v) NaCl. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-8. The major fatty acids were C-16 : 1 omega 7c/C-16 : 1 omega 6c, C-16 : 0 and C-18 : 1 omega 7c. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 67.51 mol%. The strain was clearly distinguishable from other neighbouring Schlegelella members and genera Caldimonas and Zhizhongheella, using phylogenetic analysis, fatty acid composition data and a range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and genome analysis. Therefore, strain DSM 7029 represents a novel species of the genus Schlegelella, for which the name Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov. is proposed.

Lines of HC3N J= 2-1, HC5N J= 6-5, HC7N J= 14-13, 15-14, 16-15, and C3S J= 3-2 were detected in all the targets except in the outflow source L1660 and the starless dust core Lupus I-3/4. The column densities of nitrogen-bearing species range from 10(12) to 10(14) cm(-2) and those of C3S are about 10(12) cm(-2). Two outflow sources, I20582+7724 and L1221, could be identified as new carbon-chain-producing regions. Four of the Lupus I dust cores are newly identified as early quiescent and dark carbon-chain-producing regions similar to Lup I-6, which together with the WCCC source, Lup I-1, indicate that carbon-chain-producing regions are popular in Lupus I which can be regard as a Taurus-like molecular cloud complex in our Galaxy. The column densities of C3S are larger than those of HC7N in the three outflow sources I20582, L1221, and L1251A. Shocked carbon-chain chemistry is proposed to explain the abnormal high abundances of C3S compared with those of nitrogen-bearing CCMs. Gas-grain chemical models support the idea that shocks can fuel the environment of those sources with enough S+ thus driving the generation of S-bearing CCMs.	[Wu, Yuefang; Liu, Xunchuan; Lin, Lianghao; Zhang, Chao] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuefang; Liu, Xunchuan; Zhang, Chao; Zhang, Tianwei] Peking Univ, Kavili Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi; Shen, Zhiqiang; Li, Juan; Wang, Junzhi; Liu, Qinghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi] GuangZhou Univ, Ctr Astrophys, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lianghao] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Astron & Space Sci, 96 Jinzhai Rd, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lianghao] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, 8 Yuanhua Rd, Nanjing 210034, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lianghao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Radio Astron, 8 Yuanhua Rd, Nanjing 210034, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jinghua; Zhu, Lei; Li, Di] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chao; Qin, Sheng-Li] Yunnan Univ, Dept Astron, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tie; Kim, Kee-Tae] Korea Astron & Space Sci Inst, 776 Daedeokdae Ro, Daejeon 34055, South Korea; [Liu, Tie] East Asian Observ, 660 North Aohoku Pl, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Liu, Hongli] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Shatin, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongli] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Av Esteban Iturra S-N,Dist Univ 2120000,160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Madones, Diego] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Casilla 36-D, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Madones, Diego] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, Ctr Astrochem Studies, Giessenbachstr 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Inostroza, Natalia] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Nucleo Astroquim Astrofis, Av Pedro de Valdivia 425, Providencia, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Henkel, Christian] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, Hugel 69, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Henkel, Christian] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Astron Dept, POB 80203, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Henkel, Christian; Esimbek, Jarken] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Astron Observ, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Li, Di] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Radio Astron, Nanjing 210034, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Di] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Esimbek, Jarken] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Radio Astron, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China	Wu, YF (reprint author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Wu, YF (reprint author), Peking Univ, Kavili Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.	ywu@pku.edu.cn			National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0402600]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11433008, 11373009, 11503035, 11573036, U1631237]; China Ministry of Science and Technology under State Key Development Program for Basic Research [2012CB821800]; Top Talents Program of Yunnan Province [2015HA030]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [Basal AFB-170002];  [CONICYT/PCI/REDI170243]	We are grateful to the staff of SHAO and PMO Qinghai Station.

Three-dimensional dust mapping of 12 supernovae remnants in the Galactic anticentre	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						dust; extinction; ISM: supernova remnants; ISM: clouds	POLARIZATION OBSERVATIONS; RAY-EMISSION; RADIO; GAS; DISCOVERY; CONTINUUM; IC-443; CO; OH; EXTINCTION	We present three-dimensional (3D) dust mapping of 12 supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galactic anticentre (Galactic longitude l between 150 degrees and 21 degrees) based on a recent 3D interstellar extinction map. The dust distribution of the regions, which cover the full extents in the radio continuum for the individual SNRs, is discussed. Four SNRs show significant spatial coincidences between molecular clouds (MCs) revealed from the 3D extinction mapping and the corresponding radio features. The results confirm the interactions between these SNRs and their surrounding MCs. Based on these correlations, we provide new distance estimates of the four SNRs, G189.1+3.0 (IC443, d = 1729(-94)(+116) pc), G190.9-2.2 (d = 1036(-81)(+17) pc), G205.5+0.5 (d = 941(-94)(+96) or 1257(-101)(+92) pc), and G213.0-0.6 (d = 1146(-80)(+79) pc). In addition, we find indirect evidences of potential interactions between SNRs and MCs for three other SNRs. New distance constraints arc also given for these three SNRs.	[Yu, Bin; Jiang, B.

The major differences between these two models are magnetic field structures, gamma-ray production sites, and radiation mechanisms. In the models, gamma-ray light curves of these MSPs are calculated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to pick best-fitting model parameters. Our results indicate that (1) both models can reproduce observed double-peak structures of the MSPs well, for most MSPs, a relatively large magnetic inclination angle (alpha similar to 50 degrees-90 degrees) and small viewing angle (zeta similar to 30 degrees-90 degrees) are obtained in the OG model, but a relatively small alpha is an element of (20 degrees, 60 degrees) and large zeta is an element of(70 degrees, 150 degrees) in the SW model; (2) phase-averaged spectra, cut-off energy, and gamma-ray luminosity calculated in both models are consistent with observed those by Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT). Therefore, it may be concluded that the (OG and the SW models for describing high-energy emissions of MSPs cannot he ruled out at present, and further studies are required.

It was first recorded in China in 1982 in Yuanjiang, in southern Yunnan Province. We monitored the spread of B. correcta in the field during 2017 and 2018, and found that it had moved about 300 kilometers eastward from its known range in 2011 in Yunnan and has now entered the neighboring Guangxi Province. A species distribution model used to predict the potential distribution of B. correcta in China revealed that southern China provides the most suitable habitat for B. correcta, and that further eastward expansion threatens large areas of southeastern China. Results from this study suggest that the rapid eastward migration of B. correcta is related to improved highway and high-speed railway systems in China that transport fruits and vegetables to eastern markets. This paper also discusses methods to slow the expansion of B. correcta in China.

J	Yang, RW; Wang, J				Yang, Ruowen; Wang, Jian			Interannual variability of the seesaw mode of the interface between the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							WESTERN PACIFIC; REANALYSIS; ANOMALIES; CLIMATE; EVOLUTION; PRESSURE; RAINFALL	The relation between the seesaw mode of the Interface between the Indian summer monsoon and East Asian summer monsoon (IIE) and the South China Sea summer monsoon trough (SCSSMT) and the Indian summer monsoon trough (ISMT) is investigated using two atmospheric reanalyses together with outgoing longwave radiation, sea surface temperature (SST), and gridded precipitation datasets. Canonical correlation analysis combined with empirical orthogonal functions, correlation, and composite analysis are employed. Results indicate that a stronger ISMT and SCSSMT resulting from colder SST over the tropical Indian Ocean and tropical east-central Pacific cause the IIE to deviate from its normal position in an anticlockwise direction, with a node at around 22 degrees N. This leads to heavier than normal summer rainfall over the north-central Indian subcontinent and South China Sea, but weaker than normal from the low and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and South Korea to central Japan. A weaker ISMT and SCSSMT resulting from warmer SST over the tropical Indian Ocean and tropical east-central Pacific causes the IIE to deviate from its normal position in a clockwise direction, and the anomalous summer rainfall pattern is the opposite of that for the stronger troughs. Further analysis indicates that the SCSSMT plays a crucial role in the evolution of the IIE seesaw mode. The latitudinal difference between the IMST and SCSSMT may be one of the most important reasons for the formation of the IIE seesaw mode.

Through the measurements of THz Fourier transform spectroscopy (2.5-6.5 THz) and THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS, 0.2-1.2 THz), we find that the real part of optical conductivity increases for ML MoS2 on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates and decreases for it on quartz with increasing radiation frequency. It is shown that the complex optical conductivity for ML MoS2, obtained from THz TDS measurements, can fit very well to the Drude-Smith formula. Thus, the dependence of optical conductivity of ML MoS2 on different substrates can be understood via a mechanism of electronic localization, and the electron density, relaxation time, and localization factor of the sample can be determined optically. Furthermore, we examine the influence of temperature on these key parameters in ML MoS2 on different substrates. The results obtained from this Letter indicate that THz spectroscopy is a very powerful tool in studying and characterizing ML MoS2-based electronic systems, especially in examining the electronic localization effect which cannot be directly measured in conventional electrical transport experiment. This Letter is relevant to an in-depth understanding of the optoelectronic properties of ML MoS2 and of the proximity effect induced by different substrates.

However, the effects of price regulation are yet unknown, especially when the world oil price fluctuates in different regimes. The study first analyses the mechanisms of petroleum product price (PPP) regulation (in the case of gasoline) and the crude oil-gasoline price fluctuation transmission, followed by the identification of regimes and their time intervals using regime-switching vector autoregressive model, and then estimates the effects of gasoline price regulation in reducing macroeconomic volatility. It is found that the world crude oil fluctuates in different regimes (the mild-fluctuation regime and the violent-fluctuation regime), the PPP regulation can reduce oil price volatility and then macroeconomic volatility, but it is more effective in the mild-fluctuation regime. The findings present a deeper understanding of the stabilization effect of PPP regulation on the macroeconomy, provide an evidence for sustaining China's PPP regulation for the purpose of macroeconomic stability, and offer policymakers new information for petroleum product pricing reforms.

However, in the Tibet-Himalaya orogen, the timing of the Neo-Tethyan slab rollback remains controversial. In this contribution, we investigated an early Paleocene (ca. 62 Ma) A(1)-type granitic intrusion (South Gongshan) from the Gaoligong-Tengliang-Yingjiang (GTY) area, SE Tibet. It is mainly characterized by high 10,000*Ga/Al ratios (4.0-9.1) and extremely high HFSEs contents (Zr + Nb + Ce + Y = 669-3146 ppm), with relatively low Y/Nb ratios (0.8-1.1). The samples collected from the intrusion exhibit high zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) (+1.1 to +5.7) and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values (- 0.8 to - 3.1). Geochemical data indicated that it was probably produced by extreme FC of asthenospheric mantle-derived basaltic magmas. Together with results from convergence rate between India and Asia, the emplacement of the South Gongshan intrusion was likely to be associated with a transition from flat to steep subduction triggered by the Neo-Tethyan slab rollback. We proposed that the Neo-Tethyan slab rollback beneath the GTY area might have occurred at ca. 62 Ma.

YR BP; SUMMER MONSOON; CONTINENTAL-MARGIN; ASIAN MONSOON; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Multi-proxy record of benthic and planktic foraminifera, total organic carbon and carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from Core SK291/GC15, off the coast of Goa, eastern Arabian Sea reveals significant paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic turnovers during similar to 6000 to 1700 calibrated years before the Present (cal yr BP). Benthic foraminiferal census data was analyzed with multivariate techniques including factor and cluster analyses of highest ranked species from the studied core that enabled to identify seven biofacies. The record suggests centennial to millennial-scale changes in the surface conditions driven by monsoon-linked upwelling in the eastern Arabian Sea during the studied interval. Various benthic biofacies combined with isotope and planktic foraminiferal data suggest that depletion of dissolved oxygen and increase in organic productivity in the study area was caused by intense monsoonal upwelling since the middle Holocene. The results suggest that during 5400-4700 and 3000-2500 cal yr BP the southwest (SW) monsoon was strong leading to intense upwelling in the study area as reflected by increased Globigerina bulloides percentages. These were generally warmer intervals in the northern hemisphere. The SW monsoon significantly weakened (abrupt decrease in G. bulloides population) during 4700-3400 cal yr BP roughly coinciding with a long arid phase in the Indian subcontinent and a cold interval in Europe. Our record suggests an abrupt increase in SW monsoon intensity during similar to 3000 to 2500 cal yr BP, when a pronounced change in benthic biofacies is also noted that suggests a major shift in the sub-surface conditions. Our data document a prolong weak SW monsoon phase beginning at similar to 4600 cal yr BP, little earlier than 4.2 ka event, in the eastern Arabian Sea.

The as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectra and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller's (BET) surface area measurement. Results showed that the three kinds of morphologies of MoS2 were obtained. Morphologies varied gradually from the coral-like aggregated particles to flower-like spheres to wrapped nano-sheet structure with increasing hydrothermal temperature and time. It is meaningful for specific morphology demand in different fields. Moreover, the prepared materials were used as tentative adsorbents for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) as a representative of endocrine disruptors. The results showed that the prepared MoS2 materials with wrapped nano-sheet structure had good adsorption capacity (39.03 mg/g) and fast adsorption rate (0.0053 g/(mg/min). The adsorption process was thermodynamically exothermic and spontaneous.

J	Chen, QY; Cao, C; He, Y				Chen, Qing-Yuan; Cao, Chao; He, Yao			Optical anisotropy and strain tunable optical, electronic and structural properties in monolayer GeP: A computational study	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article							CARRIER MOBILITY; SIAS; GEAS; SIP; SEMICONDUCTORS; PASSIVATION; PHOSPHORENE	This paper studies the structural, electronic and optical properties of a new group IV-V two-dimensional (2D) material GeP under the influence of different strains by using the first-principles calculations. The strains discussed in this paper include both the uniaxial strain along the different lattice vector directions, as well as the biaxial strain. The results show that monolayer GeP is a 2D dynamically stable semiconductor with low structural symmetry. In terms of the electronic property, regardless of the compressive strain or tensile strain applied in any direction, the band-gap of the monolayer GeP exhibits a decreasing tendency, and it remains semiconductivity in the range of - 10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain. As for the optical property, it is anisotropic. When GeP is subjected to a strain, regardless of the directions, the optical property of monolayer GeP is significantly affected more by tensile strain than by compressive strain. When the monolayer GeP is subjected to a tensile strain, its optical absorption and reflectivity in the visible light region to some extent increase, while its transmittance reduces. When it is subjected to a compressive strain, the main change in optical properties such as absorption and reflectivity occurs in the deep ultraviolet region. In particular, the monolayer GeP is most susceptible to deformation by the strain in a direction, and only compressive strain in a direction will cause GeP to undergo a transition from an indirect band-gap semiconductor to a direct band-gap semiconductor, which results in the improvements of absorption efficiency and reflectivity efficiency in the low energy region. Our calculated results indicate that the electronic and optical properties of monolayer GeP can be efficiently and regularly regulated by strain. In the future, it can be a suitable 2D materials used in optically polarized devices, blue light-emitting diode devices, and strain-tunable photoelectric nanodevices.

The present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of GA-13315-induced apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Lung cancer cells were treated with different doses of GA-13315 (4, 8, 16 and 32 ng/mu l) for 48 h, and a CCK8 assay was performed to measure cell viability. Alteration in gene expression was identified using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to confirm the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in RNA-Seq. Gene expression plasmids or small interfering RNA were used to overexpress or silence targeted genes, in order to investigate downstream signals. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted to evaluate the binding of transcription factors to the target genes. A Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc test were performed to evaluate the significance between groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. GA-13315 significantly decreased the number of viable cells and induced apoptosis among lung cancer cells (median lethal dose =12-16 ng/mu l). RNA-Seq identified 250 significant DEGs, including 94 upregulated and 156 downregulated genes in A549 cells (P<0.05; fold change >= 1.5). Upregulation of TRIM67, NF-kappa B subunit 2 (NF-kappa B2) and FAS was additionally confirmed using qPCR and western blot analysis in A549 and H460 cells. Apoptosis of A549 cells was significantly decreased following knockdown of TRIM67. GA-13315 promoted TRIM67 expression to increase FAS expression and cell apoptosis. TRIM67 promoted the processing of NF-kappa B2 into its active form, p52, which then enhanced the NF-kappa B pathway and GA-13315-induced apoptosis.

A logistic regression model is adopted to specify missingness covariate mechanism, a weighted robust non -negative matrix projection (WNMFP) algorithm is developed to impute missing covariates, and a mixture GEE (mix GEE) approach is proposed to estimate parameters. Under the KKT conditions, we show the convergence of the proposed WNMFP algorithm. Under some regularity conditions, we prove the consistence and asymptotic normality of the proposed mix-GEE estimator. Two simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies. Empirical results show that the mix-GEE approach is more efficient and robust than the complete-case, inverse probability weighted and quadratic inference function methods. The data from an AIDS clinical trial is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the Bi2SiO5 nanosheets was prepared by hydrothermal method, marked as BSO. Then, the flower-like Pt/BSO was synthesized with H2PtCl6 as the platinum source, methanol as electron donor and the 300 W mercury lamp as light source to restore Pt. In the process of photoreduction, H2PtCl6 was not only used as Pt resources, but also cause the BSO nanosheets assembled into flower-like structures. In addition, with introduction of Pt, the band gap width become narrower. Moreover, the amount of platinum can affect the photocatalytic activity. When the dosage of H2PtCl6 solution is 0.2 mL, the prepared optimal material was marked as 0.2 Pt/BSO. The total degradation efficiency of EE2 reached 95.6% after only 8 min of UV-light irradiation over 0.2 Pt/BSO, and the reaction rate constant were 46.16, 8.0 and 5.82 times higher than EE2 photolysis, P25 and BSO nanosheets, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of different photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, UV-vis DRS and PL techniques. The effects of pH value for removing EE2 in water was investigated. The possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed on the basis of trapping photocatalytic experiments. 0.2 Pt/BSO photocatalyst also depicted high stability and durability during three successive cycles. Results in this work provide new insights into improving the photocatalytic performance and constructing a flower-like morphology composed of nanosheets.

Leaf epidermal morphology using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy of 22 Lamiaceae species from 15 genera have been investigated with an aim to solve its taxonomic problem in the correct identification. Various foliar micromorphological features were observed to explain their importance in resolving the correct identification of Lamiaceae taxa. Two main types of trichomes were observed; glandular trichomes (GTs) and nonglandular trichomes (NGTs). GTs were further divided into seven subtypes including the capitate, subsessile capitate, sessile capitate, sunken, barrel, peltate, and clavate. Similarly, NGTs were also divided into simple unicellular and multicellular including conical, falcate, cylindrical, dendrite, papillose, and short hook shape. Quantitative measurement includes the length and width of the trichomes, stomatal complex, epidermal cells, stomata, and trichomes index. Based on the foliar micromorphological characters, a taxonomic key was developed to delimit and correctly identify studied taxa. Further molecular, other anatomical and phylogenetic studies are recommended to strengthen the systematics of Lamiaceae.

The process is achieved by pi-pi stacking and the coordination effect at room temperature, which avoids using toxic chemicals such as N2H4, NaBH4, and organic solvent. The Au nanoparticles with an average size of similar to 10 nm are dispersed on the surface of SWCNT by the anchoring effect of HP5 that provides the coordination role between Au and the hydroxyl oxygen in HP5, and by the pi-pi interaction between SWCNT and the benzene rings of HP5. The obtained hybrid nanomaterial Au@HP5@SWCNT has shown high catalytic activity for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), due to the small sized Au nanoparticles, and the sensitive sensing performance for p-dinitrobenzene (p-DNB) based on the excellent supramolecular host-guest recognition capability of HP5. This nanomaterial, Au@HP5@SWCNT, exhibits preeminent catalysis and sensing properties compared with others including SWCNT, Au@HP5, and HP5@SWCNT, and so has potential value in catalyzing, sensing, and in other fields.

CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Rhoiptelea chiliantha; Rhoipteleaceae; Juglandaceae; Chloroplast genome	PHYLOGENY	Rhoiptelea chiliantha is the only species of traditionally defined family Rhoipteleaceae which is confined to S Guizhou, SE Yunnan, N and W Guangxi of China as well as N Vietnam, and is evaluated as vulnerable (VU) in "The IUCN Red List Threatened Species" and "Chinese Species Red List". Here, we de novo assembled the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of R. chiliantha using Illumina sequencing data for the first time. The whole cp genome was 161,692 bp in length consisting of a pair of inverted repeat (IRa and IRb) regions of respectively 25,335 bp, a small single-copy region of 23,659 bp and a large single-copy region of 89,039 bp. The genome encoded 116 unique genes including 85 protein-coding genes, 27 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 21 complete cp genome sequences indicates that R. chiliantha is sister to the traditionally defined walnut family (Juglandaceae s.s.) and supports to merge Rhoipteleaceae into Juglandaceae s.l.

AD affects the whole brain and as a result the quality of life, where most affected regions are the hippocampus (HP), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We used well-known classification methods to diagnose the affected regions of the brain at different stages of age using biomarker modalities and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at the resting state, and later marked the affected brain region on MRI. We have used well-known support vector machine (SVM), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, artificial neural network, and logistic regression for the classification of AD. In the context of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, an SVM provided the best classification among AD stages. Moreover, analysis showed development of AD.

This study investigated the potential of two 'green' additives, Hg-volatilizing bacteria (Pseudomonas sp. DC-B1 and Bacillus sp. DC-B2) and sawdust biochar, and their combination to reduce Hg(II) phytoavailability in soil and the effect of the additives on the soil bacterial community. The results showed that the Hg(II) contents in soils and lettuce shoots and roots were all reduced with these additives, achieving more declines of 12.3-27.4%, 24.8-57.8% and 2.0-48.6%, respectively, within 56 days of incubation compared to the control with no additive. The combination of DC-B2 and 4% biochar performed best in reducing Hg(II) contents in lettuce shoots, achieving a decrease of 57.8% compared with the control. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that the overall bacterial community compositions in the soil samples were similar under different treatments, despite the fact that the relative abundance of dominant genera altered with the additives, suggesting a relatively weak impact of the additives on the soil microbial ecosystem. The low relative abundances of Pseudomonas and Bacillus, close to the background levels, at the end of the experiment indicated a small biological disturbance of the local microbial niche by the exogenous bacteria.

To fully understand and predict the evolutionary trajectories of floral traits, it is critical to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of floral traits on plant fitness in natural populations. We experimentally quantified phenotypic selection on floral traits through female fitness and estimated the casual effects of nectar robbing with different nectar robbing intensities on trait-fitness relationships in both the L- (long-style and short-anther phenotype) and S-morph (short-style and long-anther phenotype) flowers among Primula secundiflora populations. A larger number of flowers and wider corolla tubes had both direct and indirect positive effects on female fitness in the P. secundiflora populations. The indirect effects of these two traits on female fitness were mediated by nectar robbers. The indirect effect of the number of flowers on female fitness increased with increasing nectar robbing intensity. In most populations, the direct and/or indirect effects of floral traits on female fitness were stronger in the S-morph flowers than in the L-morph flowers. In addition, nectar robbers had a direct positive effect on female fitness, but this effect varied between the L- and S-morph flowers. These results show the potential role of nectar robbers in influencing the trait-fitness relationships in this primrose species.

The photoluminescence properties of N-GQDs were investigated and applied to determine the trace of Hg2+ in aqueous solution. The fluorescence ofN-GQDs was dramatically quenched after the addition of Hg2+. This is due to the efficient charge transfer and coordination interaction between N-GQDs and mercury ions. The N-GQDs base fluorescence sensor exhibit excellently selective and sensitive response to Hg2+. According to the standard curve analysis, a two-stage liner response to Hg(2+)can be obtained in the concentration ranging from 1 nM to 1000 nM. The detection limits (LOD) were calculated as 0.45 and 67.3 nM, respectively, which could satisfy the requirements of Hg2+ detection in water. The fluorescence N-GQDs presented here provides a functional platform with low detection limit, excellent selectivity and high sensitivity.

Existing approaches in this field only take into account the clique instances where feature instances form a clique. However, they may neglect some important spatial correlations among features in practice. In this paper, we introduce star participation instances to measure the prevalence of co-location patterns such that spatially correlated instances which cannot form cliques will also be properly considered. Then we propose a new concept called sub-prevalent co-location patterns (SPCP) based on the star participation instances. Furthermore, two efficient algorithms -- the prefix-tree-based algorithm (PTBA) and the partition-based algorithm (PBA) -- are proposed to mine all the maximal sub-prevalent co-location patterns (MSPCP) in a spatial data set. PTBA uses a typical candidate generate-and-test way starting from candidates with the longest pattern-size, while PBA adopts a step-by-step manner starting from 3-size core patterns. We demonstrate the significance of our proposed new concepts as well as the efficiency of our algorithms through extensive experiments.

Providing cognition on the effects of the policy on the distribution of dominant species is important to better understand plant community structures, development dynamics, regeneration conditions, and possible underlying ecological mechanisms. The purport of this study is to inspect the population structure of Pinus yunnanensis in a 2500 m( )(2)area of abandoned farmland where restituted to forest in 2004. The results showed that the population structure of P. yunnanensis settled on tree age formed an inverted J-distribution (20.1% seedlings, 34.2% young trees, 38.5% middle-aged trees, and 7.1% adult trees) since 2009, whereas seedlings, young trees, and middle-aged trees showed clustered distribution. Seedlings showed the highest aggregation degree (g(r) = 6.4), followed by young trees (g(r) = 2.3) and middle-aged trees (g(r) = 1.7), but a random distribution showed in adults throughout the research area. The spatial relationships among seedlings, young trees, middle-aged trees, and adults indicated that the aggregation consequences increased with the decreasing difference in the diameter at breast height. Furthermore, the correlation of canopy height and diameter at breast height decreased with the increasing competition among the individuals signified that seedlings and young trees growing in the same area might use fewer resources than needed. Generally, the study illustrated that infra-specific competition due to environmental resources is a rarely occurring event.

Compared with traditional solvent extraction technology, PIM is especially suitable for the separation of low concentration gold(I). A PIM containing [A336] [SCN] as the carrier, polyvinylidene difluoride as a polymer matrix, and 2-nitrophenyl n-octyl ether as the plasticizer was prepared using solvent volatilization and characterized by several techniques. In addition, effects of several experimental factors on the extraction and recovery efficiencies were studied; the experimental factors included the concentration of the extractant, the stirring rate, the species of the polymer matrix, the initial gold concentration in the feed solution, and the KSCN concentration in the strip solution. Results revealed that the membrane composition and in particular, the carrier concentration, significantly affect the extraction of gold(I). The extraction mechanism involved an anion exchange reaction between the carrier [A336] [SCN] embedded in the matrix polymer and the gold cyanide complex in the feed phase, followed by diffusion through the PIM, and Au(CN)(2)(-) is eventually recovered in the stripping phase. More than 98.2% of gold in the feed phase was transported through the PIM into the stripping solution, which contains 3.0 mol/L KSCN with a permeability coefficient of 1.02 x 10(-5) m/s under optimal conditions. Furthermore, the membrane lifetime was also evaluated using a continuous mode, and excellent stability was achieved for at least 9 days of continuous operation. These promising results demonstrate that the PIM technology has good prospects for the extraction and recovery of gold from alkaline solutions.

Monoclinic and hexagonal LaPO4 nanorods can be achieved by adjusting the hydrothermal temperature and the pH value. The photocatalytic activity of monoclinic and hexagonal LaPO4 nanorods on rhodamine B (RB) and Congo red (CR) under UV irradiation was investigated, respectively. Interestingly, the monoclinic and hexagonal phase shows different photocatalytic performance for the photodegradation of the organic RB and CR dye.

The newest generation of macrocyclic host and biomimetic nano-enzymes have been effectively integrated to achieve the robust immobilization of signal molecules by host-guest molecular recognition and sensitively catalytic amplification of electrochemical signals. The addition of Pd and the formation of WP6@PdPt PCONs unique bimetallic nanostructure are beneficial to changing Pt-based catalyst electronic structure, accelerating the electron transport, promoting the generation of synergistic catalysis effect. Compared with enzyme-based methods, the fabricated sandwich-type immunosensor demonstrates more advantages in robustness owing to the introduction of host-guest chemistry and biomimetic nano-enzymes. In the wide range from 0.0003 to 100.00 ng mL(-1), a good linear relationship (R-2 = 0.998) and a low LOD (0.095 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3) can be obtained. The proposed immunosensor shows remarkable analytical performances in the measurements of selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and real sample analysis, which provided a promising approach for clinical detection of NSE in human serum. Besides, the successful synthesis of WP6@PdPt PCONs provides a new idea for the preparation of biosensors based on bionic materials, nanotechnology and host-guest molecule recognition.

J	Liu, K; Chen, JL; Yang, RW				Liu, Kui; Chen, Jilong; Yang, Ruowen			Connection between Two Leading Modes of Autumn Rainfall Interannual Variability in Southeast China and Two Types of ENSO-Like SSTA	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY			English	Article							SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES; SUMMER RAINFALL; EL-NINO; PACIFIC; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; DROUGHT; EASTERN; EVENTS	The interannual variability of autumn rainfall in Southeast China (SEC) is significant, with two major modes, namely, monopole and dipole modes. It is found that the monopole mode is closely related to EP ENSO-like sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), and the dipole mode is related to CP ENSO-like SSTA. During the warm phase of EP ENSO-like SSTA, an anomalous anti-Walker circulation emerges in the tropical Pacific, with an anomalous subsiding during 110 degrees E-120 degrees E and an anomalous ascending branch in SEC. These two branches of anomalous current are in the same longitude and form a closed meridional circulation. Besides, there also exists an anticyclone anomaly in the Northwest Pacific (NWP), transporting water vapor into SEC. These circulation configurations induced by the warm phase of EP ENSO-like SSTA are consistent with those of monopole mode positive anomaly year. The good correspondence between EP ENSO warm event and the positive monopole mode also helps to support the corresponding relationship between the EP ENSO-like SSTA and monopole mode of SEC autumn rainfall. After the diagnosis of the perturbation omega equation, the anomalous subsiding branch over SEC, as the key link of EP ENSO-like warm phase SSTA exerting impact on the monopole mode during positive anomaly year, is mainly related with the anomalous relative vorticity advection transported by basic zonal wind and temperature advection transported by meridional wind anomaly. As for the dipole mode, it is related to the CP ENSO-like SSTA, but the corresponding relationship is weaker than that of the monopole mode and EP ENSO-like SSTA. In special, during the warm phase of CP ENSO-like SSTA, an anomalous cyclone appears in the NWP and prevailing sinking motion over SEC, both of which favors the appearance of positive anomaly of the dipole mode. Specially, the local anomalous vertical motion mainly depends on anomalous relative vorticity transported by basic meridional wind. Generally speaking, the monopole (dipole) mode is closely associated with the EP (CP) ENSO-like SSTA, demonstrating some correspondence.

Firstly, we use the Banach fixed point theorem to establish the existence of weighted pseudo-almost periodic solutions for this class of QVCNNs. Then, under the condition that the drive system has a unique weighted pseudo-almost periodic solution, by designing a state-feedback controller and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we see that the drive-response structure of delayed QVCNNs with weighted pseudo-almost periodic coefficients achieve global exponential synchronization. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our results.

Using morphological and molecular methods, New Guinea flatworms were discovered and identified for the first time in Hong Kong Island during a field investigation in July and August 2018. The flatworms were 32-60 mm long, 3-5 inns wide, and 1-2 mm thick. The dorsal side of the flatworm was dark brown with a thin yellow central line, and its ventral side appeared pale grey. To further verify this species, both 18S rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COX1) obtained from three specimens of P. manokwari were sequenced and analysed. While comparing these sequences with those previously deposited in GenBank, these 18S rDNA sequences shared 100% identity with the single available 18S rDNA sequence of P. manokwari; and the obtained COX1 sequences were identical to those of P. manokwari world genotype. Two native snails, Criptosoma imprator and Bradybaena similaris, have been found to be the prey of this predator during this investigation. Therefore, the invasive New Guinea flatworm certainly will cause a serious impact on the biodiversity of native snail populations, and an economic and environmental risk assessment for P. manokwari need to be completed in the near future in Hong Kong.

This study applied the isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry technique for small samples (3-4 mg) to conduct illite Rb-Sr isotope dating of five illitic clay samples from the Silurian bituminous sandstone (SBS) intersected by five drillholes in the Tarim Basin, NW China. The Rb-87/Sr-86 ratio of clays is fractionated mainly by the addition of Rb during the illitization of mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S), which is the dominant clay species in the Tarim Basin samples. The subsample-scale Rb/Sr isotope values suggest that each subsample may contain I/S particles of slightly variable degrees of illitization. Three of the analyzed samples (H6, KQ1 and TZ67) generated Rb-Sr isochron ages of 141 +/- 61 Ma, 332 +/- 32 Ma and 235 +/- 8 Ma (errors quoted at 2 sigma), respectively. These results are similar to the corresponding K-Ar ages (125 Ma, 389 Ma and 234 Ma). The isotopic ages are consistent with the timing of hydrocarbon charge which varies in different drillholes as constrained by basin modelling, indicating that a closed-system behavior is attained by the hydrocarbon charge that inhibits the illitization of I/S. The Rb-Sr isotope analyses of the other two samples (YM35-1 and Q1) that did not yield isochron ages suggest the conditions for producing isochrons were not satisfied, which may be caused by disturbance of the isotope system by a post-charge hydrothermal event. The outcomes of this study show the robust potential of Rb-Sr clay subsample geochronology for cross-checking isotopic ages yielded by other systems (e.g. K-Ar system) and constraining the timing of hydrocarbon charge.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction unveiled that CPs 1 and 1a have similar 2D layered structures, except that rctt-tpcb replaced a pair of bpe ligands in the latter. Furthermore, CPs 1 and 1a are good bifunctional luminescent sensors that can detect Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions in a mixed medium of water and DMF and display high sensitivity, selectivity, and anti-jamming capability for the recognition of Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions. Moreover, we also examine in detail the possible luminescent quenching mechanisms of 1 and 1a toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions.

This study examined the population structure of A. normalis using sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b gene (2,086 bp). In total, 107 specimens were collected from nine populations. All 105 mtDNA haplotypes were identified as belonging to two allopatric phylogroups. The results of a statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) suggested that the ancestral populations of A. normalis were distributed widely on Hainan Island and east of the Leizhou Peninsula. A comparison of the fixation indices N-ST (0.532) and G(ST) (0.004) revealed that the phylogeny and geography had a significant relationship. Our study found that (1) the Wuzhishan and Yinggeling Mountain Range was an important barrier limiting gene exchange between populations on both sides; (2) cyclic climate changes may have shaped migrations and population differentiations; and (3) different colonization times caused different population diversities between codistributed species. In addition, the inter-and intraspecific diversities of the genus Aphyocypris were estimated.

The results showed that the increase of number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohols suppressed the formation of CH4, but promoted the production of CO and the organic by-products. Both Lewis and Bronsted acidic sites were observed over Ni-Al2O3 catalyst, while Lewis acidic sites were dominated over Ni-SiO2 catalyst. The different reaction intermediates resulted in the formation of mainly amorphous coke over Ni-Al2O3 catalyst with some Ni grains were encapsulated by amorphous coke. In comparison, the coke over the Ni-SiO2 was mainly nanotube form. The varied reaction intermediates formed were observed with the in-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy studies of steam reforming of the alcohols.

Herein, an electron-donating group, namely p-phenylene, is incorporated into PCN by a polycondensation reaction between carbon nitride and p-phenylenediamine (or p-benzoquinone) to repair the structural defects. The p-phenylene-modified PCN exhibits an almost fivefold increase in H-2 evolution, a threefold increase in photocurrent density, and higher nonradiative rate (0.285 ns(-1)). Spectroscopic studies confirm that p-phenylene tends to bridge the heptazine-based oligomers through a polycondensation reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that anchoring of the heptazine units by p-phenylene induces localization of h(+) and e(-) on the phenylene and melem moieties, respectively, which effectively separates the charge carriers. This strategy provides an opportunity to overcome structural defects in carbon nitride for efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion.

However, whether invasive plants can outperform native plants at all stages of invasion is not very clear. We investigated the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and N:P homeostasis of an invasive Eupatorium adenophorum and a co-occurring native plant Artemisia argyi in an area across the five invasion stages of E. adenophorum. The N homeostasis (H-N) of E. adenophorum was higher than that of A. argyi, whereas the P and N:P homeostasis (H-P and H-N/P) were higher for A. argyi. For E. adenophorum, H-N decreased, but H-P and H-N(/P) increased with the invasion time. For A. argyi, H-N(/P) increased, H-P and H-N remained stable with the invasion time. The results demonstrated that E. adenophorum could maintain higher H-N during invasion stages when N was limited and could maintain higher H-N and H-P at invasion stages when P was more limited. This rapid nitrogen and phosphorus homeostasis transformation of invasive E. adenophorum during its invasion stages guarantees its stronger competitive ability over native species and promotes its invasion success.

In this study, we demonstrate that the Cu-based catalysts produced via the hydrotalcite precursors with tunable distribution of acidic and basic sites could, according to the requirement of the target products, effectively tune the production of GVL or to 1,4-PDO from levulinic acid/ester. The abundant Bronsted acid sites over the CuAl catalyst suppressed the opening of the ring of GVL, achieving a higher GVL selectivity while inhibiting 1,4-PDO formation. The introduction of Mg species to the catalyst significantly increased the abundance of the basic sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was essential for the selective conversion of GVL to 1,4-PDO via the opening of the ring structure of GVL, the rate-determining step in the conversion from levulinic acid/ester to 1,4-PDO. In addition, the CuMgAl catalyst showed a much superior catalytic stability to the CuMg or CuAl catalyst due to the more stable crystal structure, the more developed porous structure, the higher dispersion of the Cu species and the higher capability to suppress the growth of metallic Cu species under hydrothermal conditions.

A novel and flexible polymer brush patterning methodology, which is based on employing a digital mirror device (DMD)-based light modulation technique to spatiotemporally regulate a surface-initiated photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo-ATRP) process, is presented. Various characterization techniques confirm that the spatially and/or temporally controlled brush formation results in complex PEG-derived brush patterns in accordance with a customized digital image design. A series of step-and-exposure strategies, including in situ multiple exposure, dynamic multiple exposure and dynamic sequential exposure, are developed to implement spatiotemporal regulation of the photo-ATRP process, leading to complex patterned and gradient brushes featuring binary functionalities, pyramid nanostructures and radial directional chemical gradients. Moreover, tunable and radial directional concentration gradients of various biomacromolecules (e. g., streptavidin) are obtained through preparation of height gradients of azido-functionalized brushes and subsequent orthogonal chemical activation aimed at specific protein immobilization. Finally, a unidirectional concentration gradient of fibronectin, surrounded by non-fouling PEG brushes, is fabricated and applied for human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion experiments, whose preliminary results indicate gradient-dependent cell adhesion behavior in response to the concentration gradient of fibronectin. The presented fabrication technique could be integrated with microfluidic devices for sensors and bio-reactors, paving the way for novel approaches for lab-on-a-chip technologies.

Exploring the Origin of Multiwavelength Activities of High-redshift Flat-spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 1502+106 during 2014-2018	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: jets; quasars: individual (PKS 1502+106); radiation mechanisms: nonthermal	EXTRAGALACTIC BACKGROUND LIGHT; SPACE-TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS; GAMMA-RAY EMISSION; BL-LAC OBJECTS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CROSS-CORRELATIONS; FERMI; BLAZARS; VARIABILITY; MODELS	The origin of the multiband activities (outbursts/flares) of blazars is still a heavily debated topic. Shock and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible triggers of the multiband activities. In this paper, we present an exploration of the origin of multiband activities for a high-redshift (z = 1.8385) flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS. 1502+106. Utilizing multiband data from radio to gamma-ray and optical polarization observations, we investigate two dramatic activities in detail: a gamma-ray-dominated outburst in 2015 and an optical-dominated outburst in 2017. Our main results are as follows. (I) A fast gamma-ray flare with a flux-doubling timescale as short as 1 hr in 2015 is discovered. Based on the variability timescale, the physical parameters of the flaring region (e.g., minimum Doppler factor, emission region size, etc.) are constrained. At the peak of the flare, the gamma-ray spectrum hardens to Gamma(gamma) = 1.82 +/- 0.04 and exhibits an obvious curvature/break characteristic that is caused by the typical "cooling break." Modeling of multiband spectral energy distributions reveal a very hard electronic energy spectrum with the electronic spectral index of 1.07 +/- 0.53. This result suggests that this fast gamma-ray flare may be triggered by magnetic reconnection. (II) During the outburst in 2017, the degree of optical polarization and optical fluxes showed a very tight correlation. By analyzing the Stokes parameters of polarization observations, our results show that this outburst could be triggered by a transverse shock with a compression ratio of eta > 2.2, and the magnetic field intensity of the shock emission region is about 0.032.

Both emitters exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation-induced emission characteristics, and QBP-DMAC shows multicolor mechanochromic luminescent (MCL). Intriguingly, crystal structure of QBP-DMAC reveals loose molecular packing mode and slipped pi-pi intramolecular interactions between DMAC moieties, which are identified as the underlying mechanism for its MCL behavior. Moreover, the QBP-DMAC-based organic light-emitting diode device achieves high external quantum efficiencies up to 18.8%, which is among the highest efficiencies for the MCL-active TADF emitters.

In this study, the orthologs of VosA and VelB, AoVosA, and AoVelB, respectively, were characterized in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora, which captures nematodes by producing trapping devices (traps). Deletion of the AovelB gene resulted in growth defects in different media, and the aerial hyphae from the Delta AovelB mutant lines were fewer in number and their colonies were less dense than those from the wildtype (WT) strain. The Delta AovelB mutants each displayed serious sporulation defects, and the transcripts of several sporulation-related genes (e. g., abaA, flbC, rodA, and vosA) were significantly down-regulated compared to those from the WT strain. Furthermore, the Delta AovelB mutant strains became more sensitive to chemical reagents, including sodium dodecyl sulfate and H2O2. Importantly, the Delta AovelB mutants were unable to produce nematode-capturing traps. Similarly, extracellular proteolytic activity was also lower in the Delta AovelB mutants than in the WT strain. In contrast, the Delta AovosA mutants displayed no obvious differences from the WT strain in these phenotypic traits, whereas conidial germination was lower in the Delta AovosA mutants, which became more sensitive to heat shock stress. Our results demonstrate that the velvet protein AoVelB is essential for conidiation, trap formation, and pathogenicity in A. oligospora, while AoVosA plays a role in the regulation of conidial germination and heat shock stress.

The studied strain includes in-layer uniaxial strain and biaxial strain. Green phosphorene can be viewed as a combination of black and blue phosphorene segments in regular order. We adopt the HSE06 method to correct the calculated results. The results reveal that, firstly, strain-free monolayer green phosphorene is a stable direct band gap 2D semiconductor with the anisotropic optical property. The transmittance of infrared and visible light along the zigzag direction is better than that along the armchair direction. However, the transmittance of the UV-light along the armchair direction is better than that along the zigzag direction. Secondly, the optical properties, such as the absorption coefficient and reflectivity, along armchair and zigzag direction respond very differently to the various applied strains. As for the electronic properties, the band gap exhibits different changing trends by applying either in-layer biaxial strain or uniaxial strain in different directions. Besides, the near-band-edge electronic orbitals exhibit different bond nature in different directions. These results suggest that green phosphorene shows strong anisotropy in electronic and optical properties. By calculating and comparing the energies of near-band-edge states after applying different strains on green phosphorene, the reason for the anisotropy of the new 2D material is analyzed. This study implies that the electronic and optical properties of green phosphorene, a stable direct band gap anisotropic semiconductor, could be efficiently tuned by in-layer biaxial or uniaxial strain. Therefore, green phosphorene can be used in linear polarizers and other anisotropic photoelectric devices.

The results indicated that such an orthogonal four-peak texture could provide larger and more balanced Schmid factors for basal slip compared with that of the as-extruded sheet when the sheets subject to tension along different directions. As expected, the tensile yield strength was decreased and the ductility was increased effectively, suggesting a considerable improvement in uniaxial deformation ability. Additionally, the orthogonal four-peak texture could also provide more balanced mechanical properties along different directions and contribute to reducing the planar anisotropy. Erichsen tests showed that the Erichsen value of the sample with orthogonal four-peak texture increased up to similar to 115% compared with that of the as-extruded sheet. This finding indicated that such a texture modification method was also highly conducive to enhancing the multiaxial stretch formability of the Mg sheets. The orthogonal four-peak texture modification was confirmed as an efficient way to improve the comprehensive mechanical performance of the Mg alloy sheets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and N-2 absorption/desorption have been done to obtain compositional and morphological information as well as BET surface area of the as-synthesized sample. Catalytic activities of the porous CuCo2O4 towards the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) techniques. The results show that the addition of spinel CuCo2O4 with 3D macro-/nanoporousstructure to AP remarkably decreases the high temperature decomposition (HTD) from 470.92 degrees C for pure AP to 308.74 degrees C for AP containing CuCo2O4 additive with a mass ratio of 2%. The as-synthesized 3D macro-/nanoporous spinel CuCo2O4 is the promising type of catalytic materials for AP-based composite solid rocket propellants. The simple synthesis method is conducive to large-scale industrial production for application in AP thermal decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

But it is not easy to get the M-eigenvalues exactly, especially for high dimensional fourth-order partially symmetric tensors. In this paper, we give two M-eigenvalue inclusion intervals for a fourth-order partially symmetric tensor, which provide two upper bounds for the M-spectral radius. As an application, taking these upper bounds as the parameter tau in WQZ-algorithm presented by Wang et al. (2009), respectively, can make the generated sequence by this algorithm more rapidly converge to a good approximation of the largest M-eigenvalue of a fourth-order partially symmetric tensor.

Osbeck is a popular fruit cultivated around the world, and its peels are sometimes used for the treatment of cough, abdominal pain, and indigestion in China. However, the peel is discarded after fruit consumption in most cases, and its chemical constituents and biological activities have not been validated before. The present study focused on evaluation of the chemical and pharmacological profile of coumarins from peels of C. grandis against inflammation. The extracts and phytochemicals from peels of C. grandis were prepared, and anti-inflammatory activities were carried out in vivo and in vitro, including inhibiting xylene-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice and the production of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta, prostaglandin 2, and tumor-necrosis factor alpha) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Results indicated that methanolic extract, ethyl acetate fraction, and four major coumarins (compounds 7, 8, 13, and 16) inhibited swelling induced by xylene and carrageenan, separately, in vivo. Furthermore, 18 coumarins inhibited inflammatory factor secretion in macrophages primed by LPS, in which compounds 4, 6, 7, 10, 17 showed the most pronounced change, which were comparable to dexamethasone. In summary, peel of C. grandis showed an anti-inflammatory effect and coumarin compounds were responsible for regulating inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which might provide a novel nutritional strategy for inflammatory diseases.

Here, we demonstrate an exchange-coupled asymmetric composite film structure of Ta/Pd/[Pd/Co](5)/Cu(t(Cu))/[Co/Ni](5)/Ta with adjustable strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interlayer coupling strength, in which the dynamic magnetic properties are systematically studied by using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the in-phase precession frequency is between those of the single hard magnetic [Pd/Co](5) and soft [Co/Ni](5) multilayers, which can be significantly enhanced for the strongly coupled case at t(Cu) < 1 nm. Moreover, in the weakly coupled samples with t(Cu) = 1.0-3.0 nm, besides the common in-phase acoustic mode, an out-of-phase optical mode occurs simultaneously with a frequency even higher than that of the hard magnetic [Pd/Co](5) layer. The optical mode precession frequency and amplitude show an unusual non-monotonic variation trend with the increase of t(Cu), which has been theoretically analyzed and attributed to the co-effect of decreased coupling strength and increased magnetic anisotropy field difference between the two multilayer stacks. Moreover, by adjusting t(Cu) and the [Co/Ni] repetition number N, an optical mode of strong intensity can be actively achieved, even reaching 80% as compared to the acoustic mode. These results provide effective control and better understanding of magnetic dynamics in perpendicular composite films, which are of key importance for developing ultrafast spintronics-based devices.

HBV infection affects lncRNA expression in infected cells, but the detailed mechanism and biological significance are not yet clear. In this study, we focused on exploring the function of the HBV-upregulated lncRNA SAMD12-AS1 in cell proliferation. We found that there is a higher level of SAMD12-AS1 expression in tumors than in adjacent nontumorous liver tissues. We showed that ectopic expression of SAMD12-AS1 promotes cell growth and blocks apoptosis, while knockdown of SAMD12-AS1 inhibits cell proliferation and enhances etoposide-induced apoptosis. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we determined that SAMD12-AS1 interacts with NPM1 and confirmed that SAMD12-AS1(1-350) is required for the interaction with NPM1. As it is known that NPM1 interacts with the E3 ligase HDM2 and reduces HDM2-mediated p53 degradation, we examined whether SAMD12-AS1 can affect p53 stability. Overexpression of SAMD12-AS1 caused a reduction in p53 protein levels by shortening its half-life. Conversely, knockdown of SAMD12-AS1 prolonged the half-life of p53. We further demonstrated that SAMD12-AS1 increased the interaction of HDM2 and p53 and enhanced p53 ubiquitination. Our findings reveal that HBV-upregulated SAMD12-AS1 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis via the NPM1-HDM2-p53 axis.

The large imaged field of view of TESS allows a search over the uncertainty region produced by MOST. However, the TESS pixel scale of 21 '' and the full-frame image (FFI) cadence of 30 minutes is not optimal for the detection of a fast optical burst (FOB) with a possible millisecond duration. We search the TESS FFIs and find no events with a limiting TESS magnitude of 16, assuming a 30 minute event duration, corresponding to an optical flux density upper limit of approximately 2000 Jy for a similar to 1 ms signal duration, assuming no signal loss. In addition, the cosmic-ray mitigation method for TESS significantly reduces its sensitivity to short-timescale transients, which we quantify. We compare our results to the predictions of Yang et al. and find that the upper limit is a factor of 2000 higher than the predicted maximum optical flux density. However, we find that if FRB 181228 had occurred in the galaxy thought to host the nearest FRB detection to date (37 Mpc), an FOB may have been detectable by TESS. In the near future, when the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment and Australian SKA Pathfinder will detect hundreds to thousands of FRBs, TESS may be able to detect FOBs from those rare bright and nearby FRBs within this large population (if more sophisticated cosmic-ray excision can be implemented).

J	Xue, G; Liu, D; Liu, JS; Yao, SW				Xue, Gang; Liu, Di; Liu, Junsong; Yao, Shaowen			A process partitioning technique for constructing decentralized web service compositions	SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						decentralized web service compositions; process partitioning; QoS; web service compositions		Web service compositions have been widely applied in different applications. A service composition is usually implemented in either a centralized or decentralized manner. Compared with the centralized service composition, the decentralized composition has no central control component, and components interact with each other directly, thereby achieving better performance. Process partitioning is a technique to divide a process into multiple parts and has been shown that it can be successfully applied to decentralizing process-driven service compositions. This paper proposes a new process partitioning technique for constructing decentralized service compositions. The proposed technique, which is based on typed digraphs and a graph transformation technique, is used for exploring available process partitioning solutions. For applications, this paper discusses the topology and interaction features about the partitioning solutions and summarizes a ranking method for them. Three experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can be applied in constructing decentralized service compositions effectively. In addition, the results also show that the decentralized compositions can have lower average response times and higher throughputs than the corresponding centralized compositions in the experiments.

But challenges arise in estimating the covariance matrix of longitudinal data collected at irregular or unbalanced time points. In this paper, we develop a regularisation method for estimating the covariance function and a stepwise procedure for estimating the parametric components efficiently in the varying-coefficient partially linear model. This procedure is also applicable to the varying-coefficient temporal mixed-effects model. Our method utilises the structure of the covariance function and thus has faster rates of convergence in estimating the covariance functions and outperforms the existing approaches in simulation studies. This procedure is easy to implement and its numerical performance is investigated using both simulated and real data.

However, its origin and genetic mechanisms underlying high-altitude adaptation still remain controversial and enigmatic. Herein, we analyze 229 genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Eurasia, including 63 Tibetan pigs, and detect 49.6 million high-quality variants. Phylogenomic and structure analyses show that Tibetan pigs have a close relationship with low-land domestic pigs in China, implying a common domestication origin. Positively selected genes in Tibetan pigs involved in high-altitude physiology, such as hypoxia, cardiovascular systems, UV damage, DNA repair. Three of loci with strong signals of selection are associated with EPAS1, CYP4F2, and THSD7A genes, related to hypoxia and circulation. We validated four non-coding mutations nearby EPAS1 and CYP4F2 showing reduced transcriptional activity in Tibetan pigs. A high-frequency missense mutation is found in THSD7A (Lys561Arg) in Tibetan pigs. The selective sweeps in Tibetan pigs was found in association with selection against non-coding variants, indicating an important role of regulatory mutations in Tibetan pig evolution. This study is important in understanding the evolution of Tibetan pigs and advancing our knowledge on animal adaptation to high-altitude environments.

The debris has a significant effect on glacier dynamic characteristics, which causes uneven mass balance changes, and then affects the change of glacier geometry evolves in response to climate. In our study, both energy balance and a two-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equation were used to simulate the ice temperature and velocity respectively at the main stream line of Koxkar glacier. The influence of the debris on ice temperature was described in the model. The ice velocity simulation was coupled with a description of ice viscosity under the influence of ice temperature. Our simulation results showed that the debris could increase the ice velocity and ablation in the middle of the glacier. Especially in the surface from 3200 to 3400 m.a.s.l, where the debris had great influence for ice velocity and temperature. From simulation results, we inferred that the ice thickness in this region would change obviously. Comparing with the measured thickness changes by ground-penetrating radar (GPR) between 1981 and 2008, the simulation result is consistent with measured results. Therefore, supraglacial lakes are easily developed in this region because of the high ice temperature and uneven ice surface. And the Landsat 8 remote-sensing image had verified this conclusion.

Herein, two of these species, Ilyocypris dentifera Sars, 1903 and Ilyocypris japonica Okubo, 1990, are redescribed, and a third species, Ilyocypris incus sp. nov., is described and named. This latter species has previously been reported from Japan and possibly Korea under the names Ilyocypris angulata Sars, 1903 and I. dentifera, but study of the hemipenes demonstrates that it is a separate species. Ilyocypris nipponica Okubo, 2004 nomen nudum previously reported from Japan is herein considered to be a junior synonym of I. dentifera. Tuberculated and non-tuberculated forms of both I. dentifera and I. japonica were recovered during this study and the presence or absence of tubercles is postulated to be related to environmental conditions, such as water chemistry or predation pressures. Although tuberculated forms of I. dentifera do occur, we concur with some previous studies that Ilyocypris angulata Sars, 1903 should be treated as a separate species, based on features of the hemipenes and carapaces. Figures of the carapaces and hemipenes of I. angulata, and Ilyocypris mongolica Martens, 1991, which is morphologically very close to I. japonica, are also presented for comparisons. This study confirms that three species of Ilyocypris inhabit North East Asian rice fields: I. dentifera, I. japonica and Ilyocypris incus sp. nov. Extant Ilyocypris species in North East Asia, including those from habitats other than rice fields, can be divided into two groups based on the Zenker organ, hemipenis, and sixth limb morphologies. These groups are postulated to represent two distinct lineages of Ilyocypris in North East Asia.

These phosphors can exhibit red emission with a broad excitation band in the blue region. The optimized concentration of Mn4+ in APF(6):Mn4+ was determined. The Racah parameters B and C of Mn4+ in APF(6):Mn4+ were also calculated. The results indicate that Mn4+ in CsPF6:Mn4+ experiences the weakest crystal field among APF(6):Mn4+. The phosphor CsPF6:Mn4+ prepared with the HPF6/K2MnF6 molar ratio of 10 : 1 has the strongest red emission and the highest external quantum efficiency of 50.4% among the samples. It has high thermal quenching resistance and its emission intensity at 160 degrees C is about 1.1 times higher than that at room temperature. This sample also can remarkably improve the color rendering index and decrease the colour rendering index of white light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs). Hence, CsPF6:Mn4+ could be used as a red-emitting phosphor for warm w-LEDs.

J	Lu, J; Wang, C; Zhang, JW; Tao, J				Lu, Jing; Wang, Chun; Zhang, Jiwei; Tao, Jian			A mixture model for responses and response times with a higher-order ability structure to detect rapid guessing behaviour	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						higher-order model; Markov chain Monte Carlo; mixture model; response time	HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; ABERRANT BEHAVIOR; MARKOV-CHAINS; RASCH MODEL; SPEED; ACCURACY	Many educational and psychological assessments focus on multidimensional latent traits that often have a hierarchical structure to provide both overall-level information and fine-grained diagnostic information. A test will usually have either separate time limits for each subtest or an overall time limit for administrative convenience and test fairness. In order to complete the items within the allocated time, examinees frequently adopt different test-taking behaviours during the test, such as solution behaviour and rapid guessing behaviour. In this paper we propose a new mixture model for responses and response times with a hierarchical ability structure, which incorporates auxiliary information from other subtests and the correlation structure of the abilities to detect rapid guessing behaviour. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is proposed for model estimation. Simulation studies reveal that all model parameters could be recovered well, and the parameter estimates had smaller absolute bias and mean squared error than the mixture unidimensional item response theory (UIRT) model. Moreover, the true positive rate of detecting rapid guessing behaviour is also higher than when using the mixture UIRT model separately for each subscale, whereas the false detection rate is much lower than the mixture UIRT model. The deviance information criterion and the logarithm of the pseudo-marginal likelihood are employed to evaluate the model fit. Finally, a real data analysis is presented to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed model.

The Chengjiang biota in South China contains numerous taxa that are exclusively known from this deposit, and thus offer a unique perspective on euarthropod diversity during the early Cambrian. One such endemic taxon is the non-trilobite artiopodan Sinoburius lunaris, which has been known for approximately three decades, but few details of its anatomy are well understood due to its rarity within the Chengjiang, as well as technical limitations for the study of these fossils. Furthermore, the available material does not provide clear information on the ventral organization of this animal, obscuring our understanding of phylogenetically significant details such as the appendages. Results We employed X-ray computed tomography to study the non-biomineralized morphology of Sinoburius lunaris. Due to the replacement of the delicate anatomy with pyrite typical of Chengjiang fossils, computed tomography reveals substantial details of the ventral anatomy of Sinoburius lunaris, and allow us to observe in detail the three-dimensionally preserved appendicular organization of this taxon for the first time. The dorsal exoskeleton consists of a crescent-shaped head shield with well-developed genal spines, a thorax with seven freely articulating tergites, and a fused pygidium with lateral and median spines. The head bears a pair of ventral stalked eyes that are accommodated by dorsal exoskeletal bulges, and an oval elongate ventral hypostome. The appendicular organization of the head is unique among Artiopoda. The deutocerebral antennae are reduced, consisting of only five podomeres, and bear an antennal scale on the second podomere that most likely represents an exite rather than a true ramus. The head includes four post-antennal biramous limb pairs. The first two biramous appendages are differentiated from the rest. The first appendage pair consists of a greatly reduced endopod coupled with a greatly elongated exopod with a potentially sensorial function. The second appendage pair carries a more conventionally sized endopod, but also has an enlarged exopod. The remaining biramous appendages are homonomous in their construction, but decrease in size towards the posterior end of the body. They consist of a basipodite with ridge-like crescentic endites, an endopod with seven podomeres and a terminal claw, and a lamellae-bearing exopod with a slender shaft. Contrary to previous reports, we confirm the presence of segmental mismatch in Sinoburius lunaris, expressed as diplotergites in the thorax. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses support the monophyly of Xandarellida within Artiopoda, and illuminate the internal relationships within this enigmatic clade. Our results allow us to propose a transformation series explaining the origin of archetypical xandarellid characters, such as the evolution of eye slits in Xandarella spectaculum and Phytophilaspis pergamena as derivates from the anterolateral notches in the head shield observed in Cindarella eucalla and Luohuilinella species. In this context, Sinoburius lunaris is found to feature several derived characters within the group, such as the secondary loss of eye slits and a high degree of appendicular tagmosis. Contrary to previous findings, our analyses strongly support close affinities between Sinoburius lunaris, Xandarella spectaculum and Phytophilaspis pergamena, although the precise relationships between these taxa are sensitive to different methodologies. Conclusions The revised morphology of Sinoburius lunaris, made possible through the use of computed tomography to resolve details of its three-dimensionally preserved appendicular anatomy, contributes towards an improved understanding of the morphology of this taxon and the evolution of Xandarellida more broadly. Our results indicate that Sinoburius lunaris possesses an unprecedented degree of appendicular tagmosis otherwise unknown within Artiopoda, with the implication that this iconic group of Palaeozoic euarthropods likely had a more complex ecology and functional morphology than previously considered. The application of computer tomographic techniques to the study of Chengjiang euarthropods holds exceptional promise for understanding the morphological diversity of these organisms, and also better reconstructing their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history.

Then, some properties of local pseudo almost automorphic functions are investigated. As applications, by adopting the concept of a pi-semigroup on time scales, we obtain some new sufficient conditions for the existence of local pseudo almost automorphic mild solutions for a class of semilinear dynamic equations on arbitrary time scales.

A thermodynamic study was performed to identify the mechanism of ZrB2 formation in Al-Si alloys. The precipitated B-bearing particles, i.e., ZrB, were determined to be ZrB2 via electron probe microanalysis. The composition of the Al-Si alloy, which could form stable ZrB2 particles, was determined by measuring and calculating the equilibrium concentrations of Zr and B and the solubility products of ZrB2 in a Si-saturated Al-Si alloy at different temperatures. Thereafter, the segregation coefficients of B between solid Si crystals and the Si-saturated Al-Si melt with and without Zr addition were estimated thermodynamically. The mechanism whereby the B removal from Si was enhanced with Zr addition was as follows: the Zr not only reduced the concentration of B in the molten Al-Si but also significantly reduced the segregation coefficient of B between the solid Si and Si-saturated Al-Si melt.

It is demonstrated that the precession frequency f decreases dramatically with the increasing interlayer thickness of Ta (t(Ta)) or Pt (t(Pt)). By fitting the f similar to H curves of different t(Ta) with the coherent precession model including the interfacial coupling interaction, the exchange coupling strength as well as the magnetization orientations of FePt and [CoNi](5) are determined. Meanwhile, it is found the magnetic damping constant alpha can be modulated considerably as well by adjusting the interlayer thickness. For the Ta interlayer, the alpha value decreases gradually with the increase in t(Ta) as the result of decreased coupling strength, while it shows a monotonic increasing behavior for the Pt layer. The increased alpha with t(Pt) can be attributed to the enhanced spin pumping contribution from Pt, which greatly exceeds the decreasing tendency caused by the reduced interfacial coupling. This study provides deep insights into the dynamic behaviors of the exchange-coupled magnetic system, which are valuable to achieve effective control of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics for spintronic applications.

It is based on the use of a Ni-Co-P nanostructure fabricated on nickel foam via electrode position from cobalt chloride and ammonium phosphate for 10 min. Time-dependent experiments show the transformation of Ni-Co-P nanoparticles to spheres. The resulting electrode display excellent electrochemical response to DA. Figures of merit include (a) a working potential of 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl); (b) an electrochemical sensitivity of 5262 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2); (c) a wide linear range (from 0.5 to 2350 mu M), and (d) a 1 mu M detection limit. The outstanding electrochemical performance is explained by the synergistic effects of large surface area, improved electron transfer, presence of free binders, and the presence of three active components (nickel, cobalt and phosphonium ion). Graphical abstract A Ni-Co-P nanostructure was electrodeposited on nickel foam to obtain an electrochemical sensor for amperometric determination of dopamine with outstanding performance.

In this paper, based on a geomagnetic field model (NGDC-720) and aeromagnetic data, we use power spectrum analysis of magnetic anomalies to estimate the Curie surface in Yunnan Province, China, and its adjacent areas. By combining the distribution of the Curie surface with regional heat flow, the geothermal gradient, crustal wave velocity ratio anomalies, high-conductivity layer anomalies, and the Moho surface, we reveal the connection between the undulation of the magnetic basement and the crustal structures. The results indicate that the uplift and depression of the Curie surface in the research area are distinct. The Curie surface is approximately inversely correlated to the surface heat flow. The Lijiang-Jianchuan-Baoshan-Tengchong and Jianchuan- Chuxiong- Kunming-Yuxi zones are two Curie surface uplift zones, and their crust-mantle heat flows are relatively high. The Curie surface uplift zone along the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault and Red River fault is consistent with the heading direction of the fault zone and is partially in agreement with the eastward mass flow of the Tibetan Plateau. The Curie surface uplift zone is consistent with the high wave velocity ratio and high-conductivity layer anomaly region of the crust. The depth of the Curie surface is less than the depth of the Moho surface.

This work is to discover potent Wee1 inhibitors which can be considered valuable. Materials & Methods: Herein, Ensemble docking using multiple crystal structures was considered an effective strategy in the virtual screening. The performance of 17 scoring functions obtained from different docking software was evaluated for molecular docking. Results: Two novel compounds B1 and A2 were identified as Wee1 inhibitors with IC50 values of 10.23 +/- 0.505 and 8.72 +/- 0.323 mu M, respectively. Further cell viability assay demonstrated that the two active compounds exhibited good anticancer activities. Conclusion: This provides a meaningful starting point for further structure optimization to discover more potent Wee1 inhibitors. [GRAPHICS] .

It plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism and biotransformation processes. Oxidoreductases have many subclasses with different functions, creating an important classification task in bioinformatics. In this paper, a dataset of 2640 oxidoreductase sequences was used to perform an analysis and comparison. The idea of dipeptides was introduced to process the Position Specific Score Matrix (PSSM), since each dipeptide consists of two amino acids and each column of PSSM corresponds to the information of one amino acid. Two kinds of dipeptide scores were proposed, the Standardization Normal Distribution PSSM (SND-PSSM) and the Correlation Coefficient PSSM (CC-PSSM). Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used to extract features from the SND-PSSM and CC-PSSM, and the two sets of extracted features are combined to form a new feature matrix, the RFE-SND-CC-PSSM. The results show that, with the proposed method and a kernel-based nonlinear SVM classifier, the accuracy can reach 95.56% by the Jackknife test. Our method greatly improves the accuracy of oxidoreductase subclass prediction. Using this method to predict the categories of the 6 major types of enzymes effectively improves its prediction accuracy to 94.54%, indicating that this method has general applicability to other protein problems. The results show that our method is effective and universally applicable, and might be complementary to the existing methods.

The TEC and deviation of TEC (Delta TEC) present remarkable perturbation after the reversal of the zonal wind during the SSW period. The Delta TEC presents enhancement during the daytime and decreases after sunset, especially around the temperature peak. Results of wavelet power spectra analysis show that the Delta TEC shows intensive semidiurnal and diurnal oscillations during the SSW period. The percentage of dTEC exhibits moderate correlation with solar geophysical drivers (such as solar wind speed, F-10.7, and Ap index) during the period of 11-26 February at low-latitude stations. The significant correlation between equatorial electrojet and the percentage of dTEC monitored at low latitude indicates that the equatorial electrojet plays a key role in the anomaly perturbation and periodic oscillation of TEC, while it has a weak correlation at middle latitude.

LMWLs have practical utility as a hydrologic framework and as benchmarks for evaluating hydroclimatic processes in isotope-enabled climate models. In this manuscript, we characterize the global distribution of LMWLs and compare them to LMWLs from model data. To evaluate the sensitivity of the covariance of stable isotope ratios to data set length, we paired time series rarifaction with Bayesian ellipse estimation. We then applied a threshold of 48 months and estimated LMWLs at 398 sites in 25 Koppen climate classes using orthogonal distance regression. Slopes ranged from 4.8 to 10.9, with an average of 7.64 +/- 0.64. Intercepts ranged from -24 parts per thousand to 27 parts per thousand, with an average of 6.85 +/- 6.2 parts per thousand. We identified three processes: (1) subcloud evaporation of rain, (2) atmospheric remoistening by rainfall evaporation, and (3) conditions of snow formation as important controls on slopes and intercepts in arid, humid, and seasonally snowy regions, respectively. We compared observational LMWLs with those from a suite of isotope-enabled climate models. At arid and snowy sites, model data produced higher slopes and intercepts than observational data. At humid sites, model data exhibited dampened variability in slopes and intercepts relative to observational data. These results indicate potential for improvement in the precipitation and/or isotope parameterizations of raindrop evaporation, advection of reevaporated water, evapotranspiration fractionation, and supersaturation in mixed-phase clouds. This meta-analysis demonstrates LMWLs utility for identifying specific hydroclimatic and isotopic processes in observations and models.

These processes drop information provided by PSSM in a way thus the feature representation is limited. Moreover, the high-dimensional feature representation of PSSM makes it incompatible with other feature extraction methods. We use the PSSM as the input of Recurrent Neural Network without any post-processing, the amino acids in protein sequences are regarded as time step in RNN. This way takes full advantage of the information that PSSM provides. In this study, the PSSM is input to the model directly and the internal information of PSSM is fully utilized, we propose an end-to-end solution and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Ultimately, the exploration of how to combine PSSM with traditional feature extraction methods is carried out and achieve slightly improved performance. Our network architecture is implemented in Python and is available at https://github.com/ YellowcardD/RNN-for-membrane-protein-types-prediction.

For the fusion of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography), a novel algorithm is proposed in this paper based on LatentLRR (Latent Low Rank Representation) and gradient transfer. LatentLRR is a meaningful tool for separating out detailed information and saliency information. In order to produce saliency information fused result, image statics is used through the corresponding detailed information. For detailed information, it is separated into high frequency parts and low frequency parts by NSCT (Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform), the former are fused by the method of scale based, and the latter are merged by local energy maxima. To obtain the reconstructed image, it needs to integrate high frequency fused parts and low frequency fused parts into one image by inverse NSCT. Finally, the final image can be given by combining the reconstructed images and saliency information fused result into one image, and for a better visual effect, optimize the final result by gradient transfer. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the experiments of ten pair clinical medical images MRI/CT, the proposed algorithm receives a comprehensive advantage in preserving the detailed and gradient information, not only in visual effects but also in objective evaluation.

Manifold regularized semi-supervised learning (MRSSL) thus received intensive attention recently because it successfully exploits the local structure of data distribution including both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage the generalization ability of a learning model. Although there are many representative works in MRSSL, including Laplacian regularization (LapR) and Hessian regularization, how to explore and exploit the local geometry of data manifold is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a fully efficient approximation algorithm of graph p-Laplacian, which significantly saving the computing cost. And then we propose p-LapR (pLapR) to preserve the local geometry. Specifically, p-Laplacian is a natural generalization of the standard graph Laplacian and provides convincing theoretical evidence to better preserve the local structure. We apply pLapR to support vector machines and kernel least squares and conduct the implementations for scene recognition. Extensive experiments on the Scene 67 dataset, Scene 15 dataset, and UC-Merced dataset validate the effectiveness of pLapR in comparison to the conventional manifold regularization methods.

It is endemic to southern China, central Vietnam, and eastern Laos, and today it is nearly extinct in the wild. Forest community characteristics and population structure of G. pensilis in China have remained unknown up to now. We investigated six swamp forest stands and analyzed their forest community characteristics (i.e. vertical stratification, species composition, and diversity) and population structure, including the frequency distribution of DBH (diameter at breast height) and age-classes as found in Fujian Province, southeastern China. The vertical stratifications of all the forest stands were rather simple. The remaining wild specimens ranged from roughly 15 to some 357 years for an average of ca. 85 years, with only a few individuals less than 20 years old. Compared with the stands and populations of G. pensilis in Vietnam, the taxonomic compositions of the stands in the two regions were different, except for the dominant species-G. pensilis. The Shannon-Wiener index showed the overstory of each stand had much lower diversity (0.26 on average) in Fujian Province than that (1.97 on average) in Vietnam, whereas the diversity indices were about the same (around 2.41) for the understories in the two regions. Furthermore, we discovered 18 G. pensilis seedlings at the study sites in Fujian Province. This discovery demonstrates that G. pensilis regeneration is extremely poor and its populations are declining, although these populations are relatively healthier than those in Vietnam.

J	Abdusalam, A; Li, QJ				Abdusalam, Aysajan; Li, Qing Jun			Elevation-related variation in the population characteristics of distylous Primula nivalis affects female fitness and inbreeding depression	PLANT DIVERSITY			English	Article						Inbreeding depression; Pollination treatment; Seed mass; Seed quality	POLLEN LIMITATION; SEED MASS; STORAGE TIME; REPRODUCTION; EVOLUTION; SIZE; GERMINATION; PRIMROSE; WEIGHT; NUMBER	The population characteristics of distylous species are highly sensitive to stochastic natural selection pressure. Therefore, populations growing under different environmental conditions may vary in floral morph ratios, potentially affecting female fitness and leading to inbreeding depression. However, the variation in offspring quality among populations as a result of inbreeding depression is poorly understood in distylous species. This study investigates variations in plant density, seed mass, seed viability, female fitness, and post-dispersal inbreeding depression in both sexual morphs (long-styled and short-styled plants) of the distylous Primula nivalis that were subjected to different pollination treatments along an elevational gradient from 1657 to 2704 ma.s.l. Population characteristics (morph plant density and ratio) and fruit set were significantly affected by sexual morph and elevation. Plant density and fruit set frequencies were lower for short-styled than for long-styled plants at 2704 ma.s.l. The seeds from the cross-pollinated flowers of both morphs were higher in quality than those of self-pollinated flowers. The female fitness of seeds from cross-pollinated flowers of both morphs was higher than that of seeds from open-pollinated and self-pollinated flowers. The female fitness of seeds from long-styled flowers was higher than that of seeds from short-styled flowers at all elevations. Inbreeding depression increased with elevation among plants with short-styled flowers but not among those with long-styled flowers. Variation in the elevation-dependent mating system might influence female fitness and affect inbreeding depression in both floral morphs. In conclusion, the low quality of seeds from short-styled flowers at high elevations might decrease short-styled flower frequency, affecting population characteristics.

In the present study, we identified 14 candidate HMA genes named BrrHMA1-BrrHMA8 from the turnip genome and analyzed the phylogeny, gene structure, chromosome distribution, and conserved domains and motifs of HMAs in turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa). According to our phylogenetic tree, the BrrHMAs are divided into a Zn/Cd/Co/Pb subclass and Cu/Ag subclass. The BrrHMA members show similar structural characteristics within subclasses. To explore the roles of BrrHMAs in turnip, we compared the gene sequences and expression patterns of the BrrHMA genes between a Cd-tolerant landrace and a Cd-sensitive landrace. Most BrrHMA genes showed similar spatial expression patterns in both Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive turnip landraces; some BrrHMA genes, however, were differentially expressed in specific tissue in Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive turnip. Specifically, BrrHMA genes in the Zn/Cd/Co/Pb subclass shared the same coding sequence but were differentially expressed in Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive turnip landraces under Cd stress. Our findings suggest that the stable expression and up-regulated expression of BrrHMA Zn/Cd/Co/Pb subclass genes under Cd stress may contribute to the higher Cd tolerance of turnip landraces.

However, empirical evidence to support this prediction is scarce. We investigated the influences of semi-natural habitats and nesting resources on concentration effect and waylaying effect of bees, as well as their consequences on crop pollination in landscapes. Ninety-seven vetch patches with independent gradients of size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the concentration effect and the waylaying effect. For other solitary bees, the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect. Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density positively predict vetch pollination services. The landscape-modified concentration effect and waylaying effect cascaded to vetch pollination by modifying A. waltoni density. Our findings indicated that landscape composition could modify the spatial foraging patterns of bees and influence pollination services provided to crops, but those varied among different taxonomic groups.

There are existing differences in disease resistance between different cattle breeds. However, the genetic basis underlying disease resistance differences is poorly understood and requires further investigation. In this study, many immune- and disease-relevant genes and pathways were identified between Holstein and Yunnan humped cattle using RNA-sequencing. The novel findings regarding the genetic basis underlying disease resistance differences between zebu cattle and taurine cattle will provide a scientific basis and key technical support for disease-resistant breeding of domestic cattle, and thus have important social and economic significance. Previous studies have shown that Yunnan humped cattle have higher disease resistance than pure taurine cattle, such as Holsteins. However, there exists limited information about the molecular genetic basis underlying disease resistance differences between them. The objective of this study was to compare differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the liver and spleen tissues of Holstein and Yunnan humped cattle through comparative transcriptome analysis, using RNA-sequencing. In total, 1564 (647 up- and 917 down-regulated genes) and 1530 (716 up- and 814 down-regulated genes) DEGs were obtained in the liver and spleen tissues of Holstein and Yunnan humped cattle comparison groups, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly associated with the RIG-I signaling pathway, immune responses, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein complex and complement activation, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) infection. Some genes related to immune function, such as C1QB, CD55, MASP2, C4BPA, MAVS, NOD2, and CD46, were up-regulated in Yunnan humped cattle, while C2, SERPING1, SERPINE1, TIRAP, TLR2, and TLR6 were down-regulated. The expression levels of 11 selected DEGs, analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), were consistent with the deep sequencing results by RNA-sequencing. Our results will provide a scientific basis and key technical support for disease-resistant breeding of domestic cattle.

This paper is concerned with such a model for an isentropic Chaplygin gas. The Riemann problem is solved with four kinds of structures. The first is composed of the contact discontinuities, the second contains an overcompressible delta-wave (delta-shock wave), and the third and fourth involve a contact discontinuity and a kind of non-overcompressible delta-wave. One of the highlights of this paper lies in the introduction of the non-overcompressible delta-waves.

The CdS quantum dots conjugation with L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp@CdS QDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process. The QDs have a fluorescence emission band maximum at 595 nm with a quantum yield of 11%. The obtained CdS QDs exhibit a particle size of 1.63 +/- 0.28 nm and look like quantum dot flowers. Basically, the fluorescence intensity of L-Asp@CdS QDs can be enhanced only upon addition of Ag+ and a redshift in the fluorescence spectrum was observed. Under optimum conditions, the fluorescence enhancement of L-Asp@CdS QDs appeared to exhibit a good linear relationship in between 100-7000 nM (R-2 = 0.9945) with the Ag+ concentration, with a detection limit of 39 nM. The results indicated that the L-Asp@CdS QDs were well used in detection for Ag+ as fluorescence probe in aqueous solution with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, the sensing system has been applied in detection Ag+ in real water samples. The recovery test results were 98.6%similar to 113%, and relative standard deviation (n = 5) is less than 3.6%, which was satisfactory.

Here, NiFe2O4 nano-octahedrons were calcinated from NiFe-bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOFs) octahedrons synthesized by a facile refluxing method. The co-existence of p-Phthalic acid (PTA) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) promotes the formation of smooth NiFe-bimetallic MOFs octahedrons. After subsequent thermal treatment, a big weight loss (about 85%) transformed NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (30 nm) into NiFe2O4 porous nano-octahedrons with hollow interiors. The NiFe2O4 nano-octahedron based sensor exhibited excellent gas sensing properties for toluene with a nice stability, fast response, and recovery time (25 s/40 s to 100 ppm toluene), and a lower detection limitation (1 ppm) at 260 degrees C. The excellent toluene-sensing properties can not only be derived from the hollow interiors combined with porous nano-octahedrons to favor the diffusion of gas molecules, but also from the efficient catalytic activity of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles.

Fresh fecal samples from the three wild Asian elephants were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing to study the diversity of their gastrointestinal microbes and cellulolytic enzymes. There were a high abundance of Firmicutes and a higher abundance of hemicellulose-degrading hydrolases than cellulose-degrading hydrolases in the wild Asian elephants. Furthermore, there were a high abundance and a rich diversity of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) obtained from the gene set annotation of the three samples, with the majority of them showing low identity with the CAZy database entry. About half of the CAZymes had no species source at the phylum or genus level. These indicated that the wild Asian elephants might possess greater ability to digest hemicellulose than cellulose to provide energy, and moreover, the gastrointestinal tracts of these pachyderms might be a potential source of novel efficient lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Therefore, the exploitation and utilization of these enzyme resources could help us to alleviate the current energy crisis and ensure food security.

In a research program to discover new molecules to help overcome this problem, 14 new lanostane-type triterpenoids, gibbosicolids A-G (2-8) and gibbosic acids I-O (9-15), were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma gibbosum, along with seven known triterpenoid derivatives. These compounds featured high levels of oxidation, epimerization, and gamma-lactonization. Structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and HRMS data. Absolute configurations were assigned based on quantum chemical calculations, including calculated chemical shift with DP4+ analysis, coupling constants, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) methods. Results show that the calculated NMR with DP4+ analysis could not reliably establish the overall spatial configuration of molecules possessing independent and free-rotational stereodusters. All these compounds significantly increased the sensitivity of fluconazole (FLC)-resistant C. albicans to FLC. Compounds 2, 5, 9, 12, 16, 17, and 21 exhibited strong antifungal activity against FLC-resistant C. albicans when combined with FLC, with MIC50 values ranging from 3.8 to 8.8 mu g/mL.

After the discovery that PL centers occupy only specific morphological structures in CsPb2Br5, a two-step highly sensitive and noninvasive optical technique is employed to resolve the controversy. Same-spot Raman-PL as a static property-structure probe reveals that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are contributing to the green emission of CsPb2Br5; pressure-dependent Raman-PL with a diamond anvil cell as a dynamic probe further rules out point defects such as Br vacancies as an alternative mechanism. Optical absorption under hydrostatic pressure shows that the bandgap of CsPb2Br5 is 0.3-0.4 eV higher than previously reported values and remains nearly constant with pressure up to 2 GPa in good agreement with full-fledged density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using ion exchange of Br with Cl and I, it is further proved that CsPbBr3-xXx (X = Cl or I) is responsible for the strong visible PL in CsPb2Br5-xXx. This experimental approach is applicable to all PL-active materials to distinguish intrinsic defects from extrinsic nanocrystals, and the findings pave the way for new design and development of highly efficient optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halides.

Understanding the evolution of topics in diatom research will provide a clear and needed guide to strengthen research on diatoms. However, such an overview remains unavailable. In this study, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative model, to identify topics and determine their trends (i.e., cold and hot topics) by analyzing the abstracts of 19,000 publications from the Web of Science that were related to diatoms during 1991-2018. A total of 116 topics were identified from a Bayesian model selection. The hot topics (diversity, environmental indicator, climate change, land use, and water quality) that were identified by LDA indicated that diatoms are increasingly used as indicators to assess water quality and identify modern climate change impacts due to intensive anthropogenic activities. In terms of cold topics (growth rate, culture growth, cell life history, copepod feeding, grazing by microzooplankton, zooplankton predation, and primary productivity) and hot topics (spatial-temporal distribution, morphology, molecular identification, gene expression, and review), we determined that basic studies on diatoms have decreased and that studies tend to be more comprehensive. This study notes that future directions in diatom research will be closely associated with the application of diatoms in environmental management and climate change to cope with environmental challenges, and more comprehensive issues related to diatoms should be considered.

Ethanedithiol was used as the grafting agent to introduce thiol groups onto HKUST-1, and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride was then grafted onto SH-HKUST-1 using thiol groups. Finally, the quaternary ammonium functional group was immobilized onto the carrier by performing a quaternization reaction. The structure and property of TEBAC-HKUST-1 MOR were characterized by TGA, N-2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR, SEM, and XRD. TEBAC-HKUST-1 MOR was used to remove metal cyanide complexes from wastewater. The adsorption was rapid, and the metal cyanide complexes including Pt(CN)(4)(2-), Co(CN)(6)(3-), Cu(CN)(3)(2-), and Fe(CN)(6)(3-) were removed in 30 min. TEBAC-HKUST-1 MOR exhibited a high stability in neutral and weak basic aqueous solutions. Furthermore, Pt(II) could be efficiently recovered through two-step elution. The recovery rate of Pt(II) for five cycles were over 92.0% in the mixture solution containing Pt(CN)(4)(2-), Co(CN)(6)(3-), Cu(CN)(3)(2-), and Fe(CN)(6)(3-). The kinetic data were best fitted with the pseudo second-order model. Moreover, the isothermal data were best fitted with the Langmuir model. The thermodynamic results show that the adsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process. TEBAC-HKUST-1 MOR not only exhibited excellent ability for the rapid removal of metal cyanide complexes, but also provided a new idea for the extraction of noble metals from cyanide-contaminated water.

Here we report a proof-of-concept study on the active-site evaluation for a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite catalyst with specific pentagon carbon defective patterns (D-HOPG). It is demonstrated that specific carbon defect types (an edged pentagon in this work) could be selectively created via controllable nitrogen doping. Work-function analyses coupled with macro and micro-electrochemical performance measurements suggest that the pentagon defects in D-HOPG served as major active sites for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction, even much superior to the pyridinic nitrogen sites in nitrogen-doped highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. This work enables us to elucidate the relative importance of the specific carbon defects versus nitrogen-dopant species and their respective contributions to the observed overall acidic oxygen reduction reaction activity.

Herein, laser or light responsive pharmaceutical delivery nanoparticles are designed, by taking the advantages of redox responsive selenium (Se) substituted polymer as shell and photosensitive porphyrin zirconium metal-organic frameworks (MOF) as core. In detail, redox cleavable di-(1-hydroxylundecyl) selenide (DH-Se), biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) are randomly polymerized to form poly(DH-Se/PEG/PPG urethane), which is used to coat the reactive oxygen species' (ROS) producible porous porphyrin zirconium metal organization formulation (PCN-224 MOF) to form the final poly(DH-Se/PEG/PPG urethane)@MOF shell-core nanoparticle with spherical shape by emulsion approach. Interestingly, poly(DH-Se/PEG/PPG urethane)@MOF nanoparticles with loading of chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) experience a fast and controllable release, which can realize the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy upon irradiation with laser light, due to the light-triggered ROS production by MOF which further causes the cleavage of poly(DH-Se/PEG/PPG urethane) polymer chain and the release of encapsulated DOX. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first design of utilizing MOF and selenium substituted polymer as controllable drug release carriers, which might be beneficial for precise chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy combination.

To address limitations of these approaches, we propose a model where both the ordinal phenotype and the genotype are viewed as manifestations of an underlying multivariate normal random variable. The proposed method allows modeling the ordinal phenotype, the genotype and covariates jointly. We employ the generalized estimating equation technique and M-estimation theory to estimate the model parameters and deduce the corresponding asymptotic distribution. Numerical simulations and real data applications are also conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method with those of methods based on the logit and probit models. Even though there may be potential limitations in Type I error rate control for our method, the gains in power can prove its practical value in case of exactly ordinal phenotypes.

J	Zhang, J; Fan, H; He, DM; Chen, JW				Zhang, Jing; Fan, Hui; He, Daming; Chen, Jiwei			Integrating precipitation zoning with random forest regression for the spatial downscaling of satellite-based precipitation: A case study of the Lancang-Mekong River basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						lancang-mekong river basin; precipitation zoning; random forest regression; REOF analysis; spatial downscaling	NCEP-CFSR; TRMM; PRODUCTS; ROTATION; NDVI; REGIONALIZATION; TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHM; REGIONS; FUTURE	Downscaling satellite-based precipitation to fine scales is crucial for deepening our understanding of global hydrologic cycles and water-related issues. In this study, a novel approach that integrates precipitation zoning with random forest regression is proposed for the spatial downscaling of satellite-based precipitation. Precipitation zoning is delineated through iterative rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analyses of ground- and satellite-based precipitation observations. Random forest regression is applied to link the satellite-based precipitation to 1-km-resolution predictors such as latitude (Lat), longitude (Lon), elevation, aspect, slope, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The accuracy of the resultant downscaled precipitation is evaluated based on five statistical evaluation indices. The performance of the proposed approach is exemplified in the Lancang-Mekong River basin, taking Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) products acquired in 2001 (wet year), 2005 (normal year), and 2009 (dry year) as the databases. The results show that seven precipitation subregions can be roughly distinguished in the study basin. Zoning-based downscaling outperforms non-zoning-based downscaling in terms of accuracy, resulting in statistically significant reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 1-17% across the entire basin. Among the selected predictors, the variables Lat and Lon are the most important for precipitation estimation, whereas the remaining variables have lesser and subregion-dependent importance. The proposed approach is promising for generating high-spatial-resolution precipitation data in regions with sparse ground-based observations and differentiated climatic regimes.

Due to low or even no samples from some areas, we must adopt indirect model approaches. Existing indirect small area estimation methods often assume that a single nested error regression model is suitable for all the small areas. In particular, the effects of the auxiliary variables are either fixed or have a single attraction center. In some applications, it can be more appropriate to cluster the small areas so that the effects of the auxiliary variables are fixed but have multiple centers in the nested error regression model. In this paper, we examine an extended nested error regression model in which the auxiliary variables have mixed effects with multiple centers. We use a penalty approach to identify these centers and estimate the model parameters simultaneously. We then propose two new small area mean estimators and construct estimators of their mean square errors. Simulations based on artificial and realistic finite populations show that the new estimators can be efficient. Furthermore, the confidence intervals based on the new methods have accurate coverage probabilities. We illustrate the proposed methods with the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics conducted in Canada.

The high sensing performances of methane gas sensor still remain a considerable challenge. Herein, to solve problems mentioned above, nanoporous network SnO2 (NN-SnO2) construct with ultra-small nanoparticles, which exhibits excellent gas-sensing performances for methane, are successfully synthesized via a weak acid glucose-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The NN-SnO2 displays three particular particle morphologies: roundness, oval and polygon, with an average particle size of similar to 9 nm. When evaluated as a sensing material for methane, the NN-SnO2 sensor exhibits ultra-high response (R-a/R-g = 9.80), fast response/recovery times (tau(res)/tau(recov)= 1 s/3 s) toward 3000 ppm methane at a operating temperature of 420 degrees C, which are far superior to the vast majority methane semiconducting sensors, and more importantly, it has barely been reported that the sensor based on NN-SnO2 presented such excellent gas-sensing performances for methane. The outstanding response of the NN-SnO2 for methane gas is derived from the unique mesopores nature and small particles sizes of the as-synthesized NN-SnO2, and the charge transfer between the surface of SnO2 nanoparticles and methane gas molecules.

A stochastic predator-prey model was built to describe the corporation financial condition. The mean limiting extinction time was proposed to measure the corporation financial stability. The model parameters were estimated by using Bayesian approach with real corporation financial data. Experimental results show that: (i) an increase of system risk corresponds to a decrease of the corporation stability; (ii) the optimal initial financial condition enhances the corporation stability to its maximum extent; (iii) under the optimal initial financial condition, the optimal system parameters and system risk strength can be observed.

It is found that the CCR of stock price in financial market is equivalent to the escape rate of the drawdown time series corresponding to price series. Based on the mean escape rate, the analytical solution of CCR of financial market of stock price described by Black-Scholes model is obtained. For the CCR, empirical researches show that the theoretical results of the Heston model are in good agreement with the results of the real financial data of the S&P 500. The parameters of Heston model are estimated based on the least square estimation of the mean square error of probability density of return between the proposed model and S&P 500 data set. Then, we discuss the dynamic behaviors of CCR and the results indicate that (i) the monotonic and non-monotonic features are observed in the behaviors of CCR as a function of system parameters; (ii) we can find critical phenomena, resonance and inverse resonance behaviors in the function of CCR vs. mean reversion of volatility; (ii) the parameter variation induces the appearance of noise enhancement stability in the function of CCR vs. amplitude of volatility fluctuation.

MTBF crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P2(1)/c. In the crystal structure, the MTBF molecules are connected into a one-dimensional band and then a two-dimensional sheet by hydrogen bonds of the N-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot O types. The sheets are further linked to produce a three-dimensional network via C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. The molecules aggregate via these intermolecular forces, which restrain the intramolecular motions (RIM) and decrease the energy loss in the aggregation state, so as to open the radiative channels, and thus MTBF exhibits excellent fluorescence by aggregation-induced emission (AIE) enhancement.

Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated the roles of miRNAs in regulating ER stress in the liver of rats with obesity. Methods We used miRNA microarray to determine the miRNA expression profiles in the liver of rats fed with a high fat diet (HFD). We used prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter assay to identify the target gene of miRNAs. To overexpress the miRNA miR-30b or inhibit miR-30b rats were injected with lentivirus particles containing PGLV3-miR-30b or PGLV3-miR-30b antimiR through tail vein. Hepatic steatosis was measured using transient elastography in human subjects. Results Our data showed that miR-30b was markedly up-regulated in the liver of HFD-treated rats. Bioinformatic and in vitro and in vivo studies led us to identify sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b), as a novel target of miR-30b. Overexpression of miR-30b induced ER stress and insulin resistance in rats fed with normal diet, whereas inhibition of miR-30b by miR-30b antimiR suppressed ER stress and insulin resistance in HFD-treated rats. Finally, our data demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between serum miR-30b levels and hepatic steatosis or homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in human subjects. Conclusions Our findings suggest that miR-30b represents not only a potential target for the treatment of insulin resistance, but also a non-invasive disease biomarker of NAFLD.

Differential effects of plant growth-promoting bacteria on invasive and native plants	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Invasive plant; Ageratina adenophora; Native plant; Rhizosphere bacteria; Plant growth promotion	SOIL PATHOGENS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; RHIZOSPHERE; ALLOCATION; MECHANISM; EXPANSION; FEEDBACK; LEGACIES	A total of 390 bacterial strains were obtained from rhizosphere soils of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, and common native plants. These strains were evaluated for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) characteristics, including IAA and siderophore production and phosphate solubilization. These traits were dependent on bacterial phylogenetic position but independent of isolation sources. Twenty-four phylogenetically distinct strains were selected and evaluated for their effects on the plant performance of A. adenophora and the two native plants Fallopia multiflora and Arthraxon lanceolatus. All strains had a neutral influence on germination rate; however, the germination timing and aboveground and belowground growth of the three tested plants were significantly changed. Among all tested strains, 20.8% and 16.7% were beneficial for the aboveground and belowground growth of A. adenophora, but none were beneficial to the two native species. In contrast, no strain negatively affected the performance of A. adenophora, but more than half of the strains showed detrimental effects on the belowground growth of the two native species, and approximately half of them delayed the germination timing of F. multiflora. The phylogenetic position of strains distinctly affected plant performance. The bacteria accumulated in the rhizosphere soil of A. adenophora showed a host-specific growth-promotion of A. adenophora; however, such bacteria showed no more detrimental effects on the growth of the two native species than those inhabiting the native plants. Our data suggested that the increased bacterial number and altered species structure in the soils were able to provide a competitive advantage to A. adenophora after invasion. (C) 2019 SAAB.

This study proposes a new algorithm for calibrating camera intrinsic parameters using the properties of the polar of circular points (PCPs). Because the PCPs are asymptotic, which are self-conjugate diameters of the circle, the obtained PCPs can determine the image of the circular points and a group of orthogonal vanishing points in the image plane. On this basis, the camera parameters can be calibrated. The results of the simulation experiment and the data of the real experiment prove that the proposed method is effective and feasible.

The retrieval of lysosomal components following phagolysosomal digestion of cell corpses remains poorly understood. Here we reveal that the amino acid transporter SLC-36.1 is essential for lysosome reformation during cell corpse clearance in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Loss of slc-36.1 leads to formation of phagolysosomal vacuoles arising from cell corpse-containing phagosomes. In the absence of slc-36.1, phagosome maturation is not affected, but the retrieval of lysosomal components is inhibited. Moreover, loss of PPK-3, the C. elegans homologue of the PtdIns3P 5-kinase PIKfyve, similarly causes accumulation of phagolysosomal vacuoles that are defective in phagocytic lysosome reformation. SLC-36.1 and PPK-3 function in the same genetic pathway, and they directly interact with one another. In addition, loss of slc-36.1 and ppk-3 causes strong defects in autophagic lysosome reformation in adult animals. Our findings thus suggest that the PPK-3-SLC-36.1 axis plays a central role in both phagocytic and autophagic lysosome formation.

The lasing gain medium is consisted of a lower refractive index (RI) rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) dye solution. With this configuration, we have presented the study on the lasing coupling efficiency and lasing emission spectrum affected by the RI of the dye solution under different polarization states of the pump light. When the fiber is pumped by a linearly s- or p-polarized light, the intensity of the emitted whispering gallery modes (WGMs) lasing, i.e., transverse magnetic (TM) or transverse electric (TE) mode, decreases by approximately two-fold as the RI of the dye solution increases from 1.325 to 1.419, meaning a significant difference on the lasing coupling efficiency is achieved under different RI of the dye solution. When the fiber is excited by a s- and p-mixed polarized light, the mode separation between the adjacent TM and TE mode decreases with the increase of the RI of the dye solution, providing a simple and effective method for applications, such as RI sensing.

Inspired by the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to image-to-image task, we propose a novel FuseGAN to fulfill the images-to-image for multi-focus image fusion. To satisfy the requirement of dual input-to-one output, the encoder of the generator in FuseGAN is designed as a Siamese network. The least square GAN objective is employed to enhance the training stability of FuseGAN, resulting in an accurate confidence map for focus region detection. Also, we exploit the convolutional conditional random fields technique on the confidence map to reach a refined final decision map for better focus region detection. Moreover, due to the lack of a large-scale standard dataset, we synthesize a large enough multi-focus image dataset based on a public natural image dataset PASCAL VOC 2012, where we utilize a normalized disk point spread function to simulate the defocus and separate the background and foreground in the synthesis for each image. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method presents accurate decision maps for focus regions in multi-focus images, such that the fused images are superior to 11 recent state-of-the-art algorithms, not only in visual perception, but also in quantitative analysis in terms of five metrics.

The simulated results show that the SWS based on land use cover data for the 2010s (LUC10) is lower than that based on land use cover data for the 1980s (LUC80) by a difference of 0.17ms(-1); the LUCC effects also result in a decrease of 9.0% of the probability of strong wind. The LUCC effects induce significant alteration of the roughness length, causing changes in the drag coefficient and friction velocity, and thereby decrease SWS. A 0.1m increase in roughness length could cause a 0.003 increase in drag coefficient and a 0.015ms(-1) increase in friction velocity. The contributions of LUCC to the SWS changes vary among different regions. The increase of SWS in Northeastern China is caused by the changes from deciduous broadleaf to deciduous needleleaf forests, mixed forests and croplands, and these changes decrease the surface roughness length, drag coefficient and friction velocity. The significant decrease of SWS over the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is induced by the changes from closed shrubland and cropland/natural vegetation mosaic to evergreen broadleaf and deciduous broadleaf forest. The slowdown of SWS over the Shandong Peninsula, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta can be attributed to the extension of urban and built-up areas and the decrease of croplands and the cropland/natural vegetation mosaic. The slowdown in SWS caused by LUCC is also revealed by the friction wind model (FWM); however, the FWM presented more significant effects of LUCC on decrease in SWS.

Phylogenetic analysis recovers a xandarellid affinity for L. deletres, representing only the fifth described species of this clade. L. deletres possesses a head shield that is about one-fifth of the total body length and a trunk with 30 tergites, the reduced anterior-most tergite and terminal three tergites lacking pleural elongations. Anteriorly situated notches in the head shield are associated with stalked eyes, in contrast to the more posterior, enclosed eye slits present in Xandarella. Posterior to the antennae there are at least 11 pairs of biramous appendages preserved, including three pairs in the head. The morphology of the midline gut of L. deletres, in which lateral, unbranched diverticula are wider towards the front of the body, is a characteristic also found in various trilobites. The dorsoventrally flattened exoskeleton suggests a benthic or nektobenthic mode of life for L. deletres, as for other trilobitomorphs, and it likely used its well-developed anteriorly positioned eyes for searching out food, either to scavenge or to find prey.

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating shows that these rocks were emplaced in Late Mesoproterozoic time (similar to 1028 to 1019 Ma). Relative to typical I-type and S-type granitoids, all the samples are characterized by low Sr and Eu, and high high-field-strength element contents, high TFeO/MgO, enriched rare earth element compositions and negative Eu anomalies, indicating that they share the geochemical signatures of A-type granitoid. They can be further divided into two groups: Group I and Group II. Group I are A(1)-type felsic rocks and were produced by fractional crystallization of alkaline basaltic magmas. The Group II felsic lavas belong to the A(2)-type and were derived by partial melting of a crustal source with mixing of mantle-derived magmas. Both Group I and Group II felsic lavas may erupt in a continental back-arc setting. The coexistence of A(1)- and A(2)-type rocks in the southwestern Yangtze Block suggests that they can occur in the same tectonic setting.

Characterization of Cu and Cd biosorption by Pseudomonas sp. strain DC-B3 isolated from metal mine soil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Biosorption; Cu2+ removal; Cd2+ removal; Desorption; Functional groups; Resistant bacterial strain	AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; HEAVY-METALS; CADMIUM BIOSORPTION; AGRICULTURAL WASTE; REMOVAL; IONS; BACILLUS; COPPER; ZINC; ADSORPTION	A Cu- and Cd-resistant bacterial strain, DC-B3, was isolated from heavy metal-contaminated soils in a Cu mine, was identified as belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and biosorbed Cu2+ and Cd2+ from aqueous solution in the present study. Its biosorption properties as a function of environmental parameters such as contact time, initial concentration, pH, temperature and bacterial dosage were investigated through batch experiments, and the removal capacity peaked at pH 6.0, 40 degrees C and 0.5gbiomassL(-1) at an initial concentration of 105mgL(-1). Sorption occurred extremely rapidly at the beginning, equilibrium was reached after approximately 1h and 4h for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively, and the biosorption kinetic data for both metals were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model (r(2)>0.99). Sorption isotherms showed that the adsorptions of both metals were highly favourable, and equilibrium data were better described by the Langmuir model (r(2)>0.98 for Cu2+ and 0.99 for Cd2+), with the estimated maximum sorption capacities of 12.6 and 26.5mgg(-1) for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively. Desorption assays suggested that biosorption was a chemical process and that a fraction of the metal ions might have entered the bacterial cells. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl and phosphate functional groups on the bacterial cell walls might be mainly responsible for the biosorption, although their contributions to the binding of Cu2+ and Cd2+ were different. This result implied that the strain DC-B3 can be used as a potentially eco-friendly and efficient biosorbent for the remediation of Cu(II) and Cd(II) contaminants.	[Liang, Y.; Chen, J.

We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and find that both the leptonic and leptonic-hadronic models can well reproduce the multiband observations of the nebula with appropriate model parameters. Combining with dynamical evolution of the PWN, we investigate the time evolution of photon SED and radiative luminosity in the X-ray and TeV gamma-ray bands of G54.1+0.3. The results indicate that the synchrotron spectrum and radiative luminosity in the X-ray band of the PWN calculated with these two models have obvious differences as the age increases to about 4 kyr, and the largest difference is present at about 40 kyr. The gamma-ray luminosity calculated by the leptonic-hadronic model shows that the contribution of TeV photons arising from the decay of neutral pions produced in proton-proton interaction also changes with time and is always important for modifying the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of G54.1+0.3 during the evolution of the PWN.

The global distribution of this Glade makes it an excellent group to test hypotheses regarding the processes underlying tropical intercontinental disjunctions. More specifically, it allows us to test whether current distribution patterns resulted from recent transoceanic long-distance dispersal or ancient vicariance after boreotropical migration. We reconstructed the phylogeny of Nettles with the nuclear ITS and four plastid DNA regions (rbcL, trnL-F, matK and rpl14-rpl36) using Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony approaches. We inferred divergence times using a Bayesian uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and ancestral areas using the divergenceextinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model. Our results indicate a tropical Asian origin for the tribe during the late Paleocene. Migration events to Eurasia, South America and Africa occurred mainly during the Oligocene and Miocene. However, several long-distance dispersal events, including dispersals from Asia to Hawaii or Australasia, were inferred to have occurred from the Miocene onwards. The fleshy fruits and winged diaspores of several taxa are suited for long-distance dispersal.

The purpose of this study is to understand the level of genomic diversity and the extent of admixture in each Yunnan native cattle breed. Methods: All 120 individuals were genotyped using Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (777,962 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]). Quality control and genomic diversity indexes were calculated using PLINK software. The principal component analysis (PCA) was assessed using SMARTPCA program implemented in EIGENSOFT software. The ADMIXTURE software was used to reveal admixture patterns among breeds. Results: A total of 604,630 SNPs was obtained after quality control procedures. Among six breeds, the highest level of mean heterozygosity was found in Zhaotong cattle from Northeastern Yunnan, whereas the lowest level of heterozygosity was detected in Dehong humped cattle from Western Yunnan. The PCA based on a pruned dataset of 233,788 SNPs clearly separated Dehong humped cattle (supposed to be a pure zebu breed) from other five breeds. The admixture analysis further revealed two clusters (K = 2 with the lowest cross validation error), corresponding to taurine and zebu cattle lineages. All six breeds except for Dehong humped cattle showed different degrees of admixture between taurine and zebu cattle. As expected, Dehong humped cattle showed no signature of taurine cattle influence. Conclusion: Overall, considerable genomic diversity was found in six Yunnan native cattle breeds except for Dehong humped cattle from Western Yunnan. Dehong humped cattle is a pure zebu breed, while other five breeds had admixed origins with different extents of admixture between taurine and zebu cattle. Such admixture by crossbreeding between zebu and taurine cattle facilitated the spread of zebu cattle from tropical and subtropical regions to other highland regions in Yunnan.

However, transplantation bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation has been suggested to relieve ALF. Interestingly, microRNA-214 (miR-214) could potentially regulate differentiation and migration of BMSCs. The present study aims to inquire whether miR-214 affects therapeutic potential of BMSCs transplantation by targeting PIM-1 in ALF. 120 male Wistar rats were induced as ALF model rats and transplanted with BMSCs post-alteration of miR-214 or PIM-1 expression. Further experiments were performed to detect biochemical index (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], total bilirubin [TBiL]), and expression of miR-214, PIM-1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), caspase 3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in rat serum. Apart from the above detection, apoptosis of hepatocytes and Ki67 protein expression in hepatic tissues of rats were additionally assessed. After BMSCs transplantation with miR-214 inhibition, a decreased expression of ALT, AST, and TBiL yet an increased expression of HGF was shown, coupled with a decline in the expression of caspase 3, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Meanwhile, alleviated hepatic injury and decreased apoptotic index of hepatic cells were observed and the positive rate of Ki67 protein expression was significantly increased. Moreover, miR-214 and caspase 3, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 decreased notably, while PIM-1 was upregulated in response to miR-214 inhibition. Strikingly, the inhibition of PIM-1 reversed effects triggered by miR-214 inhibition. These findings indicated that downregulation of miR-214 improves therapeutic potential of BMSCs transplantation by upregulating PIM-1 for ALF.

Herein, an ultrasensitive and robust sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor has been fabricated for quantitative determination of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), a well-defined biomarker of squamous cell carcinoma in human serum. The water-soluble pillar [S]arene functionalized Pd/MoS2 nanosheets are prepared to immobilize the electroactive thionine molecules through host-guest interaction, and employed as labels to capture detection antibodies for signal amplification. Due to the outstanding electrochemical properties, large specific surface area, and excellent catalytic activity of Thi@WP5-Pd/MoS2 nanocomposites, the robust current response towards the oxidation of thionine are achieved. Besides, the Au nanoparticles decorated TiO2 nanosheets are applied to primary antibodies binding via Au-N bond. Under the optimized conditions, the prepared immunosensor offers a wide linear range from 0.001 to 10 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limt of 0.14 pg mL(-1). The satisfying results of analyzing SCCA in human serum suggest a promising application in the clinical monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Orientation and strain dependence of optical absorption in black phosphorene	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						Black phosphorene; Optical conductivity; Strain engineering; Anisotropy		Monolayer black phosphorus (MLBP) exhibits a strong anisotropic electronic band structure. This feature can result in anisotropic optical conductivities polarized along the armchair and zigzag directions. We examine theoretically the role of the strain presented in different directions on optical properties of MLBP via computing the dynamic dielectric function. It is found that the features of the optical absorption are sensitive to the chemical potential and the applied strain. The dependence of the extinction coefficient and/or absorption properties for x- and y-polarized light is anisotropic. The obtained results demonstrate that the significantly tuned extinction and optical absorption coefficients using strain engineering in MLBP can be applied for designing the novel optoelectronic devices.

In our study, the PBE method is mainly used to calculate the electronic and optical properties, and the HSE06 method is used to further modify the band gap and optical absorption edge. It is indicated that monolayer 1-T HfX2 and HfX2 present a stable indirect band gap semiconductor when the strain is 0%. The band gap of all monolayer 1-T HfX2 decreases significantly and the optical absorption edge shows an obvious red-shift trend with an increasing in-layer biaxial compressive strain. When the compressive strain is greater than - 8% in HfX2 and -6% in HfX2 respectively, the band gap decreases to zero, and so the semiconductor-metal transition was produced. Conversely, the band gap increases insignificantly with the increasing in-layer biaxial tensile strain from 0% to + 10% while the absorption edge reveals an inconspicuous blue-shift trend. The general rule for the change of the band gap and the absorption edge tuned by strain of monolayer HfX2 could be explained well according to the different changes of near-band-edge states. Moreover, with the vertical electric field (E-field) increases, there is the band gap decreases and the absorption edge red shifts in all monolayer HfX2 under different in-layer biaxial strains. Our study suggests that the strain and electric field (E-field) engineering are effective tunable approaches to alter the electronic and optical properties of monolayer HfX2. Namely, we suggest that the functions of TMD could be changed by setting up suitable strain and E-field on few-layer materials in the future.

Influence of Recent Climate Shifts on the Relationship Between ENSO and Asian Monsoon Precipitation Oxygen Isotope Ratios	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						oxygen isotope; precipitation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Asian Monsoon; interdecadal change; regional convection	EL-NINO; SUMMER MONSOON; STABLE-ISOTOPES; ATMOSPHERIC CONTROLS; INTERDECADAL CHANGE; NORTH PACIFIC; VARIABILITY; RECORD; PATTERNS; REGION	Recent studies have revealed robust in-phase relationships between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Asian Monsoon precipitation delta O-18 values (i.e., warm ENSO events with high delta O-18 values), and this relationship has been used in an attempt to reconstruct past ENSO activity. However, whether this relationship holds in the past is unknown. Here we use precipitation delta O-18 data from Hong Kong (East Asia) and Bangkok (Southeast Asia) and an ice core delta O-18 record from Dasuopu glacier (South Asia) to examine the delta O-18-ENSO relationship across two recent climate shifts that occurred during the winters of 1976/1977 and 1988/1989. On an annual scale, the delta O-18-ENSO relationship is weak prior to 1977 and strongest after 1988. We show that the changing delta O-18-ENSO relationship mainly originates from changes in the dry season isotope/climate relationship (which is significant only after 1988), whereas the rainy season relationship is relatively stable. We confirm that, consistent with earlier work on the rainy season, the significant delta O-18-ENSO relationship in the dry season post-1988 is associated with ENSO's influence on regional convection (Bay of Bengal to South China Sea region). We suggest the insignificant dry season relationship prior to 1989 is due to limited ENSO impacts on convection in the Bay of Bengal to South China Sea region, which is supported by the insignificant relationship between ENSO and vertical velocity at 500 hPa. These findings suggest that without additional constraints, systematic variability in isotope/climate relationships will lead to large uncertainties in ENSO reconstructions based on Asian Monsoon region delta O-18 data.

An Efficient Route to Isochromene Derivatives via Cascade Radical Cyclization and Radical-Radical Coupling	ADVANCED SYNTHESIS & CATALYSIS			English	Article						Cascade reactions; Radical coupling; Radical cyclization; Isochromene; Azaallyl anions	SUPER-ELECTRON-DONORS; CYCLIC ALKENYL ETHERS; ALKYNES; SILVER; ALKYNYLBENZALDEHYDES; DISCOVERY; CATALYST; ACID	Isochromenes are important pharmacophores present in biologically active molecules and natural products. Their synthesis is generally limited to cyclization of phenyl propargyl ether precursors under transition metal catalyzed conditions. Herein, we present a novel disconnection that rapidly constructs isochromene derivatives through a cascade radical cyclization strategy. Generation of aryl radicals by SET reduction of 2-iodo benzyl allenyl ethers is followed by radical cyclization to construct the isochromene core with formation of an allylic radical. The allylic radical then undergoes coupling with the azaallyl radical to give products in good to excellent yields. The elaborated 2-iodo phenyl propargyl ether precursors can be used to construct isochromenes bearing various functional groups.

However, the efficacy of this approach still lacks comprehensive evaluation. We carried out a case study in the economically important but phylogenetically and taxonomically difficult genus Panax (Araliaceae). We generated a large data set of plastomes and nrDNA sequences from multiple accessions per species. Our data improved the phylogenetic resolution and levels of species discrimination in Panax, compared to any previous studies using standard DNA barcodes. This provides new insights into the speciation, lineage diversification and biogeography of the genus. However, both plastome and nrDNA failed to completely resolve the phylogenetic relationships in the Panax bipinnatifidus species complex, and only half of the species within it were recovered as monophyletic units. The results suggest that complete plastome and ribosomal DNA sequences can substantially increase species discriminatory power in plants, but they are not powerful enough to fully resolve phylogenetic relationships and discriminate all species, particularly in evolutionarily young and complex plant groups. To gain further resolving power for closely related species, the addition of substantial numbers of nuclear markers is likely to be required.

Converging filaments in the high-mass cluster forming region Sgr B2(N)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; stars: massive; techniques: high angular resolution; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; ISM: individual objects: SgrB2(N); radio lines: ISM	STAR; W33A	Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. Aims. We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. Methods. We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0 : 00 4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. Results. A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OH and H2CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M-circle dot, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s(-1) pc(-1), which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales (similar to 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are (sic)0.05 M-circle dot yr(-1), which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M-circle dot yr(-1). Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a "damp" merger. Conclusions. The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster.

The as-synthesized Fe-TiO2@COF shows an exceptional photocatalytic activity degrading methylene blue (MB) under ambient light. A trace amount (0.4 mg) of the optimal catalyst 5Fe-TiO2@COF can degrade MB (100 mg L-1, 4 mL) under ambient light. More importantly, the catalyst exhibits excellent stability and can be reused multiple times without any loss of catalytic activity. The use of a crystalline porous COF as a catalyst support has many unique advantages, including controlled-growth of nanoparticles with ultrafine size, stabilization of nanoparticles, efficient sorption of the organic pollutant thus increasing their local concentration around the catalysts, and facilitating the mass transfer through its porous channels. Our study provides an efficient and novel approach for preparation of well-dispersed ultrafine metal oxides with high stability and photosensitivity for energy and environmental applications.

Conservation tillage rotation, conserved soil water and enhanced soil fertility effectively, produced high and stable crop yields in a spring maize-winter wheat-fallow rotation over a two-year period (hereafter called maize-wheat-fallow rotation). Corresponding and appropriate fertilization practices should enable the full potential of tillage rotation. Therefore, a long-term two-factor split-plot experiment (2007-2016) was established in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, China, a typical rainfed dryland agricultural region. Beginning in 2007, three fertilization practices (balanced fertilization (BF), low fertilization (LF) and conventional fertilization (CF)) and four tillage systems (no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually (NS), subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually (SC), conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually (CN), and continuous conventional tillage (CT)) were conducted to assess crop yield and soil water variation. The results showed that CCN (CF + CN, 5440 kg ha(-1)) and BNS (BF + NS, 8415 kg ha(-1)) produced the highest crop yield for winter wheat and spring maize, respectively. LNS (LF + NS, 419 mm) had a better soil water condition in fallow periods. NS and CN rotations had a better soil water condition (reserved more soil water for crop growth) than SC and CT during the wheat and maize growth season. However, both the average ET of winter wheat and spring maize under all of the treatments had no significant differences (P > 0.05) in ten years. In ten years, NS and CN rotations had higher water use efficiency (WUEs) than the SC rotation and CT, BNS had the highest WUE (19.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1))for the spring maize - winter wheat rotation. Tillage rotation and fertilization had an interactive effect on soil water use and crop growth, and the results might clarify the response of crop yield and soil water variation to fertilization and tillage rotations. For further and sustainable development of crop production, BNS (5133 and 8415 kg ha(-1) for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 386 mm) and BCN (5221 and 8116 kg ha(-1) for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 388 mm) are recommended as the optimal fertilization and tillage rotations for rainfed crop production on the Loess Plateau.

The sporadic occurrences of diosgenin in distantly related plants imply possible independent biosynthetic origins. The characteristic 5,6-spiroketal moiety in diosgenin is reminiscent of the spiroketal moiety present in anthelmintic avermectins isolated from actinomycete bacteria. How plants gained the ability to biosynthesize spiroketal natural products is unknown. Here, we report the diosgenin-biosynthetic pathways in himalayan paris (Paris polyphylla), a monocot medicinal plant with hemostatic and antibacterial properties, and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), an eudicot culinary herb plant commonly used as a galactagogue. Both plants have independently recruited pairs of cytochromes P450 that catalyze oxidative 5,6-spiroketalization of cholesterol to produce diosgenin, with evolutionary progenitors traced to conserved phytohormone metabolism. This study paves the way for engineering the production of diosgenin and derived analogs in heterologous hosts.

Maps of all the observed lines were also obtained. Comparisons with a number of early starless cores and the warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) source L1527 show that the column densities of C4H and CH3CCH are close to those of L1527, and the CH3CCH column densities of the EMC and L1527 are slightly higher than those of TMC-1. The EMC and L1527 have similar C3S column densities, but they are much lower than those of all the starless cores, with only 6.5 and 10% of the TMC-1 value, respectively. The emissions of the N-bearing species of the EMC and L1527 are at the medium level of the starless cores. These comparisons show that the CCM emissions in the EMC are similar to those of L1527, though L1527 contains a protostar. Although dark and quiescent, the EMC is warmer and at a later evolutionary stage than classical carbon-chain-producing regions in the cold, dark, quiescent early phase. The PACS, SPIRE, and SCUBA maps evidently show that the L1489 IRS seems to be the heating source of the EMC. Although it is located at the margins of the EMC, its bolometric luminosity and bolometric temperature are relatively high. Above all, the EMC is a rather particular carbon-chain-producing region and is quite significant for CCM science.

Grafting induces flowering time and tuber formation changes in Brassica species involving FT signalling	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Brassica species; flowering time; grafting; tuberisation; vernalisation	EXPRESSION; DOMESTICATION; VERNALIZATION	Brassica species are widely cultivated and important biennial and annual crops. The transition from vegetative to reproductive development in Brassica species is critical in agriculture and horticulture. Grafting is a useful tool for improving agricultural production and investigating the movement of long-range signals. Here we established a hypocotyl micrografting system in B. rapa crops and successfully grafted the rootstock of turnip onto many different scion genotypes. Grafting with turnip rootstock prolonged vegetative growth, delayed flowering and improved seed yield in rapeseed. The late-flowering turnip rootstock could delay flowering of the scion of the early-flowering turnip accession. The BrrFLC1 (FLOWERING LOCUS C1 in B. rapa) transcript levels and H3K4me3 levels at the BrrFLC1 locus were up-regulated and subsequently suppressed the downstream FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) signals in leaves of the scion to delay flowering. Vernalization treatment can efficiently promote flowering time in turnip. The non-vernalised turnip flowered early after grafting onto the rootstock of the vernalised turnip, which was accompanied by high levels of FT homologue expression in leaves of the scion. Hypocotyl excision experiments revealed that the process of tuber formation was suppressed by removing the hypocotyl tissue, which in turn repressed the expression of tuberization-related genes. Our findings suggest that the rootstock generates mobile signals that are transported from the rootstock to the scion to fine-tune FT signalling and modulate flowering time.

Secondly, we study some basic properties of almost periodic functions on the quantum time scale. Thirdly, based on these, we study the existence and uniqueness of almost periodic solutions of dynamic equations on the quantum time scale by Lyapunov method. Then, we give an equivalent definition of almost periodic functions on the quantum time scale. Finally, as an application, we propose a class of high-order Hopfield neural networks on the quantum time scale and establish the existence and global exponential stability of almost periodic solutions of this class of neural networks.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Clay minerals; Sr-Nd isotopes; Provenance; Yellow River (Huanghe) and Yangtze River (Changjiang); Yellow Sea; Quaternary	LATE CENOZOIC SEDIMENTS; NE TIBETAN PLATEAU; EAST CHINA-SEA; QUATERNARY SEDIMENTS; CLAY-MINERALS; ASIAN MONSOON; LATE MIOCENE; EVOLUTION; DELTA; PROVENANCE	Reconstructing the Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary history of the Yellow Sea, is important for understanding the long-term influence of the Yellow River (Huanghe) and/or Yangtze River (Changjiang) on the Asian marginal seas and to further constrain any links between river development, regional paleoenvironmental change, tectonic deformation and/or global climate change. Here we present the first high-resolution clay mineral record combined with Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from a 300-m long sediment core recovered in the western South Yellow Sea. Our study suggests that large-scale transgression in the Yellow Sea occurred after similar to 0.8 Ma, possibly related to tectonic subsidence of eastern China coast and the Min-Zhe Uplift. In contrast, the sedimentary environment of Bohai and Yellow Seas was mainly dominated by fluvial/lacustrine deposits at 3.5-0.8 Ma. Provenance analysis suggests a major change in sediment provenance from the Yangtze River to the Yellow River at similar to 0.8 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of the final integration of the Yellow River in its present form. At the same time the major channels of the Yangtze River migrated from the South Yellow Sea to the modern Yangtze River delta due to the subsidence of east China coast. The consistence in timing of the provenance transition and large-scale regional marine transgression suggests that tectonic deformation, rather than climate change, is the first-order control on the evolution of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers and sedimentary environmental change in the Bohai and Yellow Seas.

The polarities of the linkages had great effect on their self-assembly and photophycial properties. Both ether and amide compounds were mesogens, while the ester compounds were non-mesogens. The ether compounds displayed Col(hex)/p6mm phases, while the amide compound displayed two kinds of columnar phases i.e. columnar rectangular phase with p2mm and columnar hexagonal phase with p6mm lattices depending on temperature. The column phases could be aligned in electric field or under mechanical shearing. The ether and amide compounds showed the significant red-shifted maximum absorption and emission. In the solid and gel states, both ether and amide compounds were yellow luminescence, while ester compounds were green luminescence. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although the ecological impacts of roads are now well recognised, there remains a lack of certainty regarding how roads in general and roads with different widths affect vital ecosystem services such as above-ground biomass (AGB) in tropics. Using a non-destructive sampling method, we investigated disturbance effects of roads on AGB and related attributes in Xishuangbanna, China. We surveyed woody plants in natural forests, rubber plantations, and tea plantations up to 100 m from the edge of three different road widths and estimated AGB using allometric equations at 10 m intervals. Two sample t-test results confirmed that natural forests stored more AGB than rubber and tea plantations, and less AGB at edges of wider road than at edges of narrower road. Linear mixed effects models revealed that land use, road width, and distance from edge significantly explained 68% (both fixed and random factors) variation in AGB. We observed two results that indicated wider roads altered more AGB than narrower road types in natural forests. First, AGB declined at road edges; second, the disturbance effects on AGB by wider road types went deeper than narrower roads did in natural forests. Our results suggest that both widening the existing roads and construction of new roads will degrade ecosystem productivity. We recommend that impacts assessments of roads on AGB should be considered and taken serious while planning and designing roads to avoid serious damages to many ecosystem services that AGB provides.

The re-caching of seeds by rodents is considered a mechanism of long-distance seed dispersal. The effect of re-caching on dispersal distance is well studied. However, how re-caching by rodents affects seedling establishment remains unclear. To assess the role of re-caching by rodents on seedling establishment, we tracked a large number of seeds and investigated the seed dispersal and seedling establishment of two large-seeded tree species (Scleropyrum wallichianum and Garcinia xanthochymus) in a tropical forest. We found that rodents scatter hoarded 48.9-7L3% of the released seeds, and a total of 23.8-36.6% of the initial caches of both species experienced re-caching up to 2 or 3 times. Re-caching was correlated with farther dispersal and a higher probability of seedling establishment for both species. In addition, re-caching contributed to medium and long-distance seed dispersal, with 17.2% and 18.5% of seedlings located > 50 m from parent trees for G. xanthochymus and S. wallichianum, respectively, and 3.4% of seedlings of G. xanthochymus located > 100 m from parent trees. Our results suggested that re-caching by rodents can promote seed dispersal effectiveness and contribute to effective long-distance seed dispersal.

We have synthesized hollow dodecahedral Cu2O nanocages with exposed (1 1 1) planes by a simple solution growth approach at room temperature. Characterization results indicate that the diameters of Cu2O nanocages are about 200 nm. Gas sensing performance of the Cu2O nanocages is investigated towards ethanol gas. Remarkably, the response of Cu2O reaches 4.6 at a low working temperature of 250 degrees C when the concentration is 100 ppm. The unique structure of Cu2O benefits the sensing performance owing to its active (1 1 1) planes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, S; Wu, J; Zhao, DM; Xia, L				Zhang, Shuang; Wu, Jian; Zhao, Deming; Xia, Lan			Characteristics and reasons for light rain reduction in Southwest China in recent decades	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Light rain; warming; relative humidity; precipitable water vapor; aerosols	PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; AEROSOLS; TEMPERATURE; FREQUENCY; CLIMATE; ASIA	Although light rain events have a small intensity and amount, light rain also exerts a significant influence on the environment and climate, and observations have revealed a significant reduction in light rain in many regions around the globe. The specific reasons for light rain reduction have not been clearly revealed. Some studies attribute the reduction in light rain to an increase in aerosol, while other studies tend to associate it with global warming. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to increase knowledge regarding the reasons for the decrease in light rain. Light rain events were analyzed using daily precipitation data collected from 67 gauge stations across Southwest China from 1960 to 2010. The results show that both the amount of light rain and the number of light rain days have decreased during the last 50 years at different magnitudes (0-2 mm, 2-5 mm, and 5-10 mm), in which the light rain amount and number of light rain days for 0-2 mm of rainfall present the largest regionally averaged decreasing rates of -0.20 mm/a and -0.73 days/a from 1960 to 2010, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum (minimum) light rain amount and number of light rain days appear in summer (winter). In addition, an increasing trend in the light rain amount in discrete events and a decreasing trend in the light rain amount in consecutive events are simultaneously revealed, in which the reduction in the frequency of consecutive light rain events is more significant than that of discrete light rain events. The reduction in light rain in the eastern part of Southwest China from 1979 to 2010 is mainly caused by a combination of water vapor reduction and warming. Moreover, the influence of aerosols on the observed reduction in light rain is not statistically significant at the inter-annual scale. The results provide some main correlation factors for predicting the long-term changes of light rain in China and even the global region.

Previous studies have focused mainly on specific species complexes involving a few or dozens of species only, or have achieved a large taxon sampling but only one plastid marker was used. In the present study, DNA sequences from six plastid markers (atpB, rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS, trnL and trnL-F) of 1030 accessions (616 of them newly sequenced here) representing c. 420 species of Asplenium (60% of estimated species diversity), 16 species of Hymenasplenium, three Diplaziopsidaceae, and four Rhachidosoraceae were used to produce the largest genus-level phylogeny yet for ferns. Our major results include: (i) Asplenium as broadly circumscribed is monophyletic based on our inclusion of representatives of 32 of 38 named segregate genera; (ii) 11 major clades in Asplenium are identified, and their relationships are mostly well-resolved and strongly supported; (iii) numerous species, unsampled in previous studies, suggest new relationships and numerous cryptic species and species complexes in Asplenium; and (iv) the accrued molecular evidence provides an essential foundation for further investigations of complex patterns of geographical diversification, speciation and reticulate evolution in this family.

Gastrodia elata produces dust-like seeds and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for its germination and growth. In its life cycle, G. elata is considered to switch from a specific single-fungus relationship (Mycena) to another single-fungus relationship (Armillaria). However, no studies have investigated the changes in the plant-fungus relationship during the growth of G. elata in the wild. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the fungal community of tubers in different growth phases as well as the soils surrounding G. elata.ResultsThe predominant fungi were Basidiomycota (60.44%) and Ascomycota (26.40%), which exhibited changes in abundance and diversity with the growth phases of G. elata. Diverse basidiomycetes in protocorms (phase P) were Hyphodontia, Sistotrema, Tricholoma, Mingxiaea, Russula, and Mycena, but the community changed from a large proportion of Resinicium bicolor (40%) in rice-like tubers (phase M) to an unidentified Agaricales operational taxonomic unit 1(OTU1,98.45%) in propagation vegetation tubers (phase B). The soil fungi primarily included Simocybe, Psathyrella, Conocybe, and Subulicystidium. Three Mycena OTUs obtained in this study were differentially distributed among the growth phases of G. elata, accounting for less than 1.0% of the total reads, and were phylogenetically close to Mycena epipterygia and M. alexandri.ConclusionsOur data indicated that G. elata interacts with a broad range of fungi beyond the Mycena genus. These fungi changed with the growth phases of G. elata. In addition, these data suggested that the development of the fungal community during the growth of G. elata was more complex than previously assumed and that at least two different fungi could be involved in development before the arrival of Armillaria.

The coordination configuration of the metal atoms has been widely recognized as the determining factor to the electronic structure and the catalytic activity. However, the synergistic effect between the adjacent layers of the multilayered AMCs is always neglected. We reported an atomic Co and Pt co-trapped carbon catalyst, which exhibits a ultrahigh activity for HER in the wide range of pH (eta(10)=27 and 50mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively) with ultralow metal loadings (1.72 and 0.16wt% for Co and Pt, respectively), which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C. Theoretical analysis reveals that the atomic metals on the inner graphitic layers significantly alter the electronic structure of the outmost layer, thus tailoring the HER activity. This finding arouses a re-thinking of the intrinsic activity origins of AMCs and suggests a new avenue in the structure design of AMCs.

Unlike the conventional c-axis parallel to normal direction (ND) basal texture which usually hinders the deformation ability of the Mg sheet during secondary forming, such a special texture component could supply soft orientations of extension twinning for subsequent rolling. The results indicated that the new grain orientations induced by extension twinning, which are dependent on consuming the pre-introduced tilted texture during rolling, would lie around the ND. This positioning could offer diverse orientation gradients along different directions. Meanwhile, such randomly distributed orientation gradients could provide relatively random growth directions for the new recrystallized grains during annealing and contribute to weakening of the basal texture, as well as promoting the symmetry of texture distribution (distribution of basal poles show rotational symmetry around the (0002) pole figure center). As expected, the "pre-compressed + annealed" and subsequently "rolled + annealed" sample showed improved uniaxial tensile properties (including lower yield strength, higher ductility and more symmetrical planar mechanical performance along different directions) and a considerably improved multiaxial stamping property (Erichsen value increased similar to 120%) compared with that of the as-extruded sheet or the directly rolled and annealed sample. This study confirmed that preparing soft orientations of extension twinning for subsequent rolling (e.g., employing in-plane precompression along with rolling processes) could be a highly efficient way to optimize the texture and mechanical properties of Mg sheets.

This alternative protocol provided a wide substrate scope with excellent yields (82-95%), and a variety of ortho-amino triarylphosphines were obtained with high yields (87-95%) via further reductive reaction. Furthermore, this reaction could be scaled-up and several synthetic transformations were accomplished for the construction of functionalized organophosphorus.

Probing the initial conditions of high-mass star formation III. Fragmentation and triggered star formation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; techniques: interferometric; ISM: clouds; methods: observational	TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES; GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE; STELLAR CLUSTERS; METHANOL MASERS; FORMING REGIONS; RADIATION; TURBULENT; RESOLUTION; ACCRETION; DYNAMICS	Context. Fragmentation and feedback are two important processes during the early phases of star formation. Aims. Massive clumps tend to fragment into clusters of cores and condensations, some of which form high-mass stars. In this work, we study the structure of massive clumps at different scales, analyze the fragmentation process, and investigate the possibility that star formation is triggered by nearby H II regions. Methods. We present a high angular resolution study of a sample of massive proto-cluster clumps G18.17, G18.21, G23.97N, G23.98, G23.44, G23.97S, G25.38, and G25.71. Combining infrared data at 4.5, 8.0, 24, and 70 mu m, we use a few arcsecond resolution, radiometer and millimeter inteferometric data taken at 1.3 cm, 3.5 mm, 1.3 mm, and 870 mu m to study their fragmentation and evolution. Our sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have neighboring H II regions Taking advantage of that, we tested triggered star formation using a novel method where we study the alignment of the center of mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales. Results. The eight massive clumps, identified based on single-dish observations, have masses ranging from 228 to 2279M(circle dot) within an effective radius of R-eff similar to 0.5 pc. We detect compact structures towards six out of the eight clumps. The brightest compact structures within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact radio continuum sources. The smaller scale structures of R-eff similar to 0.02 pc observed within each clump are mostly gravitationally bound and massive enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star. Many condensations have masses larger than 8 M-circle dot at a small scale of R-eff similar to 0.02 pc. We find that the two infrared quiet clumps with the lowest mass and lowest surface density with <300 M-circle dot do not host any compact sources, calling into question their ability to form high-mass stars. Although the clumps are mostly infrared quiet, the dynamical movements are active at clump scale (similar to 1 pc). Conclusions. We studied the spatial distribution of the gas conditions detected at different scales. For some sources we find hints of external triggering, whereas for others we find no significant pattern that indicates triggering is dynamically unimportant.

Paris japonica (Melanthiaceae) has the largest genome that has been confirmed in eukaryotes to date; however, its phylogenetic position remains unresolved. As a result, the evolutionary history of the genomic gigantisms in P. japonica remains poorly understood.ResultsWe used next-generation sequencing to generate complete plastomes of P. japonica, P. verticillata, Trillium govanianum, Ypsilandra thibetica and Y. yunnanensis. Together with published plastomes, the infra-familial relationships in Melanthiaceae and infra-generic phylogeny in Paris were investigated, and their divergence times were calculated. The results indicated that the expansion of the ancestral genome of extant Paris and Trillium occurred approximately from 59.16 Mya to 38.21 Mya. The sister relationship between P. japonica and the section Euthyra was recovered, and they diverged around the transition of the Oligocene/Miocene (20 Mya), when the Japan Islands were separated from the continent of Asia.ConclusionsThe genome size expansion in the most recent common ancestor for Paris and Trillium was most possibly a gradual process that lasted for approximately 20 million years. The divergence of P. japonica (section Kinugasa) and other taxa with thick rhizome may have been triggered by the isolation of the Japan Islands from the continent of Asia. This long-term separation, since the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, would have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the genomic gigantism in P. japonica. Moreover, our results support the taxonomic treatment of Paris as a genus rather than dividing it into three genera, but do not support the recognition of T. govanianum as the separate genus Trillidium.

A library of 29 compounds was synthesized. Several title compounds exhibited selective inhibitory activities against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) over epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase; these compounds also displayed selective and potent antiproliferative activity against three cancer cell lines. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for anti-angiogenesis activity by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Among them, 1-(2-(2-chlorophenyl)benzo[d]oxazol-5-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea (compound 5 n) showed the most potent anti-angiogenesis capacity, efficient cytotoxic activities (in vitro against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), H1975, A549, and HeLa cell lines, with respective IC50 values of 8.46, 1.40, 7.61, and 0.28 mu m), and an acceptable level of VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition (IC50=0.25 mu m). Molecular docking analysis revealed 5 n to be a type II inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase. In general, these results indicate that these 6-arylurea-2-arylbenzoxazole/benzimidazole derivatives are promising inhibitors of VEGFR-2 kinase for potential development into anti-angiogenesis drugs.

However, the parameter estimation for the truncated Pareto distribution is much more complicated than that for the Pareto distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate that the bias of the maximum likelihood estimation for the truncated Pareto distribution can be significantly reduced by its jackknife estimation, which has a very simple form.

In the study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), coupled with diode array detector (DAD) and chemometrics, were used to investigate the chemical geographical variation of G. rigescens and to classify medicinal materials, according to their grown latitudes. The chromatographic fingerprints of 280 individuals and 840 samples from rhizomes, stems, and leaves of four different latitude areas were recorded and analyzed for tracing the geographical origin of medicinal materials. At first, HPLC fingerprints of underground and aerial parts were generated while using reversed-phase liquid chromatography. After the preliminary data exploration, two supervised pattern recognition techniques, random forest (RF) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), were applied to the three HPLC fingerprint data sets of rhizomes, stems, and leaves, respectively. Furthermore, fingerprint data sets of aerial and underground parts were separately processed and joined while using two data fusion strategies (low-level and mid-level). The results showed that classification models that are based OPLS-DA were more efficient than RF models. The classification models using low-level data fusion method built showed considerably good recognition and prediction abilities (the accuracy is higher than 99% and sensibility, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and efficiency range from 0.95 to 1.00). Low-level data fusion strategy combined with OPLS-DA could provide the best discrimination result. In summary, this study explored the latitude variation of phytochemical of G. rigescens and developed a reliable and accurate identification method for G. rigescens that were grown at different latitudes based on untargeted HPLC fingerprint, data fusion, and chemometrics. The study results are meaningful for authentication and the quality control of Chinese medicinal materials.

Using oblique incidence method and FeCoN/Ru/FeCoN synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) structure, two additional anisotropies energy were introduced: oblique incidence anisotropy and exchange anisotropy energy, which marked enhancement of the effective magnetic anisotropy (Hk). The increment of Hk results in a significant improvement in the roll -off frequency of these films. The roll -off frequency of FeCoN/Ru/FeCoN films with SAF structure can reach up to 8.6 GHz. A feasible approach to conveniently controlling Hk of soft magnetic thin films by using oblique deposition and SAF structure can further improve their properties for the potential applications in the high frequency region.

As this urbanisation is expected to continue in the future, it is important to understand its environmental impacts and the role that spatial planning strategies and urbanisation regulations can play herein. This is addressed by (1) quantifying the cities' expansion and intra-urban restructuring using Local Climate Zones (LCZs) for three periods in time (2005, 2011 and 2017) based on the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) protocol, and (2) cross-referencing observed land-use and land-cover changes with existing planning regulations. The results of the surveys on urban development show that, between 2005 and 2011, the city showed spatial expansion, whereas between 2011 and 2017, densification mainly occurred within the existing urban extent. Between 2005 and 2017, the fraction of open LCZs increased, with the largest increase taking place between 2011 and 2017. The largest decrease was seen for low the plants (LCZ D) and agricultural greenhouse (LCZ H) categories. As the potential of LCZs as, for example, a heat stress assessment tool has been shown elsewhere, understanding the relation between policy strategies and LCZ changes is important to take rational urban planning strategies toward sustainable city development.

In this study, we specifically developed 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The analysis of microsatellite and mtDNA markers revealed a high and a moderate genetic diversity across seven populations, respectively. Moderate differentiation was also detected among several populations, indicating the impact of habitat fragmentation and divergence. The absence of isolation by distance implied an extensive gene flow, while the presence of isolation by adaptation implied that these populations might be in the process of adapting to divergent habitats. Correlation analysis showed that abiotic factors like dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, and conductivity in water as well as biotic factors like plankton diversity and fish species diversity had impact on genetic diversity and divergence in P. phoxinus ujmonensis populations. The results of this study will provide an insight into the effect of environmental factors on genetic diversity and contribute to the study of population genetics of sympatric species.

VOLATILE METABOLITES; KETONES; CHEESE; BEETLE; ACID	Methylketones are broadly distributed in nature and perform a variety of functions. Most microorganisms are thought to produce methylketone by abortive beta-oxidation of fatty acid catalytic metabolism. However, two methylketone synthetase genes in wild tomatoes are reported to synthesize methylketone using intermediates of the fatty acids biosynthetic pathway. In our previous study on Trojan horse-like interactions between the bacterium Bacillus nematocida B16 and its host worm, the chemical 2-heptanone was found to be an important attractant for the hosts. So here we used this model to investigate the genes involved in synthesizing 2-heptanone in microorganisms. We identified a novel methylketone synthase gene yneP in B. nematocida B16 and found enhancement of de novo fatty acid synthesis during 2-heptanone production. Interestingly, a homolog of yneP' existed in the non-pathogenic species Bacillus subtilis 168, a close relative of B. nematocida B16 that was unable to lure worms, but GC-MS assay showed no 2-heptanone production. However, overexpression of yneP' from B. subtilis in both heterologous and homologous systems demonstrated that it was not a pseudogene. The transcriptional analysis between those two genes had few differences under the same conditions. It was further shown that the failure to detect 2-heptanone in B. subtilis 168 was at least partly due to its conversion into 6-methyl-2-heptanone by methylation. Our study revealed methylketone biosynthesis of Bacillus species, and provided a co-evolution paradigm of second metabolites during the interactions between pathogenic/non-pathogenic bacteria and host.

J	Liu, J; Bai, HT; Ma, HY; Feng, G				Liu, Jun; Bai, Haotian; Ma, Huiyao; Feng, Gang			Bird diversity in Chinese urban parks was more associated with natural factors than anthropogenic factors	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING			English	Article						Anthropogenic factors; Biodiversity conservation; Functional diversity; Natural factors; Phylogenetic diversity; Urban ecosystem	HUMAN-POPULATION SIZE; SPECIES RICHNESS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; LAND-USE; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; URBANIZATION	Urban parks are important for biodiversity conservation in urban ecosystems. Many natural and anthropogenic factors are associated with bird diversity in urban parks. However, so far no studies have compared the relative roles of these factors in shaping bird taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity in urban parks in whole China. In this study, we linked anthropogenic variables (NDVI, population density, park area) and natural variables (altitudinal range, contemporary and historical climate) with the three biodiversity dimensions of bird assemblages in Chinese urban parks. Notably, a total of 495 bird species (36% of all Chinese birds) were found in 140 parks, and the phylogenetic (evolutionary history) and functional diversity of these species is 49% and 80% of all Chinese birds. In addition, there were one critically endangered species (Aythya bath), eight endangered species, 11 vulnerable species and 53 near threatened species. The two variables most associated with bird taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were park area and altitudinal range, glacial-interglacial temperature change and precipitation, precipitation and park area, respectively. Notably, all anthropogenic factors, including park area, were not associated with these bird diversity indices after controlling the effects of natural variables. In contrast, most natural variables were significantly associated with bird diversity when controlled the influence of anthropogenic factors. Therefore, these results indicate that Chinese urban parks could harbor high levels of bird diversity, especially for the phylogenetic and functional diversity. More importantly, the weak relations between bird diversity and anthropogenic factors highlight the important role of Chinese urban parks in biodiversity conservation.

The CNN was designed to discriminate the corresponding patches in a pair of images. To train the CNN, a training set that contained image patches and their matching labels was created from an open-access database. The pretrained CNN was then fine-tuned by self-learning from the target image and its transformed images. With the proposed self-learning CNN, the corresponding feature points were detected for the registration in mosaicing. The proposed method was compared with the scale-invariant feature transform detector-based and speed-up robust feature detector-based methods for mosaicing of 30 pairs of microscopic images. The proposed method outperformed the two traditional methods in terms of both visual quality and objective assessment. Results demonstrate that using the self-learning CNN can improve the accuracy of registration in image mosaicing.

We designed a dimer molecule using two vindoline-bonded dimer vindoline (DVB) and studied its interaction with alpha,beta-tubulin through the double-sided adhesive mechanism to explore its anticancer cytotoxicity. In our work, DVB was docked into the interface between alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin to construct a complex protein structure, and then it was simulated for 100 ns using the molecular dynamics technology to become a stable and refined complex protein structure. Based on such a refined structure, the quantum chemistry at the level of the MP2/6-31G(d,p) method was used to calculate the binding energies for DVB interacting with respective residues. By the obtained binding energies, the active site residues for interaction with DVB were found. Up to 20 active sites of residues within alpha,beta-tubulin interacting with DVB are labeled in beta-Asp179, beta-Glu207, beta-Tyr210, beta-Asp211, beta-Phe214, beta-Pro222, beta-Tyr224, and beta-Leu227 and alpha-Asn249, alpha-Arg308, alpha-Lys326, alpha-Asn329, alpha-Ala333, alpha-Thr334, alpha-Lys336, alpha-Lys338, alpha-Arg339, alpha-Ser340, alpha-Thr349, and alpha-Phe351. The total binding energy between DVB and alpha,beta-tubulin is about -251.0 kJ.mol(-1). The sampling average force potential (PMF) method was further used to study the dissociation free energy (Delta G) along the separation trajectory of alpha,beta-tubulin under the presence of DVB based on the refined structure of DVB with alpha,beta-tubulin. Because of the presence of DVB within the interface between alpha- and beta-tubulin, Delta G is 252.3 kJ.mol(-1). In contrast to the absence of DVB, the separation of pure beta-tubulin needs a free energy of 196.9 kJ.mol(-1). The data show that the presence of DVB adds more 55.4 kJ.mol(-1) of Delta G to hinder the normal separation of alpha,beta-tubulin. Compared to vinblastine existing, the free energy required for the separation of alpha,beta-tubulin is 220.5 kJ.mol(-1). Vinblastine and DVB can both be considered through the same double-sided adhesive mechanism to give anticancer cytotoxicity. Because of the presence of DVB, a larger free energy is needed for the separation of alpha,beta-tubulin, which suggests that DVB should have stronger anticancer cytotoxicity than vinblastine and shows that DVB has a broad application prospect.

The domain decomposition is divided into multiple subdomains, two steps are used to solve the numerical solutions on each sub-domain at every time interval [t(n), t(n+1)]. In the first step, the interface fluxes are computed by local multi-points weighted average from the solutions. Secondly, the interior solutions are solved by the solution-flux coupled scheme.

Using a comprehensive dataset of Kenyan indigenous chickens and additional mined data of chickens from 8 African and 5 Asian countries, we performed univariate and multivariate assessments to uncover the underlying phenotypic and morphometric variability. Kenyan indigenous chickens expressed differentiation of several qualitative and quantitative traits, both among different counties in the Swahili coast, and among coastal, western, and northern migratory corridors. There was a substantial population stratification of these chickens, particularly distinctive clustering of chickens from Marsabit, Lamu, and Kilifi counties. The pooled dataset further clarified a closer phenotypic and morphometric proximity of chickens within different geographical regions. We additionally revealed a preponderance of bantam and rumpless traits to hot and humid locales, and feathered shanks to cooler regions. Currently, most chicken breeding programs in developing countries rely on phenotypic and morphometric properties. Hence, the high chicken diversity and population stratification observed in our study, possibly shaped by natural and artificial selective pressures, reveal opportunities for complementary phenotypic and genotypic assessments to identify resources for effective breed improvement and conservation strategies of indigenous chickens in the tropics.

Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating reveals that they were emplaced in the Middle Permian (ca. 262 Ma). All the gabbro samples collected from the intrusion exhibit low contents of TiO2 (0.24-0.37 wt %) and Fe2O3T(4.87-5.41 wt %), but high levels of MgO (11.15-12.15 wt %), CaO (11.45-12.75 wt %), Al2O3 (14.18-17.08 wt %) and high Mg# (0.81-0.83). Relative to HREEs and LILEs, the gabbros are enriched in LREEs and depleted in Th, Nb, Ce, Zr, Hf, and Ti, with positive Eu, Sr and U anomalies. In contrast to MORB, the Jigede intrusion has higher initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values of 0.7046 to 0.7054 and lower epsilon(Nd)(T) of + 1.8 to + 4.8. Elemental and isotopic data suggest that the intrusion was likely to have been produced by partial melting of a shallow lithospheric mantle source modified by slab-derived fluids, with subsequent cumulation of plagioclase. Thus, the Jigede intrusion was emplaced in a back-arc setting, in response to the Paleo-Asian oceanic subduction. In addition, the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean did not occur prior to the Middle Permian.

The Riemann problems under pressure perturbation and flux approximation are analytically solved. Then, it is shown that as the pressure and flux approximation, respectively, vanish, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted delta-measure that forms a delta shock wave; any two-rarefaction Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Especially in the process of three parameters decreasing, a U-shaped pseudo-vacuum state appears in solutions to the flux-approximation system. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

The degree-day model (DDM) coupled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were used to quantify the water budget of the Nam Co Lake over the period of 2007 to 2013. Driven by local observed meteorological data, the coupled model was successfully validated with the observed lake levels (with R-2 = 0.65, NSE = 0.61, and PBIAS = -2.26). Analysis of the water balance revealed that rapid enlargement of the Nam Co Lake was primarily associated with precipitation increase while glacier melt played its role as the potential secondary driver in lake expansion. However, temporal analysis of lake expansion displayed that supremacy of precipitation and glacier melt interchanged between the years. It was found that average annual relative contributions of the precipitation, including direct precipitation on the lake, and glacier melt to the lake were 57% (or 667 mm), and 43% (or 502 mm), respectively. Besides, it was observed that annual values of actual evapotranspiration (ET) from the lake, glaciated, and non-glaciated subbasins were 615 mm, 280 mm, and 234 mm respectively. The average annual glacier mass balance (GMB) of the Nam Co basin was -150.9 millimeter water equivalent (mm w.e.). The relatively high amount of glacier melt was a consequence of the substantial increase in annual temperature in the lake basin.

We assessed variations in meteorological and hydrological variables using innovative trend analysis (ITA) and traditional trend analysis methods at a practical significance level, which is also of practical interest. We developed threshold levels of hydrological variables and developed a non-parametric climate-sensitivity model of the high-altitude catchment of the western Himalayas. The runoff of Zone I decreased, while the temperature increased and the precipitation increased significantly. In Zone II, the runoff and temperature increased but the precipitation decreased. A two-dimensional visualization of the Parde coefficient showed extreme drought events, and indicated greater sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature than to precipitation. The threshold levels of runoff for Zones I and II were 320 and 363 mm using the Q(80) fixed method, while the mean runoff amounts were estimated to be 79.95 and 55.61 mm, respectively. The transient threshold levels varied by month, and the duration of droughts in Zones I and II ranged from 26.39 to 78.98 days. The sensitivity of the hydrological regime was estimated based on a modified climate-elasticity model (epsilon(p) = 0.11-0.23, epsilon(t) = -0.04-2.39) for Zones I and II, respectively. These results highlight the sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature, which influences the melting process. However, it is important to establish thresholds for hydrological variables and understand the climate sensitivity of the hydrological regime of the entire basin, so that policy makers and water managers can make sustainable water-resource-management decisions for this region.

AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						planting density; fertilization; the central composite design; fiber yield; analog optimization	INDUSTRIAL HEMP; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; QUALITY; STEM	Hemp is one of the most important green (i.e., environmentally sustainable) fibers. Planting density, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) significantly affect the yield of hemp fiber. By optimizing the above main four cultivation factors is an important way to achieve sustainable development of high-fiber yield hemp crops. In this study, the effects of individual factors and factor x factor interactions on the yield of hemp fiber over two trial years were investigated by the central composite design with four factors, namely planting density, nitrogen application, phosphorus application, and potassium application rate. The influences of these four test factors on the yield of hemp fibers were in the order nitrogen fertilizer (X-2) > planting density (X-1) > potassium fertilizer (X-4) > phosphate fertilizer (X-3). To obtain yields of hemp with high-quality fiber greater than 2200 kg ha(-1), the optimal range of cultivation conditions were planting density 329,950-371,500 plants/ha, nitrogen application rate 251-273 kg ha(-1), phosphorus application rate 85-95 kg ha(-1), and potassium application rate 212-238 kg ha(-1). This study can provide important technical and theoretical support for the high-yield cultivation of hemp fiber into the future.

Although some genes or biological processes involved in the interaction between eggplant and V. dahliae have been identified in some studies, the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we monitored the transcriptomic profiles of the roots of resistant S. sisymbriifolium plants challenged with V. dahliae. Based on the measurements of physiological indexes (T-SOD, POD and SSs), three time points were selected and subsequently divided into two stages (S_12h vs. S_0h and S_48h vs. S_12h). KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed several genes putatively involved in regulating plant-V. dahliae interactions, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes (MEKK1 and MAP2K1), WRKY genes (WRKY22 and WRKY33) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes (CYP73A/C4H, CYP98A/C3 ' H and CYP84A/F5H). In addition, a subset of genes that play an important role in activating V. dahliae defence responses, including Ve genes as well as genes encoding PR proteins and TFs, were screened and are discussed. These results will help to identify key resistance genes and will contribute to a further understanding of molecular mechanisms of the S. sisymbriifolium resistance response to V. dahliae.

The overuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of bacterial drug-resistance. To date, only 51 complete genome sequences of Aeromonas phages are available in GenBank. Here, we report the isolation of nine Aeromonas phages from a plateau lake in China. The protein cluster, dot plot and ANI analyses were performed on all 60 currently sequenced Aeromonas phage genomes and classified into nine clusters and thirteen singletons. Among the nine isolated phages, the DNA-packaging strategy of cluster 2L372D (including 2L372D, 2L372X, 4L372D, 4L372XY) is unknown, while the other five phages use the headful (P22/Sf6) DNA-packaging strategy. Notably, the isolated phages with larger genomes conservatively encode auxiliary metabolism genes, DNA replication and metabolism genes, while in smaller phage genomes, recombination-related genes were conserved. Finally, we propose a new classification scheme for Aeromonas phages.

The hybrid H11648 of Agave ((A. amaniensis x A. angustifolia) x A. amaniensis) is the main cultivar for fiber production in Brazil, China, and African countries. Small Auxin Up-regulated RNA (SAUR) genes have broad effect on auxin signaling-regulated plant growth and development, while only few SAUR genes have been reported in Agave species. In this study, we identified 43, 60, 24, and 21 SAUR genes with full-length coding regions in A. deserti, A. tequilana, A. H11648, and A. americana, respectively. Although phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice contained a species-specific expansion pattern of SAUR gene, no similar phenomena were observed in Agave species. The in silico expression indicated that SAUR genes had a distinct expression pattern in A. H11648 compared with other Agave species; and four SAUR genes were differentially expressed during CAM diel cycle in A. americana. Additionally, an expression analysis was conducted to estimate SAUR gene expression during different leaf developmental stages, abiotic and biotic stresses in A. H11648. Together, we first characterized the SAUR genes of Agave based on previously published transcriptome datasets and emphasized the potential functions of SAUR genes in Agave's leaf development and stress responses. The identification of which further expands our understanding on auxin signaling-regulated plant growth and development in Agave species.

A multi-folded transformation approach is used to design an illusion device with a circular opening window that allows for information interaction with the outside world. The results show that the proposed device can hide objects with arbitrary shapes or positions. Furthermore, in order to remove the material anisotropy of the proposed illusion device, a layered structure composed of homogenous and isotropic material is used based on the effective medium theory. The combination of the layered structure and the circular opening provide a flexible and feasible approach to achieve the partial implementation of the illusion device. It is hoped that these results may open an avenue for designing and implementing invisibility cloaks or illusion devices, and speed up potential applications for noise shielding, target camouflage, or target protection from active sonar signals.

However, interactions between AgNPs and proteins are poorly understood. Two dehydrogenases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), are chosen to investigate these interactions. Ag bound to thiol groups of these enzymes significantly decreases the number of free thiols available. Dose-dependent inhibition of enzyme activities is observed in both AgNPs and Ag+ treatments. Based on the concentration required to inhibit 50% activity, GAPDH and MDH are 24-30 fold more sensitive to Ag+ than to AgNPs suggesting that the measured 4.2% Ag+ containing AgNPs can be responsible for the enzymes inhibition. GAPDH, with a thiol group in its active site, is more sensitive to Ag than MDH, displaying many thiol groups but none in its active site, suggesting that thiol groups at the active site strongly determines the sensitivity of enzymes toward AgNPs. In contrast, the dramatic changes of circular dichroism spectra show that the global secondary structure of MDH under AgNPs treatment is more altered than that of GAPDH. In summary, this study shows that the thiol groups and their location on these dehydrogenases are crucial for the AgNPs effects.

The recent melting rate is still contained by considerable uncertainties, hindering to estimate precise glacier mass change. Here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole Indus Basin using SRTM and ALOS 30 m elevation data, improved glacier inventory, optimized glacier surface density, and validation through in-situ differential GPS and ICESat data. Our glacier inventory and derived by improving RGI6.0 boundaries and separated into debris cover and debris free parts. The derived surface elevation changes were converted into annual mass balances using separated density assumptions (four criteria) for debris-covered ice (900 +/- 60 kg m(-3)), debris-free ice (below 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) and above 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (600 +/- 60 kg m(-3))), respectively. The resulting mass balance biased between -0.20 and 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) a(-1) using an average (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) density assumption throughout the Indus Basin. In the western Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the Karakoram. The western (Hunza) and central (Shigar) Karakoram glaciers show negligible mass losses of -0.02 +/- 0.12 and -0.01 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) in contrast to the relatively more negative mass balance (-0.26 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1)) in the eastern (Shyok) Karakoram. All the sub-basins exhibit negative mass balances, with the most negative values ranging from -0.34 +/- 0.31 to 0.44 +/- 0.27 m w.e. a(-1) in the Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum sub-basins of the Himalaya. The whole Indus Basin contributes approximately +0.014 +/- 0.016 mm a(-1) to the global mean sea-level equivalent.

This study was executed using a cross-national, web-based survey to analyze and categorize Gen Z female (n = 435) and male (n = 377) consumers between 18 and 23 years of age living in the continental United States. The objectives of this study were to classify U.S. Gen Z consumers into unique segments based on their environmental consciousness and to assess the functional relationships among the following: (a) their degree of ecological awareness; (b) the importance of the perception of sustainable food attributes; (c) their food choices associated with healthy eating habits; and (d) sociodemographics. Survey data were analyzed using cluster analysis of consumer groups based on environmental consciousness. Environmental consciousness was measured using a composite score of the environmental involvement scale and the environmental values scale. Gen Z consumers with high environmental consciousness (sustainable activists) and moderate ecological awareness (sustainable believers) considered more eco-friendly and healthy product attributes when purchasing sustainable food, whereas Gen Z consumers with low environmental consciousness (sustainable moderates) considered more extrinsic product attributes (e.g., price and convenience). Furthermore, the results indicate that food choices associated with healthy eating habits could be used to develop a profile for different eco-conscious Gen Z consumer groups. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, for academic researchers, this paper extends marketing segmentation research concerning environmentally sensitive young consumers. Second, for industry professionals, this study provides food retailers or food service operators with sustainable consumer values that will aid in the development of effective, green marketing strategies to better attract and meet the sustainability expectations of Gen Z-the consumer segment with the most spending power of any generation.

Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue. Recent reports have shown that leptin can induce cancer cell proliferation and regulate cell energy metabolism, but the regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that leptin could promote cell proliferation and maintain high adenosine triphosphate levels in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), pyruvate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase subunit A and mitochondrial respiratory chain-associated proteins NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8, and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were distinctly increased in leptin-treated HCT116 and MCF-7 cells, while fatty acid synthase and lactate dehydrogenase expression were downregulated. Simultaneously, we found that c-Myc and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 (PGC-1) protein expression levels were significantly increased. These results indicated that leptin boosted fatty acid beta-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, and inhibited fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis in tumor cells. Gene transfection experiments revealed that leptin could induce the expression of c-Myc. Moreover, the expressions of PGC-1, CPT1A, and TFAM proteins were downregulated in HCT116 cells with low expression of c-Myc, and the expression levels of these proteins were increased in HCT116 cells overexpressing c-Myc. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism in tumor cells. It may regulate fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS of tumor cells by regulating the c-Myc/PGC-1 pathway. Targeting metabolic pathways for cancer treatment has been investigated as potential preventive or therapeutic methods. This study has important implications for the clinical therapy of tumor cell metabolism through hormone regulation.

Milky Way Tomography with the SkyMapper Southern Survey. I. Atmospheric Parameters and Distances of One Million Red Giants	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Galaxy: stellar content; methods: data analysis; stars: distances; stars: fundamental parameters	EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE; SKY SURVEY; STELLAR; CLUSTERS; STARS; SCALE; PHOTOMETRY; 2MASS; SDSS	Accurate determinations of atmospheric parameters (effective temperature T-eff, surface gravity log g, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and distances for large complete samples are of vital importance for various Galactic studies. We have developed a photometric method to select red giant stars and estimate their atmospheric parameters from the photometric colors provided by SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) data release (DR) 1.1, using stars in common with the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys as a training set. Distances are estimated with two different approaches: one based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes for nearby (d <= 4.5 kpc) bright stars and another based on the absolute magnitudes predicted by intrinsic color (g - i)(0) and photometric metallicity [Fe/H] for distant (d > 4.5 kpc) faint stars. Various tests show that our method is capable of delivering atmospheric parameters with a precision of similar to 80 K for T-eff, similar to 0.18 dex for [Fe/H], and similar to 0.35 dex for log g but with a significant systematic error at log g similar to 2.3. For distances delivered from (g - i)(0) and photometric [Fe/H], our test with the member stars of globular clusters show a median uncertainty of 16% with a negligible zero-point offset. Using this method, the atmospheric parameters and distances of nearly one million red giant stars are derived from SMSS DR1.1. Proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 are available for almost all of the red giant stars, and radial velocity measurements from several large spectroscopic surveys are available for 44% of these.

The genetic differentiation of the two genes was investigated among 10 geographically separated populations distributed in the Yunnan province. The complete sequence of the IFHSP70 cDNA had a length of 2158bp, and contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1962bp, encoding a 71-kDa polypeptide comprising of 653 amino acids. IFHSP90 cDNA had a length of 2144bp, and contained an ORF of 2103bp, encoding a polypeptide of 79.23kDa, comprising of 700 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of IFHSP70 and IFHSP90 shared high sequence identities with other fungi. Fundamental information pertaining to the protein families, signatures, and conserved motifs of Hsp70 and Hsp90 were also identified. Analysis of molecular variances (AMOVA) from the Hsp70 and Hsp90 genes showed that the genetic variation within-population (83.26%, 83.08%) was greater than among the populations (16.74%, 16.92%). The values of nucleotide diversity (Pi), haplotype diversity (Hd), coefficient of genetic differentiation (Fst), and gene flow (Nm) were calculated. For Hsp70, Pi=0.0425, Hd=0.888, Fst=0.167, Nm=1.24; For Hsp90, Pi=0.0420, Hd=0.894, Fst=0.169, and Nm=1.22.

J	Wang, J; Ding, LY; Tao, J; Ding, CZ; He, DM				Wang, Jun; Ding, Liuyong; Tao, Juan; Ding, Chengzhi; He, Daming			The effects of dams on macroinvertebrates: Global trends and insights	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						bibliometrics; biodiversity; climate change; flow alteration; fragmentation; macroinvertebrate	FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; STREAM-DWELLING CHARR; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; FLOW REGULATION; CITATION INDEX; RIVER; COMMUNITIES; FISH; REGIME; FAUNA	Dams threaten a wide range of aquatic organisms in most rivers and are thus a primary cause of global biodiversity degradation. Although macroinvertebrates play important roles in biogeochemical processes and ecosystem structuring and functioning through food web links, a global overview of research on their responses to dam construction and the subsequent flow alteration is lacking. This study bibliometrically analysed publications with regard to dams and macroinvertebrates over the last 100 years (1920-2018). The results found that macroinvertebrates have been increasingly studied in regard to damming rivers globally during the research period. The United States contributed the most to the total publication output (21.14%). Keyword analysis revealed a clear evolution and distributional pattern of research themes and studied taxa. Studies on a single taxon were more common in early times, and recent studies have shifted to multiple taxa at the community level. Different countries/territories have different research priorities (i.e., themes and taxa). "Dam removal" and "restoration" occurred more frequently in American studies, and "river regulation" was highly researched in Australia and Poland. "Schistosomiasis" was a featured topic in China and Brazil. "Mollusc" was the top taxon of focus for America, China, and Brazil. The results also demonstrated that "functional diversity," "model," and "stable isotope" are emerging hotspots in this research area. Possible explanations and implications of the above findings are discussed. This study provides an integral understanding of the research on dams and macroinvertebrates, highlighting the potential conservation imbalance among countries/territories and taxa.

Methodology for constructing p-n junction has become an important consideration in improving the performance of optoelectronic devices and broadening of its application in related fields. Currently, graphene-based p-n junctions have been explored and different structures have also been investigated. Herein, the recent progress on graphene homogeneous p-n junction is summarized, ranging from preparation of front-end materials (e.g., p- and n-type graphene) to building of planar and vertical p-n junctions. Furthermore, p-n junction via electrical modulation is described. The requirements for building the graphene homogeneous p-n junction, and the advantages and drawbacks of the different structures of the p-n junction are also discussed. Finally, a preferential technique to fabricate high performance p- and n-type graphene and building of the p-n junction is evaluated. This paper therefore provides an important indication on the future direction on the application of graphene in optoelectronics.

We evaluate the degree of this effect in the intracluster medium (ICM) with hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the buoyancy effect induced by ICM density stratification introduces qualitative changes to the turbulence energy evolution, morphology, and the density fluctuation-turbulence Mach number relation, and likely explains the radial dependence of the ICM turbulence amplitude as found previously in cosmological simulations. A new channel of energy flow between the kinetic and the potential energy is opened up by buoyancy. When the gravitational potential is kept constant with time, this energy flow leaves oscillations to the energy evolution, and leads to a balanced state of the two energies where both asymptote to power-law time evolution with slopes shallower than that for the turbulence kinetic energy of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We discuss that the energy evolution can differ more significantly from that of homogeneous isotropic turbulence when there is a time variation of the gravitational potential. Morphologically, ICM turbulence can show a layered vertical structure and large horizontal vortical eddies in the central regions with the greatest density stratification. In addition, we find that the coefficient in the linear density fluctuation-turbulence Mach number relation caused by density stratification is in general a variable with position and time.

The Galactic spiral structure as revealed by O- and early B-type stars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: early-type; Galaxy: disc; Galaxy: structure	H-ALPHA SURVEY; ARM; QUADRANT; REGIONS; CARINA	We investigate the morphology and kinematics of the Galactic spiral structure based on a new sample of O- and early B-type stars. We select 6858 highly confident OB star candidates from the combined data of the VST Photometric H alpha Survey Data Release 2 (VPHAS+ DR2) and the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2). Together with the O-B2 stars from the literature, we build a sample consisting of 14 880 O- and early B-type stars, all with Gaia parallax uncertainties smaller than 20 per cent. The new sample, hitherto the largest one of O- and early B-type stars with robust distance and proper motion estimates, covers the Galactic plane of distances up to 6 kpc from the Sun. The sample allows us to examine the morphology of the Scutum, Sagittarius, Local, and Perseus Arms in great detail. The spiral structure of the Milky Way as traced by O- and early B-type stars shows flocculent patterns. Accurate structure parameters, as well as the means and dispersions of the vertical velocity distributions of the individual spiral arms are presented.

In detail, the whole populations were classified into two types. For players of type A, they play prisoner's dilemma game, and for players of type B, they play snowdrift game. Once someone who are unsatisfied his performance, he is going to another type, otherwise, he will keep his current type constant. Through numerical simulation, we find that cooperation can be enhanced and even dominate the whole networks for moderate aspiration level. Besides, when the aspiration level is too large, cooperation level would be restrained. For these observations, we give an explanation from the points of evolutionary snapshots.

Conducting follow-up genetic association studies has become a standard approach to validate the findings of genome-wide association studies. One problem of high interest in genetic association studies is to accurately estimate the strength of the association, which is often quantified by odds ratios in case-control studies. However, estimating the association directly by follow-up studies is inefficient since this approach ignores information from the genome-wide association studies. In this article, an estimator called GFcom, which integrates information from genome-wide association studies and follow-up studies, is proposed. The estimator includes both the point estimate and corresponding confidence interval. GFcom is more efficient than competing estimators regarding MSE and the length of confidence intervals. The superiority of GFcom is particularly evident when the genome-wide association study suffers from severe selection bias. Comprehensive simulation studies and applications to three real follow-up studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimator. An R package, "GFcom", implementing our method is publicly available at https://github.com/JiyuanHu/GFcom.

The relatively short instrumental record of northern Pakistan makes long-term climate change assessments difficult. In this paper, tree-ring width chronologies were developed from two stands of spruce species (Picea smithiana) in the Karakoram region of northern Pakistan. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that tree-ring growth of spruce was limited by annual (June-May) precipitation. Based on the regional chronology, we developed an annual precipitation reconstruction for the period 1540-2016 CE. The precipitation reconstruction equation accounts for 40% of the regional precipitation variance during the instrumental period 1946-2016. Dry episodes with rainfall below the 477-year average occurred from 1569 to 1577, 1598 to 1612, 1621 to 1621, 1638 to 1654, 1673 to 1680, 1697 to 1720, 1728 to 1739, 1753 to 1761, 1777 to 1793, 1801 to 1840, 1860 to 1874, 1914 to 1932, 1960 to 1985, 1998 to 2011. Wet episodes occurred from 1540 to 1568, 1578 to 1597, 1613 to 1620, 1632 to 1637, 1655 to 1672, 1681 to 1696, 1721 to 1727, 1740 to 1752, 1762 to 1776, 1794 to 1800, 1841 to 1859, 1875 to 1913, 1933 to 1959, 1986 to 1997. Furthermore, the results of spatial correlation analyses show that the reconstructed precipitation represents the regional precipitation variations for northern Pakistan and nearby high-altitude mountains. The out-of-phase relationship in tree-ring records of the Karakoram region and surrounding areas suggests that the Karakoram was under the control of large-scale ocean-atmosphere-land circulations on a decadal timescale in the past centuries. In addition, by the comparison between the precipitation reconstruction and the instrumental data, we found that the drought risk of Karakoram has increased in the past 70 years and that extreme events are likely to become more severe and more frequent under the backdrop of climatic warming.

This study performed bioassays using the submerged macrophyte, Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, exposed to contaminated sediments collected from five locations in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China. Among the sediments collected, I-geo showed enrichment of As and Cd in Dianchi Lake sediments. In spite of enriched toxic metals at some locations, laboratory bioassays found no significant difference in leaf biomass or leaf photosynthesis rate between the sites. Root biomass and root activity showed significant differences between locations and were negatively correlated with the concentration of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb in sediment but not related to Cr. The above correlations were strongest for Hg and As, respectively. Accumulation of Cd and Pb to leaves of bioassay plants was observed, but this was not evident for As and Cr. Overall, the results indicate that V. natans can be used as a bioassay organism and measures of root toxicity are sensitive to metal concentrations present in Dianchi Lake sediments. Furthermore, the study species holds promise for use as a biomonitor of Cd and Pb sediment metal content.

For pathogenic fungi, this pathway not only enables fungi to grow over a wide pH range, but it also determines whether these fungi can successfully colonize and invade the targeted host. Within the pal/PacC pathway, palH is a putative ambient pH sensor with a seven-transmembrane domain. To characterize the function of a palH homolog, AopalH, in the nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora, we knocked out the encoding gene of AopalH through homologous recombination, and the transformants exhibited slower growth rates, greater sensitivities to cationic and hyperoxidation stresses, as well as reduced conidiation and reduced trap formation, suggesting that the pH regulatory system has critical functions in nematophagous fungi. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of pH response and regulation in fungi. (C) 2019 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although there are many video summarization models achieving good results, models based on low-level features cannot summarize important semantic information and models based on semantic analysis need related text descriptions that do not exist for most videos. As a consequence, the mining semantic information contained in the video itself is a more feasible way. In this paper, we propose an action parsing-driven video summarization model based on reinforcement learning. The model is mainly divided into two parts, video cut by action parsing and video summarization based on reinforcement learning. In the first part, a sequential multiple instance learning model is trained with weakly annotated data to solve the problem of full annotation's time consuming and weak annotation's ambiguity. In the second part, we design a deep recurrent neural network-based video summarization model that selects the most distinguishable frames comparing with other actions. Meanwhile, the quality of the extracted key frames could be evaluated by the categorization accuracy. Experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach.

HYBRIDIZATION; SEQUENCES; WELLS; GENUS; ACID	A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain C8-1(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Nicotiana tabacum L. collected from Kunming, south-west China. The cells showed oxidase-positive and catalase-positive reactions. Growth was observed at 10-40 degrees C, at pH 6.0-8.0 and in the presence of up to 1 % (w/v) NaCl, with optimal growth at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-8. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C-15 : 0 iso-C-17 : 0 and iso-C-17 : 1 omega 9c. The cellular polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, five unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified aminophospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 70.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain C8-1(T) should be assigned to the genus Lysobacter. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity analysis showed that strain C8-1(T) was closely related to Lysobacter cavernae YIM C01544(T)(98.6 %), Lysobacter soli DCY21(T) (97.6 %), Lysobacter panacisoli CJ29(T) (97.3 %), Lysobacter firmicutimachus PB-6250(T) (97.3 %), Lysobacter niastensis GH41-7(T) (97.3 %) and Lysobacter gummosus KCTC 12132(T) (97.1 %). DNA-DNA hybridization data indicated that the isolate may represent a novel genomic species belonging to the genus Lysobacter. Polyphasic taxonomic characteristics indicated that strain C8-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter tabacisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is C8-1(T) (=KCTC 62034(T)=CGMCC 1.16271(T)).

The isolate formed branched hyphae and no fragmentation was found. Clustered spore chains were borne from aerial mycelium. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained glutamic acid, alanine and meso-diaminopimelic acid. Whole-cell sugars were galactose, mannose, glucosamine, glucose and ribose. The major menaquinones were MK-9(H-6), MK-9(H-8) and MK-10(H-6). The polar phospholipids contained phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine and ninhydrin-positive phosphoglycolipid. Major fatty acids were iso-C-16(:0) and 10-methyl-C-17(:0). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YIM 75507(T) formed a stable and distinct lineage clustered with the genus Sinosporangium in the family Streptosporangiaceae. The draft genome sequence of strain YIM 75507(T) exhibited low average nucleotide identity to the closest related strain, Sinosporangium album CPCC 201354(T) (83.97 %), well below the 95-96 % species circumscription threshold. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 73.8 mol%. On the basis of morphological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence, strain YIM 75507(T) is assigned to a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Bailinhaonella thermotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MEMBER; PHYLOGENOMICS; LACEYELLA; VERSION; SOIL	The family Thermoactinomycetaceae comprises 43 validly published species, which were identified by a polyphasic taxonomic study based on molecular phylogenetics, physiological and biochemical characteristics. However, phylogenetic analysis merely based on 16S rRNA gene sequences cannot infer a robust and reliable phylogeny. For disentangling the phylogenetic relationships among members of this family, we used a large collection of genome data and the approach of phylogenomics, to re-examine their taxonomy. The topologies of phylogenomic trees are different from those of the 16S rRNA gene sequences. In addition, based on the average nucleotide identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization, phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, we found that Laceyella sediminis should be reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym of Laceyella tengchongensis; and reclassified Thermoactinomyces guangxiensis as Paenactinomyces guangxiensis gen. nov., comb. nov.; and establish Novibacillaceae fam. nov. to accommodate the genus Novibacillus as the type genus. In addition, compared to values calculated directly from genome sequences, the genomic DNA G+C contents mentioned in some species descriptions are too imprecise; and the corrected G+C content values have a significantly better fit to the phylogeny. Thus, the corresponding emendations of species descriptions are also proposed. In this paper, phylogenomics has been used to resolve the classification of the family Thermoactinomycetaceae.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Flavisolibacter nicotianae sp. nov.; polyphasic taxonomy; rhizosphere soil	EMENDED DESCRIPTION; GEN. NOV.; SEQUENCES; ACID	A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain X7X(T), was isolated from a rhizosphere soil sample of Nicotiana tabacum L. collected from a tobacco factory located in Kunming, south-western China. The cells showed oxidase-positive and catalase-positive reactions. Growth occurred at 20-40 degrees C and pH 6.0-8.0, with optimal growth at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C-15(:0), iso-C-17(:0) 3OH and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16(:1)omega 6c). The cellular polar lipids contained phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified aminophospholipid, two unidentified glycolipids, four unidentified aminolipids and four unidentified lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 49.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain X7X(T) should be affiliated to the genus Flavisolibacter. Results from further analysis showed that strain X7X(T) had highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Flavisolibacter metallilatus TX0661(T) (96.4%) and 'Flavisolibacter swuensis' SR2-4-2(T) (96.4 %), followed by other species of the genus Flavisolibacter. The polyphasic taxonomic characteristics indicated that strain X7X(T) represents a novel species of the genus Flavisolibacter, for which the name Flavisolibacter nicotianae sp. nov. (type strain X7X(T)=KCTC 62326(T)=CGMCC 16451(T)) is proposed.

However, the fire-induced drought stress on PMC and its spatial and temporal variations are unclear. Based on a parallel monitoring experiment from 2014 to 2015, this study compared the PMCs and soil moisture contents (SMC) at five post-fire sites in central Yunnan Plateau, Southwest China. The number of years since last fire (YSF), season, topographic position, plant species and tissue type (leaf and branch) were selected as causal factors of the variations in PMC and SMC. A whole year parallel monitoring and sampling in the post-fire communities of 1, 2, 5, 11 and 30 YSF indicated that drought stress in surface soils was the strongest in spring within the first 5 years after burning, and the SMC was regulated by topography, with 64.6% variation in soil moisture accounted for by YSF (25.7%), slope position (22.1%) and season (10.8%). The temporal variations of PMC and SMC differed at both interannual and seasonal scales, but the patterns were consistent across topographic positions. PMC differed significantly between leaves and branches, and among three growth-forms. The mean PMC was lower in broad-leaved evergreen species and higher in conifer species. Season and soil temperature were the primary determinants of PMC, accounting for 19.1% and 8.3% of variation in PMC, respectively. This indicated phenology-related growth rather than drought stress in soil as the primary driver of seasonal changes in PMC. The significant variations of PMC among growth forms and species revealed that seasonal soil temperature change and dominant species in forest communities are useful indicators of fire risk assessment in this region.

In this paper, urea-ZnO QDs were used as fluorescent probe to detect Cr6+ in solution. The emission from the as-synthesized urea-ZnO QDs is selectively quenched when Cr6+ ions were added. Moreover, there are two linear relationships between the quenching of fluorescence intensity and the Cr6+ concentrations ranging from 4 mu M to 1000 mu M, with the detection limit for Cr6+ at 19.53 nM (on basis of 3 sigma/slope criterion). The quenching of fluorescence is attributed to aggregation of the QDs and charge transfer between the QDs and Cr6+ by measurements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, UV-visible absorption spectra and fluorescence lifetime.

Beauveria species diversity is inventoried in seven vegetation types of the Gaoligong Mountains along an elevation gradient from 600 to 3800m. Strains were isolated from soil by using Tenebrio molitor larvae as baits and from naturally occurring insect cadavers carrying anamorphic or teleomorphic fruiting structures of Beauveria spp. The 231 isolated Beauveria strains were identified based on molecular phylogenetic analyses inferred from Bloc, nrSSU, nrLSU, TEF, RPB1, and RPB2 sequences. Eleven species were identified as Beauveria asiatica, B. bassiana, B. brongniartii, B. caledonica, B. medogensis, B. pseudobassiana, and B. sinensis, previously recorded in other Chinese environments, and B. baoshanensis sp. nov., B. malawiensis, B. rudraprayagi, and B. yunnanensis sp. nov., encountered in China for the first time. Species phylogenies are presented and morphological characters of the new species are described. Most isolates were identified as B. bassiana and B. pseudobassiana (86.1%), while the other nine species were isolated rarely. Beauveria was widely distributed in six vegetation types, but not in the vegetation type of the highest altitude. More than four species were encountered in vegetation types with moderate elevation, and these environments also showed highest diversity of plants and insects.

The variations of these observed decadal changes are assessed by the comparison between the present day (PD) of 1994-2011 and the early period (EP) of 1964-81. The compound HWs change most remarkably in all three aspects, with frequency averaged over China in the PD tripling that in the EP and intensity and spatial extent nearly doubling. The daytime and nighttime HWs also change significantly in all three aspects. A set of numerical experiments is used to investigate the drivers and physical processes responsible for the decadal changes of the HWs. Results indicate the predominant role of the anthropogenic forcing, including changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions in the HW decadal changes. The GHG changes have dominant impacts on the three types of HWs, while the AA changes make significant influences on daytime HWs. The GHG changes increase the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of the three types of HWs over China both directly via the strengthened greenhouse effect and indirectly via land-atmosphere and circulation feedbacks in which GHG-change-induced warming in sea surface temperature plays an important role. The AA changes decrease the frequency and intensity of daytime HWs over Southeastern China through mainly aerosol-radiation interaction, but increase the frequency and intensity of daytime HWs over Northeastern China through AA-change-induced surface-atmosphere feedbacks and dynamical changes related to weakened East Asian summer monsoon.

In this study, the extending lifetime of jute fiber based biosorbents for sequentially remedying aniline and heavy metal ions was demonstrated by a simple and practical chemical conversion. After jute fibers were firstly used for adsorbing aniline from water, the surface-adsorbed aniline was polymerized by using ammonium persulfate initiator at 5 degrees C to form a PANI overlayer, and the resulting PANI/jute fiber composites exhibited effective metal ion decontamination from water. The influence of parameters such as sorbent dosage, solution pH and contaminant concentration on the removal efficiency was investigated. The equilibrium adsorption, thermodynamics, kinetics and removal mechanism also were exhibited. The crude jute fibers showed a moderate adsorption capacity of 8.43 mg.g(-1) for aniline removal. After in-situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of jute fibers, the resulting PANI/jute fiber composites can effectively remove and reduce metal ions. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cd(II) and Cr(VI) reached to 140 and 50 mg.g(-1) respectively. The most meaningful contribution of this study was to provide a new approach of adsorbent regeneration and waste disposal for developing a sustainable water treatment technology.

However, their effects on natural ecosystems are largely unknown, in particular with different seasonal timing of the events and recurrence over multiple years. We conducted a 4 yr manipulative experiment to explore grassland response to heavy rainfall imposed in either the middle of, or late in, the growing season in Inner Mongolia, China. We measured hierarchical responses at individual, community and ecosystem levels. Surprisingly, above-ground biomass remained stable in the face of heavy rainfall, regardless of seasonal timing, whereas heavy rainfall late in the growing season had consistent negative impacts on below-ground and total biomass. However, such negative biomass effects were not significant for heavy rainfall in the middle of the growing season. By contrast, heavy rainfall in the middle of the growing season had greater positive effects on ecosystem CO2 exchanges, mainly reflected in the latter 2 yr of the 4 yr experiment. This two-stage response of CO2 fluxes was regulated by increased community-level leaf area and leaf-level photosynthesis and interannual variability of natural precipitation. Overall, our study demonstrates that ecosystem impacts of heavy rainfall events crucially depend on the seasonal timing and multiannual recurrence. Plant physiological and morphological adjustment appeared to improve the capacity of the ecosystem to respond positively to heavy rainfall.

J	Ma, WM; Cheng, R; Ke, H; Zhao, Z				Ma, Weimin; Cheng, Rong; Ke, Hua; Zhao, Zhang			Optimal pricing decision for supply chains with risk sensitivity and human estimation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Uncertainty theory; Risk-averse manufacturer; Human estimation; Chance-constrained programming; Pricing decision	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; MANUFACTURER; COMPETITION; IMPACT	In reality, consumption markets are changeable and uncertain in terms of consumer demands, product manufacturing costs, sales costs and so on. When facing these markets, the small and medium manufacturers are usually weak and risk sensitive vis-a-vis their counterpart power retailers, like Walmart, Carrefour, and TESCO. Therefore, human estimations on uncertain market information given by experienced experts and risk sensitivity of the weak manufacturers are of great significance for the optimal pricing strategies. Accordingly, this paper investigates the pricing decision problem in an uncertain supply chain where two risk-sensitive manufacturers distribute substitutable products into the same market through a common dominant and risk-neutral retailer. Uncertainty theory is employed to deal with human-estimation information and chance-constrained programming models are proposed to formulate the pricing decision problem with risk sensitivity. Moreover, numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Interestingly, we show that the results critically depend on the comparison between how much the demands and manufacturing costs of two competing products change with the manufacturers' risk-sensitivity levels. Correspondingly, based on the estimated uncertainty distributions of uncertain variables by experts, the weak manufacturers are suggested to adjust their risk-sensitivity levels strategically for their profitability.

The cuticles were attributed to a seed fern and several types of coniferalean plants based on the epidermal characters. The most predominant plant in the flora is a peltasperm seed fern, Germaropteris martinsii (Germar in Kurtze 1839) Kustatscher, Kerp et Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert, 2014. It is characterized by small, tongueshaped pinnuies with papillate polygonal epidermal cells and irregularly distributed stomatal apertures encircled by 5-7 subsidiary cells. Germaropteris martinsii has been mostly documented from the midlatitudinal to equatorial Euramerica and Cathaysia floras and indicates relative drier habitats. The current material from the much higher paleolatitudinal Angara realm not only extends the paleogeographical range of G. martinsii but also sheds substantial light on the regional paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions. In addition to xerophilous seed plants, few impression fossils of hydrophilous plants (lycopsids and calamites) also occurred in the cuticlebearing bed. Compared to the underlying floras, the plant assemblage described herein is distinguished by a high proportion of seed ferns and conifers, which probably indicates a shift in paleoclimatic conditions within the Guodikeng Formation.

Test strips were obtained by a dipping-drying process. On exposure to Co(II), they undergo a color change from white to brown, and on exposure to Fe(III) from white to pink. The limits of detection (LOD) are 2.6mgL(-1) for Co(II) and 2.2mgL(-1) for Fe(III). Test strips introduce a low-cost, portable, rapid and convenient tool for determination of Co(II) and Fe(III). In addition, two other analytical methods have been studied for detection of Co(II) and Fe(III) at low concentration. The first is UV-vis spectrometry which has a LOD as low as 0.14mgL(-1) for Co(II) (at 412nm) and 0.12mgL(-1) for Fe(III) (at 400nm). The second is dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a LOD of 3.0gL(-1) for Co(II) and 2.5gL(-1) for Fe(III).

In this work, observations were performed from 2010 March 11 to 2017 June 7 in the BVRI bands. We detected minute-scale rapid variabilities in the optical multi-band light curves. Durations of these rapid variabilities are from 5 to 77 minutes. The minimal decay timescale is about 3 minutes (2.330 +/- 1.572 minutes on 2012 May 22 and 3.172 +/- 1.626 minutes on 2017 May 20). After subtracting the host-galaxy component, The minimal decay timescale was about 8 minutes on 2017 June 3, and the corresponding duration is about 10 minutes. This fast variability requires the strength of the co-moving magnetic field in the jet larger than 38.60 G (19.69 G for corrected results, with Doppler factor delta(D) similar to 3). The discrete correlation function (DCF) analysis between B and I band short-term light curves show significant correlated variability; however, no significant time lags are detected. The color-magnitude variation shows significant negative correlation on intranight timescales, which is due to the superposition of multiple components.

The AMF parameters and soil properties were monitored in karst grassland after 2years of N and P addition. Then, AMF abundance, diversity, and community composition significantly differed between seasons. AMF abundance was higher in July (summer) than in December (winter), whereas richness and Chao1 estimator values showed the opposite results. The numbers of the genera Funneliformis and Sclerocystis were significantly more abundant in December, but the proportions of Scutellospora, Redeckera, and Diversispora were significantly higher in July. N and NP treatments significantly increased AMF abundance; richness and Chao1 values in the P treatment were significantly higher than those of the control in July. AMF community composition changed substantially between December and July but did not respond to fertilization. AMF abundance was significantly correlated with total N (TN), while AMF richness was also significantly correlated with available P (AP) and pH. pH and nitrate N (NO3--N) strongly affected AMF community composition. These results suggested that P became more limiting with N fertilization, AMF investment increased access to more P, and richness was lower when certain AMF taxa (Diversisporales) increased in abundance during the growing season and under more P-limiting conditions. These results also suggested that N and P addition have specifically different effects on AMF abundance and diversity, and consequently potential effect on long-term vegetation composition and productivity.

The two strains were Gram-stain-negative, non-gliding, produced flexirubin pigments, non-flagellated and aerobic bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis indicate that both YIM 102796(T) and YIM 102701-2(T) are members of the genus Flavobacterium, closely related to F. ummariense DS-12(T) (95.9% similarity) and F. ceti 454-2(T) (93.8% similarity), respectively. The two strains shared 95.1% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between the two strains were 76.5% and 22.9%, respectively, indicating that they are separate species. DNA G+Ccontents of YIM 102796(T) and YIM 102701-2(T) were 32.3mol% and 34.0mol%, respectively. Strains are able to grow at 4-37 degrees C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in 0-2% (w/v) NaCl. Predominant fatty acid constituents (>7%) were iso-C-15:0, summed feature 3 (C(16:1)6c and/or C(16:1)7c) and summed feature 9 (iso-C(17:1)9c and/or 10-methylC(16:0)). Menaquinone 6 is major respiratory quinone. The predominant polar lipids were very similar to each other, comprising phosphatidylethanolamine, and multiple unknown aminolipids and unidentified polar lipids, and an unidentified aminophospholipid. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic distinctiveness, it is suggested that the two strains represent two novel Flavobacterium species with strain YIM 102796(T) (=KCTC 52101(T)=CCTCCAB2016015(T)) as the type strain of Flavobacterium viscosus sp. nov. and strain YIM 102701-2(T) (=KCTC 52100(T)=CCTCCAB2016028(T)) as the type strain of Flavobacterium tangerina sp. nov.

J	He, KJ; Zhou, DM; Zhang, XJ; Nie, RC; Jin, X				He, Kangjian; Zhou, Dongming; Zhang, Xuejie; Nie, Rencan; Jin, Xin			Multi-focus image fusion combining focus-region-level partition and pulse-coupled neural network	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-focus image fusion; Focus region partition; Gaussian blurred; Pulse-coupled neural network; Nonsubsampled contourlet transform	NONSUBSAMPLED CONTOURLET TRANSFORM; PCNN; SEGMENTATION	Multi-scale transforms (MST)-based methods are popular for multi-focus image fusion recently because of the superior performances, such as the fused image containing more details of edges and textures. However, most of MST-based methods are based on pixel operations, which require a large amount of data processing. Moreover, different fusion strategies cannot completely preserve the clear pixels within the focused area of the source image to obtain the fusion image. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method based on focus-region-level partition and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. A clarity evaluation function is constructed to measure which regions in the source image are focused. By removing the focused regions from the source images, the non-focus regions which contain the edge pixels of the focused regions are obtained. Next, the non-focus regions are decomposed into a series of subimages using NSCT, and subimages are fused using different strategies to obtain the fused non-focus regions. Eventually, the fused result is obtained by fusing the focused regions and the fused non-focus regions.

J	Bao, XG; Wang, LZ				Bao, Xuguang; Wang, Lizhen			A clique-based approach for co-location pattern mining	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Co-location pattern; Spatial neighbor relationship; Row-instance; Clique-based approach		Co-location pattern mining refers to the task of discovering the group of features (geographic object types) whose instances (geographic objects) are frequently located close together in a geometric space. Current approaches on this topic adopt a prevalence threshold (a measure of a user's interest in a pattern) to generate prevalent co-location patterns. However, in practice, it is not easy to specify a suitable prevalence threshold. Thus, users have to repeatedly execute the program to find a suitable prevalence threshold. Besides, the efficiency of these approaches is limited because of the expensive cost of identifying row-instances of co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel clique-based approach for discovering complete and correct prevalent co-location patterns. The proposed approach avoids identifying row-instances of co-location patterns thus making it much easier to find a proper prevalence threshold. First, two efficient schemas are designed to generate complete and correct cliques. Next, these cliques are transformed into a hash structure which is independent of the prevalence threshold. Finally, the prevalence of each co-location pattern is efficiently calculated using the hash structure. The experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electron mobility of metal oxide semiconductor has a certain impact on response and operating temperature of gas sensor. Heterojunction composites of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and perovskite materials have attracted much attention due to their great potential for gas sensors. In this paper, a gas sensor for monitoring methanol gas was developed based on nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dot/Ag-LaFeO3 (NCQDs/Ag-LaFeO3) p-n heterojunction materials (NALPN). NCQDS and Ag-LaFeO3 form a heterojunction, which improves the carrier transport ability and separation of electron-hole pairs. The surface of NCQDS contains -COOH, optimize the selectivity of Ag-LaFeO3 to methanol gas. Gas sensitivity test results show that the NALPN to 5 ppm methanol gas possessed high response (73), low operating temperature (92 degrees C) and good selectivity. These excellent properties prove that NALPN materials are the main competitors for future gas sensitive materials.

Records in the southwest and northern parts of this basin show long-term contrasting trends, despite the fact that geochemical evidence for alteration is similar in both parts of the basin, i.e. towards less alteration since 10 Ma. However, contrasting clay mineral assemblages in the northern and southwestern areas do suggest long-term changes in the relative climate of Indochina and southern China. We interpret this to reflect the northward migration of the ITCZ since the Miocene resulting in a progressive drying of Indochina and increasingly wet conditions in South China. Sediment believed to be supplied from the Mekong River (IODP Site U1433) shows increasing chemical weathering at a time of long-term drying of the climate. This probably reflects increasing chemical weathering driven by slower transport and despite reduced rates of chemical alteration in the context of a colder, drier climate since the Miocene. In general hematite/goethite data are consistent with pollen constraints from the same drill site that show colder conditions with increasing hematite/goethite since 3 Ma and with a transition to apparently wetter conditions since the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT). This implies that most of the sediment in the southwestern basin is weathered and eroded during warmer, wetter interglacial phases, at least since the MPT.

J	Tian, R; Tian, LD				Tian, Ran; Tian, Lide			Two decades ammonium records from ice core in Qiangyong glacier in the Northern Himalayas	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Glaciochemical record; Ammonium; Ice core; South Asia; Tibetan Plateau	SOUTHERN TIBETAN PLATEAU; EMISSION INVENTORY; ASIAN MONSOON; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; RONGBUK GLACIER; STABLE-ISOTOPES; MOUNT EVEREST; PRECIPITATION	The increase in anthropogenic emissions and associated climate change have become a growing critical environmental concern, with significant implications for human health and ecological security. The rapid economic growth in South Asia has contributed additional stress on the atmospheric environment in the surrounding regions. Earlier ice core chemical studies revealed a strong atmospheric transport to the Himalayan region from South Asia through the Indian summer monsoon. Continuous observation of atmosphere chemistry is not yet available, while ice core chemical record from high mountain regions can serve as an alternative proxy. So far, the influence of these transports on the southern Tibetan Plateau has not been adequately evaluated as only a few glaciochemical records are rebuilt. Here, we present a chemical record from a shallow ice core (with depth of 21.4 m), which was retrieved from the Qiangyong Glacier in the rain-shadow area of the Himalayas drilled in 2009 and dated back to the past 23 years of 1987-2009. The primary objective was to retrieve glaciochemical record and establish possible sources of soluble components, in particular those of NH4+. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the eight major ions series (Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, NH4+, K+, Cl-, NO3-, So(4)(2-)) from this core reveals that NH4+ is loaded primarily separately on EOF3, likely suggesting a specific source out of the other ion signals. Both a back-trajectory model and the correlation analysis between NH4+ and So(4)(2-) indicate the anthropogenic origin from South Asia. Although earlier ice core records showed a curbed increasing trend in NH4+, our new data reveals that the increasing trend continued after 1980 and experienced a rapid increase after 2000. This trend is in accordance with the increasing population and agriculture activities in South Asia, corresponding with increasing anthropogenic emission. Spatial comparison of the Qiangyong ice core record with existing NH4+ records from other ice cores in the Tibetan Plateau show that concentrations of NH4+ are regionally increasing. However, the relatively small rise in Qiangyong record is probably in association with the effective transportation barrier of the Himalayas. This study advances the knowledge of atmospheric environmental change in the northern Himalayas and the air mass transport of anthropogenic pollutants from South Asia to the southern Tibetan Plateau via the summer Indian monsoon.

This first application of Kr-81 dating on midlatitude glacier ice was made possible by recent advances in Atom Trap Trace Analysis, particularly a reduction in the required sample size down to 1 mu L STP of krypton. Eight ice blocks were sampled from the bottom of the glacier at three different sites along the southern edges. The Kr-81 data yield upper age limits in the range of 15-74 ka (90% confidence level). This is an order of magnitude lower than the ages exceeding 500 ka which the previous Cl-36 data suggest for the bottom of the Guliya ice core. It is also significantly lower than the widely used chronology up to 110 ka established for the upper part of the core based on ice delta O-18. Plain Language Summary The oldest ice that has ever been found outside of the polar regions is from the bottom of the Guliya ice cap in the western Kunlun mountains on the Tibetan Plateau. Previous dating results from the Guliya ice core, drilled in 1992, indicate that the bottom ice is more than 500,000 years old. However, due to the lack of alternative dating methods in that time range, the age scale of the Guliya ice core has so far not been checked independently. In this work we present dating results for the Guliya ice cap with a new dating method for ice based on the radioactive decay of the extremely rare krypton isotope Kr-81. Eight ice samples were retrieved at three different margin sites of the Guliya ice cap, where the old bottom ice is expected to resurface. The Kr-81 measurements for these samples yield upper age limits in the range of 15-74 ka, which is significantly lower than the previous dating results for the ice core.

Experiments were carried out for the climatic conditions of Chennai, India, with two different concentrations of nanofluids inside a stepped basin under three different cases. Results show that there is an improvement in yield of fresh water from stepped solar still by 33.18% and 41.05% using 0.1% and 0.2% volume concentration of TiO2 nanofluid, respectively, whereas the freshwater yield from stepped still with MgO nanofluids improved by 51.7% and 61.89%. Furthermore, the economic analysis revealed that the cost of potable water from the modified solar still reduced from 0.029 to 0.016 $/kg. Similarly, the useful annual energy, yearly cost per kilogram, and annual cost per kilowatt hour are significantly profitable with the use of MgO nanofluid in the stepped basin and found as 512.46 kWh, 0.025 $/kg, and 0.026 $/kWh, respectively. It is also found that the cost of potable water from the modified still significantly increases as the amount of fresh water produced is decreased with increased fabrication cost of the solar still.

In this study, a novel multi-metal-resistant Hg-volatilizing fungus belonging to Lecythophora sp., DC-F1, was isolated from multi-metal-polluted mining-area soil, and its performance in reducing Hg bioavailability in soil when used in combination with biochar was investigated. The isolate displayed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 84.5 mg.L-1 for Hg(II) and volatilized >86% of Hg(II) from LB liquid medium with an initial concentration of 7.0 mg.L-1 within 16 h. Hg(II) contents in soils and grown lettuce shoots decreased by 13.3-26.1% and 49.5-67.7%, respectively, with DC-F1 and/or biochar addition compared with a control over 56 days of incubation. Moreover, treatment with both bioagents achieved the lowest Hg content in lettuce shoots. Hg presence and DC-F1 addition significantly decreased the number of fungal ITS gene copies in soils. High-throughput sequencing showed that the soil fungal community compositions were more largely influenced by DC-F1 addition than by biochar addition, with the proportion of Mortierella increasing and those of Penicillium and Thielavia decreasing with DC-F1 addition. Developing the coupling of Lecythophora sp. DC-F1 with biochar into a feasible approach for the recovery of Hg-contaminated soils is promising. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dielectric-loaded black phosphorus surface plasmon polariton waveguides	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							GRAPHENE; CHANNEL; WEDGE; MODES	By using the effective-index method (EIM) and the finite element methods (FEM), a surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waveguide structured by a dielectric ridge placed on monolayer black phosphorus is proposed and analyzed in the infrared spectral region. It is found that the strong anisotropic dispersion of the black phosphorus (BP) gives rise to direction-dependent waveguide modes in a dielectric-loaded black phosphorus waveguide (DLBPW). The effective mode index, propagation loss and cutoff wavelength of higher order modes are investigated along the armchair (AC) and the zigzag (ZZ) directions of the black phosphorus. Moreover, the propagation characteristics of single-mode are investigated for different widths of the dielectric ridge and different polarization directions of the black phosphorus. Via tuning the carrier density, the electromagnetic field propagation features can be effectively modified. Also, the coupling effect by adding more dielectric bridges can tune the propagation properties. These results will lead to great applications in black phosphorus-based optical integrated devices.

More than half known species of this species group were recorded exclusively from high altitude zone to the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. In our recent field survey in the Huanglong National Nature Reserve (located to the east of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) in Sichuan Province, China, we collected dozens of specimens of the H. melanderi group there. In the present study, these specimens are subjected to species delimitation based on data of not only morphology, but also DNA barcodes (nucleotide sequences of a 658-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene). The five new species thus recognized are described: Hirtodrosophila minshanensis sp. nov., H. lambda sp. nov., H. zhangae sp. nov., H. zouae sp. nov., and H. nigrispina sp. nov. In addition, an updated key to all species of the H. melanderi species group is provided.

To determine the dominant control on soil bacterial diversity in a typical dry-hot valley (DHV) of southwestern China, we collected soil samples in farmland, garden land and forestland along four elevation gradients of < 600, 600-700, 700-800, and > 800 m. Soil bacterial community abundance and composition was determined by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA. The results showed that the dominant phyla in all soil samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. Soil bacterial absolute abundance in farmland was the greatest, followed by forestland and garden land. Differences in soil bacterial composition among three land uses were significant (p < 0.05) at elevations < 600 and 600-700 m. Four alpha-diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, ACE and chao1) of soil bacteria in forestland and farmland showed insignificant differences among elevation gradients. Redundancy analysis indicated that land use was the dominant control on soil bacteria diversity, implying that shifts in land use could impact soil microbial diversity.

However, most studies have only focused on inflected and derived words while disregarding compound words, and have mainly examined the differences between native speakers and L2 leamers without addressing language proficiency levels. This paper investigates the language proficiency effect on L2 English learners' processing of all the three types of MCWs in a masked transposed letter priming paradigm. Results showed that the high proficiency learners adhered to the Post-lexical Model in general, while the low proficiency learners presented a blurred tendency due to their poor whole-word memory and overall processing efficiency. Different morphological types caused gradable priming effects with compounds on the top of the continuum. In sum, language proficiency as well as morphological types impacts L2 learners' MCW processing mechanisms.

Comparative feeding behaviour of native and introduced terrestrial snails tracks their ecological impacts	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Alien species; functional response; interspecific competition; non-indigenous species	CEPAEA-NEMORALIS GASTROPODA; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; LAND SNAILS; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; COMPETITION; PULMONATA; INVASION; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; PREDATION	A developing body of theory and empirical evidence suggest that feeding behaviour as measured by the functional response (FR) can assist researchers in assessing the relative potential, ecological impacts and competitive abilities of native and introduced species. Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.

J	Yang, YP; Zhang, B; Wei, JY				Yang, Yuan-Pei; Zhang, Bing; Wei, Jian-Yan			How Bright Are Fast Optical Bursts Associated With Fast Radio Bursts?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	CURVATURE RADIATION; HOST GALAXY; PLASMA	The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unknown. Multiwavelength observations during or shortly after the FRB phase would be essential to identify the counterpart of an FRB and to constrain its progenitor and environment. In this work, we investigate the brightness of the "fast optical bursts" (FOBs) associated with FRBs and the prospects of detecting them. We investigate several inverse Compton (IC) scattering processes that might produce an FOB, including both the one-zone and two-zone models. We also investigate the extension of the same mechanism of FRB emission to the optical band. We find that a detectable FOB with the current and forthcoming telescopes is possible under the IC scenarios with very special conditions. In particular, the FRB environment would need to invoke a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field and an extremely fast spin, or an extremely young supernova remnant surrounding the FRB source. Furthermore, most electrons in the source are also required to have a fine-tuned energy distribution such that most of the IC energy is channeled in the optical band. We conclude that the prospect of detecting FOBs associated with FRBs is low. On the other hand, if FOBs are detected from a small fraction of FRBs, these FOBs would reveal extreme physical conditions in the FRB environments.

Effects of polyester microfibers on soil physical properties: Perception from a field and a pot experiment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Polyester microfibers; Soil bulk density; Porosity; Aggregate size-distribution	MID-YUNNAN PLATEAU; ORGANIC-MATTER; AGGREGATE FRACTIONS; MICROPLASTICS; DYNAMICS; LITTER; CARBON; WATER	Understanding soil physical properties is essential for soil quality management and sustainable land use. With the growing accumulation of microplastics in soils, a better understanding of the impact of microplastics on soil physical properties is crucial to conserve and manage soil quality. This study explored the effects of polyester microfiber (PMF) concentrations (0, 0.1% and 0.3%) on bulk density, porosity, aggregation and hydraulic conductivity of a clayey soil from a field experiment (1 year) and a pot experiment (6 wet-dry cycles). Polyester microfibers significantly increased the volume of >30 mu m pores and reduced the volume of <30 mu m pores compared to the control treatment. However, there were no detectable changes in the soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity between the PMF treatments and the control treatment. Interestingly, we observed that polyester microfibers significantly increased the contents of water stable large macroaggregates (>2 mm) in the 0.3% PMF (44%) and 0.1% PMF (39%) treatments compared to the control treatment (31%) in the pot experiment, but this was not true in the field experiment. The efficient interaction between polyester microfibers and fine soil particles and the frequent wet-dry cycles enhanced the formation and stability of macro-aggregates induced by polyester microfibers in the pot experiment Overall, our results provide valuable evidence for microplastic influences on soil physical properties. Because microplastics are long-term anthropogenic contaminants, it is necessary to further study the impacts of microplastics on soil quality for terrestrial ecosystem sustainability.

In this study, soils were sampled from 30 grasslands across >2000 km on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to determine the distribution patterns of methanotrophs and their driving factors at a regional scale. Methanotroph abundance and community composition were analyzed using quantitative PCR and Illumina Miseq sequencing of pmoA genes, respectively. The pmoA gene copies ranged from 8.2 x 10(5) to 1.1 x 10(8) per gram dry soil. Among the 30 grassland soil samples, Upland Soil Cluster Gamma (USC gamma) dominated the methanotroph communities in 26 samples. Jasper Ridge Cluster (JR3) was the most dominant methanotrophic cluster in two samples; while Methylocystis, cluster FWs, and Methylobacter were abundant in other two wet soil samples. Interestingly, reanalyzing the pmoA genes sequencing data from existing publications suggested that USC gamma was also the main methanotrophic cluster in grassland soils in other regions, especially when their mean annual precipitation was <500 mm. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates including all soil samples indicated that the methanotrophic community composition was significantly correlated with local environmental factors, among which mean annual precipitation and pH showed the strongest correlations. Variance partitioning analysis showed that environmental factors and spatial distance were significant factors affecting the community structure of methanotrophs, and environmental properties were more important factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that atmospheric methane may be mainly oxidized by USC gamma in upland soils. They also highlight the key role of water availability and pH in determining the abundance and community profiles of grassland soil methanotrophs. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A qualitative exploration of smartphone addiction among working adults in China	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Smartphone addiction; Symptoms; Psychological factors; Working adults; China	MOBILE PHONE; PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS; 5-FACTOR MODEL; PERSONALITY; DEPENDENCY; USAGE; BEHAVIOR; STRESS	BackgroundSmartphones currently dominate people's lives and interests due to their increased affordability and functionality. However, the negative aspects of smartphone use, such as smartphone addiction, have recently been brought up. This study utilized a qualitative approach to explore the symptoms of smartphone addiction among working adults in China and the psychological factors that affect such addiction.MethodsSemi-structured interviews, either face to face or via Skype (online), were conducted with 32 Chinese workers. The collected data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach in Nvivo 10 software.ResultsThis study identified four typical symptoms of smartphone addiction, namely, withdrawal (e.g., experiencing negative feelings when having no access to smartphones), salience (e.g., constant checking and thinking about smartphones), conflict (e.g., smartphone use interferes with family and work life), and phantom phone signals (e.g., illusory perception of a phone vibrating or ringing). Conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extroversion increase the likelihood of smartphone addiction. Notably, this study found that conscientious workers are likely to develop smartphone addiction, a finding that is contrary to those of the majority of existing studies on technological addiction.ConclusionsThis study revealed various smartphone addiction symptoms among young Chinese workers, and these include withdrawal, salience, conflicts, and phantom phone signals. Conscientious, neurotic, and extroverted employees are likely to exhibit these symptoms.	[Li, Li] Yunnan Univ, Sch Journalism, Baijia Rd, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Lin, Trisha T.

Fourteen novel biotinylated podophyllotoxin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for cytotoxic activity for this study. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activity in the following human cancer cell lines, SW480, MCF-7, A-549, SMMC-7721, and HL-60 by MTT assay. Most of them exhibited potent cytotoxic effects and compound 15 showed the highest cytotoxic activity among the five cancer cell lines tested, having its IC50 values in the range of 0.13 to 0.84 mu M. Apoptosis analysis revealed that compound 15 caused obvious induction of cell apoptosis. Compound 15 significantly down-regulated the expression level of the marker proteins (caspase-3 and PARP) in H1299 and H1975 cells, activated the transcription of IRE1 alpha, increased the expression of GRP78 and XBP-1s, and finally induced apoptosis of H1299 cells. In vivo studies showed that 15 at a dose of 20 mg/kg suppressed tumor growth of S180 cell xenografts in icr mice significantly. Further molecular docking studies suggested that compound 15 could bind well with the ATPase domain of Topoisomerase-II. These data suggest that compound 15 is a promising agent for cancer therapy deserving further research.

Strain engineered linear dichroism and Faraday rotation in few-layer phosphorene	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article								We investigate theoretically the linear dichroism and the Faraday rotation of strained few-layer phosphorene, where strain is applied uniaxially along the armchair or zigzag direction of the phosphorene lattice. We calculate the optical conductivity tensor of uniaxially strained few-layer phosphorene by means of the Kubo formula within the tight-binding approach. We show that the linear dichroism and the Faraday rotation of few-layer phosphorene can be significantly modulated by the applied strain. The modulation depends strongly on both the magnitude and direction of strain and becomes more pronounced with increasing number of phosphorene layers. Our results are relevant for mechano-optoelectronic applications based on optical absorption and Hall effects in strained few-layer phosphorene.	[Li, L. L.; Peeters, F.

Quantum and transport mobilities of a Na3Bi-based three-dimensional Dirac system	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SEMIMETAL; FERMIONS; CARBON; GAS	The electronic and transport properties of a three-dimensional (3D) Dirac system are investigated theoretically, which is motivated by recent experimental measurements on quantum and transport mobilities in the 3D Dirac semimetal Na3Bi by J. Xiong et al. [Science 350, 413 (2015); Europhys. Lett. 114, 27002 (2016)]. The electron Hamiltonian is taken from a simplified k center dot p approach. From the obtained electronic band structure and the Fermi energy, we explain why the anomalous effect induced by the chiral anomaly and the Berry curvature in the energy band can be observed experimentally in magnetotransport coefficients in both low-and high-density samples. Moreover, the quantum and transport mobilities are calculated on the basis of the momentum-balance equation derived from a semiclassical Boltzmann equation with the electron-impurity interaction. The quantum and transport mobilities obtained from this study agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with those measured experimentally. We also examine the electron mobilities along different crystal directions in Na3Bi and find them largely anisotropic. The theoretical findings from this work can be helpful in gaining an in-depth understanding of the experimental results and of the basic electronic and transport properties of newly developed 3D Dirac systems.

However, experimental techniques of PSS are time consuming and expensive, and thus it's very urgent to develop efficient computational approaches for predicting PSS based on sequence information alone. Moreover, the feature matrix of a protein contains two dimensions: the amino-acid residue dimension and the feature vector dimension. Existing deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable performances of PSS prediction, but the methods often utilize the features from the amino-acid dimension. Thus, there is still room to improve computational methods of PSS prediction.ResultsWe propose a novel deep neural network method, called DeepACLSTM, to predict 8-category PSS from protein sequence features and profile features. Our method efficiently applies asymmetric convolutional neural networks (ACNNs) combined with bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural networks to predict PSS, leveraging the feature vector dimension of the protein feature matrix. In DeepACLSTM, the ACNNs extract the complex local contexts of amino-acids; the BLSTM neural networks capture the long-distance interdependencies between amino-acids. Furthermore, the prediction module predicts the category of each amino-acid residue based on both local contexts and long-distance interdependencies. To evaluate performances of DeepACLSTM, we conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets: CB513, CASP10 and CASP12. Results indicate that the performance of our method is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines on three publicly datasets.ConclusionsExperiments demonstrate that DeepACLSTM is an efficient predication method for predicting 8-category PSS and has the ability to extract more complex sequence-structure relationships between amino-acid residues. Moreover, experiments also indicate the feature vector dimension contains the useful information for improving PSS prediction.

In this work, we propose a coevolution rule between individuals' node weights and aspiration, and then explore how this mechanism affects the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game. We show that there is an optimistic amplitude of node weights that guarantees the survival of cooperation even when temptation to antisocial behavior is relatively large. An explanation is provided from a microscopic point of view by dividing nodes into four different types. What is interesting, our coevolution rule results in spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance, where defectors with low weight become cooperators by imitating cooperators with high weight.

The time and cost of transmission, storage, processing and analysis of these genetic data have become bottlenecks that hinder the development of genetics and biomedicine. Although there are many common data compression algorithms, they are not effective for genome sequences due to their inability to consider and exploit the inherent characteristics of genome sequence data. Therefore, the development of a fast and efficient compression algorithm specific to genome data is an important and pressing issue. Results We have developed a referential lossless genome data compression algorithm with better performance than previous algorithms. According to a carefully designed matching strategy selection mechanism, the advantages of local matching and global matching are reasonably combined together to improve the description efficiency of the matched sub-strings. The effects of the length and the position of matched sub-strings to the compression efficiency are jointly taken into consideration. The proposed algorithm can compress the FASTA data of complete human genomes, each of which is about 3GB, in about 18min. The compressed file sizes are ranging from a few megabytes to about forty megabytes. The averaged compression ratio is higher than that of the state-of-the-art genome compression algorithms, the time complexity is at the same order of the best-known algorithms.

In the present study, a novel metal-catalyzed chemical corrosion (MCCC) method on purifying industrial silicon powder, consisting of HF concentration, corroding temperature, H2O2 concentration and corroding duration were studied. The evolution of typical precipitates phases on the surface of silicon to each etchant were investigate before and after etching with/without MCCC via EPMA (electron probe micro analyzer) equipped with EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy). The results showed that numerous microporous structures applied on the surface of silicon powder by MCCC are beneficial for the removal of impurities. After MCCC, the purity of silicon powder can be improved from 99.48 to 99.99 wt%, which is higher than 99.93 wt% obtained without MCCC. It was found that the removal reaction of boron and phosphorus by MCCC from industrial silicon powder in accordance well with the cracking shrinking kinetic model, which was confirmed to be controlled by both of interfacial transfer and diffusion through the product layer process. Furthermore, the chemical reaction mechanism of MCCC was revealed. The impurities deep removal under leaching step would greatly relieve successive impurities removal stress, even shorten the traditional metallurgical routes, which is of great significance to high-effective and clean produce solar grade silicon for industrial (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we conducted in situ measurements of soil CH4 flux rates monthly throughout the year after the short-term litter input manipulations (i.e. Detritus Input and Removal Treatment-DIRT: control, CK; double litter, DL; no litter, NL; no roots, NR; and no aboveground litter and no roots, NRNL) in a coniferous forest (Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco) ecosystem in subtropical China. The associated microclimates, soil properties and microbial PLFAs were also measured. Our results showed that soils acted as CH4 sink in all litter manipulation treatments, and the CH4 sink capacity significantly differed under litter manipulation treatments. Based on annual average values, net CH4 uptake rates decreased by 37.7 +/- 4.9% and 41.7 +/- 5.8% in the NL and NRNL treatments (i.e. litter layer removal), respectively, compared to the CK treatment. Thus, the net CH4 uptake induced by litter layer approximately accounted for 37.7 +/- 4.9% of the total net CH4 uptake rate. The net CH4 uptake rate was not significantly influenced by the root exclusion (NR) treatment. In contrast, the effect of litter addition on net CH4 uptake rate was strongly depended on soil water content. During the dry season, litter addition did not significantly affect net CH4 uptake rate. In contrast, during the wet season, the net CH 4 uptake rate decreased by 47.1 +/- 4.9% in the DL treatment compared to the CK treatment. There was no significant difference in net CH4 uptake rate between dry and wet season under other litter input manipulation treatments. The net CH4 uptake rate was positively correlated with the abundance of methanotrophic bacteria across all litter input manipulation treatments, whereas the significant negative relationship between net CH4 uptake rate and water filled pore space (WFPS) was only found in the DL treatment. Overall, our results suggest that aboveground organic layer (i.e. litter) is more important in regulating the soils acting as atmospheric CH4 sink than roots, while the regulating function primarily depends on soil dry/wet conditions and the abundance of methanotrophic bacteria.

The Mikania micrantha management program is a source of great theoretical and practical insights for regional agricultural and forestry development. In this paper, the invasion history and distribution patterns of M. micrantha in the China-Myanmar Border Region are summarized, and the short-term and long-term performance of the current post-border management program are evaluated. A literature survey found that M. micrantha was mainly distributed in 85 townships of five municipalities along the border in China with Myanmar, suggesting an explicit border-crossing scenario of M. micrantha. The M. micrantha management program has produced positive but short-term results due to the conduction of general investigations, establishment of an extensive monitoring network, development of integrated measures, and improvements of public awareness and participation. However, the long-term management performance was hampered by overlapping departmental functions, lagging and unreliable public feedback, inadequate funding, and biased and passive strategies. We suggest that invasive species committees, social media tools, public-private partnership, and forest restoration and conservation and biological control could greatly improve the situation. This regional-scale research provides referential insights for the development of biological invasion management systems in developing economies under transboundary contexts.

The approach was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), via competitive supramolecular recognition, between p-sulfonated calix[6] arene (CX6)-modified reduced graphene oxide (CX6@RGO) and a probe-resveratrol complex. The probe molecule (Rhodamine B or rhodamine 123) had a strong fluorescence signal, and its fluorescence was quenched by CX6@RGO, based on FRET. When the target molecule was added to CX6@RGO, the probe molecule was displaced by resveratrol, and a host-guest complex, CX6@RGO-resveratrol formed, turning-on the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence intensity of the CX6@RGO-probe complex increased linearly with increased resveratrol concentrations (2.0-40.0 mu M). The proposed approach was used to determine resveratrol in red wine with satisfactory detection limits and recoveries. Compared with traditional determination methods, our procedure is advantageous because it saves time, is easy to operate, and does not require sample pretreatment.

Herein, two new emitters, namely ND-AC and CND-AC, featuring a naphthyridine or cyano-naphthyridine segment as the electron acceptor and an acridine unit as the electron donor were designed, synthesized and investigated. The nearly orthogonal molecular configuration of the target emitters not only endows them with small energy differences between singlet and triplet states for ensuring TADF character but also affords a remarkable AIE feature. Due to the high photoluminescence quantum yields, and excellent TADF and AIE characteristics, the doped and non-doped OLEDs based on ND-AC exhibit outstanding performances with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 16.8% and 12.0%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the naphthyridine-based emitters have a promising application in OLEDs.

Copper-based chalcogenides as the core materials of optoelectronic applications have unique advantages and have attracted increasing attention. Among many copper (Cu)-based chalcogenides, ternary compounds of CuMO2 with delafossite structures have been used as promising candidates in many optoelectronic fields. However, there is not a comprehensive understanding of the variations of the intrinsic nature of delafossite CuMO2 compounds because of M3+-ion substitution. To solve these issues, CuMO2 (M = IIIA, 3d, 4d, 5d, and RE elements, a total number of 49) compounds are systematically analyzed by density functional theory based on a high-throughput computational platform. In the quasi-two-dimensional layered superlattice structure of the delafossite CuMO2 compound, the transport behavior of photogenerated carriers is affected mainly by the Cu hexagonal closed plane. The [CuO2] dumbbell structure and [MO6] octahedra mainly determine the generation of carriers excited by incident photons. The [CuM3O] tetrahedra that connect the other motifs mainly affect the behaviors between the generation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the heteroatomic interactions in the [CuM3O] tetrahedra are the decisive factors for the band gap values of delafossite CuMO2 compounds, which can be quantitatively described by the physical properties of the M component and can accurately predict the band gap value. Finally, these 49 delafossite CuMO2 compounds are classified and screened for the potential optoelectronic applications according to requirements and screening criteria of the band gap values for different optoelectronic functional applications. These calculated results will contribute to the further development of novel Cu-based optoelectronic functional materials and provide scientific support and theoretical guidance for subsequent related research.

It is believed that animals live longer at lower body temperatures. However, the precise mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that autophagy serves as a boost mechanism for longevity at low temperature in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The adiponectin receptor AdipoR2 homolog PAQR-2 signaling detects temperature drop and augments the biosynthesis of two omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. These two polyunsaturated fatty acids in turn initiate autophagy in the epidermis, delaying an age-dependent decline in collagen contents, and extending the lifespan. Our findings reveal that the adiponectin receptor PAQR-2 signaling acts as a regulator linking low temperature with autophagy to extend lifespan, and suggest that such a mechanism may be evolutionally conserved among diverse organisms.

In particular, the growth-promoting effect of reNFB on invasive plants remains unknown. In this study, 131 strains of potential nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated and purified from the roots of the invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, in Southwest China. Phylogenetically, these reNFB were categorized into three phyla at 97% sequence identity that included Proteobacteria (92.4%), Actinobacteria (4.6%), and Firmicutes (3.1%). The dominant isolates ranked by number were Pseudomonas (80 isolates, 61.1%), Rhizobium (12 isolates, 9.2%), and Duganella (11 isolates, 8.4%). The community composition and diversity of A. adenophora reNFB were markedly different across study regions. The capacity of these reNFB to accumulate indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphate, and produce siderophores was determined. All 131 isolates of reNFB accumulated IAA, 67 isolates solubilized phosphate, and 108 isolates produced siderophores. Among the three dominant genera of reNFB, Pseudomonas had the highest phosphorus solubilization and siderophore production, while the accumulation of IAA in the genus Duganella was the lowest. Interestingly, the calculated reNFB Shannon diversity index of each A. adenophora individual was negatively correlated with the capacity of reNFB to produce growth-promoting products. Six randomly selected isolates from three dominant genera were further used to conduct inoculation experiments, and all isolates showed significant positive growth-promoting effects on A. adenophora seedlings. The contribution of reNFB to the root biomass was higher than that to the shoot biomass. Our results suggest that reNFB, similar to soil or nodular nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can potentially promote plant growth and may play an important role in the invasion of nonleguminous plants. More detailed studies on the correlation between reNFB and invasive plants are necessary.

RIBLL Collaboration	beta-decay spectroscopy of S-27	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							DELAYED PROTON EMISSION; REACTION-RATES; SI-26(P,GAMMA)P-27 REACTION; COULOMB DISSOCIATION; 2-PROTON EMISSION; LIGHT-NUCLEI; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS; MASS; GRAPHS; TABLES	Background: beta-decay spectroscopy provides valuable nuclear physics input for accurate modeling of nova and x-ray burst observables and a stringent test for shell-model theories far from the stability line. The decay scheme of S-27 is complicated and far from being understood due to a lack of experimental data prior to this work. Purpose: We aim to experimentally constrain the thermonuclear Si-26(p, gamma)P-27 reaction rate and to probe the possible mirror asymmetry in S-27 and Na-27 decays. Method: The S-27 ions were collected by double-sided silicon strip detectors operating in conjunction with high-purity germanium detectors, so the positrons, protons, and gamma rays emitted in the decay were measured simultaneously. Results: The precise resonance energy and the ratio between gamma and proton partial widths of the key 3/2(+) resonance were obtained, thereby determining the Si-26(p, gamma)P-27 reaction rate based mainly on experimental constraints. The half-life of S-27, the excitation energies, beta-feeding intensities, log ft values, and Gamow-Teller transition strengths for the states of P-27 populated in the beta decay of S-27 were determined. A more complete S-27 P-decay scheme was constructed and compared to the beta decay of mirror nucleus Na-27 and to the shell-model calculations with the universal sd (USD) Hamiltonian taking into account the shift of single-particle energies and the reduction of two-body matrix elements. Conclusions: This work yields a new Si-26(p, gamma)P-27 reaction rate two orders of magnitude lower than the rate recommended in the reaction rate libraries at around 0.1 GK. Experimental evidence for the observation of mirror asymmetries for the Gamow-Teller transitions of S-27 and Na-27 is also provided. The shell-model calculations using a modified USD interaction related to the weakly bound proton 1s(1/2) orbit give a reasonable description of the decay properties of S-27.	[Sun, L. J.; Xu, X.

Often, algorithms for the automated identification of species are based on a pre-processing of acoustic information that involves the generation of spectrograms. Even though this approach is technically advanced, recent surveys highlight substantially high failure rates to identify species correctly, which urges for improved processes. Here, we tested an entirely new method, in particular, the transformation of ultrasonic recordings into variant maps. To compare this method with a spectrogram-based method, we used a database consisting of 160 echolocation calls from eight European bat species, including species of the genus Myotis that are inherently difficult to separate based on echolocation calls. For non-Myotis species, both methods led to a 100% correct identification rate, while for Myotis species the use of variant maps led to a lower identification rate of 85.3% compared to 91.1% that was achieved with a spectrogram-based method. However, a combination of both methods could lead to an identification rate of 94.1% for Myotis species. This result suggests combining our approach with spectrogram-based techniques to improve the automated identification of species based on acoustic information.

Much research has been carried out on the impacts on birds of wetland restoration and management projects in China. Studies have mainly investigated central or coastal wetlands, while inland wetlands in remote areas have been much less studied. We focused on examining the response of wild birds to wetland restoration in Dianchi Lake, south-west China. Methods: The line transect method was performed at 26 sampling plots. Three of these were in the city, and to acquire all wild bird data 23 plots were located every 2-8 km along the shore of Dianchi Lake, between December 2011 and November 2013. We collected all related bird records by searching the available literature, articles, newspapers and records of birdwatchers to compare species variation before and after implementation of wetland restoration. To measure the relationships between waterbird assemblages and habitat structures, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to pair the main matrix of bird assemblages with a second matrix of habitat variables. Results: We recorded 182 bird species belonging to 51 families and 17 orders. Of the species, 42 were new records for Kunming City and 20 were new records for Yunnan Province. Ten waterbird species were found to have disappeared from the shore of Dianchi Lake. CCA results indicated that waterbirds could be divided into four categories based on their habitat preference: synanthropic (wintering gulls), special habitat (shorebirds), semi-natural (wintering coots and ducks) and disturbance-tolerant (resident) species. Conclusions: Our study is the first to consider the entire wild bird community throughout the year and discuss the species variation before and after wetland restoration projects launched for Dianchi Lake. Distinct habitat requirements of different waterbird groups were detected in our study, suggesting different types of restoration and management should be implemented.

After calcination, spindle-like Ni/Fe MOFs are transferred into porous NiFe2O4 nanorods. The resulting NiFe2O4 based sensor shows an excellent sensitivity (almost 60-500 ppm), good selectivity against various VOCs, and a good linearity in wide concentration and stability for toluene detection. Three major aspects of good catalytic activity, large surface area, and porous structures of NiFe2O4 are significantly attributed to the excellent gas-sensing performances. These findings demonstrate a new perspective of bimetallic Ni/Fe MOFs-derived NiFe2O4 for the promising application in toluene gas sensor.

Sr Isotope Analysis of Picogram-Level Samples by Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry Using a Highly Sensitive Silicotungstic Acid Emitter	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PRECISE DETERMINATION; CHEMICAL-SEPARATION; GEOLOGICAL SAMPLES; ICP-MS; SM-ND; LU-HF; RB-SR; RATIOS; STRONTIUM; TIMS	Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) has shown excellent analytical precision for Sr isotopic ratio analysis, even for small masses of material (0.5-10 ng). However, because of the sensitivity limit of TIMS, it is still not possible to obtain high precision Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios for picogram-level sample sizes (30-100 pg) due to the lack of a highly sensitive emitter. This study is the first to employ a highly sensitive silicotungstic acid emitter to measure Sr isotopes at the picogram-level using TIMS. This emitter produces a 3-fold enhancement in the ionization efficiency of Sr and not only significantly reduces the required sample size but also has good external precision. Analyses of the NIST 987 standard yield an external reproducibility (2 RSD, n = 8) better than +/- 0.013% even for 30 pg of Sr. It is possible to yield an internal precision (2 RSE) of +/- 0.003% for 100 pg of sample using the default 10(11) Ohm feedback resistors. This method was verified by using a suite of silicate reference materials. Replicate digestions and analyses (n = 8) of the basalt standard BCR-2 (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.704998 +/- 0.000028, 2 SD) at the 326 +/- 30 pg level demonstrates that good external reproducibility is reached on ultratrace level silicate samples. This method has a wide variety of potential applications for samples containing ultralow amounts of Sr in geoscience and archeological studies, such as single grains of mica, sphalerite, and pyrite, single mantle melt inclusions, precious extra-terrestrial materials, and human hair to name just a few.

As an important form of eco-innovation, industrial clusters' innovative behaviors need to be studied from the perspective of resources. The creation of resources requires the enterprises have the ability to create new resources, which will directly affect the quality and quantity of the enterprises' eco-innovation resources, and then affect the enterprises' eco-innovation performance. Therefore, we define the green dynamic capacity of creation of eco-innovation resources of Marine industrial clusters firstly, and then analyze the impact of green dynamic capacity on the eco-innovation performance of Marine industrial clusters from a theoretical perspective, and finally discuss the relationship between the eco-innovation network structure, green dynamic capacity and eco-innovation performance of Marine industrial clusters from the perspective of complex social network by means of modeling and simulation.

In addition, the existing model cannot be updated according to the actual situation. This article proposes a novel adaptive neighborhood preserving embedding algorithm as well as an online fault-detection approach based on adaptive neighborhood preserving embedding. This approach combines the approximate linear dependence condition with neighborhood preserving embedding. According to the newly proposed update strategy, the algorithm can achieve an adaptive update model that realizes the online fault detection of processes. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach are verified by experiments of the Tennessee Eastman process. Theoretical analysis and application experiment of Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate that in this article proposed fault-detection method based on adaptive neighborhood preserving embedding can effectively reduce the false alarm rate and improve the fault-detection performance.

MATTER DECOMPOSITION; NITROGEN; RESPIRATION; MINERALIZATION; VEGETATION; ROOT; N-15; ABUNDANCES; FRACTIONS; ECOSYSTEM	The huge background pool of soil organic carbon (SOC) is likely to impede the ready detection of SOC changes. We propose to explore SOC changes by monitoring the dynamics of soil labile organic carbon (LOC); namely if LOC could be largely retained in soils rather than respired rapidly, the SOC would be ready to be sequestered. The effects of the two major functional groups of plants, that is, canopy trees and understory plants, on SOC accumulation were then illustrated with this LOC-based approach. The characteristics of LOC and SOC of topsoils (0-20 cm) in a field manipulation experiment with 5-yr treatments of understory removal and tree girdling in both a young and a mature Eucalyptus plantations were examined. The concentration and potential turnover time of soil LOC were used to indicate the state of vegetation-induced C accumulation in soils, which were estimated by a sequential fumigation-incubation procedure. Soil natural abundances of 13C and 15N were measured to reflect the proportion of newly retained LOC in soils. We found that, in the young plantation, understory removal did not significantly affect both soil LOC and SOC concentrations, but significantly increased the potential turnover time of soil LOC. In contrast, in the mature plantation, understory removal significantly decreased soil LOC and SOC concentrations, but did not significantly alter the potential turnover time of soil LOC. However, tree girdling did not significantly affect SOC concentration, soil LOC concentration, or potential turnover time in either the young plantation or the mature plantation. These results demonstrated that understory plantderived C was one of the major components of LOC pool in topsoils, and it may be readily mineralized in the young plantation but accumulated as an important fraction of SOC in the mature plantation. This study suggests that the LOC-based approach is potentially useful in monitoring SOC changes and improves our understanding of how plant functional groups and soil fertility status could jointly affect LOC and SOC dynamics. In considering the great contribution of understory plants to SOC processes, we propose that understory plants should be maintained in subtropical plantation ecosystems.

In order to minimize the concentration of total phosphorus (TP), experiments were carried out using 3(3)-factorial designs with three levels and three factors. A Box-Behnken design, which is the standard design of RSM, was used to evaluate the effects and interactions of three major factors (Fe:P (w/w) ratio, coagulation pH and fast mixing speed (FMS)) on the treatment efficiency. A multivariable quadratic model developed for studying the response indicated that the values for optimum conditions for Fe:P (w/w) ratio, coagulation pH and FMS were 2.40, 6.48 and 100 rev min(-1), respectively. Under optimal process conditions, the TP concentration in the distillery effluent was reduced from 10 mg L-1 to 0.215 mg L-1, representing a removal efficiency of 97.85%. Based upon the statistical evaluation of results, it is inferred that RSM can be used as an appropriate approach to optimize the coag-flocculation process. Meanwhile, the study has shown that, for the equivalent dose of ferric chloride, the average three-step effect is better than that of the one-time addition.

Due to previously limited sample collection size, the data about the diversity and structure of the host insect was insufficient and lacked details. The purpose of this study was aimed to discuss the diversity and phylogeography of the host insects of O. sinensis with a large-scale sampling. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (cox1) was sequenced and analyzed among 710 samples representing 88 geographic locations. 205 haplotypes of cox1 were identified from all the 710 samples and 4 phylogenetic clades with 12 subclades were identified. Instead of the single latitude-based divergence suggested previously, three distribution patterns were deduced to correspond to the phylogeographic structures, including but not limited to the co-existence of a wide and specific local phylogeographic distribution structures. Two separate genetic diversity and differentiation centers, namely the northwestern Yunnan and the southeastern Tibet were identified. Dating analyses from three calibrations supported that the divergence of the 4 clades occurred in the Oligocene-Miocene period (30.54-13.66 million years ago) (Ma), which were connected with the second and third geological movements of the QTP (17-25, 8-13 Ma). Our results provide a more detailed understanding of the divergence and distribution patterns of the host insects of O. sinensis.

J	Guan, Z; Jia, Y; He, M				Guan, Zheng; Jia, Yao; He, Min			A Bidirectional Polling MAC Mechanism for IoT	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); media access control; bidirectional polling systems; delay; theoretical closed form expression	PROTOCOL; SYSTEMS	The Point Coordination Function (PCF)-based access control mechanism in IEEE 802.11 allows an access point to schedule stations in order to avoid hidden nodes and collisions. However, nearly all existing performance analysis models focus on the single-directional communication scenario, and these polling mechanisms consume a significant amount of energy resources. This study proposes a hybrid service bidirectional polling access control mechanism for transmission between an AP and N stations. To improve energy efficiency, the downlink data queue is assigned after all the uplink station queues, which allows the uplink station to sleep after it completes the data transmission, and it can remain in the sleep state until the downlink begins to broadcast. Then, a classical two-queue asymmetrical polling model is employed to analyze the performance of the PCF-based bidirectional access control system, and a Markov chain and generating function are used to derive a closed-form expression of the mean access delay for the uplink and downlink data. Simulations confirm that the proposed MAC mechanism could provide a maximum energy consumption reduction to 70% for 80 stations with respect to the limited-1 service mechanism in IEEE 802.11a PCF and the two-level polling model. Our analytical results are highly accurate for both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic.

However, to date, only a few tree-ring based climate reconstructions exist from this region. Here, we present a regional tree-ring chronology from the moisture-sensitive Zeravshan juniper (Juniperus seravschanica Kom.) from the Kuramin Range (Tajikistan) in western Central Asia, which is used to reveal past summer drought variability from 1650 to 2015 Common Era (CE). The chronology accounts for 40.5% of the variance of the June-July self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) during the instrumental period (1901 to 2012). Seven dry periods, including 1659-1696, 1705-1722, 1731-1741, 1758-1790, 1800-1842, 1860-1875, and 1931-1987, and five wet periods, including 1742-1752, 1843-1859, 1876-1913, 1921-1930, and 1988-2015, were identified. Good agreements between drought records from western and eastern Central Asia suggest that the PDSI records retain common drought signals and capture the regional dry/wet periods of Central Asia. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates the existence of centennial (128 years), decadal (24.3 and 11.4 years), and interannual (8.0, 3.6, 2.9, and 2.0 years) cycles, which may be linked with climate forces, such as solar activity and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The analysis between the scPDSI reconstruction and large-scale atmospheric circulations during the reconstructed extreme dry and wet years can provide information about the linkages of extremes in our scPDSI record with the large-scale ocean-atmosphere-land circulation systems.

In this work, NaAlP2O7:xEu(3+) (x= 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13%) phosphors have been synthesized using a facile solid-state reaction method. In the solid solution, Eu3+ ion successfully replaces Na+ ion in NaAlP2O7 host. To determine absorption properties of pure and Eu3+ doped NaAlP2O7, theoretical computations and diffuse reflectance absorption measurements have been implemented. Photoluminescence spectra show the red light emission under the broad irradiation wavelength region from near-UV to visible light. Under near-UV light (395 nm) excitation, it exhibits a strong red light emission peaking at 612 nm (D-5(0) -> F-7(2) of Eu3+). The emission intensity reaches maximum at doping level of 9 mol% Eu3+, and the concentration quenching mechanism have been discussed in detail. For NaAlP2O7:9% Eu3+, the color purity of the red light is as high as 90%, and the internal quantum efficiency is 35.8%. The performances mean that NaAlP2O7:Eu3+ materials may be potentially applied as red phosphor for near-UV white LEDs.

However, available habitats for bird species are changing due to intensifying human activity, especially in the context of China's mass urbanization. Urban sprawl has taken over the wetlands along the lakes in the past decades, which places tremendous pressure on wetland ecosystems and, therefore, on bird communities. However, the ways urban land cover pattern along the urban-rural gradient affects bird communities is still unclear. To investigate the influence of land cover pattern on the alpha and beta diversity of birds in the urban-rural gradient we chose 31 sites distributed within the wetlands around the Dianchi Lake in Yunnan, China. We calculated the species richness to indicate alpha diversity and used the Morisita-Horn index to indicate beta diversity. Meanwhile, we assessed the land cover pattern of each site by measuring the proportion of emergent plants, floating plants, submerged plants, ponds, forests, lawns, roads, agricultural lands and built lands in a quadrat of 1 square kilometer. Simple linear regressions, model selection, and an averaging approach based on corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) were used to test the effects of land cover pattern on bird diversity. Using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test, we compared the difference between alpha and beta diversity, respectively, along the urban-rural gradient. Based on our analyses, urban and suburban wetland birds were significantly homogeneous. The community structure in rural wetlands, however, was significantly different from that of the suburban and urban areas. According to our research, the land cover patterns that influenced bird species richness were the built lands acreage, submerged plants acreage, ponds acreage, and the edge density of emergent plants. Meanwhile, of these variables, the built lands acreage, ponds acreage and edge density of emergent plants were significantly different in urban, suburban, and rural wetlands. Therefore, to maintain high biodiversity in wetlands affected by urbanization, we must pay more attention to the land cover patterns.

Here, we examined soil prokaryote communities at three elevations to explore soil prokaryote community distribution and mediation factors in Noijin Kangsang Peak, Tibetan Plateau. Results showed prokaryote community compositions differed significantly by elevations. Topsoil or subsoil prokaryote richness and Shannon diversity were significantly lower at the middle than other elevations, while significantly higher aboveground biomass (AGB) and available P (AP) were found at the middle elevation. The importance of P for both soil layers was discovered by variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis, finding that soil AP and total phosphorus, interacted with pH, explained 43% the variance in topsoil prokaryote community compositions, while soil AP, as well as AGB, explained 44% in subsoil. Consistently, structural equation model also revealed that AP was a mediating factor for prokaryote community diversity. Other than plant beta diversity, soil prokaryote beta diversity positively correlated with AP difference significantly. Taken together, the distribution patterns of soil prokaryote community were distinct along elevations even in a small scale in Noijin Kangsang Peak and was likely mediated predominantly by soil AP in both topsoil and subsoil.

J	Rogers, A; Er, XZ				Rogers, Adam; Er, Xinzhong			Dual-component plasma lens models	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; gravitational lensing: micro; plasmas; pulsars: general	EXTREME SCATTERING EVENTS; LIGHT CURVES; INTERSTELLAR; CAUSTICS	In contrast to the converging, achromatic behaviour of axisymmetric gravitational lenses, diverging frequency-dependent lensing occurs from refraction due to a distribution of overdense axisymmetric plasma along an observer's line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify and dim the appearance of background sources as a function of frequency. Plasma lensing is believed to be involved in a number of separate phenomena involving the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events of background radio sources, and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts. These lensing phenomena are believed to occur in dense environments, in which there may be many density perturbations between an observer and background source. In this work we generalize individual plasma lens models to produce dual-component lenses using families of plasma lens models previously studied in the literature, namely the exponential and softened power-law lenses. Similar to binary gravitational lens models, these dual-component plasma lenses feature a rich and complex critical and caustic morphology, as well as generate more complicated light curves. We map the number of criticals formed for a given component separation and angular size, and highlight a relevant degeneracy between two particular models. This work provides an argument in favour of close monitoring of extreme scattering events in progress in order to break such model degeneracies.

Photocatalysts based on only the lattice disorder but without the reduction states are still quite lacking and challenging. To this end, we explored a new type of lattice disorder in terms of the surface atom non-stoichiometry strategy in BaTiO3. Well-dispersed tetragonal BaTiO3 nanocrystals with a uniform size (similar to 20 nm) and cuboid morphology were hydrothermally synthesized through controlling over t-butylamine and oleic acid. HRTEM coupled with structural evolution analysis reveals the existence of a Ti-rich layer on BaTiO3 nanocrystals with surface atom disorder, which gives an overall Ti/Ba ratio of 1.50:1. This is mainly dominated by the oriented adsorption between oleic acid and surface Ba2+ of the nucleus during solution reaction. Such a surface disorder and Ti-rich nonstoichiometry effect could facilitate the enhanced visible-light absorption with a wavelength span of 400-700 nm that enables the superior visible-light photocatalytic property, which is not subject to the reduction states. This work demonstrates a first white material presenting a new type of lattice disorder that would be helpful for a wide range of photocatalyst explorations.

The source regions for the regional Zn-Pb mineralization in the SYG are still controversial, mostly in regard to the Emeishan flood basalts, basement rocks and host rocks. The Maozu Zn-Pb deposit is geographically close to the SYG center, which could also indicate that it is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center than those deposits along the SYG margin. However, the origin of the ore-forming Zn in the Maozu deposit has not been constrained until now. In this study, the Zn and S isotopic compositions and Fe and Cd concentrations of the sphalerite from the Maozu deposit are investigated to evaluate the Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite precipitation, the source regions of the ore-forming zinc and sulfur, and the center of the regional Zn-bearing fluid system. It is suggested that the Zn isotopic fractionation between the sphalerite and original fluid during sphalerite precipitation could be limited due to the striking decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid. The Zn isotopic variation of the sphalerite from four mining levels in the Maozu deposit is really small (-0.06 to +0.23 parts per thousand), which could be attributed to heterogeneous Zn isotopic compositions in original incoming fluid rather than Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite deposition. As such, in the Maozu deposit, the Zn isotopic compositions of original hydrothermal fluid could approximately be represented by the Zn isotopic signals documented in sphalerite (-0.06 to +0.23 parts per thousand). We found that the Zn isotopic signatures of incoming fluid are largely overlapped with those of the basement rocks (+0.10 to +0.34 parts per thousand), signifying that the ore-forming Zn could be predominantly sourced from the basement rocks. However, in the Maozu deposit, the ore-forming sulfur is most likely derived from the sulfur-bearing evaporates hosted in the country rocks via thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The contrasting sources of ore-forming zinc and sulfur suggest the mixing of Zn-bearing fluid from the basement rocks and sulfur-bearing fluid from the host rocks, which could be responsible for the sharp decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid in the Maozu deposit. Combined with the results of previous studies, the integrally lower Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite in the Maozu deposit compared to those deposits along the SYG margin may demonstrate that the Maozu deposit is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center. If this is the case, Zn isotopes could be an effective proxy to trace the Zn source of Zn-enriched ore deposits and to identify the regional Zn-bearing fluid center of Zn-enriched metallogenic provinces.

CB00686	ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTIFILARIAL ACTIVITY; FILARIAL NEMATODES; BRUGIA-MALAYI; ONCHOCERCIASIS; ENDOSYMBIONTS; BIOSYNTHESIS; ANTIBIOTICS; SCREEN; DRUGS	Lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis diseases caused by filarial parasite infections can lead to profound disability and affect millions of people worldwide. Standard mass drug administration campaigns require repetitive delivery of anthelmintics for years to temporarily block parasite transmission but do not cure infection because long-lived adult worms survive the treatment. Depletion of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, present in most filarial nematode species, results in death of adult worms and therefore represents a promising target for the treatment of filariasis. Here, we used a high-content imaging assay to screen the pure compounds collection of the natural products library at The Scripps Research Institute for anti-Wolbachia activity, leading to the identification of kirromycin B (1) as a lead candidate. Two additional congeners, kirromycin (2) and kirromycin C (3), were isolated and characterized from the same producing strain Streptomyces sp. CB00686. All three kirromycin congeners depleted Wolbachia in LDW1 Drosophila cells in vitro with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in nanomolar range, while doxycycline, a registered drug with anti-Wolbachia activity, showed lower activity with an IC50 of 152 +/- 55 nM. Furthermore, 1-3 eliminated the Wolbachia endosymbiont in Brugia pahangi ovaries ex vivo with higher efficiency (65%-90%) at 1 mu M than that of doxycycline (50%). No cytotoxicity against HEK293T and HepG2 mammalian cells was observed with 1-3 at the highest concentration (40 mu M) used in the assay. These results suggest kirromycin is an effective lead scaffold, further exploration of which could potentially lead to the development of novel treatments for filarial nematode infections.

The present study investigates the water and sediment bacteria by epifluorescence microscopy in the reservoir (above the dam site), as well as in the downstream river stretches (below-dam site) at the middle reach of Lancang River during the wet, the normal and the dry seasons. The results demonstrated that the reservoir operating regime (water discharge variations) and strong precipitation promoted significant differences in the conditions of the river below the dam, especially for the concentration of dissolved oxygen, redox potential, electric conductivity, turbidity, and total dissolved solids in water and concentration of microbial activity in sediment. The seasonal variations were also key factors influencing water quality at the below-dam sampling sites. Nutrients concentration did not induce a significant response in bacterial abundance when inorganic nutrients were sufficient. Bacterial density in sediment was regulated by hydropower-related discharge, particle size, and type of sediments, while bacterial abundances in water were strongly linked with the physicochemical characteristics of the water, such as total dissolved solids and conductivity.

The biological activity of such imidazolium salts was further evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that the electron-withdrawing group on the aza-brazilan moiety, substituted 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a 4-methylbenzyl group were essential for modulating the cytotoxic activity. Compounds 55 and 39, bearing a 4-methylbenzyl substituent at position-3 of 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole, were found to be the most potent compounds with IC50 values of 0.52-1.30 mu M and 0.56-1.51 mu M against four human tumor cell lines investigated. Particularly, compound 57 exhibited inhibitory activity against the MCF-7 cell line with an IC50 value of 0.35 mu M and was 56-fold more sensitive than DDP. Moreover, compound 55 inhibited cell proliferation through inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells.

Accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal pattern of urban greenspace is important to fully understand its ecosystem services provision. While numerous studies have investigated the spatial pattern of urban greenspace and its change, few studies have explored how the spatial pattern of urban greenspace differ in urban areas developed in different years. Here, we chose Shenzhen as the study area, compared the spatial pattern of urban greenspace in urban areas developed in different years. We found urban areas developed in more recent years tend to have higher percent cover of greenspace than older ones. The proportion of greenspace (55.62%) in the most recently developed urban areas (2015-2017) was more than three times greater than that (17.24%) developed in and before 1979. We also found significant variation in spatial configuration of greenspace. The size of the largest patch in more recently developed urban areas tend to increase. Additionally, more recently developed urban areas tend to have larger variations in patch size and more edges of greenspace. In addition to the general trend, we also found clear patterns of changes in certain time periods, which are likely results of the implementation of urban management and planning policies. For example, percent cover of greenspace in areas built after 2010 is significantly higher than that in many other years. The results of this study revealed how pattern of urban greenspace varied along with the process of urbanization, which can help us review the achievements of urban development and provide useful information for better urban planning and management.

J	Zhou, GD; Zhou, S; Zhu, Q; Zhao, N				Zhou, Guodong; Zhou, Shuang; Zhu, Qiang; Zhao, Ni			Improving Operational Stability of p-Type Field-Effect Transistors by Charge Selective Electrodes: a General Strategy	ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						bias stress stability; conjugated polymers; field-effect transistors; graphene; quantum dots	FREQUENCY 1/F NOISE; ORGANIC TRANSISTORS; CONTACT RESISTANCE; STRESS; NANOCRYSTALS; FILMS	Operational instability caused by unintentional electron injection is a common problem for field-effect transistors (FETs) based on relatively narrow-bandgap semiconductors. Typically, the electron injection is followed by electron trapping at the semiconductor/dielectric interface or sometimes in the bulk semiconductor, resulting in a modification of the built-in field in the FETs. Such a dynamic process causes continuous threshold voltage or Dirac voltage (V-th/Dirac) shift and thus unstable device operation. A charge-selective electrode (CSE) design is used to address these problems. The CSE is formed by inserting a molybdenum trioxide interlayer between the electrode and the semiconductor, which creates an energy barrier to block electron injection. It is shown that the CSE strategy can generally work for FETs based on three semiconductor families, namely conjugated polymer, graphene, and quantum dot, and greatly suppresses the V-th/Dirac shift, enhancing the bias stress stability as well as reducing the noise level of the FETs. The mechanism for CSE-reduced bias stress is investigated through trap analysis. CSE is a general strategy for achieving stable and low-noise operation of unipolar FETs. The device design concept can be applied to other device configurations.

The results reveal that combination of MV and chloride ion shows as excellent inhibitor and there is a stronger synergistic effect between MV and chloride ion for cold rolled steel corrosion in 1.0 mol/dm(3) H3PO4. The electrochemical studies reveal that single MV or combination of MV and chloride ion acts as a cathodic type inhibitor and the corrosion reaction is controlled by charge transfer process. Adsorption of MV on the steel surface follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm with chloride ion and Temkin adsorption isotherm without chloride ion, respectively. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (Delta G degrees(ads), Delta H degrees(ads),Delta S degrees(ads), K-ads and E-a) were obtained and discussed. The adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the surface of cold rolled steel contains a mixed physical and chemical adsorption mechanism and the chemisorption is dominant.

The antenna element is composed of a truncated square patch, SIGW feedline with three layers of printed circuit board (PCB), and another layer of PCB with an air hole for supporting radiation patch. Each radiation patch is driven by an underneath coupling slot etched onSIGW. Awide axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth is achieved by deploying a 2x2 SIGW SRP feed network. Moreover, simple calculation expressions of the characteristic impedance and guide wavelength of SIGW are given for the design of SRP feed network. The fabricated prototype shows an impedance bandwidth of 25.6% covering 22.2-28.8 GHz, 3 dB AR bandwidth of 19% from 22.8 to 27.6 GHz, and peak gain of 11.53 dBic.

J	Du, KS; Ortega-Hernandez, J; Yang, J; Zhang, XG				Du, Kun-sheng; Ortega-Hernandez, Javier; Yang, Jie; Zhang, Xi-guang			A soft-bodied euarthropod from the early Cambrian Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte of China supports a new clade of basal artiopodans with dorsal ecdysial sutures	CLADISTICS			English	Article							CHENGJIANG-LAGERSTATTE; KONSERVAT-LAGERSTATTE; ARTHROPOD; EVOLUTION; REASSESSMENT; SYSTEMATICS; PHYLOGENY; INSIGHTS; BEHAVIOR; STAGE-3	We describe the exceptionally well-preserved non-trilobite artiopodan Zhiwenia coronata gen. et sp. nov. from the Cambrian Stage 3 Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte in Yunnan, China. The exoskeleton consists of a cephalic shield with dorsal sutures expressed as lateral notches that accommodate stalked lateral eyes, an elongate trunk composed of 20 tergites-the first of which is reduced-and a short tailspine with marginal spines. Appendicular data include a pair of multi-segmented antennae, and homonomous biramous trunk limbs consisting of an endopod with at least seven podomeres and a flattened exopod with lamellae. Although the presence of cephalic notches and a reduced first trunk tergite invites comparisons with the petalopleurans Xandarella, Luohiniella and Cindarella, the proportions and exoskeletal tagmosis of Zhiwenia do not closely resemble those of any major group within Trilobitomorpha. Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses consistently support Zhiwenia as sister-taxon to the Emu Bay Shale artiopodan Australimicola spriggi, and both of them as closely related to Acanthomeridion from the Chengjiang. This new monophyletic clade, Protosutura nov., occupies a basal phylogenetic position within Artiopoda as sister-group to Trilobitomorpha and Vicissicaudata, illuminates the ancestral organization of these successful euarthropods, and leads to a re-evaluation of the evolution of ecdysial dorsal sutures within the group.

Here we analyze the long-term impacts of extirpations and invasions on both phylogenetic and taxonomic alpha and beta diversity of fish assemblages in Chinese isolated lakes. Data of fish assemblages in 15 lakes were grouped into three periods spanning the last 75 years: historical, intermediate and current periods. We partitioned phylogenetic beta diversity into turnover and nestedness component, and examined how introductions and extirpations led to temporal changes in alpha and beta diversity using linear regression and multiple regression models on distance matrices, respectively. Introductions and extirpations caused an increase of phylogenetic diversity (Delta(+)) and phylogenetic unevenness (Lambda(+)) within the lakes, but the phylogenetic dissimilarity between lakes declined. Such trend, resulting from 60 years introductions and extirpations, was mainly due to a decline of the phylogenetic turnover, indicating that the replacement of native endemic species by widespread exotic species was the main driver of the observed phylogenetic homogenization. Temporal changes in phylogenetic and taxonomic dissimilarities were positively correlated, and taxonomic homogenization causes phylogenetic homogenization in ca. 60% of the lake pairs. Nevertheless, taxonomic homogenization turns to phylogenetic differentiation in one third of lake pairs due to the extirpation of the closely-related species and the introduction of distinct exotic species belonging to different lineages among lakes. Therefore, measuring phylogenetic diversity changes provides complementary information to taxonomy, and gives support to the Darwin's naturalization hypothesis stipulating that species distantly related to natives easily establish in their introduction range. Our results demonstrate that half a century of anthropogenic disturbance was sufficient to blur the phylogenetic distinctiveness among lakes that resulted from the last 5 million years evolutionary history of the Yun-Gui plateau.

Glacier area changes between 1968 and 2016 were derived from topographic maps and Landsat OLI images. This showed the area contained 715 glaciers, with an area of 1713.42 +/- 51.82 km(2), in 2016. Ice cover has been shrinking by 0.68 +/- 0.05% a(-1) since 1968. The glacier area covered by debris accounted for 11.9% of the total and decreased in the SE-NW directions. Using digital elevation model differencing and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, a significant mass loss of 0.46 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1) has been recorded since 1968; mass losses accelerated from 0.42 +/- 0.20 m w.e. a(-1) to 0.60 +/- 0.20 m w.e. a(-1) between 1968-2000 and 2000-2013, with thinning noticeably greater on the debris-covered ice than the clean ice. Surface-elevation changes can be influenced by ice cliffs, as well as debris cover and land- or lake-terminating glaciers. Changes showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity and a substantial correlation with climate warming and decreased precipitation.

This study aimed to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins by performing a comparative analysis among transcriptomes of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (PPC), Ypsilandra thibetica (YT), and Polygonatum kingianum (PK). De novo transcriptome assemblies generated 57,537, 140,420, and 151,773 unigenes from PPC, YT, and PK, respectively, of which 56.54, 47.81, and 44.30% were successfully annotated, respectively. Among the transcriptomes for PPC, YT, and PK, we identified 194, 169, and 131; 17, 14, and 26; and, 80, 122, and 113 unigenes corresponding to terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; and, steroid biosynthesis pathways, respectively. These genes are putatively involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol that is the primary precursor of steroidal saponins. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that lanosterol synthase may be exclusive to dicotyledon plant species, and the cytochrome P450 unigenes were closely related to clusters CYP90B1 and CYP734A1, which are UDP-glycosyltransferases unigenes homologous with the UGT73 family. Thus, unigenes of beta-glucosidase may be candidate genes for catalysis of later period modifications of the steroidal saponin skeleton. Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that monocotyledons biosynthesize steroidal saponins from cholesterol via the cycloartenol pathway.

Optimum growth was observed at 37-45 degrees C and pH 7. Pairwise comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain SYSU G00007(T) and other Novosphingobium species showed sequence similarities ranging from 93.7 to 97.9 %. Strain SYSU G00007(T) showed highest sequence identity to Novosphingobium subterraneum DSM 12447(T) (97.9 %). The average nucleotide identities and digital DNA- DNA hybridization values between strain SYSU G00007(T) and its closely related phylogenetic neighbours were below 81 and 31 %, respectively, indicating that strain SYSU G00007(T) represented a novel species of the genus Novosphingobium. The DNA G+C content of strain SYSU G00007(T) was 64.3% (genome). The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. The polar lipid profile included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, two sphingoglycolipids, two unidentified phospholipids, two unidentified aminophospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. Spermidine was the only polyamine detected. The major fatty acids were C(19:)(0)cyclo omega 8c, summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7C and/or C-18:(1 omega)6C) and C-16:0. The results obtained from phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses support the conclusion that strain SYSU G00007(T) represents a novel species of the genus Novosphingobium, for which we proposed the name Novosphingobium meiothermophilum sp. nov. The type strain is SYSU G00007(T) (=KCTC 52672(T)=CCTCC AB2017010(T)).

In this work, we present a facile approach to in situ fabricate highly accessible Ni(OH)(2)/K-Ti-O composites by hydrothermally treating NiTi foil in 5 M KOH solution. Based on systemic characterizations, the Ni(OH)(2) appears nanoflakes, meanwhile the K-Ti-O shows nanowires in shape, which are randomly mixed together. Serving as a binder-free non-enzymatic sensor, the Ni(OH)(2)/K-Ti-O/NiTi foil electrode exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a high sensitivity of 4278 mu mM(-1) cm(-2) from 5 mu M to 1 mM, and 1522 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) from 1 mM to 5 mM. Further, the electrode can be demonstrated to have excellent selectivity, fast response, and long-term stability towards the H2O2 detection. It is found that the Ni(OH)(2) plays a critical role with the synergistic effects of K-Ti-O. All our impressive performances indicate that the Ni(OH)(2)/K-Ti-O composites are promising electrode materials for non-enzymatic H2O2 sensors.

Seasonal climatic effects and feedbacks of anthropogenic heat release due to global energy consumption with CAM5	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Anthropogenic heat release; Climatic effect; Climate feedback; Climate change	COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; URBAN CLIMATE; PARAMETERIZATION; IMPACT; SIMULATIONS; CIRCULATION; URBANIZATION; MICROPHYSICS; CONVECTION	Anthropogenic heat release (AHR) is the heat generated in global energy consumption, which has not been considered in global climate models generally. The global high-resolution AHR from 1992 to 2013, which is estimated by using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) satellite data, is implemented into the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). The seasonal climatic effects and possible feedbacks of AHR are examined in this study. The modeling results show that AHR increases the global annual mean surface temperature and land surface temperature by 0.02 +/- 0.01K (1 sigma uncertainty) and 0.05 +/- 0.02K (1 sigma uncertainty), respectively. The global climatic effect of AHR varies with season: with a stronger climatic effect in the boreal winter leading to global mean land surface temperature increases by 0.10 +/- 0.01K (1 sigma uncertainty). In the selected regions (40 degrees N-60 degrees N, 0 degrees E-45 degrees E) of Central and Western Europe the average surface temperature increases by 0.46K in the boreal summer, and in the selected regions (45 degrees N-75 degrees N, 30 degrees E-140 degrees E) of northern Eurasia the average surface temperature increases by 0.83K in the boreal winter. AHR changes the height and thermodynamic structure of the global planetary boundary layer, as well as the stability of the lower troposphere, which affects the global atmospheric circulation and low cloud fraction. In addition, at the surface both the shortwave radiation flux in the boreal summer and the down-welling longwave flux in the boreal winter change significantly, as a result of the change in low clouds caused by the effect of AHR. This study suggests a possible new mechanism of AHR effect on global climate through changing the global low-cloud fraction, which is crucial for global energy balance, by modifying the thermodynamic structure and stability of the lower troposphere. Thus this study improves our understanding of the global climate change caused by human activities.

Nevertheless, synthesizing structured textures remains a challenging task. Most previous methods rely on additional guidance channels, which encode the structured features of textures. However, estimating the guidance channel is very difficult, and often fails when a texture has unpronounced features. In this paper, we propose a novel texture synthesis method, based on non-local operators, which captures the long-range structure of a texture without the additional guidance channel. The synthesized texture is generated by minimizing non-local texture energy through an expectation-maximization like optimization algorithm. A statistical constraint based on the Wasserstein distance is also proposed to ensure that the synthesized texture preserves the global statistics of the exemplar texture. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can stably handle textures with different scale structures.

However, threshold observations of N status change from N limit to N saturation by far are not conclusive in these ecosystems. Research on the natural abundance of N-15 (N-15) could greatly help provide integrated information about ecosystem N status. The goal of this study was to investigate the suitability of measurements of N-15 of major ecosystem N pools and several key species, plant N-15 fractionation, together with key vegetation and soil indicators in response to N fertilization as a tool to identify the N status in a temperate steppe in Inner Mongolia. We carried out a N addition experiment during 201114 on a Stipa krylovii steppe in Inner Mongolia, Northern China. We investigated the response of several key N transformation processes, vegetation and soil properties to N addition. Aboveground biomass and belowground biomass (BGB) N-15, root and foliar N-15 of three dominant species (Artemisia frigida, S. krylovii and Leymus chinensis), N-15 of soil total N and soil KCl-extractable NO3-N were determined. The responses of isotope fractionation during plant N uptake and reallocation to N addition were also determined. Our results suggest that the N addition rate of 5g N m(2) yr(1) could be regarded as threshold of early N saturation in this S. krylovii steppe as indicated by an increase in plant fractionation and a decrease in plant N-15. When N input rate is > 10 g N m(2) yr(1), increased N deposition can lead to an apparent reduction in species richness and BGB as well as an increase in NO3 in extractable soil pools < 30-cm soil profile. With N addition, S. krylovii and A. frigida undergo earlier N status shift from N limitation toward N excess compared with L. chinensis, contributing to L. chinensis out-competing other species. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of N status change in temperate steppe based on isotope evidence and several other functional variables and contributes to predicting the responses of temperate steppe to future global N deposition scenario.

However, the low spatial resolution of these products has limited their application in localized regions and watersheds. This study investigated a spatial downscaling approach, Geographically Weighted Regression Kriging (GWRK), to downscale the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 Version 7 over the Lancang River Basin (LRB) for 2001-2015. Downscaling was performed based on the relationships between the TRMM precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Geographical ratio analysis (GRA) was used to calibrate the annual downscaled precipitation data, and the monthly fractions derived from the original TRMM data were used to disaggregate annual downscaled and calibrated precipitation to monthly precipitation at 1 km resolution. The final downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against station-based observed precipitation in 2001-2015. Results showed that: 1) The TRMM 3B43 precipitation was highly accurate with slight overestimation at the basin scale (i.e., CC (correlation coefficient) = 0.91, Bias = 13.3%). Spatially, the accuracies of the upstream and downstream regions were higher than that of the midstream region. 2) The annual downscaled TRMM precipitation data at 1 km spatial resolution obtained by GWRK effectively captured the high spatial variability of precipitation over the LRB. 3) The annual downscaled TRMM precipitation with GRA calibration gave better accuracy compared with the original TRMM dataset. 4) The final downscaled and calibrated precipitation had significantly improved spatial resolution, and agreed well with data from the validated rain gauge stations, i.e., CC = 0.75, RMSE (root mean square error) = 182 mm, MAE (mean absolute error) = 142 mm, and Bias = 0.78% for annual precipitation and CC = 0.95, RMSE = 25 mm, MAE = 16 mm, and Bias = 0.67% for monthly precipitation.

However, one third of patients do not respond to VPA. This study is to investigate the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multidrug transporters on VPA responses in Han Chinese epilepsy patients on VPA monotherapy. Twelve SNPs involved in VPA transport pathways, including ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCG2, MCT1, MCT2 and OATP2B1 were genotyped in 153 Han Chinese epilepsy patients. We found that among all the patients, MCT1 rs60844753 CC carriers have higher incidence of VPA-resistance than CG carriers (P = 0.05), and in subgroup of generalized seizure, ABCC2 rs3740066 CC carriers had higher frequency of VPA resistance than TC + TT carriers (P = 0.03). Although other SNPs were not correlated with VPA resistance, significant ethnic difference was found in minor allele frequency of these SNPs, indicating that the influence of these SNPs on VPA efficacy should be broadly investigated in other ethnic populations. This study provides nominal evidence that SNPs of genes involved in the transport of VPA contribute to interpatient variation in VPA response. Although the associations were abolished after Bonferroni correction, the results provide an incentive for further research in sufficiently large samples.

How commodification is associated with reduced preference for equality and poverty alleviation	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						payments for ecosystem services; environmental justice; community forests; commodification; benefit sharing; sustainable development goals; distributive fairness	ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; MERE EXPOSURE; MONEY; PAYMENTS; CONSERVATION; MOTIVATION; UNDERMINE; VALIDITY; WEALTH; WORLD	This research is concerned with the trend towards commodification of forestry, in the context of community forest governance for sustainable development in the tropics. In these contexts, commodification takes different forms, including sales of certified timbers and sales of carbon credits. In addition to the general aim to enhance income, these market-based forestry interventions typically aim to align with sustainable development agendas, including (a) safeguarding ecological integrity and (b) promoting poverty alleviation. Our concern here is that the process of forest commodification might lead to a shift in local norms of benefit-sharing, in ways that can hinder these key components of sustainable development goals. We report the results of a survey (N = 519) conducted across sites in Bolivia, China and Tanzania that shows that switching from non-monetary to monetary benefits is associated with changes in preferences for distributional fairness in ways that may be detrimental to the poor. In particular, we show that forest commodification is associated with a lower likelihood of selecting pro-poor or egalitarian approaches to benefit sharing and higher likelihood of selecting to distribute benefits in a way that rewards individual contributions or compensates losses.

Currently, based on contrasting interpretations of their origin, two competing reconstruction models, the internal model and the external model, have been formulated to constrain the paleogeographic position of the South China block in Rodinia. In this study, we examined 17 representative samples from three intrusions (Kuchahe, Leidashu, and Qizanmi) within the Ailao Shan-Red River belt, located in the southwestern Yangtze block. Laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating suggests that they were emplaced during the mid-Neoproterozoic (ca. 750 Ma).The Kuchahe and Leidashu intrusions share geochemical characteristics of S-type and A(2)-type rocks, respectively. Elemental and isotopic data suggest that the Kuchahe intrusion was derived by biotite-dehydration melting of a metapelitic source, whereas the Leidashu intrusion was produced by partial melting of earlier Neoproterozoic granodiorites in the middle crust (similar to 15 km), with mixing of basaltic magmas. The Qizanmi intrusion is composed of hornblende gabbro and was likely derived by partial melting of a shallow and enriched lithospheric mantle source modified by slab-released fluids, with accumulation of plagioclase and fractionation of mafic minerals.The three intrusions were emplaced in a back-arc setting, in response to the roll-back of a subducted slab rather than mantle plume activity. The mid-Neoproterozoic (ca. 750 Ma) subduction process argues against the South China block occupying an internal setting in Rodinia, which was finally assembled before 0.9 Ga.

However, the demand for high stability in outdoor display and lighting requires further material and device developments and theoretical modeling. Here an analytical function for predicting time-dependent luminance loss in OLEDs is derived based on excitonic defect generation and interaction. Despite the simplicity, this function fits extremely well vast amount of experimental data reported by numerous industrial and academic laboratories for a variety of devices including simple bilayer devices and multilayered devices using singlet, triplet, multiple emitters in variety of host: dopant combinations. The uniqueness of the derived function is expected to allow it to be broadly used for understanding root-cause in degrading devices and for modeling OLED lifetime.

Cells of strain YIM 73036(T) were Gram-stain negative, non-motile and multiplied by binary fission. Strain YIM 73036(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-7.5 at 37-45 degrees C. Growth occurred in 0.5-3.5% (w/v) NaCl. Vitamins were not required for growth. The presence of photosynthesis genes pufL and pufM were shown and photosynthesis pigments were formed. Bacteriochlorophyll , the bacteriopheophytin and carotenoids were present as photosynthetic pigments. Internal cytoplasmic membranes were of the lamellar type. The organism YIM 73036(T) was able to grow chemo-organoheterophically, chemo-lithoautotrophically and photo-organoheterotrophically but photo-lithoautotrophic and fermentative growth were not demonstrated. Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 73036(T) is closely related to Rhodobacter blasticus ATCC 33485(T) (96.65% sequence similarity) and clustered with species of the genus Rhodobacter of the family Rhodobacteraceae. Whole-genome sequence analyses based on the average nucleotide BLAST identity (ANI<82%) indicated that this isolate belongs to a novel species. The genomic DNA G+C content of organism YIM 73036(T) was determined to be 66.0mol%. Strain YIM 73036(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(18:1)7c, C(18:1)7c 11-methyl and C-18:0 as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and unidentified phospholipid. Differential phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties, together with the phylogenetic distinctiveness, demonstrated that strain YIM 73036(T) is distinguishable from other species of the genus Rhodobacter. On the basis of the data presented, strain YIM 73036(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Rhodobacter, for which the name Rhodobacter thermarum sp. nov. [type strain YIM 73036(T) (=KCTC 52712(T)=CCTCC AB 2016298(T))] is proposed.

In this study, we first sequenced and characterized the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of S. tingi by next-generation sequencing. The complete mitogenome is 16,584bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and control region. Its gene arrangement pattern was identical to that of Sinocyclocheilus fishes available in GenBank database. The overall base composition is 30.42% A, 25.34% T, 26.98% C and 17.26% G, showing AT-rich feature (55.76%). Phylogenetic analyses showed that S. tingi from Fuxian Lake was closely related to Sinocyclocheilus grahami from Dianchi Lake. This work would provide molecular information fundamental to conservation and resource restoration studies on this endangered fish species.

It is found that the samples respond strongly to the near-infrared (NIR) irradiation in different temperature regimes. Thus, we are able to measure the optical reflectivity of the in-plane (ab-plane) thin films from room temperature to 5 K. A critical behavior near the superconducting transition temperature (T-c similar to 10 K) can be observed optically in the temperature-dependent reflectivity spectrum. We carry out the Kramers-Kronig analysis of the experimental data and discuss the basic optical properties of superconducting FeSe thin films in different structural phases above and below the transition temperature T-s similar to 100 K. By fitting experimental data with the Drude-Smith and Drude-Lorentz formulas, we obtain the key sample parameters such as the electronic relaxation time and dc conductivity. The interesting and important findings obtained from this study not only shed new light on the pairing mechanism in FeSe but also demonstrate that the NIR reflection experiment is a powerful and convenient optical technique for contactless characterization and investigation of superconducting thin film materials.

Population migration, which is a popular social phenomenon, has become an important driving force affecting China's urbanization and regional spatial restructuring. However, the previous studies on urban spatial expansion focused more on socioeconomic influences, seldom paying attention to population migration interaction. In this context, this paper proposes an integrated urban spatial expansion model considering the population interaction (UEMCPI) to simulate the collaborative development process of an urban area. The UEMCPI model combines multiple models with cellular automata (CA) to obtain the population migration interaction in a spatially explicit way and embeds the interaction into transition rule of the CA model. Ezhou, a typical city in central China, was taken as a case study to conduct the simulation of urban spatial expansion. The results show that population migration interaction plays an indispensable role in modeling urban spatial expansion, and the proposed UEMCPI model has better performance in simulating a collaborative urban development. The prediction indicates a continuous expansion of urban land in Ezhou through 2022, especially in certain new districts that have been delimited by regional planning. A polycentric urban development of the city of Ezhou will be highlighted in the future. More attention should be paid to population migration for guiding regional sustainable development.

However, its translational regulation under innate immune suppression remains largely unexplored. Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), a symbiotic virus harbored by the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus, suppresses innate immunity in parasitized Spodaptera litura. Here, we generated eIF4E dsRNA and used it to silence the eIF4E gene of S. litura, resulting in a hallmark immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis of hemocytes and retardation of head capsule width development. In response to natural parasitism, loss of eIF4E function was associated with similar immunosuppression, and we detected no significant differences between the response to parasitism and treatment with eIF4E RNAi. Under MbBV infection, eIF4E overexpression significantly suppressed MbBV-induced increase in apoptosis and suppressed apoptosis to the same extent as co-expression of both eIF4E and eIF4A. There were no significant differences between MbBV-infected and uninfected larvae in which eIF4E was overexpressed. More importantly, in the eIF4E RNAi strain, eIF4A RNAi did not increase apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that eIF4E plays a nodal role in the MbBV-suppressed innate immune response via the eIF4E-eIF4A axis.

To quantify this effect, we measured CO2 effluxes from a mountainous valley-type reservoir in the upper Mekong River (known as Lancang River in China). CO2 evasion rates from the reservoir surface were 408 +/- 337 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the dry season and 305 +/- 262 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season much lower than those from the riverine channels (1567 +/- 2312 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the main stem and 905 +/- 1536 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the tributary). Low effluxes in the pelagic area were caused by low allochthonous organic carbon (OC) inputs and photosynthetic uptake of CO2. A negative relationship between CO2 efflux and water temperature suggested CO2 emissions at the pelagic area were partly offset by photosynthesis in the warmer rainy season. CO2 emissions from the reservoir outlet and littoral area, which were usually considered hotspots of CO2 emissions, had a low contribution to the total emission because of epilimnion water spilling and a small area of the littoral zones. Yet at the river inlets effluxes were much higher in the dry season than in the rainy season because different mixing modes occurred in the two seasons. When the river joined the receiving water-body in the dry season, warmer and lighter inflow became an overflow and large amounts of CO2 were released to the atmosphere as the overflow contacted the atmosphere directly. Extended water retention time due to water storage might also help mineralization of OC. In the wet season, however, colder, turbid and heavier inflow plunged into the reservoir and was discharged downstream for hydroelectricity, leaving insufficient time for decomposition of OC. Besides, diurnal efflux variability indicated that the effluxes were significantly higher in the nighttime than in the daytime, which increased the estimated annual emission rate by half.

Rolling process was carried on such an asymmetrically textured sheet to regulate the microstructure and texture, and thus to try to modify the poor room temperature mechanical properties. The results indicated that the plastic deformation mechanism activated in the c-axis parallel to TD textured grains during rolling was sensitive to the rolling paths. When the rolling direction was perpendicular to the tilted direction of the texture component, prismatic <a> slip and extension twinning would be activated in the c-axis parallel to TD oriented matrix, and their activities readily varied with the pass reduction. Whereas when the rolling direction was parallel to the tilted direction of the texture component, only extension twinning based on consuming the tilted texture component was permissible. As a result, the microstructure, texture, rollability and the final modified mechanical properties of the sheet were strongly dependent on the rolling paths, and their evolutions during various rolling processes were investigated in detail. This study could give instructional meaning on property modification of Mg alloy sheets with similar asymmetrical texture distribution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, study on traits in females, such as sensory perception and remating strategies, is expected to disclose a greater role of sexual selection in female evolution. Here, we tested how bodyweights of both sexes affected female and male remating behavior in Spodoptera litura (Fabricius, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Results show most (74.4%; unmated virgin females may be sexually immature) females and males mated the first time in the second scotophase after eclosion. In the subsequent scotophase, 41.9% once-mated females and 94.1% once-mated males mated the second time with a novel virgin mate. Analyses indicate that female remating probability significantly increased with the increase of her own and the second male's bodyweight but decreased with the increase of the first male's bodyweight, while bodyweights of both sexes have no significant effect on male remating probability. Considering the nature of the low level of polyandry (two times on average) and last male precedence in S. litura, we propose that 1) females are more choosy when remating, from which females will benefit indirectly by sequential mate comparison and remate to replace sperm from the previous mates with those from higher quality mates, and 2) males will generally like to remate with any possible females, from which males will gain direct benefit by siring more offspring. The outcome of polyandry rate is likely to be the result of male investment x female choice interactions.

Urbanization can severely impact butterfly communities, yet there have been no reports of the species richness and distribution of butterflies in urban parks in Beijing. Here, we conducted the first butterfly survey in ten urban parks in Beijing and estimated butterfly species richness. Subsequently, we examined the distribution pattern of butterfly species and analyzed correlations between butterfly species richness with park variables (age, area and distance to city center), and richness of other bioindicator groups (birds and plants). We collected 587 individual butterflies belonging to 31 species from five families; 74% of the species were considered cosmopolitan. The highest butterfly species richness and abundance was recorded at parks located at the edge of city and species richness was significantly positively correlated with distance from city center (p < 0.05). No significant correlations were detected between the species richness and park age, park area and other bioindicator groups (p > 0.05). Our study provides the first data of butterfly species in urban Beijing, and serves as a baseline for further surveys and conservation efforts.

With the accurate spectroscopic (i.e., metallicity and line-of-sight velocity) and astrometric (i.e., proper motions) information, the position-velocity diagrams, i.e., phi(1)-mu(proportional to), phi(1)-mu(delta), and phi(1)-v(gsr), of the GD-1 stream are well mapped. The stream has an average metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.96. The rich information of member stars of the stream now available allow one not only to model its origin, but also to place strong constraints on the mass distribution and the gravitational potential of the Milky Way.

In-flight Solution of Motion and Test of Special Relativity Light Aberration	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational	PARTICLES	The Breakthrough Starshot project aims to send centimeter-sized, gram-scale "StarChip" probes to Alpha Centauri at a speed of similar to 0.2 c. On the other hand, Zhang & Li recently proposed that transrelativistic cameras may be sent to any direction to study astronomical objects and test special relativity. To conduct such "relativistic astronomy," one needs to solve the motion of the probe in flight. We solve the motion of the probe (including the moving direction and the velocity) by comparing the positions of three or more point sources observed in the Earth rest frame and in the probe's comoving frame. When the positions of enough point sources are taken into account, the motion of the probe can be solved with an error that is even smaller than the diffraction limit of the transrelativistic camera. After solving the motion, when the measurement of the position of an additional point source is introduced, one can use the data to test the light aberration effect in special relativity. The upper limit of the photon mass can be placed from the deviation of aberration to slightly lower than the energy of the photon, e.g., similar to 1 eV.

A scenario proposed by Fang et al. suggests that fast evaporation flows from flare loop footpoints can produce turbulence in the looptop via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). We revisit and improve on this scenario and study how the KHI turbulence influences extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray emission. A 2.5D numerical simulation is performed in which we incorporate the penetration of high-energy electrons as a spatio-temporal dependent trigger for chromospheric evaporation flows. EUV, soft X-ray (SXR), and hard X-ray (HXR) emission are synthesized based on the evolving plasma parameters and given energetic electron spectra. KHI turbulence leads to clear brightness fluctuations in the EUV, SXR, and HXR emission, with the SXR light curve demonstrating a clear quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP) with period of 26 s. This QPP derives from a locally trapped, fast standing wave that resonates in between KHI vortices.

As found in previous works, the distributions exhibit significant spiral patterns. The V-R distributions also show clear quadrupole patterns, which are the consequence of the well-known tilt of the velocity ellipsoid. The observed spiral and quadrupole patterns in the phase space plane vary strongly with radial and azimuthal positions. The phase spirals of V-Phi become more and more relaxed as R increases. The spiral patterns of V-Phi and V-R and the quadrupole patterns of V-R are strongest at -2 degrees < Phi < 2 degrees but negligible at 4 degrees < Phi < 6 degrees and -6 degrees < Phi < -4 degrees. Our results suggest an external origin of the phase spirals. In this scenario, the intruder, most likely the previously well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, passed through the Galactic plane in the direction toward either Galactic center or anti-center. The azimuthal variations of the phase spirals also help us constrain the passage duration of the intruder. A detailed model is required to reproduce the observed radial and azimuthal variations of the phase spirals of V-Phi and V-R.

As a result of range contraction and fragmentation, extant individuals are currently restricted to fragmented mountain ranges on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, where they are distributed among three major population clusters [2]. However, little is known about the genetic consequences of this dramatic range contraction. For example, were regions where giant pandas previously existed occupied by ancestors of present-day populations, or were these regions occupied by genetically distinct populations that are now extinct? If so, is there any contribution of these extinct populations to the genomes of giant pandas living today? To investigate these questions, we sequenced the nuclear genome of an similar to 5,000-year-old giant panda from Jiangdongshan, Teng-chong County in Yunnan Province, China. We find that this individual represents a genetically distinct population that diverged prior to the diversification of modern giant panda populations. We find evidence of differential admixture with this ancient population among modern individuals originating from different populations as well as within the same population. We also find evidence for directional gene flow, which transferred alleles from the ancient population into the modern giant panda lineages. A variable proportion of the genomes of extant individuals is therefore likely derived from the ancient population represented by our sequenced individual. Although extant giant panda populations retain reasonable genetic diversity, our results suggest that this represents only part of the genetic diversity this species harbored prior to its recent range contractions.

The bioactive ingredient in RG can induce the production of novel microbial metabolite from fermented RG. Using the one strain-many compounds strategy, the reinvestigation of the metabolites from Daldinia eschscholzii JC-15 cultured in red ginseng medium led to the isolation of an unprecedented benzopyran-naphthalene hybrid, daldinsin (1) and a new lactone (2). In this research, a new lactone, 8-hydroxylhelicascolide A (2) instead of helicascolide A was produced by the D. eschscholzii JC-15 induced by the red ginseng medium. Compound 1 showed anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with the inhibition ratio of 38.8% at 50 mu M. Compound 2 indicated antimicrobial activities against Fusarium Solani, F. oxysporum, and Escherichia coli with MICs at 128 mu g/mL. RG is therefore a promising activator in production of novel microbial metabolite. [GRAPHICS] .

In total, 129 and 112 specimens were collected from 12 and 11 populations for S. virgatus and T. japonica, respectively. These two species revealed congruent population historical signals, including (1) high levels of haplotype diversity and low values of nucleotide diversity, (2) post-LGM expansion, (3) the lack of population genetic structure, sharing haplotypes over all sampling populations, (4) gene flow connections, and (5) migration directions. Largely, all results supported that all sampling populations could be divided into two main metapopulations, exhibiting a northern and southern distribution. The north metapopulation could be considered as a marine protected area. The genetic patterns of the two species should be considered in the management and conservation in the islands along the Zhejiang, China.

Increasing epsilon(Nd) values from 17 to 9.5 Ma imply relatively more erosion from the Karakoram and Kohistan, likely linked to slip on the Karakoram Fault and compression in the southern and eastern Karakoram. After a period of relative stability from 9.5 to 5.7 Ma, there is a long-term decrease in epsilon(Nd) values that corresponds with increasing relative abundance of > 300 Ma zircon grains that are most common in Himalayan bedrocks. The continuous presence of abundant Himalayan zircons precludes large-scale drainage capture as the cause of decreasing epsilon(Nd) values in the submarine fan. Although the initial increase in Lesser Himalaya-derived 1500-2300 Ma zircons after 8.3 Ma is consistent with earlier records from the foreland basin, the much greater rise after 1.9 Ma has not previously been recognized and suggests that widespread unroofing of the Crystalline Lesser Himalaya and to a lesser extent Nanga Parbat did not occur until after 1.9 Ma. Because regional erosion increased in the Pleistocene compared to the Pliocene, the relative increase in erosion from the Lesser Himalaya does not reflect slowing erosion in the Karakoram and Greater Himalaya. No simple links can be made between erosion and the development of the South Asian Monsoon, implying a largely tectonic control on Lesser Himalayan unroofing.

The inhibition effect of CSGC on the corrosion of aluminium in HNO3 solution was studied by weight loss, electrochemical techniques, scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), contact angle images and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamic simulation were performed to theoretically investigate the adsorption mechanism. CSGC is an effective novel inhibitor, and shows higher inhibition efficiency than either CS or AA. The adsorption of CSGC on aluminium surface obeys Langmuir isotherm. CSGC is a mixed-type inhibitor, while mainly retards the anodic corrosion. EIS consists of a large capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a small inductive one at middle frequencies and the second capacitive loop at low frequency values, and the impedance strengthens with the concentration of CSGC. SEM and AFM confirms the corrosion of aluminium surface is prominently retarded after adding CSGC to the media. Contact angle image suggests that the inhibited aluminium surface is of hydrophobic nature. XPS provides the evidence of the adsorptive inhibitor of CSGC on aluminium surface. Quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamic simulation can be well theoretically elucidate that CSGC shows higher adsorption and inhibition ability than CS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work, we are the first time to report a label-free fluorescent assay for insulin determination based on the supramolecular recognition between cationic pillar[6]arene (CP6) and insulin. The approach is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) through competitive recognition between CP6 functionalized reduced graphene oxide (CP6@rGO) and probe/insulin molecules. Probe molecule (RhB) has strong fluorescent signal, and its fluorescent is quenched by rGO based on FRET. When target protein molecule (insulin) is added to CP6@rGO, the probe is displaced by insulin and a host-guest complex CP6@rGO/insulin is formed, resulting in a "turn-on" fluorescence signal. The fluorescence intensity of complex increased linearly with the increase of insulin concentration ranging 0.01-0.50 and 1.0-16.0 mu M, respectively with a detection limit of 3 nM. The sensor was successfully utilized to determine insulin in artificial serum. The molecular docking result showed that the N-terminal Phe of insulin's B chain was included in the CP6 cavity through electrostatic interaction and formed a stable host-guest complex.

In this paper, we report a novel and facile method to synthesize In2S3 quantum dots (QDs) at atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions. This involves the reaction of sodium sulfide with indium chloride and using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant to produce In2S3 QDs with excellent crystal quality. The properties of the as-prepared In2S3 QDs were investigated and photodetectors based on the QDs were also fabricated to study the use of the material in optoelectronic applications. The results show that the detectivity of the device stabilizes at similar to 10(13) Jones at room temperature under 365 nm ultraviolet light irradiation at reverse bias voltage.

The LIVs' functionality could be tuned by local perturbations and structural symmetry, but achieving large LIVs is still challenging and a clear guiding principle to this end thus remains to be established. Here, a long-range lattice strain approach that enables manipulating the crystal field and symmetry breaking is proposed to realize colossal LIVs. The tailored tensile and compressive strains are introduced into superconducting (La1.45Nd0.4)Sr0.15CuO4 epitaxial films that are fabricated by the pulsed laser deposition method. The experimental characterization indicates that long-range lattice compressive strain results in the epitaxially mosaic structures and the local crystal field transition from tetragonal to octahedral configurations that spontaneously breaks the symmetry. Such a structural transition and change through modulated compressive strain could greatly favor in-plane transport that contributes to a large anisotropy of the Seebeck coefficient Lambda S of over 100 mu V K-1, achieving strikingly colossal LIVs of over 70 V, many times larger than those of existing materials reported. This would broaden LIVs' promising application in light or photovoltage response and also exemplifies a steady route to exploring new high-performance LIV materials with structural or transport anisotropy.

One issue is that the fraction of baryons in the IGM, f(IGM), is not properly constrained. Here, we propose a method of estimating f(IGM) using a putative sample of FRBs with the measurements of both DM and luminosity distance d(L). The latter can be obtained if the FRB is associated with a distance indicator (e.g., a gamma-ray burst or a gravitational-wave event), or the redshift z of the FRB is measured and d(L) at the corresponding z is available from other distance indicators (e.g., SNe Ia) at the same redshift. As d(L)/DM essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method can determine f(IGM) independent of cosmological parameters. We parameterize f(IGM) as a function of redshift and model the DM contribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming f(IGM) has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by means of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and cosmology-independent estimate of the present value of f(IGM) with a similar to 12% uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of d(L) and DM. In addition, such a method can also lead to a measurement of the mean value of DM contributed from the local host galaxy.

Large-scale molecular phylogeny, morphology, divergence-time estimation, and the fossil record of advanced caenophidian snakes (Squamata: Serpentes)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RUKWA RIFT BASIN; VASTAN LIGNITE MINE; RED SANDSTONE GROUP; NEOTROPICAL XENODONTINE SNAKES; COLUBRID SNAKE; EARLY EOCENE; PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; ELAPID SNAKES; MISSING DATA; OLIGOCENE	Caenophidian snakes include the file snake genus Acrochordus and advanced colubroidean snakes that radiated mainly during the Neogene. Although caenophidian snakes are a well-supported clade, their inferred affinities, based either on molecular or morphological data, remain poorly known or controversial. Here, we provide an expanded molecular phylogenetic analysis of Caenophidia and use three non-parametric measures of support-Shimodaira-Hasegawa-Like test (SHL), Felsentein (FBP) and transfer (TBE) bootstrap measures-to evaluate the robustness of each clade in the molecular tree. That very different alternative support values are common suggests that results based on only one support value should be viewed with caution. Using a scheme to combine support values, we find 20.9% of the 1265 clades comprising the inferred caenophidian tree are unambiguously supported by both SHL and FBP values, while almost 37% are unsupported or ambiguously supported, revealing the substantial extent of phylogenetic problems within Caenophidia. Combined FBP/TBE support values show similar results, while SHL/TBE result in slightly higher combined values. We consider key morphological attributes of colubroidean cranial, vertebral and hemipenial anatomy and provide additional morphological evidence supporting the clades Colubroides, Colubriformes, and Endoglyptodonta. We review and revise the relevant caenophidian fossil record and provide a time-calibrated tree derived from our molecular data to discuss the main cladogenetic events that resulted in present-day patterns of caenophidian diversification. Our results suggest that all extant families of Colubroidea and Elapoidea composing the present-day endoglyptodont fauna originated rapidly within the early Oligocene-between approximately 33 and 28 Mya-following the major terrestrial faunal turnover known as the "Grande Coupure" and associated with the overall climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Our results further suggest that the caenophidian radiation originated within the Caenozoic, with the divergence between Colubroides and Acrochordidae occurring in the early Eocene, at similar to 56 Mya.

In this work, Ge QDs/Gr composite is prepared by a simple and effective ion-beam sputtering deposition technique. The intact growth evolution process is detailly investigated by means of the effect of Ge deposition amount, which will induce the enhanced crystallinity in QDs and the reduced defects in graphene. Moreover, a feasible and inspiring strategy to effectively tune doping in graphene by artificial control through changing the deposition amount of Ge atoms on graphene is demonstrated. In addition, charge transfer and interaction strength at the interface of Ge QD and graphene is influenced via the oxygen defect in the QD surface, which is consistent with field-effect transistor test and first-principle calculations. The p-doping characteristics of graphene decorated by Ge QDs may have significant application prospects in energy band engineering of graphene-based building blocks for graphene-based composite development and near-infrared detector applications.

Two IDT-based HTMs, one with 3,6-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]carbazole (YK1) and another with 2,7-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]carbazole (YK2), show different performances in PSCs. The PSC device based on YK1 displays a very impressive PCE of 20.13% under AM1.5G solar illumination, which is much higher than those of the devices based on YK2 (17.35%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (19.01%) under the same working conditions. This is mainly because YK1 has more effective intermolecular p-p stacking, a lower-lying HOMO level and higher hole-mobility than YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the YK1-based PSC exhibits excellent long-term stability retaining 94% of the initial PCE value after a 600 h lifetime without encapsulation owing to its better film morphology and hydrophobicity. These findings would shed light on the crucial importance of molecular engineering and allow its extension into general principles for the design of new HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20% in PSCs have been mostly achieved by employing a Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTM. However, it suffers from some drawbacks such as relatively low hole-mobility, complicated synthesis and difficult purification, which hamper its potential commercial applications. Here, for the first time, two new easily accessible 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene-based HTMs comprising H (YT1) and methoxyphenyl-fluorene (YT3) as the terminated groups have been synthesized for use in organic-inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs. The (FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbBr(3))(0.15) and CsPbI2Br PSCs based on YT3 yield very impressive PCEs of 20.23% and 13.36%, respectively, both of which are higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (19.18% and 12.30%). More encouragingly, the YT3-based PSC displays good long-term stability for 600 hours. These results confirm that different terminated groups in HTMs show a significant effect on the energy levels, hole extraction and transfer, thin-film surface morphology and photovoltaic performance. Our findings could provide a useful insight for future rational design of HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

After thermal treatment at 350 degrees C in air, the Ni/Fe MOFs ellipsoid were completely converted into NiFe2O4 fusiformis, leading to a big volume shrink because of the removing of organic ligands. The NiFe2O4 fusiformis was used to fabricate gas sensor to detect xylene operating at 300 degrees C. The sensor exhibited a good response sensitivity of 31.52 with response/recovery time of 50.10 s/40.30 s, respectively, toward 500 ppm xylene. It also showed a remarkably high selectivity to xylene against other gases such as toluene, ethanol, methanol, acetone, isopropanol, ammonia, formaldehyde, and benzene. The excellent performance could be ascribed to the nature and the unique morphology of as-prepared NiFe2O4 with high specific surface area (60.50 m(2)/g) and porous microstructure. These findings may render a new opportunity to fabricate gas sensor for xylene detection based on p-type NiFe2O4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The hierarchical flower-like structure was obtained by thermally treating the precursors at 600 degrees C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 degrees C/min. Based on the complex permittivity and permeability results, the Reflection loss (RL) of the Fe3O4/Fe/C composites were calculated. The Fe3O4/Fe/C composites show a RL peak of -51.3 dB for a 2 mm thick positioned at 17.2 GHz frequency. When the absorber thickness was adjusted to 2.3 mm, the effective adsorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) is 5.6 GHz (12.4-18 GHz) frequency. Simultaneously, the RL peak of the absorber still reaches -40.8 dB at 14.7 GHz frequency. The RL peak is explained using the quarter-wave cancellation model. The microwave absorption behavior of Fe3O4/Fe/C composites can be attributed to the reasonable impedance matching and the existence of interfaces around the composites. Our findings offer an effective way to design and synthesis the excellent microwave absorber of Fe3O4/Fe/C composite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Though research on the linkages between a changing climate and vulnerability has been increasing, only a few studies have examined the caste/ethnicity and gender dimensions of livelihood vulnerability. In this study, we attempt to explore how cultural and gender-related aspects influence livelihood vulnerability in indigenous farming mountain communities of the Nepal Himalaya in the context of climate change. We applied the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to estimate household (social group and gender-based) vulnerability in farming communities in the Melamchi River Valley, Nepal. The results identified female-headed families, and those belonging to disadvantaged social groups as more vulnerable and in need of being preferentially targeted by policy measures. Higher exposure to climatic extremes and related hazards, dependency on natural resources, lack of financial assets, and weak social networking were identified as components that determine overall vulnerability. The study also visualizes complex adaptation pathways and analyzes the influence of gender and ethnicity on the capacities of households and communities to adapt to climate change.

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is one of the most frequently activated signaling pathways in human cancer, playing a central role in tumorigenesis as well as the maintenance of CSCs. Here, we designed and identified B591, a dihydrobenzofuran-imidazolium salt, as a novel specific pan-PI3K inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against class I PI3K isoforms, which showed effective inhibition of cellular PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and robust antitumor activity in a set of cancer cell lines. Notably, compared with bulk tumor cell populations, B591 exhibited more potency in suppressing CSCs survival and inducing CSCs apoptosis, and presence of B591 effectively eliminated paclitaxel-enriched CSCs. B591 diminished self-renewal capacity and decreased the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of CSCs. In vivo, B591 preferentially decreased CSCs levels in mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer as evidenced especially by remarkable reduction of tumor-initiating ability. Consistent with the preferential targeting of CSCs, B591 effectively inhibited breast tumor metastasis and delayed tumor regrowth following paclitaxel treatment. Taken together, our findings establish B591, a novel PI3K inhibitor, as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation as a CSCs targeting agent.

Herein, N-doped TiO2 nanospheres with tetrahedral Ti4+ sites were synthesized by using dodecylamine as template and assisted by l-alanine acids. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS). It was found that the dodecylamine as a neutral surfactant controlled the structure of TiO2 spherical, while l-alanine acids provided a nitrogen source. The existence of tetrahedral Ti4+ sites in N-doped TiO2 was also confirmed. The N-doped TiO2 sample with tetrahedral Ti4+ sites exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic performance for degradation of methylene blue solution under UV light or visible light irradiation. A combined time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy study reveals that the enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to a large amount of photogenerated charge carriers and efficient charge separation. It is demonstrated that the shallow donor state produced by oxygen vacancies of tetrahedral Ti4+ sites can effectively promote separation of charge carriers besides capturing electrons.

Density functional theory (DFT) simulation and experimental studies indicate that the fluorescence quenching mechanisms for Fe3+ and Hg2+ detection are mainly attributed to the inner filter effect (IFE) and dynamic quenching process, respectively. The electronegativity difference between C and doped atoms (N, S) in favor to introduce negative charge sites on the surface of N, S-GQDs leads to charge redistribution. Those negative charge sites facilitate the adsorption of cations on the N, S-GQDs' surface. Atomic population analysis results show that some charge transfer from Fe3+ and Hg2+ to N, S-GQDs, which relate to the fluorescent quenching of N, S-GQDs. In addition, negative adsorption energy indicates the adsorption of Hg2+ and Fe2+ is energetically favorable, which also contributes to the adsorption of quencher ions. Blue fluorescent N, S-GQDs were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal treatment. Fluorescent lifetime and UV-vis measurements further validate the fluorescent quenching mechanism is related to the electron transfer dynamic quenching and IFE quenching. The as-synthesized N, S-GQDs were applied as a fluorescent probe for Fe3+ and Hg2+ detection. Results indicate that N, S-GQDs have good sensitivity and selectivity on Fe3+ and Hg2+ with a detection limit as low as 2.88 and 0.27 nM, respectively.

The tin orebodies are mainly hosted in the greisen and the fractured alteration zones of the tufflava and trachydacite. However, the genetic relationship between the hidden alkali-feldspar granite and volcanic rocks and the tin mineralization remains poorly understood. This paper presents SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating, whole-rock major and trace element analyses, as well as Nd isotopic data of the trachydacite and alkali-feldspar granite. The SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating of the alkali-feldspar granite and trachydacite yields weight mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 138.4 +/- 1.2, and 136.2 +/- 1.2 Ma, respectively. These granitic rocks have high levels of SiO2 (64.2-75.4 wt%, mostly > 68 wt%), alkalis (K2O + Na2O > 8.3 wt%), REE (except for Eu), HFSE (Zr + Nb + Ce + Y > 350 ppm) and Ga/Al ratios (10,000 x Ga/Al > 2.6), suggesting that they belong to the A-type granite. According to the high Y/Nb and Yb/Ta ratios, they can be further classified into A(1) subtype. Their epsilon(Nd) (T) range from -3.8 to -6.5. They were likely generated by the assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) of the coeval oceanic island basalts -like basaltic magma. This study suggests that the A(1) type granite is also a potential candidate for the exploration of tin deposits.

It is dominated by olivine pyroxenite, pyroxenite, and gabbro units. The gabbros are enriched in lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, U, and K) and light rare-earth elements (LREE), with negative anomalies in high field-strength elements, except Zr, Ta. Nb/Ta(similar to 5) and Zr/Hf (similar to 10) ratios lower than the primitive mantle and chondrites, respectively, indicate the influence of the mantle metasomatic process or fractionation of accessory mineral phases. Zircon U-Pb dating of the gabbro yielded an age of 423.9 +/- 2.6 Ma, indicating that the complex formed contemporaneously with the Xiarihamu Ni deposit (423 +/- 1 Ma). The gabbro has negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-11.3 to -1.2) with corresponding T-DM1 ages of 1535-1092 Ma. The vein-like and disseminated mineralization (i.e., pyrite and pyrrhotite) have delta S-34 values of 13.1 parts per thousand-13.4 parts per thousand and 5.0 parts per thousand-8.5 parts per thousand, respectively, suggesting that the magmas that formed the complex assimilated crustal sulfur. They yield Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 values of 17.323-18.472, 15.422-15.626, and 37.610-38.327, respectively, indicating Pb derived from multiple sources (i.e., mantle crustal sources). Geochemical and Hf-S-Pb isotopic characteristics suggest that the complex formed from a primitive magma derived by partial melting of a spinel- and garnet-bearing lherzolite mantle at variable degree of 5%-10%. This source region was geochemically enriched by previous interaction with slab-related fluids. Tectonic reconstruction suggests that the Akechukesai IV complex was generated in a post-collisional extensional environment.

SCOPE: SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution - survey description and compact source catalogue	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; stars: formation; ISM: clouds; submillimetre: ISM	GOULD BELT SURVEY; STAR-FORMATION; MILKY-WAY; CLUMP IDENTIFICATION; COMPLETE SAMPLE; LEGACY SURVEY; SPIRAL ARMS; CLOUD; GAS; ATLASGAL	We present the first release of the data and compact-source catalogue for the JCMT Large Program SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE consists of 850 mu m continuum observations of 1235 Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) made with the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data are at an angular resolution of 14.4 arcsec, significantly improving upon the 353 GHz resolution of Planck at 5 arcmin, and allowing for a catalogue of 3528 compact sources in 558 PGCCs. We find that the detected PGCCs have significant sub-structure, with 61 per cent of detected PGCCs having three or more compact sources, with filamentary structure also prevalent within the sample. A detection rate of 45 per cent is found across the survey, which is 95 per cent complete to Planck column densities of N-H2 > 5 x10(21) cm(-2). By positionally associating the SCOPE compact sources with young stellar objects, the star formation efficiency, as measured by the ratio of luminosity to mass, in nearby clouds is found to be similar to that in the more distant Galactic Plane, with the column density distributions also indistinguishable from each other.

J	Ma, XQ; Tao, DP; Liu, WF				Ma, Xueqi; Tao, Dapeng; Liu, Weifeng			Effective human action recognition by combining manifold regularization and pairwise constraints	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Action recognition; Local structure preserving; Manifold regularization; Pairwise constraints	INFORMATION; LAPLACIAN; FEATURES; FUSION	The ever-growing popularity of mobile networks and electronics has prompted intensive research on multimedia data (e.g. text, image, video, audio, etc.) management. This leads to the researches of semi-supervised learning that can incorporate a small number of labeled and a large number of unlabeled data by exploiting the local structure of data distribution. Manifold regularization and pairwise constraints are representative semi-supervised learning methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel local structure preserving approach by considering both manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. Specifically, we construct a new graph Laplacian that takes advantage of pairwise constraints compared with the traditional Laplacian. The proposed graph Laplacian can better preserve the local geometry of data distribution and achieve the effective recognition. Upon this, we build the graph regularized classifiers including support vector machines and kernel least squares as special cases for action recognition. Experimental results on a multimodal human action database (CAS-YNU-MHAD) show that our proposed algorithms outperform the general algorithms.

Strains were subjected to genotyping using CAI microsatellite typing and amplification of an intron-containing region of the 25S rRNA gene. Microsatellite genotypes of strains from non-VVC sources showed high polymorphism, whereas those of VVC were dominated by few, closely similar genotypes. However, among non-VVC strains, two genotypes were particularly prevalent in patients with lung cancer. 25S rDNA genotype A was dominant in VVC sources (86.7%), whereas genotypes A, B, and C were rather evenly distributed among non-VVC sources; known genotypes D and E were not found. In an experimental mouse model, isolates from lung cancer and AIDS patients proved to have higher virulence than VVC strains. Among 156 mice infected with C. albicans, 19 developed non-invasive urothelial carcinoma. No correlation could be established between parameters of virulence, source of infection, and incidence of carcinoma. C. albicans strains from VVC were less susceptible to itraconazole than the strains from non-VVC sources, whereas there was small difference in antifungal susceptibility between different 25S rDNA genotypes of C. albicans tested against amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, and flucytosine.

We examined these diversity elements in three types of grasslands in northern China, including two temperate steppes and an alpine meadow. We evaluated the differences in community-weighted means (CWM) of plant traits and functional dispersion (FDis) between 2 years with contrasting aridity in the growing season. Four traits were measured: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and the maximum plant height (H). CWM for SLA of the alpine meadow increased in the dry year while that of the temperate steppe in Qinghai showed opposing trends. CWM of LDMC in two temperate steppes became higher and CWM of LNC in all grasslands became lower in the dry year. Compared with the wet year, FDis of LDMC in the alpine meadow and FDis of LNC in the temperate steppe in Qinghai decreased in the dry year. FDis of H was higher in the dry year for two temperate steppes. Only in the temperate steppe in Qinghai did the multi-FDis of all traits experience a significant increase in the dry year. Most of the changes in CWM and FDis between 2 years were explained by intraspecific trait variation rather than shifts in species composition. This study highlights that temporal intraspecific trait variation contributes to functional responses to environmental changes. Our results also suggest it would be necessary to consider habitat types when modeling ecosystem responses to climate changes, as different grasslands showed different response patterns.

In our study, 51 functional genes and 11 pseudogenes were identified from 27 Rodentia species. Intriguingly, in the 3 main lineages of rodents there were multiple RNase6s identified in all species of Ctenohystrica, whereas only a single RNase6 was observed in other Rodentia species examined except for 2 species in the mouse-related clade. The evolutionary scenario of "birth (gene duplication) and death (gene deactivation)" and gene sorting have been demonstrated in Ctenohystrica. In addition, bursts of positive selection, diversification of isoelectric point and positive net charge have been identified in Ctenohystrica, especially at two key sites that are involved in antimicrobial function. Site Trp30 has undergone positive selection and Ile45 has changed into other residues in Group B and Group C of the Ctenohystrica. Our results demonstrated a complex and intriguing evolutionary pattern of rodent RNase6, and indicated that functional modification may have occurred, which establishes an important theoretical foundation for future functional assays in rodent RNase6.

The full-period properties of the sequences generated by the novel map are studied completely. We prove some theorems including full-period judgement theorem on Z(p(n)) and validate them by some numerical experiments. In the experiments, full-period sequences are generated by a full-period map on Z(p(n)). By the binarization, full-period sequences are transformed into binary sequences. Then, we test the binary sequences with the NIST SP 800-22 software package and make the poker test. The passing rates of the statistical tests are high in NIST test and the sequences pass the poker test. So the randomness and statistic characteristics of the binary sequences are good. The analysis and experiments show that these full-period maps can be applied in the pseudo-random number generation (PRNG), cryptography, spread spectrum communications and so on.

In the present study, we took advantage of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH) technology to study the difference in proteomics between the leaves of Pb-tolerant seed-type hemp variety Bamahuoma (BM) and the Pb-sensitive fiber-type hemp variety Yunma 1 (Y1) under Pb stress (3 g/kg soil). A total of 63 and 372 proteins differentially expressed under Pb stress relative to control conditions were identified with liquid chromatography electro spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in BM and Y1, respectively; with each of these proteins being classified into 14 categories. Hemp adapted to Pb stress by: accelerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism; enhancing respiration, light absorption and light energy transfer; promoting assimilation of intercellular nitrogen (N) and carbon (C); eliminating reactive oxygen species; regulating stomatal development and closure; improving exchange of water and CO2 in leaves; promoting intercellular transport; preventing aggregation of unfolded proteins; degrading misfolded proteins; and increasing the transmembrane transport of ATP in chloroplasts. Our results provide an important reference protein and gene information for future molecular studies into the resistance and accumulation of Pb in hemp.

There are currently 15 groups separated into five units based on genetic and geographic character analysis. Among these, the southern groups being on the species' most marginal distribution is the most susceptible to extinct in the near future due to most forest fragmentation and human activities. To determine the population dynamics and conversation needs in the southern unit, we conducted interviews and investigation-based interviews in Yunlong and Lanping Counties from December 2013 to February 2018. A new group contains approximately > 10 members, Tianchi group, was found in Tianchi National Nature Reserve and a known group with approximately > 20 R. bieti individuals, Heishan group, which had historically disappeared, was rediscovered in Yunling National Nature Reserve in the southern unit. As a consequence of this survey, the number of groups in the southern unit has increased from three to five, and the total groups has increased from 15 to 17, and the Tianchi group has become the southernmost group and totally isolated group with irreplaceable conservation value. These results indicate that R. bieti groups in the species' southern distribution range may be undergoing recovery and that nature reserves are playing a critical role in conservation efforts. However, small group size, highly fragmented habitats, and marginal distribution in reserves mean that these two groups are still vulnerable to extinction. We accordingly make recommendations and propose management policies for their protection: the Chinese government should commit to protect the new groups by funding academic research and conservation; the reserves, conservationists, and NGOs should take appropriate actions to ensure the establishment of long-term survey and monitoring programs.

Dubois at Trinil in 1891, over 200 hominid dentognathic remains have been collected from the Early to Middle Pleistocene deposits of Java, Indonesia, forming the largest palaeoan-thropological collection in South East Asia. Most of these fossils are currently attributed to H. erectus. However, because of the substantial morphological and metric variation in the Indonesian assemblage, some robust specimens, such as the partial mandibles Sangiran 5 and Sangiran 6a, were formerly variably allocated to other taxa (Meganthropus palaeojavanicus, Pithecanthropus dubius, Pongo sp.). To resolve the taxonomic uncertainty surrounding these and other contentious Indonesian hominid specimens, we used occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) to reconstruct their chewing kinematics; we also used various morphometric approaches based on microtomography to examine the internal dental structures. Our results confirm the presence of Meganthropus as a Pleistocene Indonesian hominid distinct from Pongo, Gigantopithecus and Homo, and further reveal that Dubois's H. erectus paratype molars from 1891 are not hominin (human lineage), but instead are more likely to belong to Meganthropus.

In this model, the injected particles with energies below the spectral "knee" are assumed to be described by two populations with different spectral indexes around 200 GeV. The high-energy population is dominated by the particles with energies above 200 GeV released upstream of the shock of SNR, and the low-energy population is attributed to the particles with energies below 200 GeV released downstream of the shock of SNR. In this scenario, the spectral hardening of cosmic ray protons and helium nuclei observed by PAMELA, AMS-02, and CREAM experiments can be reproduced.

Although numerous algorithms have been proposed, it is still challenging clue to the limited labeled data. One representative work is the Laplacian-regularized multitask dictionary learning (LR-MTDL) that employs graph Laplacian regularization terms to fully utilize both the labeled and unlabeled information. However, it probably conduces to poor extrapolating power because Laplacian regularization biases the solution toward a constant function. In this letter, we propose a Hessian-regularized multitask dictionary learning to learn a source-data set-shared but target-data set-biased representation for RS image recognition. Particularly, Hessian can properly exploit the intrinsic local geometry of the data manifold and finally leverage the performance. Extensive experiments on four RS image data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with baseline algorithms including single-task dictionary learning and LR-MTDL.

In this study, an Hg(II)-resistant bacterial strain, Bacillus sp. DC-B2, was isolated from a metal-contaminated site, and its ability to remediate five types of Hg-contaminated soils was investigated. RESULTSThe isolate DC-B2 showed strong resistance to multiple metals and volatilized 91.6% of the Hg(II) in a culture with an initial Hg(II) concentration of 10mgL(-1) within 8h. Microcosm experiments showed that the addition of DC-B2 culture improved Hg(II) removal by 11.7-17.2% from four artificially Hg(II)-spiked soil samples with initial Hg contents of approximately 100mgkg(-1) after incubating for 30days under flooded conditions compared to the control treatment. For the field-contaminated farmland soil containing 2.50mgHgkg(-1), an Hg(II) elimination rate of 82.1% was achieved within 30days with the DC-B2 inoculation, relative to the 34.1% elimination rate observed for the uninoculated control. The amendment of peptone broth slightly inhibited Hg removal (2.2-8.7%). The remediation effectiveness was verified by observations of longer root and shoot lengths of lettuce plants grown in treated soils compared to those grown in the control soil. CONCLUSIONThe isolate Bacillus sp. DC-B2 shows great potential to be developed as a bioagent for effective bioremediation of Hg-contaminated soils.

Annual streamflow of the Lhasa River is reconstructed from Juniperus tibetica tree rings. The streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern Tibetan Plateau goes back to 1546 CE and has a R-2 of 0.485. Spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal (34 and 16 years) and interannual (8.1, 5.7, 4.8, 3.8, 3.5, 3.2, 2.7, 2.3 and 2.1 years) cycles that may reflect climate forcings. Lhasa River streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, and represents streamflow of the upper Yarlung Zangbo River to a certain extent. Lhasa River variation is linked with large-scale climate circulation features, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Asian summer monsoon. Some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to ENSO events. Based on the reconstruction, the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental-period mean was lower (48% non-exceedance probability) than during the instrumental period. This study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow, especially the lowest streamflow events, and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming. Future water resource supply planning based on the instrumental record and streamflow reconstructions will be able to effectively reduce the risks posed by climate change.

Such a system usually consists of four wide-angle or fish-eye cameras that mounted around the vehicle, and a bird-eye view is synthesized from images of these cameras. Commonly there are two fundamental problems for the surround view synthesis, geometric alignment and image synthesis. Geometric alignment performs fish-eye calibration and computes the image perspective transformation between the bird-eye view and images from the surrounding cameras. Image synthesis technique dedicates to seamless stitch between adjacent views and color balancing. In this paper, we propose a flexible central-around coordinate mapping (CACM) model for vehicle surround view synthesis. The CACM model calculates perspective transformation between a top-view central camera coordinate and the around camera coordinates by a marker point based method. With the transformation matrices, we could generate the pixel point mapping relationship between the bird-eye view and images of the surrounding cameras. After geometric alignment, an image fusion method based on distance weighting is adopted for seamless stitch, and an effective overlapping region brightness optimization method is proposed for color balancing.

J	Wang, YL; Zhao, Y				Wang, Yalin; Zhao, Yue			Paracatadioptric camera calibration based on the projecting relationship of the relative position between two spheres	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine vision; Calibration; Paracatadioptric camera; Imaged circular points; Vanishing point	IMAGES	We discuss how the projecting relationship of the relative position between two spheres in space can be used to calibrate paracatadioptric cameras. The projections of two spheres under a paracatadioptric camera are classified into three cases: Intersection, tangency, and separation. Methods for obtaining the principal point are proposed for each case. When the principal point is known, an analysis of the geometric relationship of the two spheres on the unit viewing sphere model shows that their tangent lines at the antipodal points are parallel. Based on this geometric relationship, the vanishing line of the plane containing the projection circle can be determined to yield the imaged circular points and obtain the remaining intrinsic camera parameters. When the principal point is unknown, the intersection points of two groups of parallel projection circles of the two spheres on the unit viewing sphere model combine with their corresponding antipodal points to form a rectangle; hence, the vanishing point in the orthogonal directions can be determined. Finally, the intrinsic camera parameters can be obtained by applying the constraints of the vanishing points in orthogonal directions to the absolute conic. Simulation results and real image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

However, few studies assess PA performance at an individual level, and investigate the effects of management level and establishment age of PM. With nature reserves (NRs) in southwest China as the case, we set an independent control area (CA) for each NR 10-km away from its boundary to avoid the spillover effect. Forested pixels at least 300 m apart were then sampled within each NR and its CA. We applied the Propensity Score Matching method with five control variables to balance the heterogeneity of land characteristics between NR and CA sample pixels. Based on the matched samples for each NR, the individual effectiveness of 137 NRs between 2001 and 2012 was quantified. We then compared the effects of NRs with different management levels (national and provincial) and establishment ages (designated between 1981-1990 and 1991-2000) by means of nonparametric test and statistical inference. We found that approximately 63% of the NRs suffered less deforestation within their boundaries than in adjacent CM. National NRs were more effective than provincial NRs in curbing deforestation, but age had little bearing on the effectiveness of NRs. Our results revealed that NRs could play a prominent role in the greening trends of southwest China. This study offers the first individual-level assessment on NR effectiveness for forest protection in southwest China, which helps provide a more solid support for promoting effective NR management.

As different perspective on the same magnetic source, fMRI magnitude and phase data are complementary for brain function analysis. We collected 600-subject fMRI data during rest, decomposed via group-level independent component analysis (ICA) (mICA and pICA for magnitude and phase respectively), and calculated brain functional network connectivity matrices (mFC and pFC). The pFC matrix shows a fewer of significant connections balancedacross positive and negative relationships. In comparison, the mFC matrix contains a positively-biased pattern with more significant connections. Our experiment data analyses also show that human brain maintains a whole-brain connection balance in resting state across an age span from 10 to 76years, however, phase and magnitude data analyses reveal different connection-specific age effects on significant positive and negative subnetwork couplings.

The results indicate that the interannual variability of the rainy season precipitation in the MRB is significantly modulated by the ISM and EASM covariability. Herein, the ISM mainly influences the rainy season precipitation west of the MRB, and the EASM mainly influences the rainy season precipitation over the southeastern MRB. When the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and South China Sea (SCS) are dominated by positive anomalies of diabatic heating associated with a stronger ISM and EASM, the anomalous westerly winds in the BOB and significantly anomalous easterly winds in the SCS, which carry more warm-wet air, induce a stronger than normal convergence and upward motion in the MRB. This results in much heavier rainy season precipitation in the MRB. Model runs with a linear baroclinic model confirm the observational analysis results.

Cells were aerobic, motile with peritrichous flagella and rod-shaped. The strain grew at 15-37 degrees C (optimum, 28 degrees C), at 0-3 %(w/v) NaCl (1 %) and at pH 6.0-9.0 (pH 7.0). The major fatty acids of strain GY 10110(T) were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipid profile comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphoglycolipid, glycolipid, two unidentified aminophospholipids and three unidentified phospholipids. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain GY 10110(T) was closely related to Falsibacillus pallidus CCTCC AB 207188(T) (98.0 % sequence similarity) and Bacillus oceanisediminis CGMCC 1.10115(T) (96.9 %), respectively. The G+C content of strain GY 10110(T) based on the whole genome sequence was 42.3 mol%. The novel strain showed an average nucleotide identity (ANI) value of 77.8 % and a digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) value of 15.6 % with Falsibacillus pallidus CCTCC AB 207188(T) based on draft genome sequences, followed by Bacillus oceanisediminis CGMCC 1.10115(T) with ANI and dDDH values of 75.2 and 12.8 %, respectively. The results of the polyphasic taxonomic study, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, showed that strain GY 10110(T) represents a novel species of the genus Falsibacillus, for which the name Falsibacillus albus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GY 10110(T) (=CGMCC 1.13648(T)=NBRC 113502(T)).

In many applications, similar information is desired for subpopulations such as individuals in specific geographic areas and socio-demographic groups. When the surveys are conducted at national or similarly high levels, a probability sampling can result in just a few sampling units from many unplanned subpopulations at the design stage. Cost considerations may also lead to low sample sizes from individual small areas. Estimating the parameters of these subpopulations with satisfactory precision and evaluating their accuracy are serious challenges for statisticians. To overcome the difficulties, statisticians resort to pooling information across the small areas via suitable model assumptions, administrative archives and census data. In this paper, we develop an array of small area quantile estimators. The novelty is the introduction of a semiparametric density ratio model for the error distribution in the unit-level nested error regression model. In contrast, the existing methods are usually most effective when the response values are jointly normal. We also propose a resampling procedure for estimating the mean square errors of these estimators. Simulation results indicate that the new methods have superior performance when the population distributions are skewed and remain competitive otherwise.

The general framework covers parameters defined through smooth or non-differentiable estimating functions for analytic use of survey data as well as descriptive finite population parameters, and the theory focuses on point estimation, hypothesis tests and variable selection under an arbitrary sampling design. Major practical issues for the implementation of the methods, including computational algorithms, are briefly discussed. Results from simulation studies to compare the finite sample performances of the two approaches are presented.

The results show that: 1) The slight north-south difference of channel density is most likely due to lithology and independent of tectonic activity and climate. 2) The weak tectonic activity and the low hypsometric integral (HI) value suggest that the macroscopic landform condition limits erosion and sediment production. 3) The logarithmic longitudinal profile of the main channel defends that the upstream sediments generated by erosion are easily deposited in the downstream channel, rather than being transported directly into the Lancang-Mekong River. 4) Approximately 74% of the reaches have annual average stream power less than 500 Wm(-1). The narrow variation ranges of stream power in 50% of the river channel indicate relatively stable hydrodynamic environment. 5) Stream erosion and tectonic activity make the longitudinal profiles of the main channel and most tributary channels unstable. The wide range (between 22.01 and 45.58 with =0.43) of steepness index (k(sn)) of longitudinal profiles implies differential uplift in the basin.

Relationships between the major constituents of this clade remain. Here, we explore the phylogenetic relationships of Mastigodryas and its affinities to other Neotropical colubrid genera by combining DNA and morphological data. Analyses demonstrate that the concatenation of multiple individuals into a single terminal can mask the detection of new taxa. Further, non-random missing data and/or taxa in some empirical datasets can bias species tree analyses more than concatenation approaches. Our results place Mastigodryas in a strongly supported clade that includes Drymarchon, Rhinobothryum, Drymoluber, Simophis and Leptodrymus. Mastigodryas bifossatus is more closely related to species of Drymoluber and Simophis than to its congeners. Thus, we erect a new genus to accommodate it and recover a monophyletic Mastigodryas. We highlight the importance of the use of morphological characters to diagnose suprageneric clades by showing that some key external and hemipenial characteristics are phylogenetically informative.

The pinning scheme is induced for solving group-consensus under fixed and switching topologies, respectively. Firstly, a group-consensus control protocol via pining scheme under fixed topology is proposed. Then the corresponding sufficient conditions to guarantee group-consensus are deduced by employing graph theory and Lyapunov stability approach. What's more, based on pinning scheme, the agents in every group can reach their own group's reference states. Secondly, the group-consensus for heterogeneous multiagent systems with switching topologies is studied, where an equivalent system of the original multiagent system is obtained by model transformation. Then, the corresponding sufficient conditions to guarantee group-consensus are obtained based on the corresponding graph theory and Lyapunov stability approach. The same as the case of fixed topology, the agents in every group can also reach their own group's reference states by employing pinning control. Finally, some simulation examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the established theories.

Firstly, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function and applying inequality techniques, some sufficient conditions on the existence of anti-periodic solutions are established. Then, the global exponential anti-periodic synchronization of delayed QVGCNNs with impulsive effects and anti-periodic coefficients is investigated by designing a novel nonlinear state-feedback controller and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our results are completely new even if the considered quaternion-valued systems degenerated into real-valued or complex-valued systems. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained results.

In this work, Ti-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Ag-doped graphene were proposed and their adsorption capabilities for AsH3 and CO were investigated by DFT method. The optimized structures, adsorption energies, electron transfers, electron density difference, and density of states were thoroughly discussed. It was found that pristine graphene had a slight interaction with AsH3 or CO, while doping Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag could greatly facilitate the AsH3 or CO adsorption with the adsorption energies of -0.95 to -1.45eV (AsH3) and-1.00 to 2.02eV (CO). The partial density of states (PDOS) results showed that hybridizations between AsH3 orbitals, CO orbitals, and transition metals orbitals indicate that there were chemical interactions between them. The charge transfer and density of states (DOS) plots showed that AsH3 and CO have the same adsorption modes on transition metals-doped graphene. Among seven transition metals-doped graphene, Ni-doped graphene had the best selectivity for AsH3 but not for CO due to its larger adsorption energy discrepancy between AsH3 and CO than that of other transition metals-doped graphene, suggesting that Ni-doped graphene is a good candidate adsorbent for AsH3 removal in CO gas stream.

First, the classical heat potential theory is applied to convert such problems to Volterra integral equations of the second kind via the heat layer potentials, where the unknowns are only on the space-time boundary. However, the heat layer potentials contain convolution integrals in both space and time whose direct evaluation requires NS is the total number of discretization points on the spatial boundary and NT is the total number of time steps. In order to evaluate the heat layer potentials accurately and efficiently, they are split into two partsthe local part containing the temporal integration from t- to t and the history part containing the temporal integration from 0 to t-. The local part can be dealt with efficiently using conventional fast multipole type algorithms. For problems with complex stationary geometry, efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations are constructed for the heat kernel and used for the evaluation of the history part. Here all local and history kernels are compressed only once. The resulting algorithm is very efficient with quasilinear complexity in both space and time for both interior and exterior problems. For problems with complex moving geometry, the spectral Fourier approximation is applied for the heat kernel and nonuniform FFT is used to speed up the evaluation of the history part of heat layer potentials. The performance of both algorithms is demonstrated with several numerical examples.

Here we examine the whole-rock geochemical and isotopic data, as well as olivine compositions, for Cenozoic alkali and tholeiitic basalts from the Abaga, Huitengliang, and Chifeng areas in central Inner Mongolia. The results suggest that fractional crystallization of olivine + clinopyroxene (in the alkali basalts) and olivine (in the tholeiites), played a key role in their magmatic evolution, without significant crustal contamination or post-magmatic alteration. Geochemical and petrogenetic analyses show that pyroxene and garnet were dominant phases in the residual mineral assemblage for both alkali basalts and tholeiites, implying a pyroxenite source for these basalts. We propose that a pyroxenite-dominated source may be the product of reaction between recycled oceanic slab-derived melts and surrounding mantle peridotites. The spatial and geochemical variations of the Cenozoic basalts in central Inner Mongolia, together with recent geophysical and geological observations in eastern China, imply that the origin and evolution of large-scale Cenozoic continental intra-plate magmatism can be related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific and Paleo-Asian oceanic slabs. Incorporation of recycled oceanic materials from these two subducted slabs thus influenced the mantle source lithologies and deep-Earth geodynamic processes beneath eastern China.

The motivation for such an investigation is to generalize the concept of quotient soft hyperrings and isomorphism theorems. Also, we consider when the fuzzy hyperideals of a soft hyperring are normal, then the equivalence relations defined by J. Wang et. al. on soft hyperrings are strongly regular.

Model-free and model-based quantification of diurnal temperature range (DTR) time series predictability is provided in this paper. Both intrinsic predictability quantified by the permutation entropy and realizable predictability defined by the model's forecasting error are studied on DTR fluctuations. The intrinsic predictability tells us whether there are more predictive structures in DTR fluctuations and to what extent the maximal predictability can be reached. The realizable predictability measures the degree of prediction to which adopted model reaches. Results show that there is a well defined regime-dependent pattern between the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations, and both the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations over China are overall South-North (with the dividing line around the latitude of 37 degrees N and almost along the Yellow River, and south and north to this line are called southern China and northern China in this study) asymmetric with higher predictability in southern China and weaker predictability in northern China. This South-North contrasting predictability behavior is closely related to the DTR's South-North asymmetric multi-fractal behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, few papers theoretically analyze energy efficiency. This paper presents a Parallel Gated Poll (PGP) access mechanism that exploits the PCF defined in the IEEE 802.11. The basic idea is, during the contention free period, idle stations can save energy by turning into sleep and active stations exchange data packet under a gated service polling scheme to improve the energy efficiency. Besides, the mean cycle analysis model is setup to evaluate the energy efficiency of a typically PCF protocol and PGP protocol. By applying the classic 1-limited and parallel gated polling model, the closed expressions of energy efficiency of PCF and PGP are formulated respectively. Simulations show that our analytical results are very accurate with the simulation results. Both analytical and simulation results show the high energy efficiency of PGP.

XRD, Raman SEM, TEM, XPS and physical adsorption of nitrogen were used to characterize the products. Dark adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was run to evaluate their activities for removal of organic pollutants. It was demonstrated that the composition and structure of ZnO/JFC composites depended on the ratios of jute fibers to zinc salt. Through adjusting the mass ratio between raw materials, a fine composite of ZnO monocrystalline nanorods embedded on the porous carbon walls was obtained, which exhibited a much better efficiency for MB decolorization. The removal of MB was found to be pH dependent, and the optimized removal efficiency reached to 99% and the mineralization level was over 93% at pH 7.0 following 30 min under UV illumination. The kinetic studies showed the decolorization of MB followed pseudo first-order kinetics, and the rate constants were determined using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, indicating K-LH = 0.024 L.mg(-1) and k(c) = 4.01 mg.L-1 min(-1). Moreover, the ZnO nanorods/JFC composite was stable and showed a high efficiency of over 80% during seven cycles of utilization and regeneration. Examination for the real sample contaminated by MB proved that the presence of metal ions and other organic pollutants hardly affected its photocatalytic ability. It was demonstrated that ZnO/JFC composites could be fabricated through simultaneous pyrolysis of jute fibers and zinc acetate. These composites were provided with the advantages of high photocatalytic efficiency, convenient recycling and long-term stability, and were expected to be applied in environmental engineering and manufacturing for organic dyes removal.

The aim of this study is to examine the influences of mass failures due to gravity on the erosion and hydraulics processes of gully headcuts during runoff scouring. A flow scouring experiment including 11 tests with two discharges (i.e., 7 tests with 83.31min(-1) and 4 tests with 166.71 min(-1)) was conducted on 5 in situ gully head plots with similar initial topographies. Totally 36 mass failure events were observed of all the 5 gully heads during the experiment, and 63.9% of the events were occurred during the first 10 min of the tests after drying-rewetting cycles. The tests were classified into two series according to whether the mass failure occurred during the scouring. The tests with mass failures (Series I) contributed 81.7% of the total soil loss of GHR, and the average GHR rates by mass (GHR(m)) was about 5 times higher than that of the tests without mass failures (Series II). The mass failure clearly influenced the flow resistances on gully beds by increasing the surfaces roughness and the sediment load to gully beds, and the average Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) and Manning coefficient (n) of Series I were clearly higher than those of Series II. Compared to the previous studies without significant soil collapse from gully heads, the logarithmic growth relationship between GHR(m) and the energy consumption (Delta E-t) was quite weak in this study, but the R-2 between GHR(m) and Delta E-t increased for longer time scales. The results indicated that for individual runoff events, GHR rates could not be predicted by flow hydraulics alone because mass failures due to gravity made great contribution, but on longer time scales, the influence of soil collapse is reduced, and flow hydraulics become the key factor impacting GHR processes.

Many manifold embedding methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction. Many of them are supervised and based on graph regularization whose weight affinity is determined by original noiseless data. When data are noisy, their performance may degrade. To address this issue, we present a novel unsupervised robust discriminative manifold embedding approach called URDME, which aims to offer a joint framework of dimensionality reduction, discriminative subspace learning, robust affinity representation and discriminative manifold embedding. The learned robust affinity not only captures the global geometry and intrinsic structure of underlying high-dimensional data, but also satisfies the self-expressiveness property. In addition, the learned projection matrix owns discriminative ability in the low-dimensional subspace. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets corroborate the effectiveness of our approach and show its competitive performance compared with the related methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the samples' dielectric properties obviously vary with sintering conditions and the corresponding dielectric constant can reach more than 5 x 10(4) by sintering at 1100 degrees C for 8(similar to)10 h. XPS results revealed that the ratios of Cu2+/Cu+ and Ti4+/Ti3+ on the surface are apparently higher than that in the interiors, showing CuO segregation and oxidation process on the surface of CCTO ceramics during sintering in air. Therefore, it is significant for CCTO to achieve giant permittivity by properly controlling sintering conditions. According to defect chemistry, the mechanisms of defect formation and recombination are proposed to explain the influence of CuO loss on electrical properties of CCTO-base materials.

HAPLOPOLYSTICHUM; MICROSOROID FERNS; EVOLUTION; DRYOPTERIDACEAE; LIKELIHOOD; DELIMITATION; PARSIMONY; ALGORITHM; INFERENCE; PROVIDES	The newly defined fern genus Leptochilus contains about 50 species occurring in subtropical to tropical Asia and adjacent Pacific islands. The circumscription and phylogeny of the genus have been ambiguous and its species had been included in various genera such as Colysis, Dendroglossa, Kontumia, Microsorum, and Paraleptochilus. Previous molecular studies sampled only 2-4 molecular markers and 2-16 accessions of Leptochilus. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 105 accessions representing ca. 40 species of Leptochilus, including types of Colysis, Kontumia, Leptochilus, and Paraleptochilus, 39 species of six non-Leptochilus genera of Microsoroideae, and one species of Pyrrosia, are used to infer a phylogeny. Our major results include: (1) Leptochilus is monophyletic and resolved as nested within the microsoroid ferns, but its relationships with other members of Microsoroideae are not well resolved; (2) Six well-supported major clades in Leptochilus are recognized, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features; (3) Species related to L. macrophyllus representing earliest split in Leptochilus are identified; (4) The inclusion of Microsorum pteropus in Leptochilus is confirmed, whereas M. insigne is closely related to Leptochilus but not resolved as a member of the genus; (5) The species number of the genus is likely to double the most recent estimate following our study, and quite a few cryptic species should be recognized; and (6) A basal grade formed by three major clades is recovered and they are composed of species almost exclusively distributed at lower latitudes (the Malay Archipelago), whereas the shallow-level clades contain species distributed at mainly higher latitudes, suggesting that Leptochilus might have evolved at lower latitudes and progressively dispersed to and colonized higher latitudes.

Rectangular and hexagonal rings are connected with acetylenic linkages, forming a nanoporous structure with a pore size of 6.41 angstrom, which is known as T-4,T-4,T-4-graphyne. This 2D sheet exhibits a direct bandgap of 0.63 eV at the M point, which originates from the p(z)( )atomic orbitals of carbon atoms as confirmed by a tight-binding model. Importantly, T-4,T-4,T-4-graphyne is found to be energetically more preferable than the experimentally realized beta-graphdiyne, it is dynamically stable and can withstand temperatures up to 1500 K.

The proposed feature screening procedure has three key merits. First, it is computationally efficient, and can be used to screen significant covariates in the presence of missing responses. Second, it does not require estimating respondent probability and is robust to the misspecification of respondent probability models. Third, the univariate kernel smoothing method is adopted to estimate nonparametric functions, and is employed to impute estimating equations with missing responses at random, which avoids the well-known "curse of dimensionality". The ranking consistency property and the sure screening property are shown under some regularity conditions. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed screening procedure. An example is used to illustrate the proposed procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, Y; Jiang, JM				Yang, Yun; Jiang, Jianmin			Adaptive Bi-Weighting Toward Automatic Initialization and Model Selection for HMM-Based Hybrid Meta-Clustering Ensembles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Data clustering; ensemble learning; hidden Markov model (HMM); model selection	SERIES; SCHEME	Temporal data clustering can provide underpinning techniques for the discovery of intrinsic structures, which proved important in condensing or summarizing information demanded in various fields of information sciences, ranging from time series analysis to sequential data understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov model (HMM)-based hybrid meta-clustering ensemble with bi-weighting scheme to solve the problems of initialization and model selection associated with temporal data clustering. To improve the performance of the ensemble techniques, the proposed bi-weighting scheme adaptively examines the partition process and hence optimizes the fusion of consensus functions. Specifically, three consensus functions are used to combine the input partitions, generated by HMM-based K-models under different initializations, into a robust consensus partition. An optimal consensus partition is then selected from the three candidates by a normalized mutual information-based objective function. Finally, the optimal consensus partition is further refined by the HMM-based agglomerative clustering algorithm in association with dendrogram-based similarity partitioning algorithm, leading to the advantage that the number of clusters can be automatically and adaptively determined. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, time series, and real-world motion trajectory datasets illustrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the selected benchmarks and hence providing promising potentials for developing improved clustering tools for information analysis and management.

In addition to hydrological regime, revegetation has also occurred in this water-level fluctuation zone. However, how the hydrological regime and revegetation regulate soil prokaryotic community remains unclear. Here, we investigated soil prokaryotic community structure, diversity and environmental parameters in different flooding zones from two soil layers (0-10 cm and 10-30 cm) at 6 locations along the water-level fluctuation zone from upstream to downstream. The soil prokaryotic diversity tended to decrease from upstream to downstream, and the alpha diversity was higher in the topsoil than in the deep soil at all sites. Flooding significantly enhanced the prokaryotic diversity compared to the control (i.e., permanent dry zone). The soil prokaryotic composition underwent deterministic processes in the upstream sites and stochastic processes in the downstream sites, with stronger stochastic processes in the topsoil than in the deep soil across all sites and elevations. As expected, the soil pH, moisture, NH4+-N, organic carbon and nitrogen were proven to be determinants of the prokaryotic community composition. Changes in plant traits (plant biomass, richness, and carbon content) after revegetation induced by submergence also played an important role in structuring the prokaryotic community. The prokaryotic community exhibited a shorter average path distance (GD) in the flooding zones compared to the control, with the shortest average degree (avgK) and the lowest levels of stability in the longer periodic inundation zones. Overall, our results suggest that soil properties and plant functional traits are critical controls of the prokaryotic community's ability to develop at regional scales and water submergence can likewise be an important factor for variations in the prokaryotic community composition in riparian zones.

The results showed that higher ammonium and phosphorus removals were achieved with BFs filled with ceramsite (95-97% and 76-77%) and lava rock (87-92% and 84-94%), while fibrous carrier-packed BFs obtained better total nitrogen removal (37-44%). Moreover, the F/D time ratio of 16/8 h was slightly preferable for pollutant removal. High-throughput sequencing analysis illustrated that the relative abundance of potential denitrifiers that developed on organic media was much higher than those on inorganic substrates. The results indicated that the combination of inorganic materials and fibrous carriers as substrates could be an effective strategy for enhancing overall pollutant removal in BFs.

Thus, in this paper, we designed simple, bottom-up, in vitro, static experiment under laboratory conditions using suspension of mixed flower pollen grains for nanoparticle synthesis. Pollen grains provided template substrates for gold nanoparticles synthesis from dissolved Au(III). Transmission and scanning electron microscopy along with ultraviolet-visible spectra confirmed the gold nanoparticles formation. The biosynthesized/phytosynthesized gold nanoparticles had relative narrow size distribution (from 3 to 11 nm) with dominant spherical morphology with no aggregated forms. Thus, the gold nanoparticles in pollen dispersion provides excellent stability and dispersity.

A circle is the geometric element typically used as a template for camera calibration methods. In this work, we propose a calibration method based on Pascal's theorem and its inference, in which a circle is used as the calibration template. The proposed calibration method can be applied to solve the image of the circular points via the Newton iteration method. The intrinsic parameters of the camera can then be determined based on the constraints of the images of the circular points and the image of the absolute conic. The results of simulations and experiments conducted verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed calibration method.

The BEAP index (BEAPI) is defined as the signed sum of standardized apparent moisture sinks at five centers along the pathway. Correlation analysis of the apparent heat sources and apparent moisture sinks has verified the existence of the BEAP teleconnection. Variations in BEAP can affect precipitation anomalies resulting from the anomalous moisture transport and the antiphase surface temperature variation. Wave flux analysis has verified the Rossby wave propagation route that originates around the central Bay of Bengal and extends across North China to the West Pacific. La Nina-type sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) appearing simultaneously in the same season can excite a positive BEAP pattern by enhancing convection over the Bay of Bengal, while El Nino-type SSTAs have the opposite effect. Significant correlation between the BEAPI and the SSTAs can last from early summer to early winter. Numerical experiments confirm the BEAP teleconnection pattern and the associated physical processes.

Over the last several decades, a large number of studies have been published on the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of C. tropicalis from different parts of the world. However, the global pattern of genetic variation remains largely unknown. Here we analyzed the published multilocus sequence data at six loci for 876 isolates from 16 countries representing five continents. Our results showed that 280 of the 2677 (10.5%) analyzed nucleotides were polymorphic, resulting in a mean of 82 (a range of 38-150) genotypes per locus and a total of 633 combined diploid sequence types (DSTs). Among these, 93 combined DSTs were shared by 336 strains, including 10 by strains from different continents. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) showed that 89% of the observed genetic variations were found within regional and national populations while < 10% was due to among-country separations. Pairwise geographic population analyses showed overall low but statistically significant genetic differentiation between most geographic populations, with the Singaporean and Indian populations being the most distinct from other populations. However, the Mantel test showed no significant correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance among the geographic populations. Consistent with high genetic variation within and limited variations among geographic populations, results from STRUCTURE analyses showed that the 876 isolates could be grouped into 15 genetic clusters, with each cluster having a broad geographic distribution. Together, our results suggest frequent gene flows among certain regional, national, and continental populations of C. tropicalis, resulting in abundant regional and national genetic diversities of this important human fungal pathogen.

Vela X is a middle-aged pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that has been detected in radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. The observations indicate that that photon index and flux density of the inner regions of the nebula have obvious changes as the radial distance increases in the X-ray band, and the surface brightness has been discovered to decrease with the increase of radial distance in gamma-ray band. Aims. The multi-band photon emission and high energy spatially radiative properties of Vela X are investigated in the framework of a spatially dependent particle transport model. Methods. Electron distribution inside the PWN was described by a spatially dependent particle transport equation and the evolution of the non-thermal photon was described as a photon conservation equation under the assumption of a spherically symmetric system with dynamical evolution. In this model, the dynamical and particle evolution equations were simultaneously solved, and the gamma-ray attenuation by the supernova remnant (SNR) photon fields in the PWN were taken into account. Results. The observed spectral energy distributions of Vela X, including X-ray spectra of the inner regions and gamma-ray spectra observed at GeV and TeV bands, are well reproduced. The radial variations of the photon index in X-ray band and the surface brightness in the TeV energy range as well as the gamma-ray spectra of the inner region and ring extension can also be well reproduced in the framework of our model. The spatial variations of photon indices at GeV and TeV bands are predicted and show that the photon index in GeV band increases with the increase of radial distance while there is only a slight change in the TeV band. Moreover, the modelling results reveal that the gamma-ray attenuation by the SNR photon fields is important for modifying very high energy gamma-ray spectrum of Vela X.

The population heterogeneity, the qualitative nature of the outcome variable and the high dimensionality of the predictors pose significant challenge in statistical analysis. In this article, we introduce a category-adaptive screening procedure with high-dimensional heterogeneous data, which is to detect category-specific important covariates. The proposal is a model-free approach without any specification of a regression model and an adaptive procedure in the sense that the set of active variables is allowed to vary across different categories, thus making it more flexible to accommodate heterogeneity. For response-selective sampling data, another main discovery of this article is that the proposed method works directly without any modification. Under mild regularity conditions, the newly procedure is shown to possess the sure screening and ranking consistency properties. Simulation studies contain supportive evidence that the proposed method performs well under various settings and it is effective to extract category-specific information. Applications are illustrated with two real datasets. for this article are available online.

Using new Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we discover a strong X-ray dust scattering halo around it. The halo profile can be well fitted by the scattering from at least three separated dust layers. During the persistent emission phase of SWIFT J1658.2-4242, the best-fit dust scattering N-H,N- sca based on the COMP-AC-S dust grain model is consistent with the X-ray absorbing N-H,N- abs. The best-fit halo models show that 85%-90% of the intervening gas and dust along the line of sight of SWIFT J1658.2-4242 are located in the foreground interstellar medium in the Galactic disk. The dust scattering halo also shows significant azimuthal asymmetry, which appears consistent with the inhomogeneous distribution of foreground molecular clouds. By matching the different dust layers to the distribution of molecular clouds along the line of sight, we estimate the source distance to be similar to 10 kpc, which is also consistent with the results given by several other independent methods of disance estimation. The dust scattering opacity and the existence of a halo can introduce a significant spectral bias, the level of which depends on the shape of the instrumental point-spread function and the source extraction region. We create the XSPEC dscor model to correct for this spectral bias for different X-ray instruments. Our study reinforces the importance of considering the spectral effects of dust scattering in other absorbed X-ray sources.

Emerging evidence suggests that some RBPs not only bind RNA but also possess enzymatic activity related to ubiquitin regulation, raising important questions of whether these RBP-formed RNA granules regulate ubiquitin signaling and related biological functions. Here, we show that Drosophila Otu binds RNAs and coalesces to membrane-less biomolecular condensates via its intrinsically disordered low-complexity domain, and coalescence represents a functional state for Otu exerting deubiquitinase activity. Notably, coalescencemediated enzymatic activity of Otu is positively regulated by its bound RNAs and co-partner Bam. Further genetic analysis reveals that the Otu/Bam deubiquitinase complex and dTraf6 constitute a feedback loop to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis during aging, thereby controlling longevity. Thus, regulated biomolecular condensates may represent a mechanism that controls dynamic enzymatic activities and related biological processes.

J	Tang, DM; Fan, H; Yang, K; Zhang, Y				Tang, Dongmei; Fan, Hui; Yang, Kun; Zhang, Yao			Mapping forest disturbance across the China-Laos border using annual Landsat time series	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							TROPICAL FORESTS; DETECTING TRENDS; TREE MORTALITY; BARK BEETLE; RUBBER; COVER; REGION; ACCURACY; AREA; DEFORESTATION	The China-Laos border area is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and has undergone unprecedented social and economic shifts related to extensive land conversion to cash plantations in recent decades. However, spatially and temporally detailed information on land conversion and forest disturbance does not exist in this area. The aim of this study is to map and analyse spatiotemporal changes in forest disturbance from 1991 to 2016 along the China-Laos border using annual Landsat time series images. Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr), based on a temporal segmentation algorithm, was used with the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) as a disturbance index in this study. The results show that the overall accuracy of forest disturbance is 89.72% +/- 0.67% and that the estimated forest disturbance area between 1991 and 2016 reaches 4366.14 km(2) +/- 887.17 km(2) (at the 95% confidence interval). This accounts for 16.73% of the total area of forest cover in 1991, which is based on the error-adjusted estimator of area. The trend in the forest disturbance area increased from 1991 to 1995 and then continued downward. The forest disturbance area across the China-Laos border is closely related to global rubber prices as well as the policies and economies of the two countries and cooperation between China and Laos. Compared to Laos, the percentage of disturbed forest area is higher within China, except for some individual years (e.g., 1998-1999, 2004-2005, 2009 and 2016). The average annual disturbed forest area is 98.44 km(2) (0.76%) within China and 69.49 km(2) (0.53%) within Laos. Large disturbed patches are much more common within China than within Laos. This study highlights the merit of using dense Landsat time series for mapping the human-induced processes of forest disturbance in tropical areas, and the role of economic globalization and regional geopolitics in cross-border forest management.

Although many metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess a lamellar structure, the reversible structural transformation of MOFs between their three-dimensional (3D) phase and two-dimensional (2D) phase remains a largely unexplored area. Herein, we report for the first time a europium MOF with unprecedented reversible morphology in different solvents at room temperature. This europium MOF displayed a 3D nanorod morphology in organic solvent and a 2D nanobelt architecture in water. As a proof of concept for potential applications of this reversible-phase-transition MOF, we were able to use a delamination recovery method to load dye molecules that previously could not be loaded into europium MOFs.

Thermal stability of magnetohydrodynamic modes in homogeneous plasmas	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						magnetohydrodynamics; instabilities; waves; Sun: oscillations; Sun: filaments, prominences; Sun: corona	SOLAR CORONAL LOOPS; INSTABILITY; PROMINENCES; DYNAMICS; WAVES; CONDENSATION; CONTINUUM	Context. Thermal instabilities give rise to condensations in the solar corona, and are the most probable scenario for coronal rain and prominence formation. We revisit the original theoretical treatment done by Field (1965, ApJ, 142, 531) in a homogeneous plasma with heat-loss effects and combine this with state-of-the-art numerical simulations to verify growth-rate predictions and address the long-term non-linear regime. We especially investigate interaction between multiple magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes and how they in turn trigger thermal mode development. Aims. We assess how well the numerical MHD simulations retrieve the analytically predicted growth rates. We complete the original theory with quantifications of the eigenfunctions, calculated to consistently excite each wave mode. Thermal growth rates are fitted also in the non-linear regime of multiple wave-wave interaction setups, at the onset of thermal instability formation. Methods. We performed 2D numerical MHD simulations, including an additional (radiative) heat-loss term and a constant heating term to the energy equation. We mainly focus on the thermal (i.e. entropy) and slow MHD wave modes and use the wave amplitude as a function of time to make a comparison to predicted growth rates. Results. It is shown that the numerical MHD simulations retrieve analytically predicted growth rates for all modes, of thermal and slow or fast MHD type. In typical coronal conditions, the latter are damped due to radiative losses, but their interaction can cause slowly changing equilibrium conditions which ultimately trigger thermal mode development. Even in these non-linear wave-wave interaction setups, the growth rate of the thermal instability agrees with the exponential profile predicted by linear theory. The non-linear evolutions show systematic field-guided motions of condensations with fairly complex morphologies, resulting from thermal modes excited through damped slow MHD waves. These results are of direct interest to the study of solar coronal rain and prominence fine structure. Our wave-wave interaction setups are relevant for coronal loop sections which are known to host slow wave modes, and hence provide a new route to explain the sudden onset of coronal condensation.

Melatonin Synthesis and Function: Evolutionary History in Animals and Plants	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						melatonin; evolution; antioxidant; biological rhythms; biosynthesis enzymes; endosymbiosis; regulation of melatonin	ARYLALKYLAMINE N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; ACID O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; IMMUNE-PINEAL AXIS; ACETYLSEROTONIN METHYLTRANSFERASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; TRYPTOPHAN DECARBOXYLASE; FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; CIRCADIAN CLOCKS	Melatonin is an ancient molecule that can be traced back to the origin of life. Melatonin's initial function was likely that as a free radical scavenger. Melatonin presumably evolved in bacteria; it has been measured in both alpha-proteobacteria and in photosynthetic cyanobacteria. In early evolution, bacteria were phagocytosed by primitive eukaryotes for their nutrient value. According to the endosymbiotic theory, the ingested bacteria eventually developed a symbiotic association with their host eukaryotes. The ingested alpha-proteobacteria evolved into mitochondria while cyanobacteria became chloroplasts and both organelles retained their ability to produce melatonin. Since these organelles have persisted to the present day, all species that ever existed or currently exist may have or may continue to synthesize melatonin in their mitochondria (animals and plants) and chloroplasts (plants) where it functions as an antioxidant. Melatonin's other functions, including its multiple receptors, developed later in evolution. In present day animals, via receptor-mediated means, melatonin functions in the regulation of sleep, modulation of circadian rhythms, enhancement of immunity, as a multifunctional oncostatic agent, etc., while retaining its ability to reduce oxidative stress by processes that are, in part, receptor-independent. In plants, melatonin continues to function in reducing oxidative stress as well as in promoting seed germination and growth, improving stress resistance, stimulating the immune system and modulating circadian rhythms; a single melatonin receptor has been identified in land plants where it controls stomatal closure on leaves. The melatonin synthetic pathway varies somewhat between plants and animals. The amino acid, tryptophan, is the necessary precursor of melatonin in all taxa. In animals, tryptophan is initially hydroxylated to 5-hydroxytryptophan which is then decarboxylated with the formation of serotonin. Serotonin is either acetylated to N-acetylserotonin or it is methylated to form 5-methoxytryptamine; these products are either methylated or acetylated, respectively, to produce melatonin. In plants, tryptophan is first decarboxylated to tryptamine which is then hydroxylated to form serotonin.

The results showed that diosgenin-imidazolium salt derivatives displayed much higher cytotoxic activities than cholesterol-imidazolium salts and dehydroepiandrosterone-imidazolium salts. The SARs results suggested that the existence of substituted 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazoles or benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3 alpha-position with a 2-bromobenzyl or 2-naphthylmethyl group could be critical for promoting cytotoxic activity. Diosgenin-imidazolium salt a30 was found to be the most potent compound with IC(50 )values of 0.44-0.79 mu M against five human tumor cell lines. Compound a24 showed inhibitory activity selectively against SMMC7721 cell lines with IC50 value of 0.21 mu M and 54-fold more sensitive to DDP. Moreover, compound a30 inhibited cell proliferation through inducing the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In this work, we have developed series of Sm3+ doped Li2NaBP2O8 (abbreviated as: LNBP) phosphors by means of the solid state synthesis route. The crystalline phase compositions, micromorphology, valence state of elements as well as photoluminescence properties were systematically illustrated. Upon the excitation wavelength at 400 nm, emission peaks are located at 561, 597, 643 and 699 nm, corresponding to the (4)G(5/2) -> F-6(5/2), H-6(7/2), H-6(9/2) and H-6(11/2) transitions of Sm3+ in the same order. The optimal doping amount of Sm3+ ions is 2 mol% for the reddish-orange photoluminescence of the LNBP:Sm3+ phosphor system. The critical energy transfer distance, mechanism of concentration quenching, CIE chromaticity coordinate, CP, CCT and internal quantum efficiency were extensively investigated. The title product might be considered as a promising candidate of phosphor in near UV-based warm white LEDs.

Effects of TEOS, ammonia, water concentration, and temperature on particle size and morphology were investigated by laser particle size analysis and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Monomer addition model was employed to analyze the stability of intermediate, as well as the direction in which the reaction of silica particles proceeds. The analysis was carried out by Materials Studio. Results demonstrated that particle size of Nano-silica increases with increasing concentrations of H2O, NH3 center dot H2O, and TEOS in ethanol, whereas the size decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, when proper amount of H2O was added into NH3 center dot H2O at suitable temperature, silicic acid can act as a nucleus for amorphous Nano-silica particles, forming microspheres with round and smooth surfaces. By contrast, when TEOS was used, resultant nanoparticles have poor surfaces. During nucleation process of Nano-silica, silicic acid can also acts as nucleating agent providing a platform for the growth of nanoparticles with symmetric structure. Findings further indicated that the reaction proceeds by first silicic acid participates in the reaction, and the dimer and trimer molecules then react with the surface of silicic acid molecules; the same products could be produced by different reactions.

This process also is involved in cancer progression and prognosis. The potential of APA events as novel prognostic biomarkers has been suggested. CCND2 gene, which is overexpressed in various cancer tissues, tends to utilize the proximal APA site and produces a more prominent mRNA isoform with shorter 3' untranslated region in the cancer cells. In this study, an ultrasensitive detection for CCND2 APA was successfully achieved using electrochemical biosensors constructed by gold nanoparticles-Fe3O4 nanocomposite and p-sulfonated calix [8]arene functionalized reduced graphene oxide as nanocarriers. The detection ranges of CCND2-S and CCND2-L by the constructed biosensors were 10(-18)-10(-11) and 10(-17)-10(-11) M, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of CCND2-S was 0.176 aM (the RNA concentration at the single-cell level). To the best of our knowledge, this value was the lowest LOD among the reported non-coding RNA detection. In real samples, the results of the electrochemical detection using the constructed biosensors showed that the lung cancer cell H292 expressed considerably higher CCND2-S than CCND2-L. This result was in agreement with those obtained by RT-qPCR method. The electrochemical method had showed simpler operation, accurate quantitation, faster detection, and cheaper supplies compared with traditional methods. Therefore, this technology not only provides an ultrasensitive and feasible method for APA detection, but can also be applied in the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer progression.

We calculated and compared the ozone effective height H-eff and effective temperature T-eff, which are two important parameters in ground-based total ozone retrieval through the use of various profile datasets. This is used to verify the accuracy of the operative values (H-eff(0) = 23 km, T-eff(0) = -46.3 degrees C (or -45 degrees C)) from the World Meteorological Organization. The results show that the deviation of MLS and AIRS ozone profiles from ozone sounding data has significant oscillation and scatter in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The average difference of MLS at 82.5 hPa is (80.5 +/- 65.1) %, and that of AIRS at 70 and 100 hPa are (105.6 +/- 74.9) % and (107.0 +/- 67.8) %, respectively. The two satellite temperature profiles have differences within +/- 3 degrees C and can effectively describe the vertical distribution and variation of temperature. When calculating the H-eff and T-eff, upper stratospheric data missing from the sounding data must be filled in by the satellite profile data; otherwise the calculated results will show large errors of 3.2 km and 3.3 degrees C. The H-eff and T-eff at Kunming are respectively 24.36 to 25.51 km and -48.3 to -43.6 degrees C. The operational H-eff and T-eff used at Kunming ozone observation station clearly do not conform to the actual situation and must be corrected. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the Co(OH)(2) morphologies is highly depended on the solution including H2O, LiOH, NaOH and KOH. All the Co(OH)(2) shows potential application for non-enzymatic glucose detection. Especially, nanosheets after hydrothermal treating Co foil in KOH shows linearly amperometric signals to glucose concentration up to 3 mM with a detection limit of 0.5 mu M, fast response time (6.5 s-100 mu M), and an excellent sensitivity of 1646 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) (R-2 = 0.9904). These findings provide a new opportunity to directly fabricate Co(OH)(2) on Co foil for glucose detection, which does not only simplify the electrode fabrication procedure to enhance the electron transport, but also favor the full utilization of active nanocatalysts to improve the electro-chemical performance.

J	Lee, JJ; Li, PC; Kung, HT; Lu, ZH				Lee, Jae-Jin; Li, Peicheng; Kung, Hao-Ting; Lu, Zheng-Hong			Highly efficient top-emission organic light-emitting diode on an oxidized aluminum anode	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; THICKNESS; SURFACE	In today's manufacturing of organic light-emitting diode on silicon for microdisplay technologies, a top-emitting OLED (TEOLED) is required to be fabricated on top of an active-matrix circuitry located on the silicon backplane. This requires a highly reflective anode to enhance the luminance output. However, during the production process of a TEOLED, the hole injection efficiency and electrical conductivity may be suppressed by environmental exposure, in particular, moisture and oxygen. Given this, aluminum is an unfavorable reflective anode due to the primary concern of its native insulating oxide layer. The native oxide tends to grow during the patterning of the metal anode. In this paper, we have discovered that, by utilizing an A1(2)O(3)/MoO3 heterojunction anode structure, a highly efficient device can be made to achieve a current efficiency of 94 cd/A at a luminance of 1000 cd/m(2).

As a class of typical AIE molecules, tetraphenylethene (TPE) and its derivatives have prominent optical properties; nevertheless, separation of mixtures of E/Z isomers is a great challenge. Herein, a series of aromatic-substituted TPE derivatives were synthesized and used to separate mixtures of E/Z isomers by common column chromatography with high yields, as confirmed by single crystal analysis, mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The structure-property relationships of these molecules were systematically investigated by a combination of spectroscopic methods, theoretical calculations and single crystal data analysis. E/Z isomers exhibit many different fluorescent properties, such as AIE and mechanochromic behavior. Moreover, the position of N on the substituted pyridine ring also has an effect on the molecule stack pattern and the fluorescent properties. Collectively, our findings could not only improve the fundamental understanding of the cis/trans isomerization and photophysical properties of TPE derivatives but also provide a good strategy for designing different substituted groups that can produce various functions and have more potential applications.

We point out that FD provides a unique way of quantifying the accuracy of cosmic shear measurement. The idea is to stack the shear estimators from galaxies that share similar FD-induced shape distortions. Given that the latter can be calculated with parameters from astrometric calibrations, the accuracy of the shear estimator can be directly tested on real images. It provides a way to calibrate the multiplicative and additive shear recovery biases within the scientific data itself, without requiring simulations or any external data sets. We use the CFHTLenS images to test the Fourier_Quad shear recovery method. We highlight some details in our image-processing pipeline, including background removal, source identification and deblending, astrometric calibration, star selection for point-spread function reconstruction, noise reduction, etc. We show that in the shear ranges of -0.005 less than or similar to g(1) less than or similar to 0.005 and -0.008 less than or similar to g(2) less than or similar to 0.008, the multiplicative biases are at the level of less than or similar to 0.04. Slight additive biases on the order of similar to 5 x 10(-4) (6 sigma) are identified for sources provided by the official CFHTLenS catalog (not using its shear catalog), but are minor (4 sigma) for the source catalog generated by our Fourier_Quad pipeline.

Here, we report an exceptional specimen of the fuxianhuiid Alacaris mirabilis preserved in the act of moulting from the Cambrian (Stage 3) Xiaoshiba Lagerstatte, South China. The specimen displays a flattened and wrinkled head shield, inverted overlap of the trunk tergites over the head shield, and duplication of exoskeletal elements including the posterior body margins and telson. We interpret this fossil as a discarded exoskeleton overlying the carcass of an emerging individual. The moulting behaviour of A. mirabilis evokes that of decapods, in which the carapace is separated posteriorly and rotated forward from the body, forming a wide gape for the emerging individual. A. mirabilis illuminates the moult strategy of stem-group Euarthropoda, offers the stratigraphically and phylogenetically earliest direct evidence of ecdysis within total-group Euarthropoda, and represents one of the oldest examples of this growth strategy in the evolution of Ecdysozoa.

J	Tan, LL; Zhang, YC				Tan, Lili; Zhang, Yichong			M-Estimators of U-Processes With a Change-Point Due to a Covariate Threshold	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS			English	Article						Bootstrap; Monotone rank estimator; Partial rank estimator; Simulation-based inference	RANK ESTIMATION; SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION; LIMITING DISTRIBUTION; REGRESSION-MODEL; INFERENCE; SAMPLE	Economic theory often predicts a "tipping point" effect due to multiple equilibria. Linear threshold regressions estimate the "tipping point" by assuming at the same time that the response variable is linear in an index of covariates. However, economic theory rarely imposes a specific functional form, but rather predicts a monotonic relationship between the response variable and the index. We propose new, rank-based, estimators for both the "tipping point" and other regression coefficients, exploiting only the monotonicity condition. We derive the asymptotic properties of these estimators by establishing a more general result for M-estimators of U-processes with a change-point due to a covariate threshold. We finally apply our method to provide new estimates of the "tipping point" of social segregation in four major cities in the United States.

This evidence is contrasted by the conventional mathematical modeling, which predicts that the presence of many species and/or cooperative interactions are detrimental for ecological stability and persistence. Here we propose a modelling framework for population dynamics, which also include indirect cooperative interactions mediated by other species (e.g. habitat modification). We show that in the large system size limit, any number of species can coexist and stability increases as the number of species grows, if mediated cooperation is present, even in presence of exploitative or harmful interactions (e.g. antibiotics). Our theoretical approach thus shows that appropriate models of mediated cooperation naturally lead to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability paradox and on how highly biodiverse communities can coexist.

Herein, two N-linked benzoimidazole/oxadiazole hybrid electron acceptors were designed and synthesized through simple catalyst-free C-N coupling reaction. 24/PBIOXD and /TIPBIOXD exhibited deep-blue emission with peak at 421 and 459 nm in solution, 397 and 419 nm at film state, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were -6.14/-2.80 for 24/PBIOXD and -6.17/-2.95 eV for /TPBIOXD. Both compounds could form exciplex with conventional electron donors such as TAPC, TCTA, and mCP. It is found that the electroluminescent performance for exciplex-type OLEDs as well as the delayed lifetime was dependent with the driving force of both HOMO and LUMO energy offsets on exciplex formation. The delayed lifetime from 579 to 2,045 ns was achieved at driving forces close to or larger than 1 eV. Two TAPC based devices possessing large HOMO/LUMO offsets of 1.09-1.34 eV exhibited the best EL performance, with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.3% for 24/PBIOXD and 7.0% for /TPBIOXD acceptor. The TCTA containing exciplex demonstrated moderate energy offsets (0.88-1.03 eV) and EL efficiency (similar to 4%), while mCP systems showed the poorest EL performance (EQE <1%) and shortest delayed lifetime of <100 ns due to inadequate driving force of 0.47-0.75 eV for efficient exciplex formation.

Full Coverage of Optimal Phasor Measurement Unit Placement Solutions in Distribution Systems Using Integer Linear Programming	ENERGIES			English	Article						distribution system optimization; optimal PMU placement; PMU; integer linear programming	PMU PLACEMENT; ALGORITHM	Integer linear programming (ILP) has been widely applied to solve the optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement (OPP) problem for its computational efficiency. Using ILP, a placement with minimum number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and maximum measurement redundancy can be obtained while ensuring system observability. Author response: please delete this above sentence. However, the existing ILP-based OPP methods does not guarantee full coverage of solutions to the optimization problem, which may sequentially results in suboptimal supervision of the system. In this paper, a hybrid ILP-based method is proposed to cover all solutions to the OPP problem without any omission. Comparing with the existing exhaustive searching methods, the proposed method is more computationally efficient, which makes finding all solutions in a large system a more feasible problem.

In this study, a melatonin biosynthesis-related SlCOMT1 gene was cloned from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. cv. Ailsa Craig), which is highly expressed in fruits compared with other organs. The protein was found to locate in the cytoplasm. Melatonin content in SlCOMT1 overexpression transgenic tomato plants was significantly higher than that in wild-type plants. Under 800 mM NaCl stress, the transcript level of SlCOMT1 in tomato leaf was positively related to the melatonin contents. Furthermore, compared with that in wild-type plants, levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were lower while the content of proline was higher in SlCOMT1 transgenic tomatoes. Therefore, SlCOMT1 was closely associated with melatonin biosynthesis confers the significant salt tolerance, providing a clue to cope with the growing global problem of salination in agricultural production.

However, the impact mechanism of socio-economic factors on primary particulate matter (PM) emissions remains unclear. Based on the provincial primary PM emission data in the YRD from 1995 to 2014, this paper used Slope, Theil index, and Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIAPAT) models to quantitatively identify the regional differences of primary PM emissions and explore the key influencing factors. The results showed that primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate (PM10), and total suspended particulate (TSP) emissions all featured an upward trend of fluctuation over the study period. The regional differences in primary TSP emissions in the YRD region was gradually shrinking and the regional differences of primary PM2.5 and PM10 emissions presented a rising trend of fluctuation. The estimated coefficient of population size, energy structure, and fixed assets investment (FAI) were all significantly positive at the level of 1%. The negative effect of economic growth on energy PM emissions was significant under the level of 1%. The increase of foreign direct investment (FDI) had different effects on primary PM2.5, PM10, and TSP emissions. In addition, the influence of energy intensity on primary PM emission from energy consumption are mainly negative but not significant even under the level of 10%. These conclusions have guiding significance for the formulation of PM emission reduction policy without affecting YRD's economic development.

We assembled a draft genome sequence of 234.72 Mb encoding 27,019 genes and investigated its origin and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms. Phylogenomic analyses based on 4,586 single-copy genes revealed that C. himalaica is most closely related to Capsella (estimated divergence 8.8 to 12.2 Mya), whereas both species form a sister Glade to Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, from which they diverged between 12.7 and 17.2 Mya. LTR retrotransposons in C. himalaica proliferated shortly after the dramatic uplift and climatic change of the Himalayas from the Late Pliocene to Pleistocene. Compared with closely related species, C himalaica showed significant contraction and pseudogenization in gene families associated with disease resistance and also significant expansion in gene families associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and DNA repair. We identified hundreds of genes involved in DNA repair, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and reproductive processes with signs of positive selection. Gene families showing dramatic changes in size and genes showing signs of positive selection are likely candidates for C himalaica's adaptation to intense radiation, low temperature, and pathogen-depauperate environments in the QTP. Loss of function at the 5-locus, the reason for the transition to self-fertilization of C himalaica, might have enabled its QTP occupation. Overall, the genome sequence of C. himalaica provides insights into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to extreme environments.

While the spatial variability is attributed to differences in climatic setting and sensitivity of these glaciers to climate change, an assessment of these factors to date has only been performed on a small sample of glaciers and a small set of climate perturbation scenarios. To advance the assessment to larger datasets, we first reconstruct the time series of reference-surface mass balance for 1952-2014 periods using an empirical model calibrated with observed mass balance from 45 glaciers across the HMA. Forcing the model with a set of independent stepwise changes of temperature (+/- 0.5 K to +/- 6 K) and precipitation (+/- 5% to +/- 30%), we assess the reference-surface mass balance sensitivity of each glacier in the sample. While the relationship between the change in mass balance and the change in precipitation is linear, the relationship with the change in temperature is non-linear. Spatial heterogeneity in the simulated mass balance sensitivities is attributed to differences in climatic setting, elevation, and the sensitivity of mass-balance profile (gradient) to changes in temperature and precipitation. While maritime and low-lying continental glaciers show high sensitivity to temperature changes and display a uniform mass-balance sensitivity with elevation, the high-lying continental glaciers show high sensitivity to precipitation changes and display a non-uniform mass-balance sensitivity with elevation. Our analysis reveals the dominant drivers of spatial variability in the mass balance sensitivity across the region: temperature as a single driver for maritime glaciers, and a superposition of temperature, precipitation seasonality, and snow/rain differentiation for continental glaciers. Finally, a set of sensitivity tests with perturbed model parameters confirms the robustness of our results. The model's ability and robustness to resolve spatial patterns in the sensitivities and their drivers implies that simple modeling approaches remain a powerful tool for analyzing glacier response to climate change in HMA.

Nevertheless, data on whether health care workers tend to adopt healthy lifestyles after disasters are limited. This paper compares the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors among health care workers with that among non-health care workers in a postdisaster area.MethodsThis cross-sectional observational study was conducted in August 2016. The Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II questionnaire was used to interview 261 health care workers and 848 non-health care workers.ResultsResults of the multivariable linear models showed that health care workers had lower physical activity levels (beta=-1.363, P<.0001), worse stress management (beta=-1.282, P<.0001), slower spiritual growth (beta=-1.228, P=.002), and poorer interpersonal relationships (beta=-0.814, P=.019) than non-health care workers. However, no significant differences were found in either nutrition (beta=-0.362, P=.319) or health responsibility (beta=-0.421, P=.283).ConclusionsHealth care workers had less healthy lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, stress management, spiritual growth, and interpersonal relationships. Further studies are needed to develop health-improving interventions for health care workers in postdisaster areas.

The deposit contains over 4.2 million tonnes (Mt) of contained Zn + Pb metal reserves at 5.09% Zn and 2.40% Pb, and 301 Mt of Fe ore resources at 30.02% TFe. The stratiform or vein-type orebodies are hosted in the Upper Cambrian Shahechang Formation. Similar to many major Zn skam deposits worldwide, the Luziyuan deposit shows a distinct metal zonation pattern with depth, which correlates with the different calc-silicate mineral assemblages: From Zn-Pb (sphalerite + galena) ores in marble, through Zn-Pb-Fe-Cu (sphalerite + galena + magnetite +/- pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in pyroxenoid (+/- clinopyroxene)-bearing skarn, to Fe-Cu (magnetite +/- pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in garnet (+/- clinopyroxene +/- pyroxenoid)-bearing skarn. The syn-ore calcite has delta C-13(pDB) and delta O-18(SMOW) values of 1.0 to + 0.9%o and +10.3 to + 12.7%(0), respectively, suggestive of isotopic affinities to both granite and marble. 813,v, values of the fluid inclusions in the pre -ore rhodonite and the syn-ore quartz range from 81.7 to 68.8%o and 76.6 to 56.3%o, respectively; whilst the calculated delta O-18(H2O) values of the rhodonite, syn-ore calcite, and quartz are of + 5.4 to + 6.1%o, + 1.4 to +3.8%(0), and -5.3 to -2.0%(0), respectively. This indicates that the ore -forming fluids were sourced from both magmatic and meteoric waters. delta S-34 values of the syn-ore sulfides (+ 8.9 to + 12.0%(0)) are slightly higher than those of typical crustal-derived granites (delta S-34 = 4.0 to +9.0%(0)), but are significantly lower than those of Cambrian seawater sulfates. This indicates that the source of S is correlated with both granite and seawater sulfates. We propose that the Luziyuan Zn-Pb-Fe(-Cu) polymetallic mineralization occurred in a distal skarn system, and was genetically linked to concealed Early Cretaceous granite intrusions.

The new rule lowers the learning ability of a player if its payoff is larger than the average payoff of its neighbors, thus enhancing its chance to hold onto its current strategy. Conversely, when a player gaining less than the average payoff of its neighborhood, its learning ability is increased, thus weakening the player by increasing the chance of strategy change. Furthermore, considering the nature of human pursue fairness, we let a loser, someone who has larger learning ability, can benefit from another network, whereas a winner cannot. Our results show that moderate values of the threshold lead to a high cooperation plateau, while too high or too small values of the threshold inhibit cooperation. At moderate thresholds, the flourishing cooperation is attributed to species diversity and equality, whereas a lacking of species diversity determines the vanishing of cooperation. We thus demonstrate that a simple winner-weaken-loser-strengthen rule significantly expands the scope of cooperation on structured populations.

It can be distinguished from other species in Saussurea by its concolorous leaves, swollen and hollow upper stems, articulate hairs and stipitate glandular hairs, laciniate margins of uppermost stem leaves, numerous and sessile capitula, and narrow involucre. Based on nucleotide sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), phylogenetic analyses also support the recognition of these populations as representing a new species. The new species is known only from a single location in Balang Mountain, at elevations of 4500-4700 m. Its habitat can be easily disturbed or destroyed by a tourist arterial highway and the over grazing.

However, few studies have explored the landscape patterns inside newly developed urban areas that are defined based on the three growth types. In this paper, we used Landsat images to investigate the urban growth of Shenzhen from 1979 to 2017. In addition, we used high-resolution images to compare the pattern of greenspace in areas that developed from outlying, edge expansion, and infilling. Our results showed that Shenzhen experienced two expansion phases, which is in accordance with the diffusion-coalescence hypothesis. In addition, we found that the greenspace patterns in edge expansion and outlying patches were similar, but were different from those of infilling. In the infilling patches, the greenspace percentage, edge density (ED) and largest patch index (LPI) were significantly larger than those in the patches of the other two expansion types. This study linked landscape patterns and urban growth types that enhanced our understanding of the process of urban expansion and may provide valuable information for local policy making and urban planning.

The targeted compounds were efficiently obtained by only filtration without any further post-treatment. In the one-step cascade reaction, C-C and C-N bonds were constructed. In addition, when 1,4-dioxane was used as a solvent and the mixture of 1,1-eneamines (1) was refluxed with benzylidene-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-diones (BIDs) (2) for about 12 h, indenopyridine compounds (4) were produced. Two kinds of indenopyridine derivatives 3-4 resulted from alternative solvents and temperatures. The reaction had the following features: mild temperature, atom economy, high yields, and potential biological activity of the product.

The median (5-95 percentile) Corridor aPBDE concentration was 1.03 ng/g dry wt (0.25-13.48 ng/g dry wt). Dry weight aPBDEs were elevated in U.S. waters of the Detroit River (US DR) and lowest in Canadian waters of Lake St. Clair (CA LSC). Sediment total organic carbon (TOC) explained some of the variation in aPBDEs, particularly in upstream waterbodies except for the Detroit River where local sources were apparent in the US DR and TOC-dilution occurred in CA DR. Canadian Federal Sediment Quality guidelines were exceeded at 19 stations, 14 occurring in the US DR. aHazard Quotients (aHQ) had a median (5-95 percentile) Corridor value of 0.46 (ND to 2.27). By strata, 43.2% of US DR stations had aHQ's greater than 1 while 21.3% of US SCR stations exceeded a value of 1.

Traditional PA recognition techniques focus on repeated aerobic exercises or stationary PA. As a crucial indicator in human health, it covers a range of bodily movement from aerobics to anaerobic that may all bring health benefits. However, existing PA recognition approaches are mostly designed for specific scenarios and often lack extensibility for application in other areas, thereby limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we attempt to detect more gym PAs (GPAs) in addition to traditional PA using acceleration, A two layer recognition framework is proposed that can classify aerobic, sedentary, and free weight activities, count repetitions and sets for the free weight exercises, and in the meantime, measure quantities of repetitions and sets for free weight activities. In the first layer, a one-class support vector machine is applied to coarsely classify free weight and nonfree weight activities. In the second layer, a neural network is utilized for aerobic and sedentary activities recognition; a hidden Markov model is to provide a further classification in free weight activities. The performance of the framework was tested on ten healthy subjects (age: 30 +/- 5; BMI: 25 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2); and body fat: 20.5 +/- 5.4), and compared with some typical classifiers. The results indicate the proposed framework has better performance in recognizing and measuring GPAs than other approaches. The potential of this framework can be extended in supporting more types of PA recognition in complex applications.

J	Muhammad, S; Tian, LD; Nusser, M				Muhammad, Sher; Tian, Lide; Nusser, Marcus			No significant mass loss in the glaciers of Astore Basin (North-Western Himalaya), between 1999 and 2016	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						glacier mass balance; glacier mapping; dGPS; remote sensing	NANGA PARBAT; KARAKORAM HIMALAYA; BALANCE; IMPACT; REGION; IMAGES; ICE	Although glaciers in High Mountain Asia produce an enormous amount of water used by downstream populations, they remain poorly observed in the field. This study presents a geodetic mass balance of the glaciers in the Astore Basin (with differential GPS (dGPS) measurements on Harcho glacier) between 1999 and 2016. Changes near the terminus of Harcho glacier (below 3800 m a.s.l.) featured heterogeneous surface elevation changes, whereas the middle section shows the most negative changes. The surface elevation changes were positive above 4200 m a.s.l. The average annual mass balance was -0.08 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1) derived from a dGPS and DEM comparison whereas Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer DEM-based results show a slightly positive, that is 0.03 +/- 0.24 m w.e. a(-1) in the same period. In contrast, the terminus indicates a substantial retreat of similar to 368 m (4.5 m a(-1)) between 1934 and 2016. The average mass balance of 19 glaciers (>2 km(2)) covering similar to 60% of the total glaciers in the Basin exhibit no net mass loss in the period of 2000-2016 and follow a pattern similar to adjacent Karakoram glaciers.

Electrochemical measurements showed that all these VOx NBs can be adopted as promising cathode active materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The Li+ storage mechanism, charge transfer property at the solid/electrolyte interface and Li+ diffusion characteristics for these as-synthesized 1D VOx NBs were systematically analyzed and compared with each other. The results indicated that V2O5 NBs could deliver a relatively higher specific discharge capacity (213.3 mAh/g after 50 cycles at 100 mA/g) and median discharge voltage (2.68-2.71 V vs. Li/Li+) during their working potential range when compared to other VOx NBs. This is mainly due to the high V valence state and good crystallinity of V2O5 NBs, which are beneficial to the large Li+ insertion capacity and long-term cyclic stability. In addition, the as-prepared VO2 (B) NBs had only one predominant discharge plateau at the working potential window so that it can easily output a stable voltage and power in practical LIB applications. This work can provide useful references for the selection and easy synthesis of nanoscaled 1D vanadium-based cathode materials.

The current research examines the influence of identification, which is perceived anonymity, and intrinsic motivation on the continuous purchasing behaviors on retailing e-commerce websites based on self-determination theory. The mediating role of intrinsic motivation was also empirically tested from a sample of 661 frequent consumers using the partial least squares approach. The findings were: (1) Identification negatively influences perceived anonymity, and its low, but significantly positive, influence on continuous e-commerce consumption were totally mediated by perceived competence, perceived autonomy, and perceived relatedness. (2) Perceived anonymity positively influences self-determination factors, which has partly mediating impact between perceived anonymity and continuous consumption. (3) The authenticity and concealment of identity are based on different mechanisms, but both of them are conducive to promoting continuous purchases. On retailing e-commerce websites, customers' identity management should consider both identification in the background and anonymity perception in the service, and the contributions of the service to promote consumers' perceived competence and perceived autonomy are important in continuous consumption.

The skill of the SDM was checked by comparing the results of the different predictor combinations and the different time lengths used to construct the SDM. In addition, compared to the historical simulation of the coupled Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM-LR), better performance can be achieved by using the ERA-Interim data to construct the SDM in the low-latitude plateau. The long-term changes in temperature from 1981 to 2015 in the ERA-Interim reanalysis data are calibrated by the SDM over the low-latitude plateau of China. Furthermore, the SDM is projected into the simulation results of the MPI-ESM-LR model to construct a suitable SDM (ERA-SDM), and then the ERA-SDM is implemented to evaluate the future temperature changes in the low-latitude plateau during the period of 2018-2100 using the simulation results of the MPI-ESM-LR model under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The results showed that an increase in temperature of 0.3 degrees C decade(-1) was found from 1981 to 2015, in which the fastest increase of 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) occurred in winter and the slowest increase of 0.2 degrees C decade(-1) occurred in autumn. Most models in CMIP5 failed to simulate the long-term changes in temperature over the last 30years in the low-latitude plateau region, and the temperature in the low-latitude plateau was underestimated by 2.4 degrees C using the 22 models. The SDM improved the annual and seasonal temperature characteristics and inter-annual and seasonal changes simulated by the MPI-ESM-LR. The future temperature predictions by the ERA-SDM indicated that the fastest temperature increase of 0.271 degrees C decade(-1) was found in spring under the RCP8.5 scenario. A faster rate of temperature increase was found in the northern part of the low-latitude plateau than in the southern part under the RCP8.5 scenario.

Low temperatures limit the geographic distribution of Coffea canephora Pierre ex A.Froehner. The WRKYs of C. canephora are still not well characterized, and the response of C. canephora WRKYs (CcWRKYs) under cold stress is still largely unknown. We identified 49 CcWRKYs from the C. canephora genome to gain insight into these mechanisms. These CcWRKYs were divided into three groups that were based on the conserved WRKY domains and zinc-finger structure. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that 14 CcWRKYs were induced during the cold acclimation stage, 17 CcWRKYs were preferentially upregulated by 4 degrees C treatment, and 12 CcWRKYs were downregulated by cold stress. Subsequently, we carried out a genome-wide analysis to predict 14,513 potential CcWRKY target genes in C. canephora. These isolated genes were involved in multiple biological processes, and most of them could be grouped by the response to stimulus. Among the putative CcWRKY target genes, 235 genes were categorized into response to the cold process, including carbohydrate metabolic, lipid metabolic, and photosynthesis process-related genes. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and correlation analysis indicated that CcWRKY might control their putative targets that respond to cold stress. These results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanism for CcWRKY-mediated cold responses.

The proposed coupler has only three coupling branches with a circular cutout at the top and the bottom on both sides of the main branch and is of compact size. The simulation shows that the proposed design has eased the machining difficulty by providing more tolerance to fabrication errors. The simulation also shows that the amplitude imbalance of the proposed hybrid branch is 25% less than that of the traditional three-branch hybrid structure. The proposed coupler structure is verified in experiment through measuring a fabricated 90 degrees waveguide coupler at a center frequency of 195 GHz with approximately 13% bandwidth where the amplitude imbalance is less than 0.3 dB. The simulated and measured S-parameters have shown that the amplitude and phase imbalances are within 0.3 dB and 4 degrees, respectively, with an isolation and return loss of 17 dB.

The structures and absolute configurations of these compounds were elucidated by the interpretation of data from detailed spectroscopic analysis, Mosher's method, and electronic circular dichroism spectra, together with consideration of the biogenetic origins. None of the five new compounds were detected in single-strain cultures under identical fermentation conditions.

Particularly, with the advantage of being compatible with Si integrated circuits, Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and germanium quantum dots (GeQDs) have been extensively studied in the past few decades. In order to explore novel physical properties, the integration of SiNWs and GeQDs has attracted great attention recently. In this paper, recent researches on the preparation methods and structures of SiNWs, GeQDs and their composites are reviewed, respectively. The synthesis of SiNWs with random distribution and ordered arrays by using vapor- liquid-solid growth mechanism and metal-assisted chemical etching technique is firstly summarized. Some special structures of SiNWs are also discussed. Furthermore, the development of some novel structures of GeQDs for further improving their optical properties is reviewed. Finally, the growth mechanism and structure evolution of SiNWs/GeQDs composites are illustrated from the view of theory and experiment. The strain in Ge shell layers and SiNWs, the relationship between Ge growth mode and SiNW diameter, and the distribution of GeQDs on the radial and axial directions of SiNWs are discussed in detail. The research about the growth of SiNWs/GeQDs composite structures is in its early stage, so there are many questions that need to be resolved in future.

Due to their importance in plant growth and development, genome-wide analyses have been conducted in model plants (Arabidopsis and rice) and maize, but not in Brassica species, which are important vegetable crops. In this study, we systematically analyzed B. rapa BGLUs (BrBGLUs), and demonstrated the involvement of several genes in pollen development. Sixty-four BrBGLUs were identified in Brassica databases, which were anchored onto 10 chromosomes, with 10 tandem duplications. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 64 genes were classified into 10 subgroups, and each subgroup had relatively conserved intron/exon structures. Clustering with Arabidopsis BGLUs (AtBGLUs) facilitated the identification of several important subgroups for flavonoid metabolism, the production of glucosinolates, the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) levels, and other defense-related compounds. At least six BrBGLUs might be involved in pollen development. The expression of BrBGLU10/AtBGLU20, the analysis of co-expressed genes, and the examination of knocked down Arabidopsis plants strongly suggests that BrBGLU10/AtBGLU20 has an indispensable function in pollen development. The results that are obtained from this study may provide valuable information for the further understanding of -glucosidase function and Brassica breeding, for nutraceuticals-rich Brassica crops.

J	Zha, JL; Wu, J; Zhao, DM; Tang, JP				Zha, Jinlin; Wu, Jian; Zhao, Deming; Tang, Jianping			A possible recovery of the near-surface wind speed in Eastern China during winter after 2000 and the potential causes	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							REFERENCE CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE; LAND-USE; COVER CHANGE; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; HOMOGENIZATION; TEMPERATURE; PORTUGAL; IMPACTS	A lasting decrease in the near-surface wind speed (SWS) in China has been revealed, but a following short-term strengthening in the SWS was rarely noted. In this paper, the daily mean SWS observed datasets from 328 measurement stations in Eastern China during the period 1981-2011 were used to investigate the facts and causes of the observed short-term strengthening in winter SWS in recent decades. The major results are summarized as follows: the SWS showed a significant decrease in the last 30years, but a short-term strengthening in SWS was observed during the winter since 2000 in Eastern China. The SWS in Eastern China showed a significant decrease of -0.11ms(-1)decade(-1) from 1981 to 1999, followed by a weak increase of 0.0008ms(-1)decade(-1) from 2000 to 2011. The short-term strengthening in the SWS since 2000 was mainly induced by the changes of the pressure-gradient force (PGF), which could be attributed to the changes of the sea-level pressure (SLP) in the region (51 degrees-69.75 degrees N, 51.75 degrees-111.75 degrees E). Furthermore, the changes of the PGF during the two periods of 1981-1999 and 2000-2011 were consistent with those of the SLP in the region (51 degrees-69.75 degrees N, 51.75 degrees-111.75 degrees E). The correlation coefficient between PGF and SLP was 0.32 and 0.66 during the period 1981-1999 and 2000-2011, respectively. Therefore, the effects of the changes in SLP over the region (51 degrees-69.75 degrees N, 51.75 degrees-111.75 degrees E) on changes of SWS in the Eastern China should be significant.

Surface water and fish tissues (gill, muscle, liver, and intestine) from four representative sample areas (influence by a cascade of four dams) along the river were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations. Results revealed that the levels of heavy metals in fish were tissue-dependent. The highest Cu and As levels were found in the liver; the highest Zn and Pb levels occurred in the intestine, and the highest Hg level was found in the muscle. The total target hazard quotient (THQ) value for residents is > 1 for long-term fish consumption, and local residents are, therefore, exposed to a significant health risk. Results from the current study provide an overall understanding of the spatial and tissue distribution of heavy metals in water and fish body along the upper Mekong River under the influence of cascade dams and highlight the potential health risk of As for the local residents of long-term fish consumption.

In order to understand the genetic mechanisms governing its biocontrol efficiency and other biological processes, an effective gene disruption system is needed. Here we report the development of an efficient system which integrates selective markers that differ from Purpureocillium lilacinum, a one-step construction method for gene knockout plasmids, and a ku80 knockout strain for efficient homologous recombination. With this system, we effectively disrupted the transcription factors in the central regulation pathway of sporulation and a serine protease which were contributed to nematode infection, demonstrating this system as an efficient gene disrupting system for further characterization of genes involved in the development and pathogenesis of this fungus.

The results indicate that combination of Vitamin B-1 and bromide ion performs excellent as inhibitor for carbon steel corrosion in H3PO4 solution and a stronger synergistic effect exists between Vitamin B-1 and bromide ion. The electrochemical studies reveal that single Vitamin B-1 acts as a cathodic type inhibitor, but combination of Vitamin B-1 and bromide ion shows as a mixed-type inhibitor and the corrosion reaction is controlled by charge transfer process. Adsorption of VB1 on the steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm in the absence or presence of bromide ion. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (Delta G degrees(ads), Delta H degrees(ads), Delta S degrees(ads), K-ads and E-a) were calculated and discussed. The adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the steel surface is a spontaneous process and chemical adsorption is absolutely dominant.

The laser gain medium consists of glycerol aqueous solution doped with rhodamine B (RhB) molecules, which has a lower refractive index (RI) than that of the optical fiber. The circular cross section of the optical fiber forms an optofluidic ring resonator and hosts high-quality (Q) whispering gallery modes (WGMs). Optically pumped along the fiber axis, lasing threshold properties of the RhB glycerol aqueous solution have been investigated. With the increase of both RhB dye concentration and the RI of the glycerol aqueous solution, the recorded lasing threshold decreases at first and then increases. Therefore, there is a best dye concentration as well as a best RI of the dye solution that corresponds to the lowest lasing threshold. Additionally, lasing threshold for the mixed solution of ethanol and ethylene glycol doped with RhB molecules is also demonstrated, which is much higher than that of the glycerol aqueous solution for the same dye concentration and the same RI of the dye solution. Based on evanescent wave pumped and gain coupled WGM lasing theory, we compute the lasing threshold varied with the dye concentration and the RI of the dye solution. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data.

A larger sample of OB candidates are first selected from the distributions in the spectral line indices' space. Then, all 22,901 OB spectra are identified by manual inspection. Based on a subsample validation, we find that the completeness of the OB spectra reaches about 89 +/- 22% for the stars with spectral types earlier than B7, while around 57 +/- 16% B8-B9 stars are identified. The smaller completeness for late B stars will lead to the difficulty in discriminating them from A0-A1-type stars. The subclasses of the OB samples are determined using the software package MKCLASS. With a careful validation using 646 subsamples, we find that MKCLASS can give fairly reliable subtypes and luminosity classes for most of the OB stars. The uncertainty of the spectral subtype is around 1 subtype, and the uncertainty of the luminosity class is around 1 level. However, about 40% of the OB stars fail to be assigned to any class by MKCLASS, and a few spectra are significantly misclassified by MKCLASS. This is likely because the template spectra of MKCLASS are selected from nearby stars in the solar neighborhood, while the OB stars in this work are mostly located in the outer disk and may have lower metallicities. The rotation of the OB stars may also be responsible for the misclassifications. Moreover, we find that the spectral and luminosity classes of the OB stars located in the Galactic latitude larger than 20 degrees are substantially different with those located in the latitude smaller than 20 degrees , which may either be due to the observational selection effect or may hint a different origin of the high Galactic latitude OB stars.

This paper designs a novel fusion scheme for CT and MRI medical images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a dual-channel spiking cortical model (DCSCM). Firstly, non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) is utilized to decompose the source image into a low-frequency coefficient and a series of high-frequency coefficients. Secondly, the low-frequency coefficient is fused by the CNN framework, where weight map is generated by a series of feature maps and an adaptive selection rule, and then the high-frequency coefficients are fused by DCSCM, where the modified average gradient of the high-frequency coefficients is adopted as the input stimulus of DCSCM. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse NSST. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme performs well in both subjective visual performance and objective evaluation and has superiorities in detail retention and visual effect over other current typical ones.

However, there are some drawbacks in existing preparation techniques for CdS QDs, such as protection of inert gas, lengthy reaction time, high reaction temperature, poor crystallinity, and non-uniform particle size distribution. In this study, we prepared CdS QDs by liquid phase synthesis under ambient room temperature and atmospheric pressure using sodium alkyl sulfonate, CdCl2, and Na2S as capping agent, cadmium, and sulfur sources respectively. This technique offers facile preparation, efficient reaction, low-cost, and controllable particle size. The as-prepared CdS QDs exhibited good crystallinity, excellent monodispersity, and uniform particle size.

With a vapor cell of size 8 mm x 8 mm x 8 mm, we have incorporated four SERF magnetometer channels, which provides sufficient spatial resolution for magnetoencephalography (MEG). The four channels share the same laser beam for the best cancellation of common mode noise due to laser fluctuations. With gradient measurement, the sensitivities of the four sensors are better than 6 fT/Hz(1/2), which is also good enough for MEG measurement. The vapor cell is heated to 160 degrees C by a novel nonmagnetic current-heating structure. Our sensor with high spatial resolution and compact size is particularly suitable for MEG systems.

The main purpose of this paper is to reveal the impact of vegetation change on regional climate simulation over Eastern China. Therefore, we have performed three 30-year simulations from 1982 to 2011 with the WRF model coupled with the Noah land surface model as follows: a control experiment with climatology green vegetation fraction (GVF) (CTL), a sensitive experiment with WRF default climatology GVF (CLMV), and a sensitive experiment with dynamic vegetation (DYNV). The climatology difference between the CTL and CLMV experiment points out that during 1982-2011 over Eastern China, the increase of vegetation causes the decrease of temperature; on the other hand, the increase of temperature often corresponds to the reduction of vegetation. In the meantime, the increase/decrease in GVF is quite consistent with the simulated increase/decrease in precipitation, which is caused by both circulations and water vapor distributions at lower levels. The difference in the temperature trend between the cri. and DYNV experiment is almost opposite to that between the DYNV and GVF trend, which means that the decreased/increased vegetation will increase/decrease the surface air temperature. However, the trend of precipitation variation shows no clear relation with that of GVF. In response to GVF change, the results show that in the vegetation-climate feedback the moisture feedback is dominant over the radiation and momentum feedback. Significant decrease in GVF and LAI is detected across the East China, which leads to the decrease in the latent heat flux and increase in the sensible heat flux. For extremes and heat waves, it is shown that DYNV leads to better stimulation on the maximum of daily maximum temperature (TXx), warm spell days (WSDI), heat wave days (HWNY) and the averaged heat wave duration (HWDU) than CTL does over most of the Southeast China, although it may introduce some new biases in the Eastern coastal regions as well as the Northeastern China.

We produce the gamma-ray light curves by using the geometric method and the particle trajectory method. For the geometric method, assuming the gamma-ray emission originates in a finite-width layer along the last closed lines, we generate the gamma-ray light curves based on the uniform emissivity along the magnetic field lines in the comoving frame. For the particle trajectory method, we consider the spatial distribution of conductivity sigma by assuming a very high conductivity within the light cylinder (LC) and a finite conductivity outside the LC. Assuming that all the 7-ray emission originates in the outer magnetosphere outside the LC, we generate the gamma-ray light curves by computing realistic particle trajectories and Lorentz factors, taking into account both the accelerating electric field and curvature radiation loss. Further, we compare the modeling light curves to the observed light curves at >0.1 GeV energies for the Vela pulsar. Our results show that the magnetosphere with the low a value is preferred for the geometric method. However, the magnetosphere with a near force-free regime within the LC and a high a value outside the LC is favored for the particle trajectory method. It is noted that the particle trajectory method uses the parallel electric fields that are self-consistent with the magnetic fields of the magnetosphere. We suggest that the results from the particle trajectory method are better supported on the physical ground.

Fossil taxa can provide morphological evidence that may elucidate the origins of derived characters and shared ancestries among divergent taxa, providing a means to "break" long branches in phylogenetic trees. Here we describe new fossil material from the early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota, Yunnan Province, China, including the putative cnidarian Xianguangia, the new taxon Daihua sanqiong gen et sp. nov., and Dinom-ischus venustus, informally referred to as "dinomischids" here. "Dinomischids" possess a basal calyx encircled by 18 tentacles that surround the mouth. The tentacles carry pinnules, each with a row of stiff filamentous structures interpreted as very large compound cilia of a size otherwise only known in ctenophores. Together with the Cambrian tulip animal Siphusauctum and the armored Cambrian sclerocte-nophores, they exhibit anatomies that trace ctenophores to a sessile, polypoid stem lineage. This body plan resembles the polypoid, tentaculate morphology of cnidarians, including a blind gastric cavity partitioned by mesenteries. We propose that comb rows are derived from tentacles with paired sets of pinnules that each bear a row of compound cilia. The scleroctenophores exhibit paired comb rows, also observed in Siphusauctum, in addition to an organic skeleton, shared as well by Dinomischus, Daihua, and Xianguangia. We formulate a hypothesis in which ctenophores evolved from sessile, polypoid suspension feeders, sharing similarities with cnidarians that suggest either a close relationship between these two phyla, a striking pattern of early convergent evolution, or an ancestral condition for either metazoans or eumetazoans.

Based on classical electromagnetic theory, we obtain analytically the dispersion equation for cavity plasmon polariton (CPP) modes. The obtained results show the existence of two types of CPP modes in THz range. One can be referred as Fabry-Perot-like modes and another as surface-plasmon-like modes (SPLMs). Interestingly, the SPLMs can realize notable enhancement of wave localization in comparison with usual graphene plasmons. Moreover, a scheme to modulate the THz CPP modes via visible light irradiation is proposed and examined. We find that the optical pumping can affect rather efficiently the CPP modes via excitation of photon induced carriers. These important theoretical findings indicate that the CPP can be applied in all-optical tunable plasmonic devices in THz bandwidth. This paper is relevant to the application of graphene as advanced optical and plasmonic devices.

The RGB stars are distinguished from the red clump (RC) stars utilizing period spacing derived from the spectra with a machine-learning method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Cross-validation suggests our method is capable of distinguishing RC from RGB stars with an only 2 per cent contamination rate for stars with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 50. The ages and masses of these RGB stars are determined from their LAMOST spectra with the KPCA method by taking the LAMOST-Kepler giant stars having asteroseismic parameters and the LAMOST-TGAS sub-giant stars based on isochrones as training sets. Examination suggests that the age and mass estimates of our RGB sample stars with SNR > 30 have a median error of 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Stellar ages are found to exhibit positive vertical and negative radial gradients across the disk, and the age structure of the disk is strongly flared across the whole disk of 6 < R < 13 kpc. The data set demonstrates good correlations among stellar age, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]. There are two separate sequences in the [Fe/H]-[alpha/Fe] plane: a high-alpha sequence with stars older than similar to 8Gyr and a low-alpha sequence composed of stars with ages covering the whole range of possible ages of stars. We also examine relations between age and kinematic parameters derived from the Gaia DR2 parallax and proper motions. Both the median value and dispersion of the orbital eccentricity are found to increase with age. The vertical angular momentum is found to fairly smoothly decrease with age from 2 to 12 Gyr, with a rate of about - 50 kpc km s(-1) Gyr(-1).

However, the role of SIRT1 in invasion and metastasis of glioma cells and its associated signaling pathway remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of SIRT1 on these processes and on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human glioma and adjacent tissues, and in the human glioma cell lines U87 and U251. SIRT1 expression in tissues was investigated using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The U87 and U251 cell lines were divided into control and SIRT1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) groups. The Cell Counting Kit-8, cell invasion assays were used to evaluate the effects of SIRT1 silencing on cell viability, invasion and EMT. Results indicated that SIRT1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues compared with in adjacent brain tissues. In addition, SIRT1-siRNA significantly inhibited the viability and invasion of U87 and U251 cells. Furthermore, EMT analysis revealed that the expression levels of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and vimentin were significantly lower in the SIRT1-siRNA group compared with in the control group. Conversely, expression levels of the epithelial markers epithelial cadherin and beta-catenin were significantly higher in the SIRT1-siRNA group compared with in the control group. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that SIRT1 was positively associated with viability and invasion of U87 cells, potentially through EMT. These results suggested that SIRT1 may serve a crucial role in the proliferation and development of glioma.

The characterization was actualized on the synthesized nanocomposite using XRD, Raman, TG-DSC, IJV-vis-DRS, PL, XPS, SEM, TEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis. An efficient and stable photocatalytic activity was exhibited by the synergistic ZnO/PNAI nanocomposites on the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to benign Cr(III) in comparison with the pristine ZnO and other semiconductor/PANI materials reported. The influence of parameters such as solution pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration and the addition of organic sacrifices on the Cr(VI) removal efficiency was investigated. It was found that the Cr(VI) removal was strongly pH-dependent and the optimum pH range was 4-7 for ZnO/PANI composite catalyst. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic examination showed that the surface photoreaction was the rate-determining step to compare the adsorption equilibrium. The organic additives such as EDTA and citric acid can promote the photocatalytic efficiency and the solution of EDTA/HCI can well restore the photoreduction ability of ZnO/PANI catalyst. Moreover, the reusability of photocatalyst was also tested to estimate the practicability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we report two subtractive cDNA libraries for MZ(2) (forward library) and MZ(3) (reverse library) that were constructed using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). PCR amplification revealed that the MZ(2) and MZ(3) libraries contained approximately 96.7% and 95% recombinant clones, respectively, and the length of the inserted fragments ranged from 0.5 to 1.5kb. A total of 106 and 111 unique sequences were obtained from the MZ(2) and MZ(3) libraries, respectively, and were assembled into 13 specific consensus sequences (contigs or genes) (5 from MZ(2) and 8 from MZ(3)). The qRT-PCR results revealed that 11 out of 13 genes were differentially expressed between MZ-2 and MZ-3. Of 13 genes, 11 genes were found in both SSH and our RNA-seq data and displayed a similar expression trend between SSH and RNA-seq data, and the remaining 2 genes have not been reported in both E. necatrix genome and our RNA-seq data. Among the 11 genes, the expression trends of 8 genes were highly consistent between SSH and our RNA-seq data. These DEGs may provide specialized functions related to the life-cycle transitions of Eimeria species.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			Comparisons of urban-related warming in Beijing using different methods to calculate the daily mean temperature	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Urban surface expansion; Surface air temperature; Daily mean temperature; Changing trend; Urban-related warming	SURFACE EXPANSION; URBANIZATION; RECORDS; TRENDS; CHINA	To evaluate the contribution of urban surface expansion to regional warming using different methods to calculate the daily mean surface air temperature (SAT), satellite-based images displaying urban surface expansion over the past 37 years (1980-2016) across China were collected for use in nested numerical experiments using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) regional climate model. The contribution of urban surface expansion to urban-related warming was determined using the daily mean SAT averages based on four time records each day (00, 06, 12, and 18 h UTC, T-4) and averages of the SAT maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) (T-xn). The contribution of urban surface expansion to urban-related warming (relative value) in Beijing was 0.110 degrees C per decade (22.8% of total warming) for T-4 and 0.094 degrees C per decade (20.2%) for T-xn. The values obtained when using T-4 were larger than those obtained when using T-xn. Differences in the urban-related warming calculated using T-4 and T-xn could be attributed to the smaller changing trends in T-xn in the urban-surface expansion experiment, which resulted from a large changing trend in T-min and a much smaller changing trend in T-max. The changes in the diurnal cycle of the energy budget due to urban surface expansion induced changes in the diurnal cycle of SAT, as evidenced by the four time records each day, as well as T-max and T-min. This was especially true for periods of intense urban surface expansion, although the annual mean SAT calculated using T-xn was larger than that calculated using T-4. The increase in impervious area (walls, streets, etc.) due to urban surface expansion, as well as the widespread use of building materials with a large heat capacity resulted in a marked increase in ground heat flux in the daytime. This restricted the increase in SAT in the daytime, but promoted it at night. The increases in SAT due to urban surface expansion were not symmetrical, being smaller in the daytime and larger at night.

Here, we examined the trends in SDD variation and the driving mechanisms based on short-term (35 lakes, JulySeptember 2017) and long-term (3 lakes, 19822016) datasets covering lakes with different trophic states on the Yunnan Plateau. In the short-term dataset, increases in organic matter content, phytoplankton biomass and trophic state reduced the SDD. In the long-term dataset, the annual SDD decreased significantly in all three lakes. Significant increases occurred in phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic Lake Dianchi, both phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai, and organic matter content in oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu over time, and these increases were related to increased trophic state (or change in nutrient level) and/or possibly to climate warming. Furthermore, phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content were important direct driving factors for reduced SDD in eutrophic Lake Dianchi and oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu, respectively, while the interaction of these two factors was the most important factor in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai. These results implied that eutrophication and climate warming could regulate SDD by changing organic matter concentration and/or phytoplankton biomass, which may depend on the lacustrine trophic state. However, further studies across larger geographical scales and more lakes are needed to confirm these results.

Accordingly, toluidine blue (TB), one electrochemcial indicator, could enter into the cavity of 2HP5 to fabricate host-guest complex through strong electrostatic interaction and charge-transfer interaction, which significantly enhanced the loading quantity of TB and effectively suppressed the leaking of TB resulting in an ultrasensitive and robust electrochemical response. More importantly, the integration of 2HP5-stabilized AuNPs and Pd-decorated MnO2 nanocomposites (2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2) might usually obtain a novel functional-enhanced materials and lead to new properties and improving the analytical performance and robustness of electrochemical devices. Therefore, we construct a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using TB-2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2 nanocomposites as the transducing materials for robust and ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a significant biomarker of acute myocardial infarction. As anticipated, this immunosensor had remarkable robustness, sensitivity, stability, specificity, and corresponded linearly to the concentration of cTnI over a wide range from 0.005 to 20 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 2 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The proposed electrochemical immunosensor showed acceptable recoveries in human serum, indicating that macrocycle-stabilized metal nanoparticle might be a promising emerging transducer material for the detection of biological markers.

In this study, we investigated the seed dynamics of canopy and soil seed banks in this species, as well as the resulting fate of seed in different locations. We found few seeds on the soil surface, and virtually no viable seed within the soil. In serotinous populations, the size of the seed bank was 20 times greater than that of non-serotinous populations. The number of seeds stored on the forest floor was considerably lower than the number input by seed rain. Almost all seeds on the floor lost viability within 17 months, and most died during the rainy season. Seed mortality in the canopy was considerably lower than either on or in the soil. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that serotiny enhances the size of the P. yunnanensis seed bank and that in this species, serotiny has an adaptive advantage over soil seed storage in Central Yunnan.

The challenge is due to fewer variations in rubber defoliation of rubber canopy. We examined the relationship between colour indices calculated from digital camera images and gross primary production (GPP) obtained from daily flux tower observations of carbon dioxide over two years in a rubber plantation and used these colour indices to model GPP. According to the results, (1) the strength of green (S-green), Hue and GPP exhibited clear seasonal patterns in the rubber plantation, and the relationship between the camera-based indices and GPP appeared to have distinct characteristics at different phenological stages; (2) the peak GPP from the flux tower measurements lagged behind the peak in the colour indices calculated from digital camera imagery, (3) GPP was strongly correlated with S-green derived from camera imagery in the rubber plantation, especially in the leaf expansion period; and (4) the GPP simulated by colour indices (S-green and Hue) was underestimated, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) was the best parameter for modelling GPP in normal years. Our results indicate that colour indices calculated from digital camera images can be used to model GPP in rubber plantations and to monitor biotic and abiotic stress events. Future research should measure the pigment contents of canopy leaves to precisely quantify the relationship between colour indices and GPP.

Here, we examine the Mo-isotopic composition of black to gray shales from the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) section at Chaohu, eastern China, in order to assess the utility of this proxy under a range of paleoredox conditions. We evaluated local redox conditions using a combination of redox-sensitive trace-element concentrations (Mo, U) and Fe-T/Al ratios, recognizing six intervals of more reducing conditions at the PTB and Induan-Olenekian boundary (IOB), in the mid-Smithian, at the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB), and in the mid- and upper Spathian. These six intervals are associated with variably weak to moderate enrichments of Mo, and they show variable shifts away from background delta Mo-98 values of ca. -0.4 to +0.1 parts per thousand (recording detrital Mo-isotopic compositions) toward delta Mo-98 values as high as +2.3 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand. Based on an analysis of local redox proxies versus delta Mo-98 as well as of sample- to-sample variance in delta Mo-98 values, we conclude that only one of the six reducing intervals in the study section is likely to record contemporaneous seawater delta Mo-98 (as a result of quasi-quantitative Mo uptake), i.e., the interval from the Hindeodus typicalis conodont Zone close to the PTB, for which delta Mo-98 values of + 2.3 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand suggest average global-ocean redox conditions similar to those of the modern ocean. For the remaining five reducing intervals, non-quantitative Mo uptake led to Mo-isotope signatures reflecting local, mostly suboxic redox conditions. The highest Mo concentrations (17-23 ppm) were yielded by the mid- and upper Spathian intervals, and the lack of concurrent U enrichment in the mid-Spathian interval suggests the local operation of a Mn-Fe particulate shuttle, an inference that is consistent with its relatively low delta Mo-98 values (0 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). The lack of evidence for strong oceanic anoxia in the South China Craton following the PTB crisis may have been a factor in the relatively rapid recovery of marine ecosystems in this region during the Early Triassic. The present contribution serves as a case study of the application of Moisotopes as a paleoredox proxy in low-[Mo] sediments, which requires a careful assessment of the relative importance of global versus local redox influences based on additional proxies and evaluation criteria.

J	Xia, YM; Tang, NS				Xia, Ye-Mao; Tang, Nian-Sheng			Bayesian analysis for mixture of latent variable hidden Markov models with multivariate longitudinal data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Latent variable hidden Markov model; Finite mixture model; MCMC; Gibbs sampler	FINITE MIXTURES; POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS; IDENTIFIABILITY	Latent variable hidden Markov models (LVHMMs) are important statistical methods in exploring the possible heterogeneity of data and explaining the pattern of subjects moving from one group to another over time. Classic subject- and/or time-homogeneous assumptions on transition matrices in transition model as well as the emission distribution in the observed process may be inappropriate to interpret heterogeneity at the subject level. For this end, a general extension of LVHMM is proposed to address the heterogeneity of multivariate longitudinal data both at the subject level and the occasion level. The main modeling strategy is that the observed time sequences are first grouped into different clusters, and then within each cluster the observed sequences are formulated via latent variable hidden Markov model. The local heterogeneity at the occasion level is characterized by the distribution related to the latent states, while the global heterogeneity at the subject level is identified with the finite mixture model. Compared to the existing methods, an appeal underlying the proposal is its capacity of accommodating non-homogeneous patterns of state sequences and emission distributions across the subjects simultaneously. As a result, the proposal provides a comprehensive framework for exploring various kinds of relevance among the multivariate longitudinal data. Within the Bayesian paradigm, Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to implement posterior analysis. Gibbs sampler is used to draw observations from the related full conditionals and posterior inferences are carried out based on these simulated observations. Empirical results including simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, WD40 repeat (WDR) domain proteins, some of the most abundant mediators of protein interactions, are largely unexplored. In our study, 57 of 361 known WDR proteins were identified as hub nodes, and a hub (WDR54) with elevated mRNA in colorectal cancer (CRC) was selected for further study. Immunohistochemistry of specimens from 945 patients confirmed the elevated expression of WDR54 in CRC, and we found that patients with WDR54-high tumors typically had a shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) than those with WDR54-low tumors, especially for the subgroup without well-differentiated tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that WDR54-high tumors were an independent risk factor for DSS, with a hazard ratio of 2.981 (95% confidence interval, 1.425-6.234; p = 0.004). Knockdown of WDR54 significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of CRC cells and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Each WDR54 isoform (a, b, and c) was found to reverse the inhibitory effect of WDR54 knockdown; however, only isoform c, which exhibited the highest expression, was increased in CRC cells. Sensitization of WDR54 knockdown to an SHP2 inhibitor was consistently found in CRC cells, and the underlying mechanism involved their common function in regulating AKT and ERK signaling. In conclusion, the present study is the first to investigate the significance of WDR54 in cancer and to conclude that WDR54 serves as an oncogene in CRC and may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

Appropriate tillage practices are beneficial to soil conservation and avail against soil erosion. Currently, how tillage contributes to soil erosion of EG at the catchment scale is still unclear. To quantify EG erosion and analyze the effects of tillage practice on EG erosion in a typical farmed dry-hot valley catchment, EGs under five tillage practices including conventional tillage (CT), contour ridge tillage in sugarcane land (CRT-40S), vegetable land (CRT-40 V) and in orange land (CRT-25), and without tillage in abandoned land (CK) were investigated. Five field surveys were conducted during two growing seasons from April 2013 to February 2015. The results showed that EG erosion was most serious after crops being harvested, followed by that before crops being planted, after crops being planted subsequently. The average EG erosion modulus of two growing seasons was 231.85 t km(-2) a(-1). Considering the effect of tillage practices, EG erosion modulus was the largest under CK, followed by CT, CRT-25, CRT-40 V and CRT-40S subsequently, indicating that contour ridge tillage practice would benefit for controlling EG erosion. We found that farmlands with conventional tillage practice had to be abandoned when EGs were developed intensively. But EG erosion did not terminate after being abandoned. The redundancy analysis further confirmed that tillage practice was the dominant control on EG erosion in the dry-hot valley. Our results suggested that appropriate tillage practice such as contour ridge tillage can efficiently restrain EG erosion in the dry-hot valley.

However, the spatial correlation across distinct sites and the temporal correlation within each site pose challenges to accurate forecasting. In this paper, a geosensor data forecasting tensor framework for significant societal events is proposed. Specifically, a tensor pattern is used to model the geosensor data, based on which a tensor decomposition algorithm is then developed to estimate future values of geosensor data. The proposed approach not only combines and utilizes the multi-mode correlations, but also well extracts the underlying factors in each mode of tensor and mines the multi-dimensional structures of geosensor data. In addition, a rank increasing strategy is used to determine tensor rank automatically, and a sliding window strategy is used to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluations illustrate the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-arts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The synergetic effect and oxygen vacancies of g-C3N4@CeO2 play the major role in the process of CO2 reduction, leading to CH4 generating much earlier and higher concentration than that of the pristine g-C3N4 and CeO2 alone. Meanwhile, the unique hollow structures can make multiple reflections of light in the cavity, and thus enhance the utilization efficiency of light. Moreover, the L-cysteine offers amine groups and meanwhile is anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 during the synthesis process, and thus contributes greatly to the enhanced CO2 adsorption capability. Additionally, the large CO2 adsorption capability is also beneficial for the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the novel photocatalysts exhibit a remarkable reduction performance for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The g-C3N4@CeO2 (CeO2 49.7 wt %) shows the highest yields of CH4 (3.5 mu mol g(-1)), CH3OH (5.2 mu mol g(-1)) and CO (16.8 mu mol g(-1)), which are higher than most of other latest reported g-C3N4 based photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, including coupled with semiconductors and noble metal cocatalysts. This strategy might represent a novel way for the effective conversion of CO2 to clean fuels and can also be great potential used in the energy and environmental science.

On the other hand, due to the potential risk during pursuing high payoff in human society, selecting the most common strategy for a player inside the interaction range is relatively safer, at least its payoff is not much lower than average, which is known as conformity. Motivated by these facts, we here propose a mechanism of conformity with memory whose core lies in two facts: (i) Each player first applies a memory rule to compare its own historical payoffs with a limited memory length and to take the strategy corresponding to the maximal payoff as historical optimal strategy; (ii) Each player can get the virtual optimal strategy by selecting the most common strategy from its neighbors' historical optimal strategies according to the conformity rule. The asynchronous updating algorithm, together with the virtual strategy, is used to study the evolution of cooperation with different memory lengths on a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism remarkably promotes cooperation in three classical evolutionary social dilemmas. More specifically, it is revealed that the cooperation level decreases gradually as the memory length increases in the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game, and that the cooperation level increases as so does the memory length in the stag-hunt game.

Here we present exceptionally preserved specimens of the polychelidan lobster Voulteryon parvulus, from the Jurassic of La Voulte-sur-Rhone Fossil-Lagerstatte, France, bearing eyes with hexagonal and square facets, ovaries, and a unique association with epibiont thecideoid brachiopods, giving insights onto the palaeoenvironment of this Lagerstatte. The eyes, mostly covered in hexagonal facets are interpreted as either apposition eyes (poorly adapted to low-light environment) or, less likely, as refractive or parabolic superposition eyes (compatible with dysphotic palaeoenvironments). The interpretation that V. parvulus had apposition eyes suggests an allochthonous, shallow water origin. However, the presence of thecideoid brachiopod ectosymbionts on its carapace, usually associated to dim-light paleoenvironments and/or rock crevices, suggests that V. parvulus lived in a dim-light setting. This would support the less parsimonious interpretation that V. parvulus had superposition eyes. If we accept the hypothesis that V. parvulus had apposition eyes, since the La Voulte palaeoenvironment is considered deep water and had a soft substrate, V. parvulus could have moved into the La Voulte Lagerstatte setting. If this is the case, La Voulte biota would record a combination of multiple palaeoenvironments.

Alternatively, tuning the Pd catalyst switched the reactivity toward an unprecedented [4+3] cycloaddition/cross-coupling. Ligands play a vital role in controlling the reaction pathway, allowing highly selective access to different products from identical substrates. Biological evaluation of the obtained compounds led to the discovery of new antitumor targets. A possible mechanism is proposed, suggesting two interesting catalytic cycles for the cycloaddition with palladium-butadienyls. This study also demonstrated the potential and utility of allenic esters as 1,4-biselectrophiles and C-4 synthons for participating in cycloaddition reactions.

J	Deng, WS				Deng, Weisheng			Does Remanufacturing Always Benefit the Manufacturer and Hurt the Supplier?	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						remanufacturing; closed-loop supply chain; market segment; recycling	CHAIN; OPTIMIZATION; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; CHANNEL; DESIGN	Traditional wisdom claims that remanufacturing operations always benefit the manufacturer in monopolistic cases and hurt the supplier in a supply chain system. However, we show that this claim does not hold when firms face a mature market. In particular, we consider a case in which some consumers in the market possess old products before the selling season, i.e., some consumers are holders. A monopolistic manufacturer collects used products from holders and then sells the products to non-holders after furbishing and remanufacturing. In the integrated case, the manufacturer performs manufacturing and remanufacturing together. We find that remanufacturing may hurt the manufacturer when the fraction of non-holders in the market and the production cost are both low. In the separated case, in which an upstream supplier provides the core component to a downstream manufacturer, the downstream manufacturer undertakes the remanufacturing operation as well as manufacturing. We find that the supplier can benefit from the manufacturer's remanufacturing operation under a specific condition, even if the manufacturer always receives a higher profit.

However, they were not widespread in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Limited in research methods, previous studies failed to make convincing arguments on this phenomenon. We collected, organized and analyzed relevant historical documents to reconstruct the spatio-temporal process of the construction of masonry walls from 1st to 17th century in China. We conducted a time series analysis primarily based on factors such as wars, garrisons, economy, and natural disasters. Analysis of the correlation among the construction of masonry walls and these factors provides insights into this process. From the 1st to 14th century, only 125 masonry city walls were built in China and the annual average number was below 0.1. While in the Ming Dynasty, a total of 1,493 masonry walls were built, with an annual average of 5.41. The construction activities in 1368-1456 spread throughout the country, but mainly appeared in the high-grade administrative cities and garrisons, as a result of the planned implementation of the central government. The construction activities in 1457-1644 had corresponding cluster areas during different periods, mainly at county-level. We found that the wall construction was stimulated by external factors such as wars and disasters. We believe that the mass construction of masonry walls in the Ming Dynasty is a phenomenon of cultural diffusion. The central government plan, the complex interactions between local governments and community, and the stimulation of external factors worked together to contribute to the diffusion of masonry city walls in the Ming Dynasty.

The crystal and morphological structures as well as electromagnetic shielding performance at Ku band (12-18 GHz) were thoroughly investigated. Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with a diameter around 6-10 nm were anchored on the surface of carbon nanotubes with some aggregation. It is found that the as-prepared nanocomposites exhibit excellent electromagnetic shielding performance with values 22-25 dB in the Ku frequency range with a thickness of 2 mm. The small cobalt ferrite nanoparticles offer a large number of polarization and magnetization active sites to improve the electromagnetic performance by the incorporation of carbon nanotubes.

However, it is very challenging to develop materials that can achieve a subtle balance between the key requirements, such as large NLO response, high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT), wide IR transparency, and phase-matching. In this work, a new wide IR transparency (0.38-15.3 mu m) NLO crystal Ba10In6Zn7S26 (SS26) is synthesized. Further, its composite system Ba10In6Zn7S26-nZnS is synthesized by eutectic reaction. In particular, Ba10In6Zn7S26-14ZnS (SS40) shows excellent balanced NLO performance that includes a large band gap of 3.05 eV, high LIDT (13.3 X AgGaS2), large second harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.1 x AgGaS2 at 2050 nm, 5.2 X KDP at 1064 nm), and wide optical transmission window (0.37-15.4 mu m). Importantly, the phase-matching condition is realized for SS40 by interfaces formed between the crystal face (112) of matrix SS26 and the crystal face (111) of reinforcement cubic ZnS by topological chemical reaction, and the NLO performance can be tuned by different concentrations of ZnS. First-principles simulations are employed to study NLO properties of SS26 and the interfaces. This work demonstrates that SS40 is a promising MFIR NLO material, and tuning components of the composite material system is a useful way to develop new MFIR NLO materials with excellent comprehensive performance.

In comparison with the reported concentrators, material parameters of the concentrators developed here are homogeneous and non-negative, which make the devices applicable to practical fabrication. The constitutive parameters equations reported here are effective for concentrators of regular and irregular shape, which provide the flexibility for device design. Furthermore, to remove the anisotropic of material parameters, layered structure concentrator composed of only homogeneous, isotropic materials are presented based on effective medium theory. Space compressing ratio and concentrating efficiency are calculated to quantitatively investigate the efficiency of the proposed device. The feasibility of concentrator design with ordinary isotropic materials instead of metamaterials would dramatically reduce the fabrication difficulties and move the device a step further towards the practical use.

In this work, for the first time, an efficient cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene-based dopant-free D-A-D type hole transport material (HTM) YN3 is developed for application in organic-inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performance. The (FAPbI(3))(0.85)(MAPbBr(3))(0.15) and CsPbI2Br PSCs devices based on YN3 as a dopant-free HTM render very impressive PCEs of 18.84% and 12.05%, respectively. The obtained PCE values of YN3-based PSCs outperform most dopant-free HTMs based on small organic molecules reported so far. More encouragingly, the YN3-based PSCs without encapsulation display good long-term stability.

The reaction provides an efficient way to construct various 3-aryloxindole building blocks of pharmaceutical interest at ambient temperature by using household compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs as the light source. Preliminarily, mechanistic studies revealed that the intermolecular electron transfer relied on the formation of photon-absorbing electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes between electron-rich oxindole enolates and electron-deficient (hetero) aryl halides, and a radical chain mechanism was operative.

The present plastid analysis discovered the same major clades as the nuclear data but with some substantial differences in topology within the clades. The considerably larger plastid and nuclear data sets add phylogenetic resolution within the prior plastid DNA restriction site data, highlight plastid/nuclear incongruence that supports hypotheses of hybridization/introgression to help explain the taxonomic difficulty in the section.

The uncertainty of semi-Markov jump refers to that the partial information on transition rates are incompletely known. Firstly, an extended reciprocally convex combination inequality with less conservative is provided. Secondly, by constructing an eligible stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with considering more information about various time delays, uncertain semi-Markov jumping parameters, some stability criterions are derived via utilizing the improved inequality together with some integral inequalities. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The typical semimetal-like electronic structure is observed and examined, where multiple hole pockets related to Te 5p bands and one-electron pockets related to Ti 3d bands are populated by carriers. The obtained results reveal (i) a pronounced three-dimensional (3D) electronic band structure of 1T-TiTe2 with typical semi-metallic features for both the Ti 3d and the Te 5p states; (ii) multiple Fermi surface sheets and complex band structure; and (iii) an obvious kink in the dispersion at an energy of about 18 meV below the Fermi energy, which is an experimental observation of the kink structure in 1T-TiTe2 single crystal. We find that this kink is induced by electron-phonon coupling in the material. These important and significant findings can help us to gain an in-depth understanding of the 3D electronic structure of semimetallic 1T-TiTe2.

After comparing with those for the previous relativistic outflow systems (including long gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and black hole X-ray binaries), our results show that there exists a universal correlation between the gamma-ray luminosity and power, and the radiation efficiency is independent of the gamma-ray luminosity for various relativistic jet systems. Therefore, the acceleration and emission mechanisms or efficiencies may be similar in all relativistic outflows regardless of their central engines.

The structure and chemical composition of as-synthesized Co(OH)(2)@FeCo2O4 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The results show the FeCo2O4 nanosheets are covered with the Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles and the BET show the nanocomposite possess the mesoporous structure with specific surface area and total pore volume are 93.071m(2) g(-1) and 0.37 cm(3) g(-1), respectively. In addition, the electrochemical performances were investigated in a three-electrode system to evaluate the material. The as-synthesized Co(OH)(2)@FeCo2O4 nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1173.43 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and remarkable cycling stability with 95.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The results show the higher capacitance and longer cycle performance, compared with the Co(OH)(2) and FeCo2O4, respectively. This remarkable electrochemical performances were mainly due to mesoporous structure and the synergistic effect of Co(OH)(2) and FeCo2O4.

Understanding the water-quality trend and characteristics is the basis of area protection for Fuxian Lake. This study combines of the Mann-Kendall, Mann-Kendall-Sneyers, water pollution index (WPI), the trophic state index and time series analysis to detect and characterize the water quality with a set of indicators: transparency (SD), permanganate index (IMn), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and chlorophyll-a (Chl.a). Then, the characteristics are discussed on the scales of long-period, sections divided by the change point, and monthly data. Results show that the water quality of Fuxian Lake is at a good level but decreases consistently. Especially, the increasing trends of IMn, BOD5, and Chl.a pass the confidence limit of the Z value of 2.56. The year of 2007 was designated as the change point. The characteristics of pollution and typical components vary in the long-period series, between the two sections divided by the change point, and in the monthly data. In the long period, the TN and TP are typical pollution components. However, the IMn, BOD5, and Chl.a are typical components as the large changes of a 99.1% and 89.5% increase after the change point with respect to the former values, respectively. On the scale of monthly data of a typical year, the pollution grade and components varies within the years. The multidimensional synthesis methodology established by employing evaluation index systems from the aspects of pollution level, multi-attributes and the trophic state status could also be applied to detect and characterize the water quality of other water bodies. The results of the Fuxian Lake study can provide the base information and decision-making support for water quality management and area protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wetland carbon storage controlled by millennial-scale variation in relative sea-level rise	NATURE			English	Article							MANGROVE FORESTS; BLUE CARBON; ACCUMULATION; RATES; SOILS	Coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass) sustain the highest rates of carbon sequestration per unit area of all natural systems(1,2), primarily because of their comparatively high productivity and preservation of organic carbon within sedimentary substrates(3). Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.

However, the development of hollow-structured COFs with defined morphology is important for their further applications, which is rare. Herein, COF with unique hollow shuttle morphology was prepared by a Schiff condensation reaction between 4-(4-aldehyde phenyl) ethylene (TPE) and tetra-(4-aminophenyl) porphyrin (TAP). A detailed mechanistic investigation reveals that an initial self-assembly followed by a similar inside-out Ostwald ripening process is responsible for the hollow capsule formation. The hollow microshuttle-shaped capsule COF is used for studying hemoglobin adsorption, which shows an uptake of 550.82 mg g(-1) of hemoglobin. These studies could foreshadow new avenues for the development of porous materials with defined morphologies for the adsorption of biomolecules.

The lasing gain medium consists of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor-acceptor dye pair Rhodamine B (RhB)-LDS821 mixture solution, which has a lower refractive index than that of the optical fiber and flows in the PDMS microfluidic channel. The circular cross section of the optical fiber forms a ring resonator and hosts high-quality (Q) whispering gallery modes (WGMs). Pumping along the optical fiber axis, the FRET characteristic parameters, i.e., the FRET efficiency and the Forster distance R-0 of donor-acceptor dye pair, are firstly studied by using a continuous wave laser as a pump light source with a wavelength of 532 nm. The excited states are thencreated in the donor (RhB) by using a pulse laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and whose energy is transferred into the adjacent acceptor (LDS821) through the nonradiative FRET mechanism. Finaly, the emission of LDS821 iscoupled into the WGM of the ring resonator to lase. Due to the high energy transfer efficiency and high Q-factor, the acceptor shows a lasing threshold as low as 1.26 mu J / mm(2).

The DNA sequences of respective strains including nuclear ribosomal DNA genes (nuSSU, ITS, nuLSU) and fragments of three protein-coding genes (ACT1, BT2, TEF1) were sequenced and compared with those from closely-related species to genera Ochroconis and Verruconis (Family Sympoventuriaceae, Order Venturiales). Morphologically, both species showed typical ampulliform conidiophores and conidiogenous cells, features not seen in other species of Verruconis. The conidia of V. hainanensis are fusiform and those of V. pseudoricladiata are Y or T shaped, similar to old members of a closely-related genus Scolecobasidium.

When isophthalic acid ligands with different substitutions are introduced, the crystal structures and fluorescence properties are significantly changed. Hirshfeld surface calculation is used to study the nuances of diverse substitutions during the construction of all of the crystals. The solid fluorescence results indicate that there are obvious two-channel emissions, including intralayer excimers and interlayer trapped excitons, both in 1 and 2 with a double-layer structure and in 3 with a single-layer structure, mainly exhibiting intralayer emission. Furthermore, the fluorescence changes on morphology transformations are explored after mechanical exfoliation consisting of grinding and ultrasonicaation of MOFs 13. The regulation and control of crystal structure and morphology can suppress emission based on interlayer excitons, achieving adjustment of the overall emitting color. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 2D bilayer MOFs with dual-channel emissions, which provides a new structural model for synthesizing new exciton materials.

As most chemical nematicides have negative environmental side effects, there is a pressing need for developing efficient biocontrol methods. Nematophagous microbes, the natural enemies of nematodes, are potential biocontrol agents against PPNs. These natural enemies include both bacteria and fungi and they use diverse methods to infect and kill nematodes. For instance, nematode-trapping fungi can sense host signals and produce special trapping devices to capture nematodes, whereas endo-parasitic fungi can kill nematodes by spore adhesion and invasive growth to break the nematode cuticle. By contrast, nematophagous bacteria can secrete virulence factors to kill nematodes. In addition, some bacteria can mobilize nematode-trapping fungi to kill nematodes. In response, nematodes can also sense and defend against the microbial pathogens using strategies such as producing antimicrobial peptides regulated by the innate immunity system. Recent progresses in our understanding of the signal pathways involved in microbe-nematode interactions are providing new insights in developing efficient biological control strategies against PPNs.

Increasing numbers of enterprises implement carbon emission reduction by using carbon cap-and-trade mechanisms to cater to consumers and practice social responsibility. From the manufacturer's perspective, they can implement carbon emission reduction investment by themselves or outsource it to the retailer or energy service company (referred as ESCO). To explore the best carbon emission reduction mode selection strategy, we built and compared three carbon emission reduction modesmanufacturer emission reduction, retailer emission reduction, and ESCO emission reductionby using Stackelberg game models. The joint decisions of operation, finance, and environment were obtained by using the backward induction approach. The impacts of key parameters were analyzed, such as the retailer's initial capital amount and the decision-makers' risk aversion degree on the low carbon supply chain operation. Our results show that the optimal carbon emission reduction mode for the manufacturer is changed as the retailer's initial capital amount changes. Carbon emission reduction by the ESCO (retailer) becomes the dominant strategy for both the economy and environment when the cost advantage (cash investment ratio) of the ESCO (retailer) carbon emission reduction mode is sufficiently high (low). Overall, decision-makers' risk aversion is detrimental to both the economic and environmental developments of the supply chain. We also designed contracts to realize the coordination of risk-neutral, risk-averse, capital-adequate, and capital-constrained low-carbon supply chains. These results give guidance for decision-makers to better manage the low-carbon supply chain in the context of fully considering the influential factors of risk aversion and capital constraint.

This study sets up an indoor evacuation model based on the social force and dynamic mechanics. First, social forces were formulated in the Eulerian coordinate system, seismic force that excites on pedestrians in a multi-story building is derived from structural acceleration, and an evacuation criterion is given based on above forces. Second, a simulation was performed through VB programming, which accounts for the situation that people evacuate from a walkway. Parameters of the social force model are modified in order to estimate pedestrians' acceleration in concerned situation. Third, structural dynamic responses under a series of ground motion excitations with varying peak values are acquired through finite element analysis to determine pedestrians' seismic forces. Then, pedestrians' ability to escape safely is evaluated according to evacuation criterion. Results show that seismic force would increase when pedestrian located on higher floor or ground excitation is of more dramatic level. Additionally, the possibility of survival is likely minimized as long as seismic force is larger than social force. This proposed model is capable of describing the effects of environment on human behavior during earthquake evacuation.

We report here that caffeine markedly improved high fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice resulting in a 10-fold increase in circulating IL-6 levels, leading to STAT3 activation in the liver. Interestingly, the expression of IL-6 mRNA was not increased in the liver, but increased substantially in the muscles of caffeine-treated mice. Caffeine was found to stimulate IL-6 production in cultured myotubes but not in hepatocytes, adipocytes, or macrophages. The inhibition of p38/MAPK abrogated caffeine-induced IL-6 production in muscle cells. Caffeine failed to improve NAFLD in IL-6 and hepatocytespecific STAT3 knockout mice, indicating that the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is vital for the hepatoprotective effects of caffeine in NAFLD. The possibility that IL-6/STAT3-mediated hepatic autophagosome induction and hepatocytic oxygen consumption are involved in the anti-NAFLD effects of caffeine cannot be excluded, based on the findings presented here. Our results reveal that caffeine ameliorates NAFLD via crosstalk between muscle IL 6 production and liver STAT3 activation.

The results showed that the packing ratio of PIN/DM-beta-CD complex and PIN/TM-beta-CD complex was 1:1. The water solubility of PIN respectively increased 817 times and 575 times in the inclusion complex with DM-beta-CD and TM-beta-CD. Molecular docking showed the pinocembrin entered from the large end of the DM-beta-CD molecule and penetrated through the cavity. The A and B rings of the PIN were respectively located at the big and small ends of the cyclodextrin molecule. For the TM-beta-CD, only A and C rings of the PIN entered cavity of cyclodextrin.

In this study, our questions were: (1) what are the differences in engineering effects between cushions and shrubs in alpine ecosystems in southwestern China? (2) what are the differences in their influences on the attributes of alpine plant communities? and (3) can we detect the effects of changes in environmental stress with elevation on the engineering effects of cushions and shrubs? Study Site Three plant communities along an elevational gradient on Baima Snow Mountain, SW China. Methods Field measurements were carried out to assess effects of cushion (Arenaria polytrichoides) and shrub (Rhododendron rupicola) species on soil temperature, soil nutrient and water availabilities, the species richness of co-existing vascular species and their abundance, above-ground production and the percentages of grazed individuals. Results Shrub and cushion species modify micro-environmental conditions, especially at higher elevations, but in different ways. Grazing pressures are highest for plants in the surroundings, followed by within cushions, and finally under shrubs. This indicates that both cushion and shrub species can protect beneficiary species from grazing by livestock. The presence of cushion plants increased species richness, abundance and above-ground production in the higher community but not in the middle and lower communities. However, the presence of shrubs consistently increased those measurements across the elevational gradient. In addition, some species exclusively and some others preferentially occur within cushions or beneath shrubs. Conclusion The results clearly suggest that alpine cushion and shrub species in the Hengduan Mountains both act as ecosystem engineers and contribute positively to community attributes. However, their engineering effects vary with environmental stresses. Cushions could facilitate other species under severe abiotic stress, but showed much weaker or even competitive effects in benign conditions; shrubs' facilitation may remain consistently strong under different stresses.

The stem of T. resinus sp. nov. is very small, only ca. 1 cm in diameter, and is characterised by the bi-zoned pith, pith cells typically vertically elongated, ectophloic siphonostele, primary xylem mesarch and 6-8 tracheid thick, a mass of sclerenchymatous cells in the adaxial concavity of the leaf trace and an arch-shaped secretory cell band surrounding the adaxial side of the leaf trace. The stem is compared with the member of Osmundales and is assigned into the genus Tiania of the extinct family Guaireaceae, where it represents the smallest member of the Guiariaceae. Distinctions from Tiania yunnanense include no sclerenchymatous and secretory cells in the primary xylem and the secretory cells in the cortex distributing around the adaxial side of the leaf trace and lead to the establishment of Tiania resinus sp. nov. T. resinus together with the three other species from three genera osmundalean trunk/stem have now been reported from the Upper Permian of eastern Yunnan and western Guizhou, southwestern China.

This refers to the electric dynamics in charged particles as well as the crystal growth for real metal particles, but it is still opening in experimental observations and interpretations. To this end, we performed an in-situ electron-beam irradiation study using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on the Au nanocrystals that freely stand on the nitride boron nanotube (BNNT). Au nanocrystalline particles with sizes of 2-4 nm were prepared by a well-controlled sputtering method to stand on the BNNT surface without chemical bonding interactions. Au nanoparticles presented the surface atomic disorder, diffusion phenomena with continuous electron-beam irradiation, and further, the long-range motion that contains mainly the three stages: charging, activation, and adjacence, which are followed by final crystal growth. Firstly, the growth process undergoes the lattice diffusion and subsequently the surface-dominated diffusion mechanism. These abnormal phenomena and observations, which are fundamentally distinct from classic cases and previous reports, are mainly due to the overcharging of Au nanoparticle that produces a surface activation state in terms of high-energy plasma. This work therefore brings about new observations for both a single and dual-nanocrystals system, as well as new insights in understanding the resulting dynamics behaviors.

Here, we improved the Jayaweera-Mikkelsen (JM) model through multiplying the concentration of aqueous NH3 in ponded water by an activity coefficient that was determined based on high-frequency flux observations at Jingzhou station in Central China. We found that the improved JM model could reproduce the dynamics of observed NH3 flux (R-2=0.83, n=228, P<0.001), while the original JM model without the consideration of activity of aqueous NH3 overstated NH3 flux by 54% during the periods of fertilization and pesticide application. The validity of the improved JM model was supported by a mass-balance-based indirect estimate at Jingzhou station and the independent flux observations from the other five stations across China. The NH3 volatilization losses that were further simulated by the improved JM model forced by actual wind speed were in general a half less than previous chamber-based estimates at six stations. Difference in wind speed between the inside and outside of the chamber and insufficient sampling frequency were identified as the primary and secondary causes for the overestimation in chamber-based estimations, respectively. Together, our findings suggest that an in-depth understanding of NH3 transfer process and its robust representation in models are critical for developing regional emission inventories and practical mitigation strategies of NH3.

Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the urban agglomeration pattern and process of Kunming-Yuxi driven by recent political and economic decisions, as well as topographic factors. Methods We used multi-temporal Landsat imagery to create land cover maps and detect land cover changes from 2000 to 2015. The spatial trend surface analysis and lacunarity index were used to quantify the homogenization process of urbanization between Kunming and Yuxi. Results Land cover maps showed that built-up area increased remarkably reaching about 13% of the total area in 2015, and agricultural land declined from 12.2% in 2000 to 6.7% in 2015. Moreover, more than 90% of urban areas are located in flat areas. Spatial trends revealed the agglomeration of Kunming and Yuxi city. The lacunarity analysis also indicated that the homogeneity of built-up space increased resulting in increased connectivity of the cities. Conclusions Spatial trends and lacunarity analyses support the finding that moderate urban homogenization and agglomeration formation took place during the past 15 years. The "Integration of urban agglomeration of Kunming and Yuxi cities" agreement signed by the governments of the two cities in 2011, along with other similar policies, has contributed to the urban expansion. Moreover, because of the rough topography of Yunnan Plateau, the urban growth has also been shaped by topographic patterns.

However, the socioeconomic factors affecting energy-related PM2.5 emissions are indistinct. Therefore, this study first explored the change in PM2.5 emissions over time in China from 1995 to 2012. Then the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model was adopted for quantitatively revealing the mechanisms of various factors on energy-related PM2.5 emissions. Finally, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis was adopted to examine whether an EKC relationship between affluence and energy-related PM2.5 emissions is present from a multiscale perspective. The results showed that energy-related PM2.5 emissions in most regions showed an increasing trend over the study period. The influences of the increase in population, energy intensity, and energy use mix on energy-related PM2.5 emissions were positive and heterogeneous, and population scale was the major driving force of energy-related PM2.5 emissions. The effects of the increase in the urbanization level and the proportion of tertiary industry increased value to GDP on energy-related PM2.5 emissions varied from area to area. An inverse U-shape EKC relationship for energy-related PM2.5 emissions was not verified except for eastern China. The conclusions are valuable for reducing PM2.5 emissions without affecting China's economic development.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Chinese listed firms; corporate charitable giving; corporate performance	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; PHILANTHROPY	We examined whether corporate charitable giving (CCG) in China benefits corporate performance (CP) in terms of sales growth (SG), return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and Tobin's Q (TQ), and revealed several findings. First, testing shows variation in the impact of CCG on CP. Whereas the ratio of corporate charitable giving (RCCG) to total sales revenue does not significantly enhance SG, ROA, and ROE, it is positively related to TQ. Second, the positive relationship between RCCG and TQ originates from non-state-owned firms (NSOFs) rather than state-owned firms (SOFs). Third, Chinese firms may use CCG as traditional philanthropy to enhance long-term performance instead of strategically using it to generate short-term performance. Lastly, an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between RCCG and TQ, especially for NSOFs.

Urban agglomerations in developing countries like China, although have the same characteristics as the developed countries because of globalization, often show a more different and dynamic process. Urban agglomerations in China are generally dominated and planned as a mode of organizing and improving urbanization by the Chinese government; however, in different regions, urban agglomeration has different trajectories based on a different historical and geographical context. The paper applies a new social theory, production of space, into explaining the development and governance of urban agglomeration in China, which is effective and meaningful to help understand the developmental process of urban agglomeration and urbanization. The theory of spatial production focuses on the relation between society and space, in which 'society' has a broad meaning and can be divided into three factors or parts: power, capital, and class. This paper chooses YRD (the Yangtze River Delta) as a typical case and designs a simple index system to reflect the influences of these three factors on urban agglomeration. The governance of urban agglomeration will be indicated by national or regional policies analysis. According to such a synthesis method of index assessment, GIS (Geographic Information System), and policies analysis, we find Chinese urban agglomeration is a capital-intensive region, and the national policies tend to regard it as an intensive investment object. Planning and governance from top-down power have more influence than the market in the evolving process of urban agglomeration. There is a contradiction between spatial production and people-oriented urbanization, with the latter more important than the former, but China's urbanization often emphasizes the former.

However, little is known about the spatiotemporal organization at the elementary level. Here, we developed Orai1-tethered or palmitoylated biosensor GCaMP6f to report subplasmalemmal Ca2+ signals. We visualized spontaneous discrete and long-lasting transients ('Ca2+ glows') arising from STIM1-Orai1 in invading melanoma cells. Ca2+ glows occurred preferentially in single invadopodia and at sites near the cell periphery under resting conditions. Re-addition of external Ca2+ after store depletion elicited spatially synchronous Ca2+ glows, followed by high-rate discharge of asynchronous local events. Knockout of STIM1 or expression of the dominant-negative Orai1-E106A mutant markedly decreased Ca2+ glow frequency, diminished global SOCE and attenuated invadopodial formation. Functionally, invadopodial Ca2+ glows provided high Ca2+ microdomains to locally activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Pyk2 (also known as PTK2B), which initiates the SOCE-Pyk2-Src signaling cascade required for invasion. Overall, the discovery of elemental Ca2+ signals of SOCE not only unveils a previously unappreciated gating mode of STIM1-Orai1 channels in situ, but also underscores a critical role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOCE in orchestrating complex cell behaviors such as invasion.

We here integrate analyses of multiple genomic markers, including mitochondrial (mt) genomes, Y-chromosomes, and autosomes of 54 golden monkey individuals from all three geographic populations (SG, QL, and SNJ). Our results reveal contrasting population structures. Mt analyses suggest a division of golden monkeys into five lineages: one in SNJ, two in SG, and two in QL. One of the SG lineages (a mixed SG/QL lineage) is basal to all other lineages. In contrast, autosomal analyses place SNJ as the most basal lineage and identify one QL and three SG lineages. Notably, Y-chromosome analyses bear features similar to mt analyses in placing the SG/QL-mixed lineage as the first diverging lineage and dividing SG into two lineages, while resembling autosomal analyses in identifying one QL lineage. We further find bidirectional gene flow among all three populations at autosomal loci, while asymmetric gene flow is suggested at mt genomes and Y-chromosomes. We propose that different population structures and gene flow scenarios are the result of sex-linked differences in the dispersal pattern of R. roxellana. Moreover, our demographic simulation analyses support an origin hypothesis suggesting that the ancestral R. roxellana population was once widespread and then divided into SNJ and non-SNJ (SG and QL) populations. This differs from previous mt-based mono-origin (SG is the source population) and multiorigin (SG is a fusion of QL and SNJ) hypotheses. We provide a detailed and refined scenario for the origin and population history of this endangered primate species, which has a broader significance for Chinese biogeography. In addition, this study highlights the importance to investigate multiple genomic markers with different modes of inheritance to trace the complete evolutionary history of a species, especially for those exhibiting differential or mixed patterns of sex dispersal.

Three-dimensional interstellar dust reddening maps of the Galactic plane	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						dust, extinction; ISM: structure; Galaxy: structure	LAMOST SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; EXTINCTION MAP; SKY SURVEY; 3D; ANTICENTRE; PARAMETERS; PHOTOMETRY; SELECTION; 2MASS; SDSS	We present new three-dimensional (3D) interstellar dust reddening maps of the Galactic plane in three colours, E(G - K-S), E(G(BP) - G(RP)), and E(H - K-S). The maps have a spatial angular resolution of 6 arcmin and covers over 7000 deg(2) of the Galactic plane for Galactic longitude 0 degrees < l < 360 degrees and latitude vertical bar b vertical bar < 10 degrees. The maps are constructed from robust parallax estimates from the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) combined with the high-quality optical photometry from the Gaia DR2 and the infrared photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer survey. We estimate the colour excesses, E(G - K-S), E(G(BP) - G(RP)), and E(H - K-S), of over 56 million stars with the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest regression, using a training data set constructed from the large-scale spectroscopic surveys, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration, and Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. The results reveal the large-scale dust distribution in the Galactic disc, showing a number of features consistent with the earlier studies. The Galactic dust disc is clearly warped and show complex structures possibly spatially associated with the Sagittarius, Local, and Perseus arms. We also provide the empirical extinction coefficients for the Gaia photometry that can be used to convert the colour excesses presented here to the line-of-sight extinction values in the Gaia photometric bands.

Classification of large-scale stellar spectra based on deep convolutional neural network	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; techniques: spectroscopic; astronomical data bases: miscellaneous; stars: statistics	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; FEATURE-SELECTION; OBJECT DETECTION; GAIA; RECOGNITION	Classification of stellar spectra from voluminous spectra is a very important and challenging task. In order to better classify stellar spectra, inspired by the principle of deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose a supervised algorithm for stellar spectra classification based on 1D stellar spectra convolutional neural network (1D SSCNN). In 1D SSCNN, we modify the traditional 2D convolutional neural network into 1 D network to adapt to the spectral classification. On the basis of using convolution algorithm, the spectral features are extracted and used for classification. We first use the stellar spectra data to train a ID SSCNN to obtain a well-trained model, and then we apply the well-trained model to classify the unknown spectra. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, we apply ID SSCNN to classify three spectral types: F-type spectra, G-type spectra, and K-type spectra and 10 subclasses of K-type spectra: A0-type, A5-type, F0-type, F5-type, G0-type, G5-type, K0-type, K5-type, M0-type, and M5-type spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our 1D SSCNN algorithm obtain higher classification accuracy compared with support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN).	[Liu, W.; Zhu, M.; Dai, C.; Tian, H.

The objective of this study was to examine links among the soil microorganisms, enzyme activities, and soil carbon (C), N, and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry in a subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) plantation after continuous N fertilization for 13years.MethodsThis study was performed in 25-year-old fir plantation along a fertilization gradient (0, 60, 120, and 240kgNha(-1)yr.(-1)), designated as N0, N1, N2, and N3, respectively. Soil microbial properties, including the microbial community composition, as revealed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and soil enzyme activities (i.e., sucrase, urease and catalase) were measured, and soil elemental stoichiometry was calculated based on soil C, N, and P concentrations. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to determine the relationship between soil C:N:P stoichiometry and soil microbial properties.ResultsCompared with the control (N0), N fertilization decreased the total PLFAs (-12.20%), bacteria (-14.33%), fungi (-12.97%), and actinomycetes (-17.11%) on average. Sucrase, urease and catalase activities were enhanced by low and middle levels of N (N1 and N2), but not with high level of N (N3). Long-term N fertilization decreased soil pH, C to N ratio (C/N), and C to P ratio (C/P), while increased soil C, N and N to P ratio (N/P). The RDA identified the first two axes of soil stoichiometry variation that explained 20.4% of the variation at the soil depth of 0-20cm, 28.6% at 20-40cm and 49.9% at 40-60cm in PLFAs biomarkers and enzymes, respectively. Significant correlations between soil stoichiometry (soil N/P and C/P ratio) and soil microbial properties were found in this study.ConclusionsThese observations suggested that long-term N fertilization influenced soil microbial community composition and enzyme activities by changing the soil C/P and N/P ratios. Future studies are needed to consider the coupling relationships between soil microbial community composition, enzyme activities and elemental stoichiometry in different ecosystems under future climatic change.

Although Gastrochilus is a small genus, the generic and interspecific relationships of it are still not well understood. Here, we present a molecular study using sequence data from nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and four plastid DNA regions (matK, psbA-trnH, psbM-trnD, trnL-F) to clarify these relationships. Our results indicated that Gastrochilus is monophyletic and subdivided into five clades. Haraella is nested in Pomatocalpa, and together they are sister to Gastrochilus. Five morphological characters (epichile hairs, stem type, leaf size, dorsal sepal size and presence of leaf spots) agree well with the molecular phylogenetic trees and can be used to subdivide Gastrochilus. Two new species are separated from G. calceolaris, and the status of the confused species G. somai and G. fuscopunctatus is clarified as a distinct species. The molecular phylogenetic trees and evaluation of characters indicate that shifts in pollination system in Gastrochilus have occurred independently at least three times.

Thus the development of highly selective and sensitive fluorescent probes is essential to detect HSO3- in living cells. In this work, we report the synthesis and analysis of a ratiometric fluorescent probe for selective detection of HSO3- based on the 1,4-nucleophilic addition reaction with the carbazole as an electron donor (D) and aldehyde group as an electron acceptor (A). The addition of HSO3- and other ions to our probe can be observed by UV vis and fluorescence spectrometry. Our investigation proved that the probe is highly selective and sensitive for HSO3- and ratiometric changes. Moreover, the probe has good cell permeability and was successfully applied to the detection of exogenous HSO3- in Hela cells and C. elegans.

In this study, we describe new fruit fossils of Rosoideae, including Fragaria achenes and Rubus endocarps, from the late Pliocene of northwestern Yunnan, Southwest China. These fossils add new accounts to the fossil archive of Rosoideae and provide the first fossil record of Fragaria in East Asia. The new fossil findings provide a historical backdrop for the modern diversity and distribution of the subfamily in northwestern Yunnan, a topographically complex area accommodating a high diversity for many plant groups. Our Rubus fossils, in combination with other nearby coeval occurrences of the genus, suggest that Rubus was already establishing its modern diversity in northwestern Yunnan during the late Pliocene. This finding enriches our knowledge of the post-Neogene diversification of flowering plants in northwestern Yunnan, which is thought to be largely driven by dramatic mountain uplifts and environmental complications associated with the southeastern extension of the Tibetan Plateau.

The ore occurs as laminated or lenticular units in skarns, distributed in the contact zone between the Jubuzhari complex intrusions and carbonate strata of the Mengla Formation. Intrusions associated with the two ore blocks are granodiorite, granodiorite porphyry, and granite porphyry of 62.4 +/- 1.2 Ma, 62.6 +/- 0.6 Ma, and 63.7 +/- 1.0 Ma by zircon U-Pb age dating. Molybdenite Re-Os analyses yield an isochron age of 59.0 +/- 1.7 Ma, with a MSWD of 1.6. Comparable isotopic ages between the intrusions and mineralization indicate that they are genetically related, and occurred during or shortly before the main stage of the Indian-Asian continental collision. Granodiorites have SiO2 content of 62.0-69.1 wt%; Al2O3 content of 15.1-15.3 wt%; total alkali concentration (K2O+Na2O) of 6.63-7.46 wt% and vary in terms of the differentiation index (DI = 67-78). Rocks from the granodiorite porphyry and granite porphyry are characterized by high SiO2 contents (72.3-74.0 wt%; 74.8-75.8 wt%) and DI (89-90; 93-94). Contents of CaO, Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, P2O5, TiO2 of granodiorite, granodiorite porphyry and granite porphyry show negative correlations with SiO2. Samples from the granite porphyry have the most negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.35-0.36), which are lower than the granodiorite porphyry and granodiorite (delta Eu = 0.46-0.55 and 0.46-0.66). All the rocks are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (Rb, Ba, Pb, K and Th) and depleted in high-field-strength elements (Ta, Ti and Nb). The granodiorites have zircon epsilon(Hf(t)) values from +2.5 to +8.4, while epsilon(Hf(t)) values of the granodiorite porphyries and granite porphyries range from -6.3 to + 6.8, and +1.8 to +6.9, respectively. These data suggest that the three types of intrusions are genetically related, and the less evolved granodiorites are I-type granites that were derived from a mantle-crust mixed source. The granodiorite porphyries and granite porphyries were strongly fractionated, and most likely derived from the melts represented by granodiorites through fractional crystallization of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, ilmenite, titanite, apatite, and zircon. Zircon trace elements (average Delta FMQ values of granodiorites, granodiorite porphyries, granite porphyries are 0.15, -0.07 and 0.25, respectively) indicate that the Lietinggang-Leqingla magmas were weakly oxidized to moderately reduced. The involvement of mantle materials and medium oxygen fugacity controlled the Fe-Cu mineralization, while the contribution of ancient crustal end-member and strongly fractional crystallization caused the Pb-Zn mineralization of the Lietinggang-Leqingla deposit. Combined with previously published data, we suggest that the Fe-Cu-Pb-Zn fertilities of magmas in the central Lhasa subterrane and their metal series were not only influenced by magma sources, but also by the evolution degree (fractional crystallization) and oxidation state of the magmas.

We analysed the Sino-German Urumqi lambda 6 cm survey and the Effelsberg lambda 11 cm and lambda 21 cm surveys to identify radio emission from HESS J1912+101 to clarify the question of a supernova origin. We find a partial shell of excessive polarisation at lambda 6 cm at the periphery of HESS J1912+101. At lambda 11 cm, its polarised emission is faint and suffers from depolarisation, while at lambda 21 cm, no related polarisation is seen. We could not separate the shell's total intensity signal from the confusing intense diffuse emission from the inner Galactic plane. However, a high percentage of polarisation in the shell's synchrotron emission is indicated. Our results support earlier suggestions that HESS J1912+101 is an old supernova remnant. The synchrotron emission is highly polarised, which is typical for evolved supernova remnants with low surface brightness.

Here we present molecular line and continuum observations toward the massive core G192.16-3.84 with the Submillimeter Array. (CO)-O-18(2-1) and HCO+(3-2) lines show pronounced blue profiles, indicating gas infalling in this region. This is the first time that infall motion has been reported in the G192.16-3.84 core. Two-layer model fitting gives infall velocities of 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.8 +/- 0.1 km s(-1). Assuming that the cloud core follows a power-law density profile (rho proportional to r(1.)(5)), the corresponding mass infall rates are (4.7 +/- 1.7)x10(-3) and (6.6 +/- 2.1)x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1) for (CO)-O-18(2-1) and HCO+(3-2), respectively. The derived infall rates are in agreement with the turbulent core model and those in other high-mass star-forming regions, suggesting that high accretion rate is a general requirement for forming a massive star.

They exhibit a high optical absorption coefficient and strong photoconductive property in the ultraviolet and visible regions. Therefore, they have been found to have many potential applications, such as gas sensors, resistors, photodetectors, photocatalysts, and solar cells. However, the existing preparation methods for SnS2 QDs are complicated and require a high temperature and high pressure environments; hence they are unsuitable for large-scale industrial production. An effective method for the preparation of monodispersed SnS2 QDs at normal temperature and pressure will be discussed in this paper. The method is facile, green, and low-cost. In this work, the structure, morphology, optical, electrical, and photoelectric properties of SnS2 QDs are studied. The synthesized SnS2 QDs are homogeneous in size and exhibit good photoelectric performance. A photoelectric detector based on the SnS2 QDs is fabricated and its J-V and C-V characteristics are also studied.

A tentaculitid assemblage is described herein from the Nagaoling Formation spanning the Lochkovian-Pragian boundary in Nanning, South China. Six new species are recognised: Tentaculitesbrevitenui n. sp., Lonchidium cylicus n. sp., Bicingulites nanningensis n. sp., Odessites aurisites n. sp., O. nahongensis n. sp. and Volynites nagaolingensis n. sp. are diagnosed. Two species Podolites sp. and Seretites sp. and one population Uniconus spp. are described in open nomenclature. All above tentaculitid genera can be detected in the Silurian strata from Sweden. The tentaculitids from South China allow transitional skeletal characters between benthic and planktonic tentaculitoids to be described, including conch size, conch wall thickness, septum number and the relationship between external and internal wall sculptures. The fossil assemblage, sedimentary rocks and taphonomic characters indicate that tentaculitids of Nagaoling Formation in South China were deposited in an outer shelf region with weak hydrodynamic condition.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements disclosed that all Pr3+ doped samples are single phase with the crystal structure of diphosphate NaAlP2O7 host. The fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry as well as photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out at room temperature. NaAlP2O7:Pr(3+ )polycrystal exhibits a red emission with dominant peak at 663 nm under the visible blue light irradiation. The optimum dopant concentration of Pr3+ is 9%. The concentration quenching mechanism, CIE chromaticity coordinate and IQE were also present in this paper.

Semiparametric inference for the dominance index under the density ratio model	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Bootstrap; Empirical likelihood; Multiple sample; Quantile; Stochastic dominance	EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD; STOCHASTIC-DOMINANCE; TESTS	An important and often discussed research problem in statistics is how to compare several populations; examples arise in medical science, engineering, finance and other fields. Often population means or medians are compared. However, one population may have a higher mean income, for example, because of a small number of super-rich individuals; the mean therefore may not reflect the wealth of the general population. Instead, an index of the degree of stochastic dominance of one population over another would better reflect their relative wealth. Currently, we can estimate such an index under restrictive conditions, but there is no generic estimator with a known asymptotic distribution. In this paper, we suggest linking the populations via the density ratio model. Under this model, we develop an empirical likelihood estimator and establish its asymptotic normality. In addition, we improve the estimation efficiency by examining the similarities between the populations. Furthermore, we provide a valid bootstrap method for hypothesis testing and the construction of confidence intervals. Simulation experiments show that the proposed estimator substantially improves the estimation efficiency and power of the test, and leads to confidence intervals with satisfactorily precise coverage probabilities. It is also robust with respect to mild model misspecification. Two examples are given to demonstrate the usefulness of both the method and the concept.	[Zhuang, W.

There is a lack of genomic information on this species, which can provide valuable resource for conservation biology and phylogenetic studies on hornbill birds. Here we first characterized the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of R. undulatus by next-generation sequencing and conducted phylogenomic analysis of hornbill species with mitogenome sequences available. The complete mitogenome of R. undulatus was 17,842bp in length and incorporated 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and 1 control region (D-loop). The overall nucleotide composition of this mitogenome was 30.3% A, 22.4% T, 32.6% C, and 14.7% G, with AT content of 52.7%. Phylogenomic analysis using mitogenomes of eight hornbill birds showed that R. undulatus was more closely related to Penelopides panini and two Aceros species.

However, it is still a great challenge to exactly explore and exploit the local structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective approximation algorithm of hypergraph p-Laplacian and then propose hypergraph p-LapR (HpLapR) to preserve the geometry of the probability distribution. In particular, hypergraph is a generalization of a standard graph while hypergraph p-Laplacian is a nonlinear generalization of the standard graph Laplacian. The proposed HpLapR shows great potential to exploit the local structures. We integrate HpLapR with logistic regression for remote sensing image recognition. Experiments on UC-Merced data set demonstrate that the proposed HpLapR has superior performance compared with several popular MR methods including LapR and HLapR.

Phylogenetic and biochemical analysis suggested that it should represent a new species of the genus Pseudaminobacter in the family Phyllobacteriaceae. The 16S rRNA gene of CB3(T) shared the highest sequence similarities to those of the type strains Pseudaminobacter defluvii THI 051(T) (97.8 % identity) and Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans BN12(T) (97.4 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness values of CB3(T) with respect to strains belonging to the genus Pseudaminobacter were less than 70 %. The fatty acid profile of CB3(T) consisted of C-16:0, cyclo-C-19:0 omega 8c and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) as major components. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The DNA G+C content was 61.4 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain CB3(T) was distinct from previously described Pseudaminobacter species. Therefore, we propose that strain CB3(T) represents a novel species of the genus Pseudaminobacter, Pseudaminobacter arsenicus sp. nov., strain CB3(T) (=CCTCC AB2016116(T)=KCTC 52625(T)) is designated as the type strain.

Here, we combined field monitoring with a multi-generation common garden approach to study the dynamics of DNA methylation variation in invasive Chinese populations of the clonal alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides). Using AFLP and MSAP markers, we found little variation in DNA sequence but substantial epigenetic population differentiation. In the field, these differences remained stable across multiple years, whereas in a common environment they were maintained at first but then progressively eroded. However, some epigenetic differentiation remained even after 10 asexual generations. Our data indicate that epigenetic variation in alligator weed most likely results from a combination of environmental induction and spontaneous epimutation, and that much of it is neither rapidly reversible (phenotypic plasticity) nor long-term stable, but instead displays an intermediate level of stability. Such transient epigenetic stability could be a beneficial mechanism in novel and heterogeneous environments, particularly in a genetically impoverished invader.

A rat model of arthritis was induced with type II collagen. Arthritic rats were treated with curculigoside (50 mg/kg) and blood samples were collected to determine serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17A. Furthermore, indices of the thymus and spleen were determined. The anti-proliferative effects of curculigoside were detected with Cell Counting kit-8 assays in rheumatoid arthritis-derived fibroblast-like synoviocyte MH7A cells. In addition, expression levels of Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, nuclear factor (NF)-B p65 and its inhibitor (IB) were determined by western blotting. The results revealed that curculigoside inhibited paw swelling and arthritis scores in type II collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats. Additionally, curculigoside decreased serum levels of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17A in CIA rats. Curculigoside also significantly inhibited MH7A cell proliferation in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment downregulated the expression of JAK1, JAK3 and STAT3, and upregulated cytosolic nuclear factor (NF)-B p65 and IB. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that curculigoside exhibited significant anti-arthritic effects in vivo and in vitro, and the molecular mechanism may be associated with the JAK/STAT/NF-B signaling pathway.

Crystalline structure, morphology, surface chemical states and specific surface area were investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and BET techniques, respectively. Sensors fabricated from CdO-Ag-ZnO nanocomposites were made based on indirect heating method, which showed superior sensing properties in detecting different concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast with singular ZnO, gas-sensing experiment results reveal that the addition of CdO and Ag effectively decreases optimum working temperature, increases gas response value and shortens response and recovery time. What's more, other gas-sensing properties including repeatability, sensitivity and long-term stability are also discussed in this research. Particularly, gas sensor based on 10 mol% CdO-Ag-ZnO shows modest gas-sensing performance to VOCs at the operating temperature of 200 degrees C, and its gas response values are 198.63, 156.07, 53.04, 64.23, 183.65 towards 100 ppm formaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, methanol and isopropanol, respectively, indicating it a promising candidate in detecting VOCs. Superior sensing property is mainly ascribed to large specific surface area, special porous surface morphology, unique combination of nanocomposites and good catalytic ability of metallic Ag.

In this paper, we introduce a new mechanism of punishment that the punishment fine can be multiplied if there are several punishers decide to punish a defector, which leads to a low payoff of defector and promotes the level of cooperation. This mechanism can simulate group hunt which is common in natural animal world, for example, in biological system, a pack of animal in which every individual cooperates with each other can hunt a prey which is stronger than an individual inside the pack. This phenomenon can be explained by that the ability of punishment is multiplied by individuals cooperating with each other to carry out the punishment. A pack of wolves can make the process of hunt easier than the hunt implemented by a lone wolf, inspired by which we construct this mechanism of punishment to simulate the group punishment. Interestingly, we find that this mechanism can dramatically promotes the level of cooperation when we compare the simulation result with traditional evolutionary public good game. In order to figure out how our new mechanism of punishment promotes the cooperation, we have drawn several figures below to explain the mechanism. Our work simulates a widely existing phenomenon in biological and social systems and reveals some essential principles in the process of evolution. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, more than 20 relatively diverse genera were assigned into Afrograptidae based on the presence of serrated structures. This has created a series of taxonomic disputes in regard to fossil conchostracans. In this study, serrated microstructures on the growth lines of two species, namely, Eosestheria ovata and E. middendorfii, in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota are reported and described in detail. Our microstructural study shows that these structures are pit-shaped and are actually insertion remains of setae. Such microstructures commonly exist on the growth lines of some extant spinicaudatans. The setae probably served a sensory function. The presence or absence of these setae in extant species of the same genus can be variable and size of the setae of the same species can also be variable. Thus they are not appropriate to be considered as possessing important taxonomic value. Based on this conclusion, the species of the family Afrograptidae are listed in conjunction with the results of our previous study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Constitutive over-expression of OsPT2 may have negative effects on the growth of rice seedlings under high Pi condition. Thus, characterization and utilization of root-specific promoters are critical for genetic breeding. Here, a root-specific promoter (Os03g01700) with a number of specific regulatory elements has been confirmed. Interestingly, cis-regulatory element S449 is significantly enriched in the -1475 similar to -2013 bp and -1077 similar to -1475 bp regions of Os03g01700 promoter. The activities of several deletion derivatives of Os03g01700 promoter were analyzed using both transient expression and genetic transformation system. The results showed that the root-specific cis-acting elements might be present in the - 2013 bp similar to -1475 bp and -1077 bp similar to -561 bp regions of Os03g01700 promoter. To determine the actual effect of root-specific expression of OsPT2, a construction consisting of Os03g01700 promoter and OsPT2 CDS was used to transform rice. Under Pi-sufficient condition, there were a series of symptoms of phosphorus toxicity in the shoots of OsPT2 over-expressing (Ov-OsPT2) seedlings. Under Pi-deficient condition, more soluble Pi was accumulated in the shoots of Ov-OsPT2 seedlings than that in the wild type. Our data provide a candidate root-specific promoter in the breeding of rice with high phosphorus uptake variety.

However, the negative effects on the parasitoid and the strategy of the parasitoid to deal with this disadvantage are still unknown. Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus induces granulocyte apoptosis to suppress immune responses, resulting in an apoptotic haemolymph environment in which immature M. bicoloratus larva develop. Here, we determined the transcriptional profiles of immature M. bicoloratus across five time-points throughout the immature developmental process from egg to third instar. Dynamic gene expression pattern analysis revealed clear rapid changes in gene expression characteristic of each developmental stage, indicating faster sequential unambiguous functional division during development. Combined with the proteome of the host haemolymph, immature parasitoids likely secreted a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase to reduce reactive oxygen species generation by symbiotic bracovirus. These data established a basis for further studies of parasitoid/host interactions and identified a novel positive self-protection mechanism for the parasitoid.

The structures of bioactive molecules, isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the fermentation broth of the strain, were identified as echinosporin (1) and 7-deoxyechinosporin (2) based on extensive spectroscopic analyses. 1 exhibited antifungal activity against four tested root-rot pathogens of Panax notoginseng include Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Alternaria panax, and Phoma herbarum with the MIC value at 64, 64, 32, and 64g/mL, respectively. 2 exhibited antifungal activities against F. oxysporum, F. solani, A. panax, and P. herbarum with the MIC value at 128, 128, 64, and 128g/mL, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, the closest phylogenetic relative of strain YIM PH20520 is Amycolatopsis speibonae JS72(T) (97.69%), so strain YIM PH20520 was identified as Amycolatopsis strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of echinosporin antibiotics isolated from Amycolatopsis strain besides Streptomyces strain and their antifungal activity against four tested root-rot pathogens of the Panax notoginseng. The results provide a reliable evidence for the following related biosynthetic investigations on Amycolatopsis strain YIM PH20520 due to echinosporins antibiotics' unique tricyclic acetal-lactone structures.

However, the relationship between fine tree roots (including absorptive roots and fine transport roots) and forest biomass or fine understory vegetation roots (understory roots) remains poorly understood, which was the main objective of this study. We selected 20 plots in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation forests of the similar ages (23 years old on average) in different areas with various levels of forest biomass in subtropical China to assess the above mentioned relationship. Forest biomass was used as a proxy for soil condition. We found that all fine root biomass of trees and understory vegetation were significantly and negatively correlated with forest biomass. To our surprise, both total Chinese fir fine root biomass (absorptive roots and fine transport roots) and fine transport root biomass showed significant and positive correlations with understory root biomass. These results clearly demonstrate that fine tree root biomass is significantly promoted and increased due to competition from understory vegetation where forest biomass is low.

We collected water and phytoplankton samples at 107 sites in the Dongjiang River in two seasons to assess the impact of the sub-catchments land use composition. The results showed that (1) the forested sub-catchments had higher humic-like Cl (16.45%) and C2 (25.04%) and lower protein-like C3 (22.57%) and C4 (35.95%) than the urbanized and mixed forest-agriculture sub-catchments, while the urbanized sub-catchments showed an inverse trend (4.54%, 15.51%, 33.97% and 45.98%, respectively). (2) A significant variation in the proportion of C1 and C4 between the dry and rainy seasons was recorded in both the forested and the mixed forest-agriculture sub-catchments (p <0.01), but only C4 showed an obvious seasonal variation in the urbanized sub-catchments (p < 0.01); while the DOM composition was mainly related to the proportion of urbanized and forested land year-round (p < 0.01). (3) No significant correlation was found in either season between the DOM composition and the agricultural land proportion (p > 0.05). Our findings indicated that the DOM composition was strongly dependent on the land use composition of the sub-catchments and varied seasonally, but the seasonal variation pattern could be disturbed by human activities in the extensively urbanized catchments. Notably, when considering bioavailability, the higher C4 proportion compared with those in temperate rivers implied a larger amount of CO2 released from subtropical rivers into the atmosphere.

Although MbBV is a known inducer of apoptosis in host hemocytes, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. In this study, we found that expression of cyclophilin A (CypA) was significantly upregulated in Spodoptera litura hemocytes at 6-day post-parasitization. Similar results were reported in High Five cells (Hi5 cells) infected by MbBV, suggesting that the upregulation of CypA is linked to MbBV infection in insect cells. cDNA encoding CypA was cloned from parasitized hemocytes of S. litura, and bioinformatic analyses showed that S. litura CypA belongs to the cyclophilin family of proteins. Overexpression of S. litura CypA in Hi5 cells revealed that the protein promotes MbBV-induced apoptosis in vitro. Conversely, suppression of the expression and activity of CypA protein significantly rescued the apoptotic phenotype observed in MbBV-infected Hi5 cells, suggesting that it plays a key role in this process. MbBV infection also promoted the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of CypA in Hi5 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that MbBV infection upregulates the expression of CypA, which is required for MbBV-mediated apoptosis. Our findings provide insight into the role that CypA plays in insect cellular immune response.

Here, responses of hemp (Cannabis saliva L.) seedlings of the cultivars YM5 and BM to the stress of different concentrations of NaCl and Na2CO3 were investigated to explore the salt tolerance of hemp. Results showed that the plant height, dry weight and root length of YM5 and BM seedlings gradually decreased as the concentration of NaCl or Na2CO3 increased. Although physiological indices such as EC (Electrical conductivity), SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and Pro (Proline) increased as the salt concentration increased, the increase extent was significantly greater in YM5 than in BM. Under the conditions of 100 and 200 mM NaCl, BM had greater dry weight and root length, and lower Pro content than YM5. However, under the stress of 100 and 200 mM Na2CO3, the opposite results were recorded, with the exception for lower chlorophyll content and higher SOD activity in BM than in YM5. These findings indicated that BM had a stronger NaCl tolerance than YM5. Moreover, morphological indices of the two cultivars under Na2CO3 stress were stunted more than under NaCl stress, and the seedlings died when Na2CO3 concentration increased up to 300 mM. Some up-regulation of salt-tolerant genes were observed in the two hemp cultivars, a higher expression under NaCl stress than under Na2CO3 stress, and a higher expression in YM5 than in BM were recorded. Findings from the study indicated that hemp seedling is more sensitive to Na2CO3 stress, and the tolerance of hemp to salt stress varies with salt type and salt concentration, although both cultivars can withstand moderate doses of NaCl and Na2CO3.

Results showed that adding microbial carrier did not affect the growth and biomass components of duckweed. The following features were discovered in the CDW system. First, the NO3--N and TN removal efficiencies were the highest among three systems, reaching 80.02% and 56.42%, respectively. Secondly, Illumina sequencing revealed the highest microbial diversity. Thirdly, a distinct succession of microbial community was observed. Rhodobacter, Bacteria vadinCA02, C39 and Flavobacterium dominated in the start- up stage, and contributed to biofilm formation and pollutants degradation.

We apply the Effective-Range method to match the parameters of the EFT from obtained data on the 1/2+ and 3/2- levels in Neon-31 nuclide. We then obtain predictions for the one-neutron separation energy for the ground 3/2- state and the predicted 1/2+ state. It is shown that the 31Ne has a halo feature with a small separation energy. The neutron radius is also discussed in this paper. Our work provides an applicable approach to analyze nuclei with heavy mass and large deformation.

The oxygen isotope composition of phosphate (delta O-18(p)) in soil is mainly controlled by P source, temperature, the delta O-18(w) of soil water, and biological processes and has been used as a unique tracer for the sources and inter conversion of P pools within soil. Understanding if and how the diurnal variation of the environmental factors affects the delta O-18(p) of soil P pools is thus indispensable to elucidating the biogeochemical cycling of different P pools and to a better use of soil delta O-18(p) as a tracer. Soil samples from the same location with different moisture contents were collected every 3 or 12 h for 7 days for the measurement of the content and oxygen isotope composition of soil water and P pools. The results show that soil temperature, moisture and the delta O-18(w) of soil water had clear diurnal variations, with delta O-18(w) decreasing with increasing soil moisture. However, both the content and delta O-18(p) of different soil P pools did not show a significant diurnal variation. These characteristics indicate that short-term diurnal changes in environmental conditions and biological activities have little effect on the content and delta O-18(p) of soil P pools. Therefore, the diurnal sampling time has no effect on the content and delta O-18(p) of soil P pools. However, the equilibrium delta O-18(p) value represents the complete exchange of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water. Comparisons of the measured values with the equilibrium value could decipher the degree of P recycling by organisms. This study shows that the mean, not the measured (at the sampling time), temperature and delta O-18(w) of soil water should be used to calculate the representative equilibrium delta O-18(p) value of soil to avoid bias.

In this work, a series of molecular imprinted Ag-LaFeO3 nanoparticles (IAL NPs) were synthesized in a microwave-assisted colloidal route. Especially, the one prepared with optimal amount of imprint molecules (IAL-2 NPs) have a response of 24.0 to 5 ppm toluene at the optimum working temperature of 215 degrees C with negligible responses to the other test gases, exhibiting enhanced gas sensing properties for toluene gas at a relatively low working temperature. The improved performance can be attributed to the favorable effect of microwave radiation, the molecular imprinting structure and the sensitization of Ag, which illuminates that IAL-2 NPs is a potential candidate for toluene detection.

Benefitting from the large amount and uniform distribution of oxygen atom, conjugated aromatic nucleus as active electrochemical reaction sites, Tb-MOF anode exhibits good specific capacity and excellent cycle performance. The initial discharge specific capacity reached 627.5 mAh g (1) and -87.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g (1). At the same time, Tb-MOF electrode has an extremely high structural stability, and the capacity retention is maintained at 99.1% even if it is cycled 3000 times at a current density of 0.8 Ag (1).

The as-synthesized RhB-GQDs have few layers configuration with an average size of 4.5 nm and good distribution. The fluorescence quenching approach was applied to the sensing of mercury ions in water. Rodamine B absorb on the surface of RhB-GQDs, and it can prevent RhB-GQDs from contacting with interfering cations. The presence of N atoms reduces the ability of interfering cations to form stable complex with carboxyl groups, and gives the RhB-GQDs good selectivity to mercury ions. In the case of low concentration, the fluorescence quenching efficiency of as-synthesized RhB-GQDs still has a good liner relationship with concentration. Due to the strong affinity of Hg2+ to amino and carboxyl on the surface of RhB-GQDs, the fluorescence of RhB-GQDs is quenched by nonradiative electron transfer between Hg2+ and the excited state of RhB-GQDs. Based on the fluorescence turn off process, the as-synthesized RhB-GQDs can be served as fluorescent platform for the sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ with a detection limit of 0.16 nM.

Cryptochromes (CRYs) are photolyase-like flavoproteins with blue-light receptor function and other functions on circadian clock and migration in animals. Here, we cloned the full-length cDNA of CRY1 and CRY2 in Spodoptera litura (Fabricius, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Sl-CRYs show high similarity to orthologs from other insects, and their conserved regions contain a DNA photolyase domain and a FAD-binding seven domain. The expression levels of both genes were relatively low during the larval stage, which increased during the pupal stage and then peaked at the adult stage. The expression of Sl-CRY1 and Sl-CRY2 showed differences between males and females and between scotophase and photophase. Further, our study demonstrated that copulation has a significant effect on the expression of SlCRYs. More interestingly, the changes in the expression of Sl-CRY1 and Sl-CRY2 due to copulation showed the same trend in both sexes, in which the expression levels of both genes in copulated males and females decreased in the subsequent scotophase after copulation and then increased significantly in the following photophase. Considering the nature of the dramatic changes in reproductive behavior and physiology after copulation in S. litura, we propose that the changes in the expression of Sl-CRYs after copulation could have some function in the reproductive process.

However, how soil C-decomposition enzymes respond to different land use change remains unclear. Here, we conducted a study to explore seasonal variations in C-decomposition enzyme activities including hydrolases (alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and beta-xylosidase) and oxidases (polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase) in woodland, shrubland, cropland, and adjacent uncultivated soils in central China. Soil dissolved organic C (DOC), SOC, labile C (LC), recalcitrant C (RC), soil C recalcitrance index (RIC: RC/SOC ratio), pH, soil moisture, and temperature were also investigated. Both afforested and cropland averaged higher hydrolase and oxidase activities compared with the uncultivated land, with higher levels of enzyme activities in topsoils than deep soils. By comparing with the uncultivated land, higher hydrolytic enzyme activities in afforested soils were mainly attributed to higher DOC and LC contents, whereas higher hydrolase activities in cropland soils were possibly due to lower C:nitrogen (N) ratios and agricultural disturbance (i.e., fertilization and tillage). In contrast, two oxidases activities were the highest in the cropland, which might be attributed to higher RIC and lower C:N ratio. Cropland soils also averaged higher specific enzyme activities (i.e., enzyme activities per unit of SOC) compared with the afforested land, indicating fast C turnover rates in cropland. Seasonal variations in soil enzyme activities were primarily driven by soil temperature and pH. Overall, our results reveal the different underlying mechanisms between hydrolases and oxidases in response to types of land use change.

Synthesis of Benzofuran Derivatives through Cascade Radical Cyclization/Intermolecular Coupling of 2-Azaallyls	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						azaallyl anions; benzofurylethylamine; cascade reactions; radical coupling; radical cyclization	SUPER-ELECTRON-DONORS; CYCLIZATION	Benzofurans are among the most popular structural units in bioactive natural products, however, the synthesis of such structures by radical cyclization cascade reactions is rare. Herein, we report a mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex benzofurylethylamine derivatives through a unique radical cyclization cascade mechanism. Single-electron transfer (SET) from 2-azaallyl anions to 2-iodo aryl allenyl ethers initiates a radical cyclization that is followed by intermolecular radical-radical coupling. This expedient approach enables the synthesis of a range of polycyclic benzofurans that would otherwise be difficult to prepare.

We investigate their use on lensing convergence maps in order to see whether they can provide further insights on the underlying cosmology with respect to the standard second-order statistics, i.e., cosmic shear tomography. To this end, we first present a method to match theoretical predictions with measured MFs taking care of the shape noise, imperfections in the map reconstruction, and inaccurate description of the nonlinearites in the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We validate this method against simulated maps reconstructed from shear fields generated by the MICE simulation. We then perform a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the accuracy on cosmological parameters from a joint MFs and shear tomography analysis. It turns out that MFs are indeed helpful to break the Omega(m)-sigma(8) degeneracy, thus generating a sort of chain reaction leading to an overall increase of the figure of merit.

The current sheet (CS) evolution during the MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD simulation can be divided into four stages. The first stage shows the CS forming and gradually lengthening. Resistive instabilities that disrupt the CS mark the beginning of the second stage. Magnetic islands disappear in the third stage and reappear in the fourth stage. Synthetic images and light curves of the seven Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels, i.e., 94 angstrom, 131 angstrom, 171 angstrom, 193 angstrom, 211 angstrom, 304 angstrom, and 335 angstrom, and the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray are obtained with forward-modeling analysis. The loop-top source and the coronal sources of the soft X-ray are reproduced in forward modeling. The light curves of the seven SDO/AIA channels start to rise once resistive instabilities develop. The light curve of the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray starts to go up when the reconnection rate reaches one of its peaks. Quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) appear twice in the SDO/AIA 171 angstrom, 211 angstrom, and 304 angstrom channels, corresponding to the period of chaotic (re) appearance and CS-guided displacements of the magnetic islands. QPPs appear once in the SDO/AIA 94 angstrom and 335 angstrom channels after the disruption of the CS by resistive instabilities and in the 193 angstrom channel when the chaotic motion of the magnetic islands reappears.

In this study, beta AS gene from P. japonicus (Pj beta AS) was transferred into P. notoginseng cells. Along with Pj beta AS expression in the transgenic cells, the expression levels of several key enzyme genes related to triterpenoid saponins biosynthesis and the content of P. notoginseng saponins were also increased. Two oleanane-type saponins, chikusetsusaponin IV and chikusetsusaponin IVa, contained in P. japonicus were first discovered in transgenic P. notoginseng cells. This study successfully constructed a biosynthetic pathway of oleanane-type saponins in P. notoginseng by introducing just one gene into the species. On the basis of this discovery and previous studies, the common biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoid saponins in Panax genus may be unified to some extent.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Search for Gamma-Ray Emission from the Sun during Solar Minimum with the ARGO-YBJ Experiment	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astroparticle physics; cosmic rays; gamma rays: general; Sun: general	SPECTRUM; DETECTOR	The hadronic interaction of cosmic rays with solar atmosphere can produce high energy gamma-rays. The gamma-ray luminosity is correlated both with the flux of primary cosmic rays and the intensity of the solar magnetic field. The gamma-rays below 200 GeV have been observed by Fermi without any evident energy cutoff. The bright gamma-ray flux above 100 GeV has been detected only during solar minimum. The only available data in the TeV range come from the HAWC observations, however, outside the solar minimum. The ARGO-YBJ data set has been used to search for sub-TeV/TeV gamma-rays from the Sun during the solar minimum from 2008 to 2010, the same time period covered by the Fermi data. A suitable model containing the Sun shadow, solar disk emission, and inverse-Compton emission has been developed, and the chi-square minimization method was used to quantitatively estimate the disk gamma-ray signal. The result shows that no significant gamma-ray signal is detected and upper limits to the gamma-ray flux at 0.3-7 TeV are set at the 95% confidence level. In the low energy range these limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT measurements taken during solar minimum and are compatible with a softening of the gamma-ray spectrum below 1 TeV. They also provide an experimental upper bound to any solar disk emission at TeV energies. Models of dark matter annihilation via long-lived mediators predicting gamma-ray fluxes > 10(-7) GeV cm(-2) s(-1) below 1 TeV are ruled out by the ARGO-YBJ limits.

Herein, we theoretically propose a new inversion-asymmetry topological phase with tunable Rashba effect in a 2D bismuthene monolayer, which is driven by the sublattices half-oxidation (SHO). The nontrivial topology is identified by the SHO induced p-p band inversion at the point, the Z(2) topological number, and the metallic edge states. Interestingly, the SOC opens a band gap as large as 0.26 eV at , which is twice as large as that of the freestanding bismuthene monolayer, revealing a predominant contribution of the orbital filtering effect. Inversion-symmetry breaking leads to a substantial Rashba constant of 11.5 eV angstrom near the valence band top, which is about twice as large as that of the freestanding bismuthene monolayer due to the SHO effect. In particular, the topological insulator-to-topological semimetal phase-transition and the tunable Rashba effect were achieved by exerting a moderate strain. We demonstrate that 3% stretching is the most desirable strain to obtain superior properties. Hexagonal boron nitrogen (h-BN) is proposed to serve as a suitable substrate for SHO-Bi in practical applications. Our findings not only provide a new route to engineering a 2D inversion-asymmetry topological insulator but also represent a significant advance in the exploration of 2D Bi-based topological materials.

We investigated the effect on the microstructure at different hydrothermal times (12h, 18h, 24h, and 30h), and the BET and XPS results revealed that the specific surface area and adsorbed oxygen species were consistent with a microstructure that significantly influences the sensing performance. The gas properties of the Sm2O3-doped ZnO/SmFeO3 microspheres were also investigated. With a hydrothermal time of 24h, the gas sensor exhibited excellent sensing performance for methanol gas. For 5ppm of methanol gas at 195 degrees C, the response reached 119.8 with excellent repeatability and long-term stability in a 30-day test in a relatively high humidity atmosphere (55-75% RH). Even at 1ppm of methanol gas, the response was also higher than 20. Thus, the Sm2O3-doped ZnO/SmFeO3 microspheres can be considered as prospective materials for methanol gas sensors.

Decadal biomass increment in early secondary succession woody ecosystems is increased by CO2 enrichment	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ELEVATED CO2; FOREST PRODUCTIVITY; CARBON ALLOCATION; SOIL CARBON; SWEETGUM PLANTATION; TREE MORTALITY; NITROGEN; GROWTH; RESPONSES; CLIMATE	Increasing atmospheric CO2 stimulates photosynthesis which can increase net primary production (NPP), but at longer timescales may not necessarily increase plant biomass. Here we analyse the four decade-long CO2-enrichment experiments in woody ecosystems that measured total NPP and biomass. CO2 enrichment increased biomass increment by 1.05 +/- 0.26 kg C m(-2) over a full decade, a 29.1 +/- 11.7% stimulation of biomass gain in these early-secondary-succession temperate ecosystems. This response is predictable by combining the CO2 response of NPP (0.16 +/- 0.03 kg C m(-2) y(-1)) and the CO2-independent, linear slope between biomass increment and cumulative NPP (0.55 +/- 0.17). An ensemble of terrestrial ecosystem models fail to predict both terms correctly. Allocation to wood was a driver of across-site, and across-model, response variability and together with CO2-independence of biomass retention highlights the value of understanding drivers of wood allocation under ambient conditions to correctly interpret and predict CO2 responses.

The genetic basis of LP has been investigated in many populations in the world. Iran has a long history of pastoralism and the daily consumption of dairy products; thus, we aim to assess how LP has evolved in the Iranian population. We recruited 400 adult individuals from seven Iranian ethnic groups, from whom we investigated their lactose tolerance and screened the genetic variants in their lactase gene locus.ResultsThe LP frequency distribution ranged from 0 to 29.9% in the seven Iranian ethnic groups with an average value of 9.8%. The variants, -13910*T and -22018*A, were significantly associated with LP phenotype in Iranians. We found no evidence of hard selective sweep for -13910*T and -22018*A in Persians, the largest ethnic group of Iran. The extremely low frequency of -13915*G in the Iranian population challenged the view that LP distribution in Iran resulted from the demic diffusion, especially mediated by the spread of Islam, from the Arabian Peninsula.ConclusionsOur results indicate the distribution of LP in seven ethnic groups across the Iranian plateau. Soft selective sweep rather than hard selective sweep played a substantial role in the evolution of LP in Iranian populations.

Benzaldehyde is a fungistatic factor produced by soil microorganisms that can suppress conidial germination, but the molecular mechanism of this suppression is unknown. In this study, three conidial proteomes of Arthrobotrys oligospora ATCC24927, a nematode-trapping fungus, were obtained, quantified, and compared. Under benzaldehyde fungistatic stress, conidial protein expression profile changed significantly. Screening with a twofold selection criterion revealed 164 up-regulated and 110 down-regulated proteins. 17 proteins related to protein translation were down-regulated and gene transcription analysis suggested that the repression of proteins translation might be one mechanism by which benzaldehyde inhibites conidial germination. Benzaldehyde also resulted in the down-regulation of respiratory chain proteins and mitochondrial processes, as well as the repression of conidial DNA synthesis. In addition, the conidia up-regulated several proteins that enable it to resist benzaldehyde-induced fungistatis, and this was confirmed by a functional assessment of two knockout mutants. This study reveals putative mechanisms by which benzaldehyde causes fungistasis as well as the proteomic response of conidia to benzaldehyde. Significance: Soil fungistasis limits the effect of fungal agents designed to control plant-parasitic nematodes. Benzaldehyde is one of fungistatic factors produced by soil microorganisms that can suppress conidial germination. In this study, we found that conidial protein expression profile changed significantly under benzaldehyde fungistatic stress. This research revealed new mechanistic data that describe how benzaldehyde is responsible for fungiststis by inhibiting conidial germination. Moreover, we also found that conidia can resist benzaldehyde by up-regulating proteins such as benzaldehyde dehydrogenase and heat shock proteins. This study also showed that proteomics methods play important roles in addressing soil fungistatic mechanisms.

Here, a Ti-based MOF (Ti-MOF) with stable Ti-skeleton and hexagonal nut shape is synthesized and selected for LIBs. The Ti-MOF exhibits a specific capacity of the maximum initial discharge capacity of 1590.24 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and it displayed excellent structural reversibility even over 8000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the carboxyl groups act as an electrochemically active site to reversibly bond with Li+, and the Ti octahedron functions as stable skeleton. The porous structure provides channels for the dein-tercalation of Li+, enhancing the contribution of the pseudocapacitive process, but the overall electrochemical rate determining step is still controlled by Li+ diffusion.

We report here the discovery of a new species from Kon Tum plateau of the Truong Son (Annamite) Range of Central Vietnam, which we describe based on morphological and molecular evidence. Molecular phylogeny shows that the new taxon, G. (P.) wenlingae Hu, Cotton & Monastyrskii sp. nov., is sister to G. (P.) daiyuanae Hu, Zhang & Cotton, 2018 plus G. (P.) confucius Hu, Duan & Cotton, 2018. Molecular dating analysis further suggests that this new species diverged from its sister Glade in the Pliocene (similar to 3.5 million years ago). The new taxon constitutes the eighth and southern-most species of the mandarinus group.

The square columnar phases should have 4 molecules in each unit cell and 2 molecules in each cell wall with the c-parameter (intermolecular distance) varying from compound to compound. The UV-vis spectra of these red emissive BTD-based bolaamphiphiles covered almost the whole visible range with a relatively low band gap. Most interestingly, white light with CIE coordinates (0.30, 0.33) was obtained by doping this BTD-based bolaamphiphile with a blue emissive dithiophene bolaamphiphile and yellow-green emissive tetrathiophene bolaamphiphile.

Jaboticabin and Related Polyphenols from Jaboticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) with Anti-inflammatory Activity for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						jaboticaba; Myrciaria cauliflora; Myrtaceae; jaboticabin; depside; COPD	BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; FRUIT; ELLAGITANNINS; COPD; PHENOLICS; PRODUCTS; RISK; PEEL	Myrciaria cauliflora (jaboticaba) is an edible fruit common in Brazil that has been used for treating respiratory diseases, including chronic tonsillitis and asthma. This study explores the distribution of an anti-inflammatory depside, jaboticabin, in different parts of the jaboticaba plant as well as major polyphenols from the wood of jaboticaba, some with biological activity similar to jaboticabin. The peel of the fruit was found to be the major source of jaboticabin. This is the first phytochemical study of the wood of M. cauliflora. The antioxidant-activity-guided fractionation strategy successfully identified 3,3'-dimethylellagic acid-4-O-sulfate from jaboticaba wood. This ellagic acid derivative, in a manner similar to jaboticabin, showed antiradical activity and inhibited the production of the chemokine interleukin-8 after treating the human small airway epithelial cells with cigarette smoke extract. The human intestinal Caco-2 cell studies demonstrated the jaboticabin transport in vitro. The polyphenols, jaboticabin and 3,3'-dimethyellagic acid-4-O-sulfate, from jaboticaba were both found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, thus suggesting the potential use of these compounds or even the fruits themselves for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Thermodynamic performance analyses and optimizations are conducted with 523.15-623.15 K exhaust gas temperature (T-g1). Cyclopentane, cyclohexane, benzene, and toluene are selected as working fluids for high-temperature loop (HTL), whereas R1234ze(E), R600a, R245fa, and R601a are selected as working fluids for low-temperature loop (LTL). The HTL evaporation temperature, condensation temperature, and superheat degree are optimized through a genetic algorithm, and net power output is selected as the objective function. Influences of T-g1 on system net power output, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, HTL evaporation temperature, HTL condensation temperature, HTL superheat degree, exhaust gas temperature at the exit of the HTL evaporator, heat utilization ratio, and exergy destruction rate of the components are analyzed. Results are presented as follows: the net power output is mainly influenced by HTL working fluid. The optimal LTL working fluid is R1234ze(E). The optimal HTL evaporator temperature increases with T-g1 until it reaches the upper limit. The optimal HTL condensation temperature increases initially and later remains unchanged for a cyclopentane system, thus keeping constant for other systems. Saturated cycle is suitable for cyclohexane, benzene, and toluene systems. Superheat cycle improves the net power output for a cyclopentane system when T-g1 is 568.15-623.15 K.

Instead of identifying the maximal number of two propagating waves at fixed frequency !, we introduce a unique labelling of all 5 mode pairs described by the general dispersion relation omega (k), starting from their natural ordering at small wavenumber k. There, the 5 pairs start off as Alfven (A), fast magnetosonic (F), modified electrostatic (M) and electromagnetic O and X branches, and each !. k /branch smoothly connects to large wavenumber resonances or limits. For cold pair plasmas, these 5 branches show avoided crossings, which become true crossings at exactly parallel or perpendicular orientation. Only for those orientations, we find a changed connectivity between small and large wavenumber behaviour. Analysing phase and group diagrams for all 5 wave modes, distinctly different from the Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis representation, reveals the true anisotropy of the A, M and O branches.

In this paper, a carbon monoxide sensor based on Pt decorated SnO2 nanoparticles is obtained by a hydrothermal method. Abundant characterization methods are used to analyze the structure, morphology, chemical state and specific surface area of the as-prepared compounds. The pure SnO2 sensor exhibits inferior operating temperature and low response for the detection of carbon monoxide. In contrast, the observed response of the sensor with the as-synthesized 1.5mol% Pt decorated SnO2 is up to 610.45 at a low operating temperature of 80 degrees C, and the response value is about three times higher than that of SnO2 sensor. The significantly improved performance is thoroughly explained in terms of the adsorption-desorption mechanism, and the chemical sensitization and electronic sensitization of Pt.

Recent work has shown that apparently simple Faraday rotation measure spectra can be generated by complex sources. This is true even when the distribution of rotation measures in the complex source greatly exceeds the errors associated with a single component fit to the peak of the Faraday spectrum. We present a convolutional neural network that can differentiate between simple Faraday thin spectra and those that contain multiple (two) Faraday thin sources. We demonstrate that this network, trained for the upcoming Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism early science observations, can identify two component sources 99 per cent of the time, provided that the sources are separated in Faraday depth by >10 per cent of the full width at half-maximum of the Faraday point spread function, the polarized flux ratio of the sources is >0.1, and that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the primary component is >5. With this S/N cut-off, the false positive rate (simple sources misclassified as complex) is <0.3 per cent. Work is ongoing to include Faraday thick sources in the training and testing of the convolutional neural network.

In the model, three assumptions are made: (i) gamma-ray photons are mainly produced in a finite region outside the light cylinder, (ii) relativistic electrons in the finite region satisfy the distribution of a power law with an exponential cut-off, and (iii) inverse Compton process is the main mechanism of pulsed gamma-rays production. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to look for best fits of inclination angle and view angle, which are two important model parameters after other model parameters are constrained. Our calculating results can reproduce the observed LCs and phase-averaged spectra of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J1939+2134, and PSR J1744-1134 well.

As a reference for comparison, we present an analysis of cloud cover, 200-hPa wind speed, precipitable water vapour, vertical wind velocity, and aerosol index, for 15 observatory sites around theworld. Our study employs ERA-40 and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer climatological data covering a 45-yr time period. We have examined this data set for long-term trends. Several sites are found to show significant long-term changes in some parameters, possibly due to climate change. Four sites show significant increases in cloud cover (99 per cent confidence level). Four sites show changes in 200-hPa wind speed. Eight sites show increases or decreases in precipitable water vapour. The largest changes are found for Antarctic sites, which have clear trends of increasing cloud cover and water vapour. These results should help to characterize the relative astronomical potential of the sites and highlight the influence of both seasonal variations and long-term trends.

In the imaging model of the unit viewing sphere of a central catadioptric camera, there exists a pair of common self-polar triangles between a pair of antipodal sphere images and the image of the great circle on the base plane, so the vertices of the common self-polar triangles can be obtained. According to the imaging characteristics of the sphere on the unit viewing sphere, the line connecting the two common poles outside the conics is a vanishing line, enabling the imaged circular points to be determined. Finally, the intrinsic parameters of the paracatadioptric camera can be found using constraints between the imaged circular points and the image of the absolute conic. Since the boundary points of the sphere image can be almost completely extracted, the curve fitting accuracy can be improved. Experiments with simulated as well as real data demonstrated that our method is feasible and effective.

Therefore, it is significant to study inclusion regions of the zeros for generalized polynomials. In this paper, several new inclusion sets of zeros for Chebyshev polynomials are presented by applying Brauer theorem about the eigenvalues of the comrade matrix of Chebyshev polynomial and applying the properties of ovals of Cassini. Some examples are given to show that the new inclusion sets are tighter than those provided by Melman (2014) in some cases.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			Modelling Daily Mean Surface Air Temperature Calculated from Different Methods and Its Impact on Urban-Related Warming Evaluations over Guangzhou and Shenzhen Using the WRF Model	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						dynamical downscaling; surface air temperature; urban-related warming; trend; asymmetric warming	URBANIZATION; CLIMATE; EXPANSION; ENERGY; TRENDS; CHINA	The impacts of urban surface expansion, based on satellite-derived data displaying urban surface expansion in China at different spatial scales from 1980 to 2016, were investigated using nested dynamical downscaling methods with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model at a 3.3-km resolution over a city and city cluster scale. Urban-related warming, based on daily mean surface air temperature at 2 m (SAT), calculated from the averages of four time records each day (00, 06, 12, and 18 h UTC, T-4) and averages of SAT maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) (T-xn), was evaluated. Differences in urban-related warming contributions calculated using T-4 and T-xn were small, whereas annual mean SAT and trends calculated using T-xn were respectively and significantly larger and smaller than those calculated using T-4 over Guangzhou and Shenzhen, excluding the trends over middle-northern Shenzhen. The differences in annual mean SAT calculated using T-4 and T-xn are attributed to nonlinear or asymmetric variations with time for the diurnal cycle of SAT. Meanwhile, differences in trends between T-4 and T-xn are interpreted as a strong trend for T-min and a weak one for T-max, which mitigated the trend for T-xn. The impacts on the evaluations of urban-related warming contributions calculated from different methods were the largest over the areas classified as urban surfaces in both time periods (U2U), especially during intense urban-surface-expansion periods between 2000 and 2016. The subregional performances in the changes in annual mean SAT, trends, and urban-related warming are attributed to urban-surface-expansion, which induced varied changes in the diurnal cycle due to asymmetric warming during the daytime and nighttime over different subregions.

Bacillus subtilis was used to produce a dense biofilm on an AZ31B magnesium alloy surface. Corrosion behavior of the alloy with the B. subtilis biofilm was evaluated in artificial seawater. The results revealed that the biofilm hampered extracellular electron transfer significantly, which resulted in a decrease of i(corr) and increase of R-t clearly compared to the control group. Moreover, an ennoblement of E-corr was detected under the condition of B. subtilis biofilm covering. Significant reduction of the corrosion was observed by using the cyclic polarization method. All of these prove that the existence of the B. subtilis biofilm effectively enhances the anti-corrosion performance of the AZ31B magnesium alloy. This result may enhance the usage of bio-interfaces for temporary corrosion control. In addition, a possible corrosion inhibition mechanism of B. subtilis on AZ31B magnesium alloy was proposed.

However, the mechanism of STIM1 overexpression and its relationship with hypoxia in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. Methods: STIM1 and HIF-1 alpha expression was tested using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray (TMA) including pancreatic cancer and matched normal pancreatic tissues, and their relationships with clinicopathological parameters were statistically analyzed. q-PCR, Western blot, ChIP, and luciferase assay were employed to 030 analyze transcriptional regulation between HIF-1a and STIM1 in pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. Results: Both STIM1 and HIF-1 alpha showed higher positive rates and up-regulated expression in cancer tissues compared to that of normal tissues (P < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier method revealed that higher HIF-1 alpha and STIM1 expression levels were significantly correlated with decreased disease-free survival (P = 0.025 and P = 0.029, respectively). The expression of HIF-1 alpha showed a significant positive correlation with that of STIM1 in cancer tissues (r(s) = 0.3343, P = 0.0011) and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, ChIP and luciferase assays confirmed that HIF-1 alpha bound to the STIM1 promoter and regulated its expression in PANC-1 cells. Conclusions: In hypoxia microenvironment, up-regulated expression of STIM1 mediated by HIF-1 alpha promotes PDAC progression. HIF-1 alpha and STIM1 are potential prognostic markers and/or therapeutic targets for PDAC treatment.

The microstructure, morphology, chemical states and specific surface areas were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N-2 adsorption-desorption, respectively. Results indicating the as-synthesized SnO2 are fiber-like structures and composed of numerous nanoparticles, and with large specific surface areas (36.50m(2)g(-1)). The XPS spectra confirms that the existence of adsorbed oxygen (O-ads) on the surface of product, which may lead to the response of gas sensor. The gas-sensing properties of the sensor based on SnO2 nanofibers for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, formaldehyde and n-butanol. The sensor showed high gas response, low detection limit and fast response towards various VOCs gases at the optimal operating temperature of 260 degrees C. These results demonstrated the potential of using as-synthesized SnO2 nanofibers for VOCs gases detection. In addition, the possible formation mechanism and the gas-sensing mechanism were also discussed.

Furthermore, layered structure based on effective medium theory is utilized to remove the anisotropic property of the proposed device. Simulation results show that when with sufficient layers, both the layered shrinking device and amplifying device behave nearly as perfect as the ideal one. A dielectric or magnetic object placed inside the proposed device will be visually transformed into another object with a bigger/smaller size and different constitutive parameters are figured out clearly, making the proposed device have potential applications in military camouflage or other field of electromagnetic engineering system. The shrinking/amplifying scale is tailored by the ratio of b/c (b and c are the quasi-radius of the arbitrarily shaped polygon). Composing of alternatively isotropic layers with positive material parameters would dramatically reduce the fabrication difficulty and move the device a step further towards the practical application.

However, recent progress in the description and revision of radiodont taxa, particularly drawing on their frontal appendages, has exposed morphological variation that challenges reliable identification of higher-level groupings. Here we describe a new taxon of Radiodonta, Laminacaris chimera gen. et sp. nov., from the Cambrian Series 2, Stage 3, Chengjiang biota of China, based on its unique frontal appendage morphology. Laminacaris is distinctive for its combination of characters shared by hurdiids and other early Cambrian radiodont families. Elongated, possibly unpaired endites on two proximal podomeres that bear small distally-directed auxiliary spines oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the endite, are comparable with the elongated endites and their auxiliary spines of all known Cambrian members of Hurdiidae. In contrast, endites on more distal podomeres are similar to some species of Anomalocaris, and the dorsal spines at the distal end resemble those of Amplectobelua. The mosaic characters in the frontal appendage of Laminacaris chimera may capture morphology close to the divergence between the major radiodont groups.

Ni-Cu sulfide ores of economic interest are found within these intrusions, with the Niubiziliang III and IV intrusions hosting most of the Ni-(Cu) mineralization. The Niubiziiang mafic-ultramafic intrusions intrude biotite-plagioclase gneiss of the Paleoproterozoic Dakendaban Group. Zircons separated from the gabbro, plagioclase-bearing clinopyroxenite, and olivine websterite yield U-Pb ages of 389 +/- 2, 373 +/- 2, and 380 +/- 2 Ma, respectively, indicating a genetic linkage with Middle-Late Devonian regional magmatism (390-370 Ma). Gabbro zircons have EHf(t) values of 4.2-10.9 with older T-DM1 ages (0.86-0.59 Ga). The Niubiziliang intrusions contain many xenoliths of Paleoproterozoic biotite-plagioclase gneiss, and the intrusions have similar trace element patterns with strong enrichment in LILEs (e.g., K, Rb, and Th) and moderate depletion in HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Ta, P, and Ti). The major and trace element characteristics, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions indicate the parental magmas originated from a metasomatized, asthenospheric mantle source that had previously been modified by subduction-related fluids. The magmas experienced significant crustal contamination both in the magma chamber and during ascent, triggering sulfur over-saturation that resulted in the deposition and enrichment of sulfides. Considering the tectonic evolution of this region, we infer that the Niubiziliang mafic-ultramafic intrusions formed in a post-collisional extensional setting related to delamination of the subcontinental lithosphere.

Morphological and geochemical (elemental and boron-isotopic) studies on these tourmalines are very limited. Furthermore, the tourmaline genetic correlation between the leucogranite and the pegmatite is also unknown. In this contribution, two types of tourmaline occurrences have been identified in the Conadong area, south Tibet, including randomly disseminated tourmaline in leucogranite (GT type) and radial, dendritic or massive tourmaline aggregates in pegmatite dikes that intrude the leucogranite (PT type). We performed major element and boron isotopic analyses of tourmaline using electron microprobe (EMPA) and laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. The two types of tourmalines are enriched in Fe, Na and Al but relatively depleted in Ca and Mg elements, with compositions close to alkali group tourmaline and schorl. All the tourmalines are likely the products of equilibrium crystallization and their dominance of Na was controlled by the magmatic compositions of their host rocks. The GT type tourmalines show a narrow range of delta B-11 values between -9.78 +/- 0.81 parts per thousand and - 8.53 +/- 0.68 parts per thousand (with a mean of -8.91 +/- 0.18 parts per thousand); whereas the PT type tourmalines have significantly lower delta B-11 values than the GT type, ranging from -14.02 +/- 0.85 parts per thousand to -11.83 +/- 0.57 parts per thousand (with a mean of -13.31 +/- 0.49 parts per thousand). These data together with their morphology and petrography indicate that the Conadong granitic tourmalines were derived by the melts at the early magmatic stage, whereas the pegmatitic tourmalines precipitated from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids at the late magmatic stage. The variation in boron isotopic compositions (Delta B-11 = 4.4 parts per thousand) between the PT and the GT type tourmalines is most likely correlated with their different melt/fluid source regions that had distinct Sr-Nd-B isotopic compositions.

While it is technically feasible to produce bioethanol using water hyacinth, the economic feasibility of this valorization is yet unknown. This article conducted an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis of the production of bioethanol from water hyacinth. The results show that in comparison with the active control approach of collection and landfill, it is economically feasible to produce bioethanol from the collected biomass. In addition to its contribution to energy diversification, the production of bioethanol using water hyacinth as a feedstock cannot only control the rapid expansion of water hyacinth but can also contribute to carbon emissions reduction and water quality improvement. While the production cost of bioethanol is high, environmental values play an important role in the economic justification of the production. The coupled use of water hyacinth as a phytoremediation plant and bioethanol feedstock is a potential response to green development strategies.

To a leaderless team with homogeneous space-based robots, a multirobot controller architecture is proposed in which information flow is included. For each robot, there are two coupled feedback loops with different control objectives. One feedback loop is for guidance and is designed so that each robot can rapidly maneuver and rendezvous at the target point in a neighboring orbit. The other feedback loop is for formation control and is designed so that all robots in the group maintain a desired formation during a maneuver. A modified linear quadratic regulator method is used to design the guidance and control laws, where separate performance indexes are used for the two loops. By analyzing the interaction between the formation control and the maneuver guidance, a new restriction on the communication topology is proposed. An estimator for the state of the formation center is included in this control loop, and to guarantee a consensus on the formation center state estimates among all of the robots, a distributed Kalman filter based on the consensus algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the approach.

The current study set up field cages (2 x 2 x 3 m each, US-80 standard nylon mesh) in both early-and mid-season paddies in Yuanjiang (Red River) Valley in Yunnan, China, in 2012 and 2014. The immigrating population was successfully separated from the local population of S. furcifera and identified using statistical comparisons. The findings showed that densities of macropterous adults outside the cages were all significantly higher than those inside the cages on both early- and mid-season rice in both years, whereas the densities of young nymphs and old nymphs showed no significant differences. This indicated that immigrations were occurring, the earliest of which occurred on early-season rice in early May and reached its peak in mid-late May before a rapid collapse in both years. In contrast, the immigration on mid-season rice showed a continuous decline or fluctuation throughout the entire period. Analyses demonstrated that the migration process of S. furcifera in the Yuanjiang Valley features continuous immigration from the adjacent southern parts of Yunnan, which may represent most migration events in Yunnan during the outbreak period of a year. The findings of this case study could benefit our understanding of planthopper migration and outbreaks in other parts of China, especially where the outbreak pattern is very different from Yunnan.

However, in light of numerous news apps and information overload, motivating users to adopt one app is a major concern for both the industry and academia. Therefore, considering the attributes of mobile news and the debate on switching costs in the Internet context, based on the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), this study suggests that switching costs still exist and have a significant moderating effect on user satisfaction and continuous usage of mobile news apps. Furthermore, the different influences of information quality, system quality and service quality on continuance intention, user satisfaction and switching costs are discussed, showing that quality of information has a significant impact on users' continuous usage of mobile news apps through increasing perceived usefulness, whereas personalized service quality have stronger effects through increasing user satisfaction and switching costs.

In this study, an enantioselective potentiometric sensor composed of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane electrode modified with CC3-R POC material was used for the recognition of enantiomers of 2-amino-1-butanol. After optimisation, the developed sensor exhibited enantioselectivity toward S-2-amino-1-butanol (log K-S,R(pot) = -0.98) with acceptable sensitivity, and a near-Nernstian response of 25.8 +/- 0.3 mV/decade within a pH range of 6.0-9.0.

The fossil of Zhalai Nur mammoth was dated to 43,500 +1000/-900 C-14 yr BP. The results of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, which show that a fluvially deposited gravel layer, from that the mammoth fossils were excavated, formed between 51,300 +/- 2100 and 26,600 +/- 1200 yr BP, place the new AMS C-14 dates in a well-developed chronological framework. Through this study, it can be summarized that, firstly, using suitable sample material, it is possible to obtain reliable AMS C-14 results, even when the ages of the target materials approach the upper limits of the method. Second, it reveals that a depositional hiatus exists during the Late Pleistocene, between ca. 26,000 yr BP and ca. 13,000 yr BP. Finally, large rivers and widely distributed areas of alluvial-fluvial deposits existed in this present-day desert area between ca. 51,000 and 26,000 yr BP. These results may shed new light on the study of the Mammuthus-Colelodonta-Bubalus fauna, the most important and fully developed fauna during the Late Pleistocene in northeastern China. They also deepen our understanding about the eco-environments of the region.

Threshold analyses were employed to investigate the nonlinear relationships based on the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework using a balanced panel dataset of 29 provinces of China over the period of 1998-2014. The common correlated effects mean group estimator (CCEMG) was used to address time-series cross-section (TSCS) issues. The results confirmed the existence of the nonlinear relationship between urbanization and REC in China. The impact of urbanization on REC varied at different economic development levels and urbanization levels. Specifically, urbanization decreased REC at the stage that per capita disposable income of urban residents (PDI) less than 2615 USD, while it increased REC at the stage that PDI higher than 2615 USD. Similarly, urbanization decreased REC at the stage that urbanization rate lower than 55.31% and increased REC after urbanization rate exceeded 55.31%. This study did not find evidence to support the urban environmental transition theory, indicating there was still no region in China had stepped into the win-win stage of urbanization and energy consumption. Furthermore, the nonlinear impact of urban density on REC was estimated and the results indicated that urban density exerted a positive effect on REC when urban density was lower than 808 inhabitants per square kilometer, while it was no longer relevant to REC after that threshold point. Based on these results, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions to achieve low-carbon urbanization were put forward.

We wish to explore more organic molecules with increasing complexity in this region. In particular, we have searched for one of the most complex organic molecules detected in space so far, ethyl formate (C2H5OCHO). This species is the next step in chemical complexity after the simplest member of esters (methyl formate, CH3OCHO). The mechanisms leading to its formation are still poorly known. We have used high angular resolution (similar to 1 ''.5) ALMA observations covering a large bandwidth from 214 to 247 GHz. We have detected 82 unblended lines of C2H5OCHO (49 and 33 of the trans-and gauche-conformers, respectively). The line images showed that C2H5OCHO arises mainly from the compact ridge and the hot core-southwest regions. The derived rotational temperatures and column densities are 122 +/- 34 K, (0.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(16) cm(-2) for the hot core-SW, and 103 +/- 13 K, (0.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(16) cm(-2) for the compact ridge. The comparison of spatial distribution and abundance ratios with chemically related molecules (methyl formate, ethanol, and formic acid) indicates that C2H5OCHO is likely formed on the surface of dust grains by addition of CH3 to functional-group radicals (CH2OCHO) derived from methyl formate (CH3OCHO).

The objective of the study is to explore whether ASC(apo) is stimulated by elevated O-3 concentrations. The detoxification of O-3 by ASC(apo) was quantified in tobacco (Nicotiana L), soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) and poplar (Populus L), which were exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and elevated O-3 treatments (E-O-3). ASC(apo) in the three species were significantly increased by E-O-3 compared with the values in the filtered treatment. For all three species, E-O-3 significantly increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decreased light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(sat)), suggesting that high O-3 has induced injury/damage to plants. E-O-3 significantly increased redox state in the apoplast (redox state(apo)) for all species, whereas no effect on the apoplastic dehydroascorbate (DHA(apo)) was observed. In leaf tissues, E-O-3 significantly enhanced reduced-ascorbate (ASC) and total ascorbate (ASC+DHA) in soybean and poplar, but significantly reduced these in tobacco, indicating different antioxidative capacity to the high O-3 levels among the three species. Total antioxidant capacity in the apoplast (TAC(apo)) was significantly increased by E-O-3 in tobacco and poplar, but leaf tissue TAC was significantly enhanced only in tobacco. Leaf tissue superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) in poplar and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tobacco and soybean were significantly increased by E-O-3. The diurnal variation of ASC(apo), with maximum values occurring in the late morning and lower values experienced in the afternoon, appeared to play an important role in the harmful effects of O-3 on tobacco, soybean and poplar.

NOV.; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SOIL; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES; MEMBER; WELLS	A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterium, designated YIM 730274(T), was isolated from a sediment sample collected from a hot spring located in Tibet, PR China, and was characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomy approach. Cells were motile by means of a polar flagellum. The strain was oxidase- and catalase-positive, and contained polyalkanoates and polyphosphate as storage polymers. Growth occurred at 25-50 degrees C, at pH 6.0-8.5 and with 0.5-1.0 % NaCl. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c), summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) and C-16:0. The known polar lipids comprised of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. The isoprenoid quinone was Q-8. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 70.7 mol%. The results of phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain forms a monophyletic branch at the periphery of the evolutionary radiation occupied by the genus Aquabacterium in the class Betaproteobacteria. The most closely related phylogenetic neighbours were Aquabacterium limnoticum ABP-4(T) (97.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity) and Aquabacterium commune B8(T) (97.2 % 16SrRNA gene sequence identity). DNA-DNA relatedness values between YIM 730274(T) and A. limnoticum KCTC 23306(T) (46.4 +/- 0.4%) and A. commune DSM 11901(T) (42.2 +/- 1.2 %) were well below the 70 % limit for species identification. YIM 730274(T) was distinguishable from other members of the genus Aquabacterium by the differences in phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics. YIM 730274(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Aquabacterium. It is proposed that the isolate should be classified in the genus Aquabacterium as representing a novel species, Aquabacterium tepidiphilum sp. nov. The type strain is YIM 730274(T) (=KCTC 52716(T) =CCTCC AB 2016295(T)).

NOV.; FILAMENTOUS ACTINOMYCETE; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES	A novel halophilic actinobacterial strain, designated YIM 96934(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from the edge of a saline lake in Xinjiang, north-west China. The taxonomic position of the strain was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Cells of the strain were aerobic and Gram-stain-positive. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain YIM 96934(T) was related most closely to type strains of the genus Phytoactinopolyspora, and shared highest sequence similarity with Phytoactinopolyspora endophytica EGI 60009(T) (94.7 %), Phytoactinopolyspora alkaliphila EGI 80629(T) (94.5 %) and Phytoactinopolyspora halotolerans YIM 96448(T) (94.1 %). Optimum growth of the strain was observed at 28-37 degrees C (range 15-45 degrees C), pH 7.0-8.0 (6.0-9.0) and 5-8 % (w/v) NaCl (2-24 %). The major isoprenoid quinone was MK-9(H-4). The whole-cell sugars were glucose, galactose, mannose and rhamnose. The diagnostic diamino acid was LL-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipid profile was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, four unidentified phospholipids, three unidentified phosphoglycolipids, an unidentified aminophospholipid, two phosphatidylinositol mannosides and an unidentified polar lipid. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0, anteiso-C-17.0 and summed feature 4 (iso-C-17:1 I and/or anteiso-C-17:1 B). The DNA G+C content was 66.6 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, a novel species, Phytoactinopolyspora halophila sp. nov., is proposed.

No bacteriophage that infects Exiguobacterium has been reported, despite its potential impacts on the utilization of Exiguobacterium. E. indicum EI9 was isolated from Dianchi Lake, a plateau eutrophic lake in China, which can significantly inhibit the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa. To isolate and characterize Exiguobacterium-infecting bacteriophage, a virulent bacteriophage, DCEIV-9 that specifically infects E. indicum EI9 was isolated from Dianchi lake water sample. DCEIV-9 produced tiny, round, and clear plaques with 0.5-1 mm in diameter. Electron microscopy showed that DCEIV-9 is a typical representative of the Siphoviridae, with an icosahedral head (56 nm in diameter) and a non-contractile tail (163 nm in length). Based on a one-step growth curve, latent period of 20 min and burst size of 51 PFU/infected cell were determined. DCEIV-9 was sensitive to temperature over 50 degrees C and prefers acid environment. DCEIV-9 was extremely sensitive to proteinase K, chloroform, ethanol, Triton X-100 but not sensitive to SDS. Restriction endonucleases analysis indicated that DCEIV-9 is a dsDNA virus. DCEIV-9 can only infect E. indicum, indicates that it has a narrow host range. DCEIV-9 is a potential new species.

Here we report the requirement for mitochondrial saccharopine degradation in mitochondrial homeostasis and animal development. In Caenorhbditis elegans, mutations in the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain of the bi-functional enzyme alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase AASS-1 greatly elevate the lysine catabolic intermediate saccharopine, which causes mitochondrial damage by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, leading to reduced adult animal growth. In mice, failure of mitochondrial saccharopine oxidation causes lethal mitochondrial damage in the liver, leading to postnatal developmental retardation and death. Importantly, genetic inactivation of genes that raise the mitochondrial saccharopine precursors lysine and alpha-ketoglutarate strongly suppresses SDH mutation-induced saccharopine accumulation and mitochondrial abnormalities in C. elegans. Thus, adequate saccharopine catabolism is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. Our study provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights for understanding and treating hyperlysinemia II (saccharopinuria), an aminoacidopathy with severe developmental defects.

J	Yang, RW; Wang, J; Zhang, TY; He, SP				Yang, Ruowen; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Tianyu; He, Shengping			Change in the relationship between the Australian summer monsoon circulation and boreal summer precipitation over Central China in the late 1990s	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ANTARCTIC OSCILLATION; ARCTIC OSCILLATION; CO-VARIABILITY; ASIAN MONSOON; ALEUTIAN LOW; CLIMATE; RAINFALL; IMPACT	Recent study revealed a close connection between the Australian summer monsoon (ASM) and boreal summer precipitation over Central China (SPCC). This study further revealed a strengthening of the ASM-SPCC relationship around the late 1990s. It is found that the relationship between the ASM and the SPCC during 1979-1997 (1998-2014) relationship is statistically insignificant (significant). Further analysis indicated that during 1998-2014, the weakened ASM is concurrent with significant positive sea surface temperature (SST) in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea, which could persist into the following boreal summer and further lead to intensified East Asian summer monsoon, strengthened western North Pacific subtropical high, and anomalous ascending motion over Central China. Consequently, more moisture is transported from the western Pacific northward to Central China where significant anomalous convergence appears. Therefore, the ASM could potentially influence the SPCC during 1998-2014. By contrast, the ASM-related SST and atmospheric circulation anomalies in boreal winter are statistically insignificant during 1979-1997. Such an interdecadal change might be attributed to the interdecadal warming that occurred in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea around the late 1990s. This study might be useful for the prediction of the SPCC.

The mode converter is formed by connecting a single-mode fiber, a taper-core multi-mode fiber, and a few-mode fiber (FMF) together. The taper fiber core is designed to convert LP01 mode to LP02. The few-mode fiber is used to cut off the modes that are higher than LP02. It is shown that the proposed mode converter provides 20 dB extinction ratio and low insertion loss in a very broad optical bandwidth of 200 nm, from 1465 to 1665 nm. By further optimizing the FMF radius only for each of the O-, E-, S-, C-, U-, etc. bands, the mode converter can apply to any band of interest with higher performance. It is found that the performance of the mode converter has a large tolerance to structural parameters. The mode converter has the same performance in reciprocal operation, i.e., LP02 to LP01.

However, glacier observations in this region are short and scarce and hence limit a better understanding of glacier behaviors under a warming climate and thereto coupled processes. The purpose of this research is to investigate the potential and the uncertainty for using pioneering trees on glacial deposits/glacier forefields as a proxy record for past glacier fluctuations in the Himalaya-Nyanqentanggula-Hengduan (H2N) area. It was found that Hippophae tibetana spent 4 years to colonize the glacier forefields at Hailuogou glacier and Pinus wallichiana germinated 11 years after glacier retreating at Gangapuna and Raikot glaciers. At deposit sites of glacier avalanche and glacial lake outburst, it took 8 years for Larix griffithii to germinate after the historical events. As shown by bootstrap resampling, the precision of the sampled maximum tree age could reach 2-14 years, which is related to the sample size to ensure the possibility of obtaining the eldest trees. However, if using the traditional sampling method at 100-cm height, errors of tree age estimation may reach up to +/- 20 years due to uncertainties of pith offset estimation and height-age calibration. If samples are collected with pith from <= 20 cm tree height, an error of < 5 years in tree age estimation could be derived. These results suggest that maximum tree ages may be a promising proxy record of glacier fluctuation with decadal precision in the H2N mountain range if the sample-collecting methods are rigidly controlled and the old trees are well replicated. The uncertainties due to the pith offset, tree height age and sample size imply that cautions should be taken when integrating exposure age dating on decadal-multidecadal glacier fluctuations at regional to hemispheric scales.

In this paper, following the work Duric and Seaquist (ApJ 301:308, 1986) at adiabatic phase, we carefully investigate shell-type supernova remnants at radiative phase, and obtain theoretical sigma-D relation at radiative phase of shell-type supernova remnants at 1GHz. By using these theoretical sigma-D relations at adiabatic phase and radiative phase, we also roughly determine phases of some supernova remnant from observation data.

However, debate continues regarding the degree of sediment buffering and recycling in the sediment transport process. In this study, we investigate the origin of sediment in the Indus Submarine Canyon since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 20 ka) using zircon U-Pb dates. Zircon grains in the submarine canyon are resolvably different from those at the river mouth, at least before 6.6 ka, implying a disconnection between the river mouth and the canyon up to that time. Sand may be stored near the river mouth as sea level rose, while finer-grained sediment was directly transferred into deeper water. Since 1 ka the upper canyon has shown big and rapid provenance changes, most notably a sharp increase in erosion from Nanga Parbat, whose influence is minor in the modern river. Such rapid changes imply a lack of buffering in the recent past. The modern river contrasts with sediments in the canyon in terms of its zircon U-Pb age populations and may be influenced by significant anthropogenic impact on the terrestrial drainage basin, especially damming.

The absorption peak of the N-CDs is located at325nm. The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths of the N-CDs are 340nm and 430nm, respectively. The fluorometric response to Fe(III) is linear in the ranges between 1.0 and 21.0M and between 0.05 and 30.0M, and the limits of detection are 0.28M in case of colorimetry and 13.5nM in case of fluorometry. Quenching by Fe(III) is mainly attributed to a combination of chelation (static quenching) and inner filter effect. The N-CDs also can be used as a new sort of fluorescent ink owing to the strong luminous performance and chemical inertness.

However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.

In the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, rainfall stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, and the transboundary characteristic makes the collection of precipitation data more difficult, which has restricted hydrological processes simulation. In this study, daily precipitation data from four datasets (gauge observations, inverse distance weighted (IDW) data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimates, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) estimates), were applied to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and then their capability for hydrological simulation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin were examined. TRMM and CHIRPS data showed good performances on precipitation estimation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, with the better performance for TRMM product. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of gauge, IDW, TRMM, and CHIRPS simulations during the calibration period were 0.87, 0.86, 0.95, and 0.93 for monthly flow, respectively, and those for daily flow were 0.75, 0.77, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively. TRMM and CHIRPS data were superior to rain gauge and IDW data for driving the hydrological model, and TRMM data produced the best simulation performance. Satellite-based precipitation estimates could be suitable data sources when simulating hydrological processes for large data-poor or ungauged watersheds, especially in international river basins for which precipitation observations are difficult to collect. CHIRPS data provide long precipitation time series from 1981 to near present and thus could be used as an alternative precipitation input for hydrological simulation, especially for the period without TRMM data. For satellite-based precipitation products, the differences in the occurrence frequencies and amounts of precipitation with different intensities would affect simulation results of water balance components, which should be comprehensively considered in water resources estimation and planning.

To determine whether dam removal on a mountainous river benefit restoration of fish diversity, we investigated the response of fish assemblage to dam removal using a before- after-control-impact design in two tributaries of the Lancang River (dam removal river: the Jidu River, and control river: the Fengdian River). Fish surveys were conducted one year prior to dam removal (2012) and three years (2013-2015) following dam removal. We observed rapidly and notably spatio-temporal changes in fish biodiversity metrics and assemblage structure, occurring in the Jidu River within the first year after dam removal. Overall, fish species richness, density and Shannon-Wiener diversity all increased immediately in above- and below-dam sites, and maintained a stable level in subsequent years, compared to unchanged situation in the control river. All sites in the Jidu River experienced shifts in fish composition after dam removal, with the greatest temporal changes occurred in sites below- and above- the former dam, resulting in a temporal homogenization tendency in the dam removed river. These findings suggest that dam removal can benefit the recovery of habitat conditions and fish community in Asian mountainous rivers, but the results should be further evaluated when apply to other dammed rivers since the dam age, fluvial geomorphology and situation of source populations could all affect the responses of fish assemblages.

Cooperation on water resources has been determined as one of the key priority areas in the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism, but there are no details of targets. In order to establish the priorities of water cooperation under the mechanism, we adopted nine categories to classify the objectives of 87 water cooperation events based on the Lancang-Mekong Water Cooperative Events Database' from 1995 to 2015. Based on the occurrence of cooperative events, cooperative objectives, cooperative scales, and approaches to cooperation, we conducted statistical, correlation, and text analyses. Our analyses indicated the following results: under the impact of economic conditions inside and outside the river basin, full cooperation appeared more difficult than bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Each of the partners adopted different preferences for cooperation targets. Cooperation with more definite objectives was easier to establish than cooperation with broader and more complex objectives. The potential objectives for water cooperation were navigation, hydropower, joint management, data sharing, flood control and water use. Because hydropower development is controversial, and because water cooperation is avoided by most existing regional cooperation mechanisms due to its complexity, we suggest the following priority areas for water cooperation in the Lancang- Mekong River Basin. 1) Navigation and flood control/drought relief are attractive objectives for all the riparian countries across the whole watershed. 2) Data sharing should be a priority for cooperation in the watershed due to its laying the foundation for the equitable and reasonable utilization of transboundary waters. 3) Hydropower is an objective best implemented mainly through bilateral cooperation, and on tributaries.

After the reservoir impoundment, the intense water level fluctuations under the interaction of cascade dams operating and the mountainous flooding, usually cause bank collapse, landslide and debris flow hazards. The Xiaowan reservoir (XWR), for example, as the dragon head' meg reservoir located in the middle mainstream of Lancang River, have resulted in a series of geohazards during its building and operating. In this study, we investigated the number and surface area of collapses and landslides (CLs) occurred in the water level fluctuations zone (WLFZ) of XWR using remote sensing images of Gaofen-1 and Google Earth; evaluated the CLs susceptibility using information value method. The results presented that the total WLFZ area of 87.03 km(2) and 804 CLs masses with a total area of 1.98 km(2) were identified in the riparian zone of XWR. CLs mainly occurred at an elevation of 1190-1240 m, and the CLs density increased with an increase in altitude. The WLFZ with a slope gradient of 25 degrees-45 degrees is the main CLs distribution area that accounts for more than half of the total CLs area. The susceptibility assessment revealed that high and very high susceptibility zones are generally distributed along zones with an elevation of 1210-1240 m, a slope degree of 25 degrees-45 degrees and a slope aspect perpendicular to the direction of Lancang River. Furthermore, these susceptible zones are close in distance to the dam site and tend to be in the riparian zones with the formation lithology of Silurian strata. These results provide a valuable contribution to prevent and control geohazards in the XWR area. Moreover, this study offers a constructive sample of geohazards assessment in the riparian zone of large reservoirs throughout the mountains of southwest China.

Inspired by this fact, here we study the emergence of cooperative behavior in weighted networks under the coevolution of game strategy and node weight, where the node weight is used to mimic the role or influence of subjects. In the prisoner's dilemma, if an individual's fitness exceeds the aspiration level, its weight becomes larger; otherwise weight decreases. While such an adjustment of weight is defined by the intensity parameter delta, it is interesting that there is an optimal range for delta guaranteeing the best evolution of cooperation. The facilitation of cooperative behavior mainly depends on the weight distribution of players, which is based on the formation of a cooperative cluster controlled by high-weight cooperators. These cooperators are able to prevail against defectors even when there is a large temptation to defect. Our research provides a viable route to resolve social dilemma and will inspire further applications. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

High resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents resulted in an urgent need for novel formulation to eliminate these bacterial communities. Herein we fabricated light controllable chitosan micelles loading with thymol (T-TCP) for elimination of biofilm. Due to the exterior chitosan, T-TCP micelles easily bind to negative biofilm through electrostatic interaction and efficiently deliver the essential oil payloads. Under irradiation, T-TCP micelles generated ROS, which triggered simultaneous thymol release and also resulted in additional ROS-inducing bactericidal effects, both effectively eradicating biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. This formulation provided a platform for other water-insoluble antimicrobials and might be used as a potent and controllable solution to biofilm fighting.

In IFS theory, the calculation of the distance and similarity between IFSs are significant techniques that are effective measurement methods for distinguishing the similarity degree between IFSs, and the two measures can be used in pattern recognition, decision-making and so on. In this paper, a novel similarity/distance measure between IFSs is proposed according to the intersections of the transformed isosceles triangles from IFSs, and the isosceles triangles are placed in a square area; furthermore, the properties of the proposed measure are also analyzed to prove whether the measure satisfies the definition of the similarity/distance measure for IFSs or not. The numerical experiments are implemented to test the validity of the proposed measure; in addition, several pattern recognition and clustering problems are also employed to further demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed measure is an accurate and superior measure that can avoid the shortcomings of most existing measures. Finally, the directions for future research of this work are also represented in the conclusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, a novel model, called energy-aware profit maximizing scheduling problem (EAPM), which combines energy and makespan into the objective of maximizing the profit per unit of time has been proposed. The user pay a given price to have a bag-of-tasks processed and the objective is to maximize the profit per unit time. In this study, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for the EAPM problem. The execution time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of task types which is an improvement over the previous algorithm, whose execution time is polynomial in the number of tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the approximation ratio of our algorithm is close to 2 for a special case, which may be the best result we can obtain. Experimental results show that our algorithm can produce a feasible solution with better objective value than the previous algorithm. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Stomatal development is under the rigorous control of many regulators. The last step of development is the terminal division of guard mother cells (GMC) into two guard cells (GC). It is still unclear how the symmetric division of GMCs is regulated. Here, we show that the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is required for the symmetric division of GMCs into GCs in Arabidopsis. Exogenous application of the ACC biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) induced the formation of single guard cells (SGCs). Correspondingly, an acs octuple-mutant with extremely low endogenous ACC also developed SGCs, and exogenous ACC dramatically decreased the number of SGCs in this mutant whereas exogenous ethephon (which is gradually converted into ethylene) had no effect. Furthermore, neither blocking of endogenous ethylene synthesis nor disruption of ethylene signaling transduction could induce the production of SGCs. Further investigation indicated that ACC promoted the division of GMCs in fama-1 and flp-1myb88 mutants whereas AVG inhibited it. Moreover, ACC positively regulated the expression of CDKB1; 1 and CYCA2; 3 in the fama-1 and flp-1myb88 mutants. The SGC number was not affected by ACC or AVG in cdkb1; 11; 2 and cyca2; 234 mutants. Taken together, the results demonstrate that ACC itself, but not ethylene, positively modulates the symmetric division of GMCs in a manner that is dependent on CDKB1s and CYCA2s.

Introduction to the special issue: Saving plants, saving lives: Trade, sustainable harvest and conservation of traditional medicinals in Asia	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Editorial Material								This "geographic and thematic" issue of the Journal of Ethnopharmacology focuses on the traditional medicines in trade in Asia on the 30th anniversary of the 1988 Chiang-Mai Declaration, an output of an historic meeting organized by WHO, IUCN and WWF. The emphasis on the Asian countries that represent the highest volume and value of medicinal plants trade in the world is deliberate. Not only because of the scale and speed of changes in traditional medicines trade in Asia, but also to highlight the conservation and sustainable use issues being faced today. In 1988, few studies had been done on the informal sector trade or on medicinal plant value chains and even fewer studies on cross-border trade in medicinal plants or fungi. At that time, e-commerce in Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM), so common today, did not even exist. And no comparitive, repeat studies of traditional medicines markets had been done at all. Thirty years later, this special issue illustrates how the traditional medicines trade has grown and changed. Links between medicinal plant conservation, scarcity and price on one hand and quality, safety and adulteration on the other are better understood. E-commerce in T&CM has grown exponentially, due to 51% of the world's population having internet access by 2017. Yet despite global policy goals for conservation and sustainable use, the challenges facing medicinal plants conservation are greater than ever before. Consequently, the need for co-operation between the health-care and conservation sectors recognised in 1988 is even greater today. And this is recognised in WHO's 2014-2023 strategy for traditional medicines, which identifies the need to raise awareness about issues of biodiversity and conservation as an important strategic action (WHO, 2013). This Special Issue is a small contribution towards that goal.	[Cunningham, A. B.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, King Edward Ave, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Cunningham, A.

The main intention of this study is to design a non-fragile sampled-data controller for the considered model to handle the issue of tax fluctuations by means of showing that the closed-loop system is regular, impulse free and stochastically finite-time bounded. Sampled-data controller is the one where the continuous system is controlled by the digital control algorithms. By introducing a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a new set of criteria is obtained in terms of LMIs for achieving the required result. More precisely, by solving LMIs, an upper bound for the cost function can be obtained. Finally, a simulation result is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design.

Intense-terahertz-laser-modulated magnetopolaron effect on shallow-donor states in the presence of magnetic field in the Voigt configuration	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-GAS; DOUBLE-QUANTUM-WELL; CYCLOTRON-RESONANCE; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; TRANSITION ENERGIES; HYDROGEN-ATOM; OSCILLATOR-STRENGTHS; BINDING-ENERGIES; IMPURITY STATES; SEMICONDUCTOR	The laser-modulated magnetopolaron effect on shallow donors in semiconductors is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field in the Voigt configuration. A nonperturbative approach is used to describe the electron-photon interaction by including the radiation field in an exact way via a laser-dressed interaction potential. Through a variational approach we evaluate the donor binding energy. We find that the interaction strength of the laser-dressed Coulomb potential in the z direction cannot only be enhanced but also weakened by the radiation field, while that in the x-y plane is only weakened. In this way, the binding energy of the states with odd z parity, like 2p(z) can be decreased or increased with respect to its static binding energy by the radiation field, while that of the other states can be only decreased. Furthermore, all binding energies become insensitive to the magnetic field if the radiation field is strong. The magnetopolaron effect on these energies is studied within second-order time-dependent perturbation theory. In the nonresonant region, a laser-modulated magnetopolaron correction, including the effect of single-photon processes, is observed. In the resonant region, a laser-modulated magnetopolaron effect, accompanied by the emission and absorption of a single photon, is found. Moreover, the 1s -> 2p(+) transition, accompanied by the emission of a single photon, is tuned by the radiation field into resonance with the longitudinal-optical phonon branch. This is electrically analogous to the magnetopolaron effect, and therefore we name it the dynamical magnetopolaron effect. Finally, by changing the frequency of the radiation field, these interesting effects can be tuned to be far away from the reststrahlen band and, therefore, can be detected experimentally. This in turn provides a direct measure of the electron-phonon interaction.

In detecting underlying structure and representing possible interrelationships, statistical analysis using a two-part model is appropriated. In this paper, we present a general extension of two-part model to the situation where the unobserved factors are included in the two parts to interpret external variability in semicontinuous variable. Auxiliary information on these factors is manifested by continuous responses via measurement model, while the interrelationships among factors are exploited through structural equation model. Moreover, under longitudinal setting, dynamic characteristics of responses between any two occasions are represented by transition model. Procedures for model fitting, parameter estimation, model selection and prediction are developed within the Bayesian paradigm. Markov Chains Monte Carlo method is used to implement posterior analysis. Empirical results including a simulation and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

ZrO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 40 nm were synthesized by a sol-gel process with zirconium oxychloride as the precursor. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized via a facile method by calcining a solution of ammonium citrate. Synthesized CQDs suspended in absolute ethanol emitted a green glow under UV irradiation. A convenient one-step process involving mixing in absolute ethanol under sonication was adopted for the formation of CQD-decorated ZrO2 nanoparticles (CQDZ). The dried final composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of CQDZ was evaluated by quantifying the removal efficiency of methylene blue dye. CQDZ managed to remove methylene blue by 66.5%, 76.5%, 84.3% and 95.0% under UV-irradiation of 10, 20, 40 and 60 min respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, pure ZrO2 nanoparticles managed to remove only 34% of the dye under 60 min of UV irradiation. The produced composite showed promise as a formidable contender to be used in industrial dye removal from waste water.	[Ratnayake, S. P.; Mantilaka, M. M. M. G. P.

C2H N=1-0 and N2H+ J=1-0 observations of Planck Galactic cold clumps	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: molecules; ISM: abundances; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; stars: formation; ISM: clouds	MASSIVE STAR-FORMATION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; LINE-PROFILES; DENSE CORES; CHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; DEPLETION; ABUNDANCE; COLLAPSE; MOTIONS	A survey of C2H N = 1-0 and N2H+ J = 1-0 toward Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) was performed using the Purple Mountain Observatory's 13.7 m telescope. C2H and N2H+ were chosen to study the chemical evolutionary states of PGCCs. Among 121 observed molecular cores associated with PGCCs, 71 and 58 are detected with C2H N = 1-0 and N2H+ J = 1-0, respectively. The detected lines of most sources can be fitted with a single component with compatible V-LSR and line widths, which confirms that these PGCC cores are very cold (with gas temperatures 9-21 K) and quiescent while still dominanted by turbulence. The ratio between the column densities of C2H and N2H+ (N(C2H)/N(N2H+)) is found to be a good tracer for the evolutionary states of PGCC cores. Gas-grain chemical model can reproduce the decreasing trend of N(C2H)/N(N2H+) as a function of time. The cores with the lowest abundances of N2H+ (X[N2H+] < 10(-10)) are the youngest, and have nearly constant abundances of C2H. In evolved cores with X[N2H+] similar to 10(-9), abundances of C2H drop quickly as the exhaustion of carbon atoms. Although these PGCC cores are in different evolutionary states, they are all quite young (<5 x 10(5) yr) with N(C2H) > N(N2H+). Mapping observations are carried out toward 20 PGCC cores. The PGCC cores in Cepheus have lower N(C2H)/N(N2H+) and larger line widths compared with those in Taurus. This implies that PGCC cores in Taurus are less chemically evolved than those in Cepheus.

But the risk must be assessed because of the potential damage caused by these agents. We conducted this project to investigate the mechanism driving the choice of a native obligate parasite, Cuscuta australis, between the exotic, Humulus scandens, and native plants as its host through field and pot experiments. The results showed that C. australis preferred the exotic weed over native (naturalized) hosts and caused a notable reduction in the biomass of H. scandens in the field. In contrast, the results of the pot experimentindicated that C. australis preferred a mix of native (naturalized) hosts over the exotic weed. Both texperiments indicated that the parasitic preference of C. australis was induced more by light irradiance than plant water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents, indicating that the native parasite can only be used to control H. scandens when the exotic weed forms mono-cultures or dominates the community. Accordingly, induction and release of C. australis to control H. scandens should be conducted with great caution.

Topology analysis indicated that compound 1 showed a 3D lvt topology, whereas compound 2 showed a two-fold interpenetrated 3D diamond network. Complexes 3 and 4 exhibited 2D sql/Shubnikov tetragonal plane networks. The coordination polymers were distinguished by the 5-substituted groups of isophthalate and the conformation of bpp. Moreover, compounds 2-4 are bifunctional luminescent materials that can detect environmentally relevant Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions using a luminescence quenching method. The detection limits of CPs 2-4 for Fe3+ were 6.676 x 10(-5) M, 5.442 x 10(-5) M, and 1.773 x 10(-5) M, respectively, whereas the detection limits of CPs 2-4 for Cr2O72- were 0.1314 x 10(-5) M, 1.778 x 10(-5) M, and 1.676 x 10(-5) M, respectively. The possible mechanisms for the fluorescence quenching phenomenon toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions have also been investigated in detail.

The thus-synthesized CeNiXOY and Pd-CeNiXOY catalysts were applied respectively to the direct N-alkylation of amine and alcohol via oxidative coupling, under O-2 in the absence of basic additives. The CeNiXOY catalyst could provide a >99% yield of imine in the model alkylation reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol at 100 degrees C. The Pd-promoted Pd-CeNiXOY catalyst surprisingly showed an enhanced imine yield (>99%) at a mild temperature of 60 degrees C. This catalyst exhibited good reusability, and moreover, demonstrated high performance towards imine synthesis from various amines with alcohols. The presence of Pd species and the Ni/Ce molar ratio showed a synergistic impact on the conversion of aniline, as well as on the product selectivity, which was believed to be related to the improvement on the intrinsic activity of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Various physicochemical techniques, including ICP-MS, XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, UV-Raman, H-2-TPR, TEM, EPMA and XPS, were employed to study mainly the composition, structure and redox properties of the catalysts. The proportion of Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies, which can be manipulated by the Ce-Ni redox system and the interaction between Ce and Ni, was crucial to the selective activation of alcohols in the presence of reactive amines. The activation of alcohol on the highly reactive Pd-0 species was the other crucial factor.

Enhancement of localized surface plasmon resonance by inter-band transitions in an Au based nanoshell structure	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; ABSORPTION; SCATTERING; MODEL; SIZE	We present a theoretical study on plasmonic properties of an Au based nanoshell structure in which the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) and the inter-band electronic transitions (IBTs) are presented. The optical properties of Au nano shell are depicted by a corrected dielectric function of Drude-Lorentz mode, and Mie theory is applied to calculate the absorption efficiencies. It shows that there are two localized surface plasmon absorption peaks, which are induced from the outside LSPRs and the inside LSPRs, respectively. The positions of these two peaks can shift by changing core radius and shell thickness. By varying the core radius and thickness of the shells, the LSPRs are modulated with the IBTs, leading to the strong interactions between the LSPRs and the IBTs. It is found that the LSPRs and IBTs can couple with each other and the new resonance absorption peaks can be observed. Our results show that the LSPRs are enhanced by the IBTs. This enhancement can be applied to improve biosensor signals and advanced plasmonic applications. Published under license by AIP Publishing.	[Dong, H. M.; Duan, Y. F.; Shen, X.

The Galactic Magneto-ionic Medium Survey: Moments of the Faraday Spectra	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic rays; ISM: magnetic fields; local interstellar matter; techniques: polarimetric	RADIO POLARIZATION; ROTATION MEASURES; INTERSTELLAR; FIELDS; BAND; DEPOLARIZATION; LATITUDE; PLANE; SCALE; GAS	Faraday rotation occurs along every line of sight in the Galaxy; rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows a 3D representation of the interstellar magnetic field. This study uses data from the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey, a combination of single-antenna spectro-polarimetric studies, including northern sky data from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) 26 m telescope (1270-1750 MHz) and southern sky data from the Parkes 64 m telescope (300-480 MHz). From the synthesized Faraday spectral cubes we compute the zeroth, first, and second moments to find the total polarized emission, mean RM, and RM width of the polarized emission. From DRAO first moments we find a weak vertical field directed from Galactic North to South, but Parkes data reveal fields directed toward the Sun at high latitudes in both hemispheres: the two surveys clearly sample different volumes. DRAO second moments show feature widths in Faraday spectra increasing with decreasing positive latitudes, implying that longer lines of sight encounter more Faraday rotating medium, but this is not seen at negative latitudes. Parkes data show the opposite: at positive latitudes the second moment decreases with decreasing latitude, but not at negative latitudes. Comparing first moments with RMs of pulsars and extragalactic sources and a study of depolarization together confirm that the DRAO survey samples to larger distances than the Parkes data. Emission regions in the DRAO survey are typically 700-1000 pc away, slightly beyond the scale height of the magneto-ionic medium; emission detected in the Parkes survey is entirely within the magneto-ionic disk, less than 500 pc away.

Herein, a new generation of thermotropic ionic liquid crystalline lithium salt (LiBIB) with potential bilayer fast ion-conductive tunnels, having functionalities of both lithium salt and polymer host or electrolyte, is successfully synthesized. Molecular structure, thermal stability, ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and ion- conductive mechanism of the LiBIB are extensively assessed. The obtained LiBIB shows typical behaviors of both ionic liquid and liquid crystal. Melt point at 43 degrees C, much lower than that of traditional lithium salts like LiClO4 and LiPF6, and clear point of the LiBIB at 83 degrees C are both detected. Solid LiBIB salt shows better ionic conductivity (3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) and electrochemical stability at room temperature in comparison with those of traditional lithium salts. Time-resolved and perturbation-correlation moving window 2D-COR FTIR results indicate that the high ionic conductivity of the LiBIB is mainly originated from the formation of fast ion-conductive tunnels, implying a promising application in solvent-free Li-ion batteries.

Energy saving and emission-reduction policies have been proposed in the government's Five-Year Plans (FYPs) to achieve sustainable development. Yunnan (YN) province, which is in its economic infancy, is facing industrial structure adjustment and is a typical case of severe environmental degradation. In this study, a decoupling analysis was conducted to explore the performances of economic growth and environmental pressure during the period from 2006 to 2016. The author of this paper made an innovative use of the pollutant discharge fee (PDF) as the measure of environmental pressure and Gross domestic product (GDP) as the measure of economic growth. The trend analysis and decoupling analysis revealed that although YN has already transformed from a weak decoupling to a strong decoupling state in the long term, stable and strong decoupling cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there was consistency between the decoupling conditions and the FYP cycle, all of which indicated that there was a shift from the target emissions to non-target emissions during the 11th (2006-2010) and 12th (2011-2015) FYPs. Thus, a single index for evaluating pollutant emissions cannot be adopted effectively to achieve adequate pollutant emission reduction. In addition, three industrial structures were considered in the decoupling analysis, which indicated that the tertiary industry will be a new key area for emission reduction, and the emissions of secondary industries have also been reduced.

Meanwhile, the adsorption mechanism of TBT+ (organic part of TBTB) was theoretically investigated by quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that TBTB acts as a good inhibitor, and inhibition efficiency in three chlorinated acetic acids follows the order: ClCH2COOH < Cl2CHCOOH < Cl3CCOOH. The maximum inhibition efficiency of 1.0 mM TBTB from weight loss method is 85.8% in ClCH2COOH; 91.7% in Cl2CHCOOH; and 95.5% in Cl3CCOOH. The adsorption of TBTB on CRS surface obeys Langmuir isotherm, and the adsorption free energy (Delta G(0)) is about -34 kJ mol(-1). In each chlorinated acetic acid solution, TBTB behaves as a mixed inhibitor, and the presence of TBTB shifts the both anodic and cathodic curves to lower current densities. With the addition of TBTB, the corrosion potential almost does not alter in ClCH2COOH, while becomes more positive in Cl2CHCOOH, and moves negative position in Cl3CCOOH. EIS exhibits one large depressed capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a small inductive section at low frequencies. In the presence of TBTB, the charge transfer resistance increases, while both constant phase element and double layer capacitance decreases. SEM micrographs reveal that the corrosion of CRS can be efficiently retarded by TBTB. TBT+ can be further protonated by H+ in acid solution to form TBTH2+. Both TBTH2+ and TBT+ could easily physical adsorb on steel surface owing to high dipole moment values, and TBTH2+ exhibits stronger physisorption than TBT+. The electron densities of both HOMO and LUMO are localized principally on tetrazole and thiazole rings, which are chemical adsorption sites. TBTH2+ strengthens accepting electrons while weakens donating electrons as compared with TBT+. Both TBT+ and TBTH2+ adsorb onto Fe (001) surface with nearly flat orientation mode, and the adsorption energy of TBT+ is a little higher than that of TBTH2+. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, C; Tian, LD; Shao, LL; Li, Y				Wang, Cheng; Tian, Lide; Shao, Lili; Li, Yao			Glaciochemical records for the past century from the Qiangtang Glacier No.1 ice core on the central Tibetan Plateau: Likely proxies for climate and atmospheric circulations	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Qiangtang ice core; Glaciochemical records; Climate change; Central Tibetan Plateau	DUST EVENT FREQUENCY; SUMMER MONSOON; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS; REGIONAL-DISTRIBUTION; AMMONIUM RECORD; NORTHERN CHINA; ASIAN MONSOON; WIND-SPEED; PRECIPITATION	Previous studies of glaciochemical records retrieved from the southern and northern sectors of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have revealed that there are diverse patterns of climate change within this region. However, uncertainty remains regarding changes in the atmospheric environment over the central TP where the Indian monsoonal circulation and westerly winds meet. This study presents a glaciochemical record of the past 112 years from the upper part of the ice core drilled into the Qiangtang Glacier No.1 (QT-1) located in the central TP. The purpose of this study is to understand the glaciochemical controls, if any, and how these controls have been affected by both local climate parameters and atmospheric circulation patterns. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to determine the significance of any chemical components. The results show that the major soluble ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-) are predominantly controlled by crustal aerosols and have high loadings on EOF1. Correlation analysis between EOF1 and the annual dust-event frequency recorded by local/regional meteorological stations suggests that the ice core chemical record provides a reasonable proxy for local/regional atmospheric dust loading. Analysis of EOF1 also demonstrates changes that are consistent with regional meteorological parameters and large-scale circulations, revealing a strong link with the glaciochemical record. The windy, cold-dry climate and/or enhanced northwesterly/westerly winds appear to be responsible for the higher atmospheric dust aerosols, leading to higher concentrations of ions. Our analysis also isolated a significant positive correlation between EOF1 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, suggesting that, as an underlying mechanism, the PDO likely influences the regional climate conditions and atmospheric circulation patterns and thereby the QT-1 ion records. Our findings may, therefore, enhance the understanding of the relationship between chemical records and climatological variations that are preserved in ice cores, improve our knowledge of changes in the composition of the atmosphere and atmospheric circulation over the central TP, and potentially facilitate reconstruction of the paleo-PDO.

By using a novel continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory, the existence of anti-periodic solutions for DQVCNNs is obtained with or without assuming that the activation functions are bounded. Furthermore, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability of anti-periodic solutions for DQVCNNs. Our results are new and complementary to the known results even when DQVCNNs degenerate into real-valued or complex-valued neural networks. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Within the tailored parameter, the competition of the power-law exponent a and the Levy index it ensures the long tail of probability density function with the form P(chi) similar to 1/vertical bar chi vertical bar(mu/p+1) with p = 2/2-alpha falling rapidly when mu/p > 2. Meanwhile, we observe the subdiffusive motion that is characterized by the scale of ensemble averaged mean-square displacement (MSD), (chi(2)(t)) alpha t(k) with k = 2p/mu < 1. Furthermore, we also observe the weak ergodicity breaking which means the inequivalence between individual time averaged MSD and the corresponding ensemble averaged MSD. We quantify the weak ergodicity breaking behavior in terms of the dimensionless parameters EB and epsilon B. For 1 <= mu < 2 (except for mu = 2), the ergodicity breaking enhances as the alpha increases, but weakens as mu or D-0. Overall, the epsilon B follows the from, epsilon B proportional to (Delta/T)((1/2-2p/mu)), in the large time. Additionally, the anomalous diffusion above might be particularly relevant for ultracold atoms diffusion in heterogeneous media. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, little is known about the global pattern of gene expression changes during domestication.ResultsWe generated and collected transcriptome data for seven pairs of domestic animals and plants including dog, silkworm, chicken, rice, cotton, soybean and maize and their wild progenitors and compared the expression profiles between the domestic and wild species. Intriguingly, although the number of expressed genes varied little, the domestic species generally exhibited lower gene expression diversity than did the wild species, and this lower diversity was observed for both domestic plants and different kinds of domestic animals including insect, bird and mammal in the whole-genome gene set (WGGS), candidate selected gene set (CSGS) and non-CSGS, with CSGS exhibiting a higher degree of decreased expression diversity. Moreover, different from previous reports which found 2 to 4% of genes were selected by human, we identified 6892 candidate selected genes accounting for 7.57% of the whole-genome genes in rice and revealed that fewer than 8% of the whole-genome genes had been affected by domestication.ConclusionsOur results showed that domestication affected the pattern of variation in gene expression throughout the genome and generally decreased the expression diversity across species, and this decrease may have been associated with decreased genetic diversity. This pattern might have profound effects on the phenotypic and physiological changes of domestic animals and plants and provide insights into the genetic mechanisms at the transcriptome level other than decreased genetic diversity and increased linkage disequilibrium underpinning artificial selection.

Solar Magnetic Flux Rope Eruption Simulated by a Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Model	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Sun: activity; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields; Sun: photosphere	VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS; INSTABILITY; CATASTROPHE	The combination of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and multi-wavelength observations is an effective way to study the mechanisms of magnetic flux rope eruption. We develop a data-driven MHD model using the zero-beta approximation. The initial condition is provided by a nonlinear force-free field derived from the magnetofrictional method based on vector magnetic field observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The bottom boundary uses observed time series of the vector magnetic field and the vector velocity derived by the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms. We apply the datadriven model to active region 11123 observed from 06: 00 UT on 2010 November 11 to about 2 hr later. The evolution of the magnetic field topology coincides with the flare ribbons observed in the 304 and 1600 A. wavebands by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The morphology, propagation path, and propagation range of the flux rope are comparable with the observations in 304 A. We also find that a dataconstrained boundary condition, where the bottom boundary is fixed to the initial values, reproduces a similar simulation result. This model can reproduce the evolution of a magnetic flux rope in its dynamic eruptive phase.	[Guo, Yang; Ding, M. D.; Chen, P.

A xenograft model of A549 was established to evaluate the anti-tumor effect and histopathological examination was performed to assess the toxicity of GA-13315. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining in tissues and flow cytometry in cells; activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis; protein levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-4, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) were determined by western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured by the JC-1 fluorescence probe.ResultsOur results showed that GA-13315 exhibited potent, dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative activity, and the IC50 values were 37.432.73, 28.08 +/- 7.76 and 19.29 +/- 7.61M at 24, 48, and 72h, respectively. The xenograft experiment revealed that tumor weight and volume were significantly decreased after GA-13315 3mg/kg and 9mg/kg (P<0.05) treatment, and GA-13315 had low toxicity in bone marrow, kidney and colon tissues. GA-13315 triggered remarkable apoptosis in A549 cells at the concentration of 25.6M and 32M (P<0.05) and activated caspase-3, -8 and-9. Moreover, GA-13315 induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by elevating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, releasing cytochrome c and activating caspase-9 in A549 cells. In the endoplasmic reticulum apoptosis pathway, the levels of caspase-4, ATF4, GRP78 and GADD153 were markedly upregulated.Conclusions This study suggests that GA-13315 can be considered as a promising chemotherapeutic agent with anticancer activity in treatment of lung cancer in future.

Yunnan province, the congruity area of undeveloped region with high vehicle population increasing, as well as special natural conditions, was taken as the study area. We estimated the vehicle emissions during 2003-2015 with COPERT IV model, including private cars (PC), buses (BUS), light duty vehicles (LDV) and heavy duty trucks (HDT), then analyzed the vehicle emission characteristics, involving CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, Volatile organic compounds (VOC), Ambient Air Non-Methane Volatile Organic compound (NMVOC), CH4, PM2.5, PM10, PM (exhaust), Cadmium and Zinc. The results indicated that all pollutants as well as heavy metals were increased at different growth trends except SO2 although more stringent emission standard implementation, the rising of vehicle population become the main contributor to the vehicle emission growth, and CO2 emission was the major vehicle emissions accounted for one third of total CO2 emissions in Yunnan. PC was the main contributor to the rising of CO, VOC, NMVOC, CH4, NH3, CO2, Cadmium and Zinc, which was also the major vehicle growth type; HDT and LDV brought to the emissions of N2O, NOx, NO, PM10, NO2, PM2.5, and PM (exhaust) respectively. At last, uncertainty of emission estimation was analyzed based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The vehicle emission become one critical field of emission reduction in Yunnan which should be given greater emphasis to environmental concerns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, mesoporous Ag/Zn-LaFeO3 nanocomposite is successfully synthesized through a facile nanocasting technique using KIT-6 as a hard template in sol-gel route and used as sensing materials to achieve an exceptionally sensitive and selective detection of trace ppm-level ethanol. The obtained composite possesses high surface area and exhibits excellent sensing response (64.2 for 100 ppm) to ethanol at near-room with relatively fast response/recovery time. When tested with the concentrations as low as 5 ppm, it also shows a remarkably high selectivity to the ethanol, but only minor responses to other interfering gases. These enhanced gas-sensing properties are attributed to the combination of mesoporous nanostructure and Ag/Zn-LaFeO3 heterogeneous composites.

Molecular clock estimates suggest an early Cambrian divergence for pancrustaceans [2, 3]. Despite the wealth of Palaeozoic exceptional fossiliferous deposits [4-7], the early evolution of Pancrustacea remains elusive given the difficulty of recognizing synapomorphies between Cambrian forms and extant representatives. Although early studies suggested crustacean affinities for Cambrian bivalved euarthropods [8-11], this view has fallen out of favor by recent reappraisals of their morphology [12-16]. The best evidence for total-group pancrustaceans comes from Cambrian microfossils preserved as three-dimensional phosphatic replicates in Orsten-type assemblages [4, 17-19] or as "small carbonaceous fossils" (SCFs) [20, 21]. Although these taphonomic windows capture minute morphology enabling detailed comparisons with extant representatives, these microfossils are limited to larval stages (Orsten) or recalcitrant fragmentary remains (SCFs) restricting their phylogenetic precision [5, 12, 19, 20, 22, 23]. We employed X-ray computed tomography [24] to reveal the three-dimensionally appendage morphology of the Chengjiang bivalved euarthropod Ercaicunia multinodosa [25] from the early Cambrian of China. E. multinodosa possesses characters uniquely shared with extant crustaceans, including differentiated tritocerebral antennae and epipodite-bearing biramous trunk appendages. Similarities between E. multinodosa with clypecaridids [9], waptiids [16] and hymenocarines [11, 14] suggest that these euarthropods may also possess similarly differentiated appendages, but these details are obstructed by the limits of preservation of compacted macrofossils. E. multinodosa illuminates the early evolution of pancrustacean appendage differentiation and represents the oldest unequivocal crown-group mandibulate known from complete macrofossils [22].

Furthermore, skewed XCI has been reported to be related to many X-linked diseases. However, no statistical method is available in the literature to measure the degree of the skewness of XCI for case-control design. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for such a task.ResultsIn this article, we first proposed a statistical measure for the degree of XCI skewing by using a case-control design, which is a ratio of two logistic regression coefficients after a simple reparameterization. Based on the point estimate of the ratio, we further developed three types of confidence intervals (the likelihood ratio, Fieller's and delta methods) to evaluate its variation. Simulation results demonstrated that the likelihood ratio method and the Fieller's method have more accurate coverage probability and more balanced tail errors than the delta method. We also applied these proposed methods to analyze the Graves' disease data for their practical use and found that rs3827440 probably undergoes a skewed XCI pattern with 68.7% of cells in heterozygous females having the risk allele T active, while the other 31.3% of cells keeping the normal allele C active.ConclusionsFor practical application, we suggest using the Fieller's method in large samples due to the non-iterative computation procedure and using the LR method otherwise for its robustness despite its slightly heavy computational burden.

The main purpose of this paper is to study the low energy small solution sequence of systems of Kirchhoff-type equations by the variational approaches. Our result shows that the low energy vibration can be controlled by setting the parameters and this can be used for optimization of structures under small perturbations, e.g. the bridge vibration under winds.

Although structures of Env/gp120 in the liganded state are known, detailed information about dynamics of the liganded gp120 has remained elusive. Two structural models, the CD4-free gp120 and the gp120-CD4 complex, were subjected to mu s-scale multiple-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the effects of CD4 binding on the conformational dynamics, molecular motions, and thermodynamics of gp120. Comparative analyses of MD trajectories in terms of structural deviation and conformational flexibility reveal that CD4 binding effectively suppresses the overall conformational fluctuations of gp120. Despite the largest fluctuation amplitude of the V1/V2 region in both forms of gp120, the presence of CD4 prevents it from approaching the gp120 core. Comparison of the constructed free energy landscapes (FELs) shows that CD4 binding reduces the conformational entropy and conformational diversity while enhancing the stability of gp120. Further comparison of the representative structures extracted from free energy basins/minima of FELs reveals that CD4 binding weakens the reorientation ability of V1/V2 and hence hinders gp120 from transitioning out of the liganded state to the unliganded state. Therefore, locking gp120 conformation via restraining V1/V2 reorientation with small molecules seems to be a promising strategy to control HIV-1 infection. Our computer simulation results support the conformational selection mechanism for CD4 binding to gp120 and facilitate the understanding of HIV-1 immune evasion mechanisms.

Therefore, a polling-based access control is proposed in this paper using a sleeping schema to meet the challenge of quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficient transport in VANET environments for smart cities. Based on IEEE 802.11p, it was developed in an attempt to improve the energy efficiency of the hybrid coordination function of controlled channel access (HCCA) through a self-managing sleeping mechanism for both the roadside unit (RSU) and on-board units (OBUs) or sensor nodes according to the traffic load in vehicle -to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. Additionally, a Markov chain was developed for analyzing the proposed mechanism, and the exact mathematical model is provided with regard to the passive vacation. Then, the performance characteristicsincluding the mean cyclic period, delay, and queue lengthwere accurately obtained. In addition, the closed-form expression of the quantitative relationship among sleeping time, performance characteristics, and service parameters was obtained, which can easily evaluate the energy efficiency. It was proven that theoretical calculations were completely consistent with simulation results. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested method had much lower energy consumption than the standard strategy at the expense of rarely access delay.

However, some of the strategies may cause deficiencies in other software NFRs. These strategies are called conflicting strategies. Making the tradeoff decision of these conflicting strategies for NFRs is crucial. Therefore, a conflicting NFRs tradeoff framework (CNTF) and the corresponding method are proposed. Firstly, the NFRs are obtained from stakeholders. Fuzzy set theory is used to express stakeholder assessments on the importance of each NFR. The assessment results are ranked using a fuzzy ranking method. Then, adapting from production theory in microeconomics, the degree of satisfaction by which NFRs are affected by conflicting strategies are plotted as tradeoff curves. Borrowing the concept from the linear programming in management science, a tradeoff method is presented to help software project teams make the best tradeoff decision for conflicting NFRs. Finally, feasibility and limitations of the CNTF are elaborated in a case study.

Using the soluble graphene oxide (GO) as a precursor, graphene production can be achieved via photochemical reduction, paving the way for manufacturing graphene products in controllable microscopic patterns. In this work, I used a photochemical method to obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO), assisted by strong reducing -A & x002A;) radicals generated by photoinitiator Irgacure-907. The extent of oxygen reduction can be continually controlled by manipulating light dosage and characterized by quantitative measurements of structure, morphology, chemical composition and electrical conductivity. The high quality of obtained rGO makes this photochemical-reduction based technology ideal for inkjet printing microstructures of graphene, thus achieving desirable conductivity, other physical and chemical properties associated.

First, several statistical metrics were used to evaluate the CHIRPS data against 122 gauge observations acquired during 1981?2015. Then, the variation of drought was investigated further based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over multiple timescales. The results showed the following: (1) the CHIRPS data performed well in terms of monthly precipitation estimation (CC?=?0.89, RMSE?=?44.26, and MAE?=?27.89), albeit with slight overestimation of total precipitation (Bias?=?2.9%). Moreover, the CHIRPS data were found adequate in capturing the spatial distribution of precipitation. (2) The CHIRPS-based SPI was shown to be able to capture the occurrence and characteristics of drought events, suggesting that the CHIRPS dataset could be used as an alternative precipitation source for monitoring drought. (3) On the annual scale, it was found that the regions affected most frequently by drought are areas in central, western, and southern parts of Yunnan Province. High frequency of drought occurrence was observed in both spring and winter. Moreover, the results revealed a widespread drying trend over Yunnan Province during 1981?2015, especially in autumn and winter.

Although some per-butyrylated glucosides of podophyllotoxin and 4 beta-triazolyl-podophyllotoxin glycosides show good anticancer activity, the peracetylated/free of podophyllotoxin glucosides and their per-acetylated are not well studied. Methods: A few glucoside derivatives of PPT were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines, HL-60 (leukemia), SMMC-7721 (hepatoma), A-549 (lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and SW480 (colon cancer), as well as the normal human pulmonary epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). In addition, we investigated the structure-activity relationship and the physicochemical property-anticancer activity relationship of these compounds. Results: Compound 6b shows the highest cytotoxic potency against all five cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 3.27 +/- 0.21 to 11.37 +/- 0.52 mu M. We have also found that 6b displays higher selectivity than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possess similar physicochemical properties: MSA > 900, %PSA < 20, ClogP > 2, MW > 700 Da, and RB > 10. Conclusion: We synthesized several glucoside derivatives of PPT and tested their cytotoxicity. Among them, compound 6b showed the highest cytotoxicity. Further studies including selectivity of active compounds have shown that the selectivity indexes of 6b are much greater than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possessed similar physicochemical properties. This study indicates that active glucoside analogs of podophyllotoxin have potential as lead compounds for developing novel anticancer agents.

Among the foodborne pathogens, strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogen and Clostridium are very important because of its presence in a wide range of foodstuffs. A total of 520 food samples were collected at Peshawar (50%) and Mardan (50%), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, from April 2016 to March 2017. Isolates were cultured and discriminated by Grain stain, followed by biochemical identification, disk diffusion assay was performed using antibacterial and antifungal agents. Out of 520, only 122 (23.46%) samples were positive for various types of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria was the predominant (70.49%) followed by fungal pathogens (26.23%) and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens (3.27%) among the total positive samples. Prominent bacterial samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Staphylococcus ,saprophytic, Listeria spp., Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., whereas four fungal pathogens were also identified in various food items. Among the fungal pathogens isolated were Aspergillus nigar (50%), Candida krusei (19%), Fusarium oxysporium (6%) and Mucor (25%). Antibiogram analysis reveals that Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone Ciprofloxacin, Cefoxitin, Chloramphenicol, and Ceclor were more active against bacterial isolates. Fungal isolates had shown differential sensitivities toward Voriconazole. Local food markets of Peshawar and Mardan, KPK, Pakistan have more than 20% risk of foodborne pathogens. It is recommended that the general public should purchase neat and clean food and adopt mild processing techniques to make the food hygienic.

In terms of the Bouligand tangent cone and Clarke tangent cone, we introduce and study the Abadie constraint qualification (ACQ) and the strong ACQ for a nonconvex multifunction. With the help of the strong ACQ, we establish several primal characterizations for calmness and strong calmness of multifunctions with the Shapiro property (an extension of both convexity and smoothness). As applications, we consider linear regularity for a finite or infinite collection of closed (not necessarily convex) sets and establish some primal sufficient and necessary conditions for linear regularity, which extend and improve some existing results to either the nonconvex or the infinite index set case.

We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on the crystal structure of Ver112 to investigate its dynamic properties and large-scale concerted motions. The results indicate that the structural core of Ver112 shows a small fluctuation amplitude, whereas the substrate binding sites, and the regions close to and opposite the substrate binding sites experience significant conformational fluctuations. The large concerted motions obtained from essential dynamics (ED) analysis of MD trajectory can lead to open or close of the substrate binding sites, which are proposed to be linked to the functional properties of Ver112, such as substrate binding, orientation, catalytic, and release. The significant motion in the loop regions that is located opposite the binding sites are considered to play an important role in modulating the dynamics of the substrate binding sites. Furthermore, the bottom of free energy landscape (FEL) of Ver112 are rugged, which is mainly caused by the fluctuations of substrate binding regions and loops located opposite the binding site. In addition, the mechanism underlying the high flexibility and catalytic activity of Ver112 was also discussed. Our simulation study complements the biochemical and structural studies, and provides insight into the dynamics-function relationship of cuticle-degrading serine protease Ver112.

When a driver is in a state of fatigue, the facial expressions, e.g., the frequency of blinking and yawning, are different from those in the normal state. In this paper, we propose a system called DriCare, which detects the drivers' fatigue status, such as yawning, blinking, and duration of eye closure, using video images, without equipping their bodies with devices. Owing to the shortcomings of previous algorithms, we introduce a new face-tracking algorithm to improve the tracking accuracy. Further, we designed a new detection method for facial regions based on 68 key points. Then we use these facial regions to evaluate the drivers' state. By combining the features of the eyes and mouth, DriCare can alert the driver using a fatigue warning. The experimental results showed that DriCare achieved around 92% accuracy.

The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and rapid light response curves of eight Rhododendron species were determined under field conditions across elevation gradients (at elevations of 2,950, 3,560, 3,660, 3,770, and 4,030 m) in the Jiaozi Mountain National Natural Reserve, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. The effect of different elevations, species, and their interactions significantly affected most of the chlorophyll fluorescence and rapid light response curve parameters. The variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-m) ranged from 0.78 to 0.81 at the five elevation gradients. This result indicated that the studied species were well grown and adapted to the current environment. The correlation analysis indicated that the elevation was positively significantly correlated with the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, electron transport rate, maximum electron transport rate, light saturation coefficient (E-k), and chlorophyll relative content (SPAD: leaf chlorophyll content index) and was negatively significantly correlated with photochemical quenching, nonphotochemical quenching, and linear initial slope values. Although no significant relationship was observed between the elevations and F-v/F-m, the apparent difference in F-v/F-m both at elevation gradients and elevation x species levels indicated that the Rhododendron species demonstrated species-specific adaptation to the environment at different elevations. Our results provided evidence that Rhododendron species exhibit variations in photosynthetic activities in an alpine environment at different elevations. These differences may improve the understanding of the physiological adaptation variations of Rhododendron species across elevation gradients in association with climate change in the mountains of southwestern China.

Methods: In this study, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) of a series of 38 S-DABO analogues developed in our lab was studied using Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA). The Docking/MMFF94s computational protocol based on the co-crystallized complex (PDB ID: 1RT2) was used to determine the most probable binding mode and to obtain reliable conformations for molecular alignment. Statistically significant CoMFA (q(2)=0.766 and r(2)=0.949) and CoMSIA (q(2)=0.827 and r(2)=0.974) models were generated using the training set of 30 compounds on the basis of hybrid docking-based and ligand-based alignment. Results: The predictive ability of CoMFA and CoMSIA models was further validated using a test set of eight compounds with predictive r(pred)(2) values of 0.843 and 0.723, respectively. Conclusion: The information obtained from the 3D contour maps can be used in designing new S-DABO derivatives with improved HIV-1 inhibitory activity.

The results showed that the environmental efficiency value of industrial cluster districts in China ranged between 0.83 and 0.94 not considering carbon emission, and it had a certain degree of reduction when considering the effect of undesirable output, maintaining values between 0.74 and 0.84, and which showed that there was much room for improving the environmental condition of the industrial cluster districts in China Carbon emission had a great impact on the environment of China's industrial cluster, which resulted in a greater degree of efficiency loss. And it showed that the carbon emissions showed a great difference to the sensitivity degree of influence on regional environmental efficiency.

Despite its high adaptivity and frequency resolution, the effectiveness of VMD highly depends on parameters, including mode number K, initial center frequency omega(init), and the penalty coefficient alpha. To tackle this problem, an improved VMD is proposed, which involves: 1) the spectrum of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) to determine optimal K, omega(init) and 2) the summation of permutation entropy (SPE) to optimize alpha, respectively. The presence of nonlinearity can be monitored by investigating the relationships among different frequencies of the process variable (PV) in the control loops. In addition, the oscillation detector based on the improved VMD is capable of distinguishing multiple oscillations, even when both nonlinear and linear oscillations from different sources occur. The proposed method is completely adaptive and data driven, which acts without a priori knowledge. The validity of the raised approach is verified by a set of simulations as well as industrial applications.

For instance, an image-based intelligent technology, such as image classification of diseases, is widely used in daily life. However, the image in real life is mostly unlabeled, so the performance of many image-based intelligent models shows limitations. Therefore, how to use a large amount of unlabeled image data to build an efficient and high-quality model for better urban life has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised image feature extraction method that is referred to as a stacked multi-granularity convolution denoising auto-encoder (SMGCDAE). The algorithm is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), yet it introduces a multi-granularity kernel. This approach resolved issues with image unicity by extracting a diverse category of high-level features. In addition, the denoising auto-encoder ensures stability and improves the classification accuracy by extracting more robust features. The algorithm was assessed using three image benchmark datasets and a series of meningitis images, achieving higher average accuracy than other methods.

To this end, we propose a novel correctness enforcement approach for collaborative business processes. In this approach, given an original process, we first propose an algorithm for automatically detecting its correctness. Then, in case the original process is partially correct, we prune it to generate its core. The core captures all legal traces in the original process. Finally, an enforced process is yielded from the core through coordination mapping (i.e., inserting additional coordination activities into original processes). Our approach is implemented as a prototype tool called cet (a correctness enforcement tool for collaborative business processes), and a series of experiments is conducted to validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, in some applications, this assumption may be inappropriate. To this end, this paper proposes a transformation spatial mixed models (TSMMs) to accommodate large dataset that follows the non-Gaussian distribution. With the help of Gibbs sampler algorithm, a semiparametric Bayesian approach is developed to make inference on TSMMs by using Bayesian P-splines to approximate transformation function, and a fixed number of known but not necessarily orthogonal spatial basis functions with multi-resolution analysis method to approximate nonstationary spatial process. Instead of Wishart distribution assumption for the prior of precision matrix of random effects, we consider Cholesky decomposition of the precision matrix, and specify the priors for unknown components in low unit triangular matrix and diagonal matrix. Simulation studies and an example are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

Eight-week-old female MRL/Ipr mice were used to establish the lupus nephritis model. Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis was conducted for lupus nephritis. Anti-dsDNA IgG and BAFF level were detected by ELISA. Cells directly isolated from the spleen were used to detect macrophage subsets and activation status by FACS. Curcumin reduced the total IgG and anti-dsDNA IgG levels in blood and reduced the activation of B cells in MRL/Ipr mice. Moreover, curcumin prevented activation of macrophages in MRL/Ipr mice. Levels of BAFF in serum, spleens and kidneys were also reduced in curcumin-treated MRL/Ipr mice. In vitro experiments showed that curcumin reduced the activation of macrophage and leaded to the decrease of BAFF from them upon toll like receptor (TLR) 4 stimulation. Curcumin attenuates lupus nephritis in MRL/lpr mice by inhibiting macrophages activation and their secreting BAFF, which may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of SLE.

Chitin can be degraded by chitinases, which are important virulence factors in pathogenic fungi. Knowledge about the biosynthesis and degradation of chitin, and the enzymes responsible, has accumulated in recent years. In this review, we analyze the amino acid sequences of chitin synthases from several typical fungi. These enzymes can be divided into seven groups. While the different chitin synthases from a single fungus share a low degree of similarity, the same type of chitin synthase from different fungi shows high similarity. The number of chitinase genes in fungi display wide variation, from a single gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to 36 genes in Trichoderma virens. Chitinases from different fungi can be divided into four groups. The functions of chitin synthases and chitinases in several typical fungi are summarized, and the crystal structures of chitinases and chitinase modification are also discussed.

These alkali-rich magmatic rocks include granites and syenites. The former includes granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry, and the later consists of syenite porphyry and trachyte. In this paper, we report major and trace elemental composition, zircon U-Pb geochronology and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition of these alkali-rich magmatic rocks. The zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the granites and syenites formed at 35. 1 similar to 36. 1Ma and 35. 7 similar to 35. 8Ma, respectively, consistent with the Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatic rocks in western Yunnan. Geochemical results showed that the granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry belong to high-K calc-alkalic series, with Si02 contents of 67. 92% similar to 69. 93% and K2O/Na2O ratios of 0. 86 similar to 1. 22. The syenite porphyry and trachyte belong to shoshonite series, with Si02 contents of 53. 94% similar to 63. 51% and K2O/Na2O ratios of 1. 20 similar to 2. 68. They are both enriched in alkali, K2 0, light rare-earth elements ( LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements ( LILEs), but depleted in high field strength elements ( HFSEs) relatively. The granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry geochemically show adakitic affinity, characterized by high Sr contents and high ratios of Sr/Y, La/Yb, but low Y and Yb contents. These geochemical signatures, along with Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions, reveal that the granites were product of partial melting of thickened mafic lower crust and the syenites were derived from direct partial melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle with various degree of fractionation. These alkali-rich magmatic rocks in the Jianchuan area formed during the late stage of collision between Indian and Eurasian continents. The Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatism is the response to asthenospheric upwelling, following the thinning of mantle lithosphere in western Yunnan.

The research results showed that: (1) the roots-soil complex samples has no peak strength and has the characteristic of strain hardening. The lower moisture constant, the more obvious the characteristic of strain hardening, (2) under the action of the same vertical pressure, the shear strength tends to decrease with the increase of moisture content. The maximum value of shear strength is 208Kpa (vertical stress is 400kpa and moisture content is 25%), and the minimum is 47kpa (vertical stress is 100kpa and moisture content is 40%), (3)with the change of moisture content, the cohesive force and the angle of internal friction are negatively correlated. The cohesive force of soil samples decreases with the increase of moisture content, while the angle of internal friction increases. The decrease of shear strength with the increase of moisture content is mainly determined by the decrease of cohesive force, (4) when the roots content is less and the moisture content is lower(moisture content <= 35% and roots content <= 0.93mg/cm(3)), the failure mode is that the complex samples is broken as a whole and the root is pulled. When the roots content is higher and the moisture content is larger (moisture content =35% and roots content =1.4mg/cm(3) or moisture content =45% and roots content >= 0.467mg/cm(3) ), the failure mode is that the contact surface between roots and soil shows shear failure, and the roots is pulled out of the soil. At this time, the shear body is the roots, and the resulting cohesive force is negative, which does not conform to coulomb's law. Therefore, coulomb's law is not applicable to the study of the shear strength of root-soil complex with high moisture content and vegetation roots.

MTERF3 is overexpressed in liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. However, whether MTERF3 is up-regulated in brain glioma is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of MTERF3 in brain glioma and to analyze its potential prognostic value in brain glioma. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and a semi-quantitative RT-PCR were performed to analyze the protein and mRNA expression levels of MTERF3 in 28 human brain glioma tissues and 10 noncancerous brain tissues. The expression data of MTERF3 and its clinical information in brain glioma were downloaded from the TCGA dataset using R 2.15.3 software. The relationship between the expression of MTERF3 and its clinicopathological characteristics and its prognostic value was analyzed. A Cox regression model was used for a multivariate analysis of the factors affecting the prognosis of brain glioma. The immunohistochemistry results showed that the MTERF3 protein is located in the cytoplasm, and the positive expression rate of the MTERF3 protein in brain glioma tissues is 64.29%. We found that the positive expression rate of the MTERF3 protein in high-grade glioma tissues (81.25%) is higher than it is in low-grade glioma tissues (41.67%). The expression levels of the MTERF3 mRNA and protein in brain glioma tissues are significantly higher than they are in the noncancerous brain tissues. Moreover, the expression of MTERF3 is significantly correlated with age, tumor type, and pathological classification (P<0.05). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a high expression level of MTERF3 mRNA indicated a poor prognosis (log rank P<0.01). Furthermore, a multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and tumor type were independent prognostic factors for brain glioma patients. A GEPIA analysis suggested that the expression levels of MTERF3 are positively correlated with the TFAM, TFB1M, TFB2M, MTERF1, MTERF2, TEFM, and MFN1 genes, but negatively correlated with the PINK1 gene. The expression level of MTERF3 had no correlation with the MTERF4 gene. In conclusion, these data indicate that the expression of MTERF3 in glioma tissue samples can be used as a prognostic factor for patients with glioma and that a high MTERF3 expression correlates with a poor prognosis in glioma patients.

How to allocate limited channel resources reasonably and reliably to each competing user is a problem that the access protocol of the MAC (Multiple Access Control) layer needs to solve. As an important way of random access, NP-CSMA (Non Persistent Carrier Sense Multiple Access) has a higher network throughput rate when the arrival rate is higher. This paper analyzes and improves the implemented NP-CSMA model, and obtains a three-slot NP-CSMA model. The mathematical tool MATLAB is used to analyze the network throughput, delay and energy efficiency of the model, and compare several random multiple access protocols adheres to the network throughput, they are NP-CSMA, Three-slot NP-CSMA, 1-persistent CSMA, P-persistent CSMA, and concludes that the three-slot NP-CSMA is significantly letter than several other multiple access protocols. Finally, using Quartus to design the three-slot NP-CSMA circuit, the statistical value of the circuit system is compared with the theoretical value of the model, and the error is less than 0.01, which proves that the system is reasonable in design and can be applied to wireless communication networks.

Our study aimed to identify the nematostatic metabolites and evaluate the biocontrol efficiency in pot experiments. As the bacterial culture filtrate showed 100% nematostatic activity against M. incognita juveniles in 12 hr, we isolated and identified six compounds following activity guiding. 3-methoxycyclobutane-1, 2-dione showed 58.9% and 72.2% nematostatic activities against juveniles of M. incognita in 12 and 48 hr, with strong LC50 value at 447 mu g mL(-1). In pot experiments, treatments with the bacterial culture filtrate of strain ZKB-2 showed significant efficacy, especially at doses of 150 mL/pot, which were close to that of avermectin (positive control) at 0.01 g kg(-1) soil. The most effective treatment inhibited 85.1% population of juveniles of M. incognita in the roots and 76.9% in the rhizosphere soil after 30 days. Furthermore, the promoting tomato growth also significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Our results revealed the potential of strain ZKB-2 to act as a biocontrol agent in the integrated management of root-knot nematodes on tomatoes.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of CGA on tumor cells was investigate in vitro and in vivo and its possible mechanisms involving filamentous actin (F-actin) organization was investigated. By cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis, we demonstrate that CGA effectively inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro. Also, CGA treatment inhibits migration and invasive ability of cancer cells. Further studies revealed that CGA modulates mTORC2-associated signaling pathways with decreased phosphorylation of p-protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha), Akt, decreased expression of Rictor and F-actin which are known to activate cell growth and organize the actin cytoskeleton. Consistently, administration of CGA to mice bearing tumor cell-implanted xenografts also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that the mTORC2/F-actin pathway is involved in CGA-induced tumor suppression. CGA might have the potential to become an anti-cancer agent.

This study used 16S rRNA Miseq sequence to investigate the sediment archaeal community structure and diversity of Bruguiera gymnoihiza mangrove forest in China along three different distribution areas. The results showed rich methanogen and ammonia-oxidizing archaea resources in the study site, with Methanobacterium, Methanothrix, Methanomassiliicoccus, Nitrosopumilus and Nitrososphaera (>1%) as the dominant genera. Mantel test and Redundancy analysis (RDA) results revealed that pH was the determinant for archaeal community structure in our study. The RDA result showed that the available K also contributed to archaeal community structure. There was a significant and positive relationship between pH and available P; in addition, the two values were significantly and negatively related to the observed OTU number. These results suggested that pH is the main determinant of the archaeal community structure and diversity in distribution areas of Bruguiera gymnoihiza in Dongzhaigang.

In order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of cyanobacterial bloom decline to P amounts in Caohai, a typical cyanobacteria-dominated sub-lake in northern Dianchi Lake, the P concentrations in algae during the peak and bottom of cyanobacterial bloom were measured and calculated. Remote sensing monitoring analysis and monthly monitoring data showed that the cyanobacterial bloom in Caohai developed from June, reached its peak in July to August and then declined to its bottom from December to February. The concentrations of different phosphorus forms contained in algal cells were different between the peak and bottom of the cyanobacterial bloom. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in algae (TP-A) were higher in summer than in winter, while the TP content per unit Chl-a in winter was much larger than in summer. The annual released TP was approximately 24.12 tons in 2016, and its potential contribution to TP and Ortho-P in water body of Caohai was around 0.958 and 0.647 mg.L-1, respectively. The P release amount was 303.30 and 20.57 tons in 2011 and 2014, respectively. For Caohai of Dianchi Lake, the P released from bloom-cyanobacteria could provide adequate P for the next year's bloom recovery.

Since Clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra and its multiplication is noncommutative, to overcome the difficulty of the noncommutativity of the multiplication of Clifford numbers, we first decompose the considered Clifford-valued neural network into 2m2n real-valued systems. Second, based on the Banach fixed point theorem, we establish the existence and uniqueness of almost periodic solutions of the considered neural networks. Then, by designing a novel state-feedback controller and constructing a proper Lyapunov function, we study the global asymptotic synchronization of the considered neural networks. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our results.

This is particularly important to the practice of restoration-friendly cultivation for conserving over-collected medicinal orchids, for example, many species of Dendrobium in China. In this study, we comparatively investigated the effects of fungi from roots and protocorms/seedlings on seed germination, protocorm formation and seedling development in Dendrobium exile. A total of 7 different fungal species were obtained, including three rhizoctonia fungi (Tulasnella sp. DerIV, Tulasnella sp. DerV and Tulasnella sp. DesI), three non-rhizoctonia fungi (Nodulisporium sp. DerI, Xylaria plebeja DerII, Colletotrichum sp. DerIII) and one unidentified fungus DesII. Among the three rhizoctonia fungi, DesI isolated from seedlings was more efficient at supporting seed germination up to seedlings than the two fungi (DerIV and DerV) isolated from adult roots. At 45 days of incubation, 70.93 +/- 6.92% of seeds developed into seedlings in DesI treatment, while no seedlings were developed in the DerIV and DerV treatments. Our results indicated that orchids may need different fungal partners for seed symbiotic germination vs. adult plant development. The diverse fungi residing in the roots could have potentially diverse functions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Not only does more than 80% of the information received by humans comes from the visual system, but the human visual system also gives its fast, accurate, and efficient image processing capability. In the current image classification task, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) focus on processing pixels and often ignore the semantic relationships and human brain mechanisms. With the development of image analysis and processing techniques, the information in the image is becoming increasingly complicated. Humans can learn about the characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to classify the images. It is a significant characteristic that sets humans apart from the modern learning-based computer vision algorithms. How to make full use of the semantic relationships in categories and how to apply the knowledge of biological vision to image classification are our main concerns. In this view, we propose the concept of the image knowledge graph (IKG) to incorporate the semantic association and the scene association to fully consider the relations between objects (external and internal). We take full advantage of the reasoning model of the knowledge graph that is closer to the biological visual information-processing model. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale image datasets (ImageNet), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our method participates in ILSVRC 2017 challenges and obtains the new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet (82.43%).

Without decomposing the considered neural networks into real-valued systems, based on a continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory and the Wirtinger inequality, the existence of anti-periodic solutions of the networks is established. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, the global exponential stability of anti-periodic solutions of the networks is obtained.

Such problems refer to the combination of two areas of MINLP and nonsmooth optimization. For solving these minimax convex MINLP problems, we consider an outer approximation method and use KKT optimality conditions and subgradients to reformulate MINLP as an equivalent mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Then we construct an outer approximation algorithm for solving a sequence of relaxed MILP problems so as to find the optimal solution of MINLP. The algorithm is proved to terminate after a finite number of steps. To illustrate the feasibility of the outer approximation method for such problems, several minimax convex MINLP examples are provided and calculated by this algorithm. All computational tests are implemented by MILP solvers of Matlab and BARON.

The applied strain includes in-layer biaxial strain and uniaxial strain. The monolayer C3N is composed of a number of hexagonal C rings withN atoms connecting them. It is a stable indirect band gap 2D semiconductor when the strain is 0%. It could maintain indirect semiconductive character under different biaxial and uniaxial strains from epsilon = -10% to epsilon = 10%. As for its optical properties, when the uniaxial strain is applied, the absorption and reflectivity along the armchair and zigzag directions exhibit an anisotropic property. However, an isotropic property is presented when the biaxial strain is applied. Most importantly, both uniaxial tensile strain and biaxial tensile strain could cause the high absorption coefficient of monolayer C3N to be in the deep ultraviolet region. This study implies that strain engineering is an effective approach to alter the electronic and optical properties of monolayer C3N. We suggest that monolayer C3N could be suitable for applications in optoelectronics and nanoelectronics.

In order to overcome the non-commutativity of the multiplication of Clifford numbers, we first transform the Clifford-valued RNNs with discrete and infinitely distributed delays into real-valued systems based on the multiplication rule and properties of Clifford numbers. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of almost automorphic solutions for the neural networks under consideration by applying the contraction mapping principle, and we obtain the globally asymptotic almost automorphic synchronization of the neural networks under consideration by designing a novel state feedback controller and constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function. Finally, we present a numerical example to illustrate the feasibility of the results of this paper.

Since there has been sufficient local information in the PSSM-SAA vector with high dimensionality, four global algorithms of dimensional reduction are suggested, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), median LDA (MDA), generalized Fisher discriminant analysis (GDA), and median-mean line-based discriminant analysis (MMLDA). PSSM-SAA is also compared with three important expressions: PSSM-S, DipCPSSM, and PsePSSM. Numerical experiments involving the overall success rate (OSR) show that PSSM-SAA is much better than PSSM-S and DipCPSSM and slightly better than or equal in performance to PsePSSM regardless of which dimension reduction algorithm is used. LDA is finally recommended for PSSM-SAA through comparison among four techniques of dimensional reduction. Other popular evaluation indexes also confirm the effectiveness of PSSM-SAA with LDA. Next, the suggested model is compared with the state-of-the-art predictors to further evaluate its validity. Finally, a new user-friendly local software for implementing PSSM-SAA is provided, which can be found at https://www.github.com/caozicheng/PSSM SAA-Builder.

Production and Identification of Interspecific Hybrids between Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and the Wild Relative (Capsicum frutescens L.)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Gene transfer; Interspecific hybridization; Introgression breeding; Morphological descriptors	DOMESTICATED CAPSICUM; INHERITANCE; BARRIERS; CHINENSE	Wild pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.) could be a source of variation to improve cultivated pepper due to its unique traits with adapting challenges caused by adversity. Interspecific hybridization has been used as an effective way of pepper introgression breeding, which transfers genes of interest from wild relatives to cultivated crops. Here, eight fertile hybrids F-1 were produced from pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and the wild relative (C. frutescens), as female and male, respectively, by interspecific hybridization. Interspecific hybrids were identified using conventional morphological descriptors and SSR molecular markers. The results showed that significant differences in agronomic traits existed among cultivated pepper, wild relatives, and interspecific hybrid F-1. Interspecific hybrid F-1 presented intermediate values, although they were closer to the wild species in most of the agronomic traits. Analysis of SSR markers clearly showed that interspecific hybrid F-1 had bands from the paternal and maternal accessions, which indicated that F-1 hybrid was heterozygous. Our results provide hybrid for breeder to transfer genes of interest from wild relative, C. frutescens, to cultivated pepper, which is an important step for introgression breeding.

In this study, we report NiO decorated biomass porous carbon derived from pine nut shells as a promising microwave absorbing material by a facile strategy. The NiO/biomass porous carbon (BPC) is thermally converted from Ni(OH)(2)/BPC with BPC as the base for precipitation. All products were characterized by XRD, Raman, and SEM techniques, which reveals that the NiO nanoflakes were uniformly self-assembled on the surface of the activated carbon. Compared with counterparts of pure Ni(OH)(2) and Ni(OH)(2)/BPC, a large reflection loss peak of -33.8 dB at 16.4 GHz is achieved for the NiO/BPC composites, and the absorption bandwidth less than -10 dB can reach up to about 6.7 GHz (from 11.3 to 18.0 GHz) with a thickness of 8 mm. The enhanced microwave absorption properties originate from the electric/dielectric polarization and the unique NiO decorated BPC structures. The expanded interfaces, such as NiO-NiO, Ni-BPC and NiO-paraffin interfaces in the complicated porous composites, could boost the interfacial polarization as well as related relaxation which results in enhanced dielectric loss and electromagnetic absorbing properties. In addition, NiO/BPC nanocomposites exhibit comparatively better matching of permittivity and permeability. It is expected that our present investigation could provide a new possibility for biomass based fabrication of potential microwave absorbing materials.

Typically, feature extraction by deep neural networks makes use of all words in a document, which cannot scale well for a long document. In this paper, we propose to tackle the long document classification task by incorporating the recurrent attention learning framework, which can produce the discriminative features with significantly less words. Specifically, the core work is to train a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based controller, which can focus its attention on the discriminative parts. Then, the glimpsed feature is extracted by a typical short text level convolutional neural network (CNN) from the focused group of words. The controller locates its attention according to the context information, which consists of the coarse representation of the original document and the memorized glimpsed features. By glimpsing a few groups, the document can be classified by aggregating these glimpsed features and the coarse representation. For our collected 11-class 10 000-word arXiv paper data set, the proposed method outperforms two subsampled deep CNN baseline models by a large margin given much less observed words.

The existing traffic accident's severity prediction methods mainly use shallow severity prediction models and statistical models. To promote the prediction accuracy, a novel traffic accident's severity prediction-convolutional neural network (TASP-CNN) model for traffic accident's severity prediction is proposed that considers combination relationships among traffic accident's features. Based on the weights of traffic accident's features, the feature matrix to gray image (FM2GI) algorithm is proposed to convert a single feature relationship of traffic accident's data into gray images containing combination relationships in parallel as the input variables for the model. Moreover, experiments demonstrated that the proposed model for traffic accident's severity prediction has a better performance.

As one of the important signs of the development of information warfare, the tactical data chain overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional warfare platforms and wins the opportunity to master the battlefield situation, improve decision-making efficiency, and enhance the cooperative combat capability. The access control protocol determines how the user sites share the channel resources in the tactical data link system, which has an important impact on system performance and has always been a hot issue in tactical data link research. A multi-level priority polling MAC protocol (MPPMP) is proposed for the actual demand of multi-user multi-priority transmission control in tactical data link systems. The protocol can control the arrival rate of user packets at all levels based on the priority weight matrix named P which based on the user's priority level in the tactical data link system. The simulation results show that the MPPMP can meet the multi-priority transmission control requirements of each user in the system and overcomes the problem that the traditional polling MAC protocol has a single control function. In addition, the design and implementation of MPPMP are implemented by FPGA. The feasibility and correctness of the design are verified by the simulation test and statistical analysis.

Thus, the modeling and correctness of private processes is a key issue that business designers should consider at design time. To this end, we propose an approach for constructing correct private processes in a refinement manner. In this approach, we first present a formal model for private processes and abstract the control flow of the model into four basic blocks. Then, we derive a set of refinement rules for the four basic blocks and present an approach that relies on the refinement rules for constructing correct private processes. Finally, we prove that the private process established by our approach is correct at the syntax and semantic levels, and thus a subsequent correctness verification is avoided. Our approach is validated through a case study, and the results show that the approach is more effective than the existing work in terms of modeling private processes.

Such searches enable the data owner to search on the encrypted data stored on the cloud without leaking any information. To obtain a better search experience, researchers have proposed many schemes which mainly focus on conjunctive and disjunctive keyword searches. However, conjunction of all the keywords may result in very few results, whereas a disjunction will return too many results. With the current schemes, customizing the relevancy of the keywords to obtain the desired results is difficult. To solve these problems, we propose a novel scheme that supports the search with the user-specified number of keywords contained in the search result. This number n can be used to customize the keyword relevancy. As a result, the data owner could obtain the desired search results containing any n keywords of a keyword set. The proposed scheme also supports the traditional disjunctive and conjunctive keyword searches when n equals 1 or the size of the keyword set, respectively. The keyword could be positive or negative.

Here, we present high-quality draft genomes of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus) with scaffold N50 of 6.04Mb and 3.96 Mb, respectively. Sequence alignment comprising genomes of three canid species reveals SVs specific to the dog, particularly 16 315 insertions, 2565 deletions, 443 repeats, 16 inversions and 15 translocations. Functional annotation of the dog SVs associated with genes indicates their enrichments in energy metabolisms, neurological processes and immune systems. Interestingly, we identify and verify at population level an insertion fully covering a copy of the AKR1B1 (Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member B) transcript. Transcriptome analysis reveals a high level of expression of the new AKR1B1 copy in the small intestine and liver, implying an increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis and antioxidant ability in dog compared to gray wolf, likely in response to dietary shifts during the agricultural revolution. For the first time, we report a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of SVs during the domestication step of dogs. Our findings demonstrate that retroposition can birth new genes to facilitate domestication, and affirm the importance of large-scale genomic variants in domestication studies.

Recently, many researchers focused on mining disease diagnosis to innovate the hidden patterns and their relevant features. Mining bio-medical data is one of the predominant research areas where clustering techniques are emphasized in heart disease diagnosis. But few people deal with large heart disease datasets and then classify disease data sets according to heart disease feature. We propose a method of anomaly threshold based on multiple classifiers can be well suited to datasets containing abnormal data, and use XGBoost algorithm as a sub-classifier to process massive ECG data. This research focuses on the heart disease classification problem. The data set is divided into two categories, and then it was classified into more specific categories, experimental results show that this method can improve classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on massive instances of different heart disease obtained from the hospital actual cases and two data sets of UCI. In fact, we compared SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, Logistic, RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, and found that tree-based model classifier is the best fit to predict arrhythmia. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance to the processing and forecasting system of large medical data sets, and promote the development of wisdom medical care.

Our algorithm hybridizes deep-learning algorithms such as word2vec and recurrent neural network (RNN) with classical techniques to improve the performance of text analysis. Given the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the software requirement descriptions on websites, the instance-transfer learning method is utilized to construct a robust classifier and predict domain feature knowledge based on domain knowledge similar to the target domain. The bagging clustering algorithm is utilized with multiple clustering algorithms to help select transfer instances. [Author to confirm changes.] The RNN-based algorithm is utilized as a useful alternative to predict missing features by studying the requirement descriptions of a related software system, while word2vec is utilized to extract sensible feature keywords for the specific software domain. [Author to confirm changes.] Our RNN model for every subclass is based on the clustering result, and we construct subclass classifiers to recommend requirement keywords. Requirement features recommended by our algorithm potentially increase opportunities for requirement classification, promote software requirement quality, and deliver more reliable software products. We explain the details of implementation and perform experimental work on real requirement descriptions to establish its worth.

Based on the study on the core LGH2 from Lugu Lake, we inferred that the Rb/Sr ratio of sediments in closed lakes is inversely correlated with precipitation and open lakes are positively correlated. In semi closed lake, the Rb/Sr ratio is always positively correlated with precipitation different from closed lakes. According to the indicative significance of the Rb/Sr ratio, the paleoprecipitation evolution sequence in Lugu Lake basin since 16 cal. ka BP could be divided into six evolutionary stages: 1) the late glacial period (16.0-14.7cal. ka BP), the Rb/Sr ratio rose rapidly indicating that precipitation increased rapidly, and the climate had changed from dry to wet; 2) the Bolling-Allerod(BA) warm period (14.7-12.9 cal. ka BP), the ratio of Rb/Sr rapidly increased and remained high, indicating that precipitation increased; 3) the Younger Dryas (YD) period (12.9-11.6 cal. ka BP), the decrease of Rb/Sr ratio indicated that precipitation decreased; 4) the Early-Middle Holocene (11.6-3.5 cal. ka BP), the ratio of Rb/Sr was almost in the high value area, the precipitation was abundant, it was the warmest and humid period since the 16.0 cal. ka BP, the variation of Rb/Sr ratio indicated the climate was unstable, there are eight droughts (11.38-11.1, 10.35-10.22, 9.4-9.0, 8.39-7.66, 5.95-5.75, 5.3-5.06, 4.56-4.13 and 3.87-3.71cal. BP); 5) the sharp change drought period (3.5-3.0 cal. ka BP), the Rb/Sr ratio decreasing rapidly indicated that precipitation decreased suddenly, it had undergone about 500 years of drought event; 6) the Late Holocene(3.0cal. ka BP to 0), the Rb/Sr ratio reached lower value, and fluctuated four times greatly, indicating that precipitation, the lake water level decreased and the southwest monsoon weakened, there were four drought events: 3-2.82, 2.55-2.30, 1.3-1.1 and 0.43-0.25 cal. ka BP. The variation of Rb/Sr ratio in sediments from Lugu Lake responses to the change of Asian monsoon driven by solar radiation since 16 cal. ka BP. It can also sensitively capture the influence of cold and dry climate from high latitudes, such as YD cold event, 8.2 and 4.2 cal. ka BP event, and also reflect the local regional climate feature, such as 3.5 and 2.5 cal. ka BP., which also proves that the delta O-18 value can indicate the change of local precipitation. Therefore, considering the closed and open state of lakes, it can be clearly and concretely explained the true implication of Rb/Sr ratio in Lugu lake sediment. However, it is prudent to use TOC to explain the climate change in semi-enclosed lakes.

Astrocytes not only regulate glutamate metabolism and clearance, they also produce neurotrophins in the brain. However, the direct interaction between neurons and astrocytes remains unknown. Methods: This study evaluated the cellular mechanisms by which astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) protects prefrontal cortical neurons from glutamate-induced death by measuring cell viability and morphology as well as mRNA and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), BDNF receptors, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Neurons and astrocytes were purified from the brains of neonatal 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. ACM was harvested after exposing astrocytes to culture medium containing 100 mu M glutamate for 48 h. Results: Glutamate insult (100 mu M for 6 h) significantly reduced neuronal cell viability and increased the mRNA expression of BDNF. Glutamate (24 h) decreased neuronal viability and the expression of BDNF, but increased mRNA expression of GFAP, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and TNF-alpha. ACM pretreatment (2 h) reversed glutamate-decreased cell viability and increased BDNF, but reduced the expression of GDNF, P75NTR, and TNF-alpha at the mRNA level. Western blotting generally confirmed the mRNA expression following 24 glutamate insults. Furthermore, the glutamate-induced decrease in the protein expression of BDNF and full-length TrkB receptor and increase in pro-BDNF, truncated TrkB isoform 1 receptor, p75NTR, GDNF, and TNF-alpha were significantly attenuated by ACM pretreatment. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that ACM exerts neuroprotective effects on cell viability, and this effect is most likely mediated through the modulation of neurotrophin and TNF-alpha expression.

This paper discusses the situation where one faces current status data and also there exists informative censoring or when the failure time of interest and the observation process are correlated. Several authors have discussed the problem and in particular, Zhang et al. (2005) and Zhao et al. (2015) proposed an estimating equation-based approach and a copula model-based method, respectively. However, the former may not be efficient and the latter needs some restrictive assumptions. To address these, we propose a sieve maximum likelihood estimation approach that can be more efficient and also does not require the assumption above. For the implementation of the method, an EM algorithm is developed and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method works well in practical situations and an application is provided.

J	Liu, L; Tang, L; Jin, X; Zhou, W				Liu, Lin; Tang, Lin; Jin, Xin; Zhou, Wei			A Multi-Label Supervised Topic Model Conditioned on Arbitrary Features for Gene Function Prediction	GENES			English	Article						multi-label classification; topic model; gene function; probability distribution; Dirichlet-multinomial Regression	PROTEIN	With the continuous accumulation of biological data, more and more machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of gene function prediction, which has great significance in decoding the secret of life. Recently, a multi-label supervised topic model named labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (LLDA) has been applied to gene function prediction, and obtained more accurate and explainable predictions than conventional methods. Nonetheless, the LLDA model is only able to construct a bag of amino acid words as a classification feature, and does not support any other features, such as hydrophobicity, which has a profound impact on gene function. To achieve more accurate probabilistic modeling of gene function, we propose a multi-label supervised topic model conditioned on arbitrary features, named Dirichlet multinomial regression LLDA (DMR-LLDA), for introducing multiple types of features into the process of topic modeling. Based on DMR framework, DMR-LLDA applies an exponential a priori construction, previously with weighted features, on the hyper-parameters of gene-topic distribution, so as to reflect the effects of extra features on function probability distribution. In the five-fold cross validation experiment of a yeast datasets, DMR-LLDA outperforms the compared model significantly. All of these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential value of DMR-LLDA for predicting gene function.

Here, we perform an in-depth study of the relationship between cloud parameters and meteorological factors over the TP. The spatiotemporal variations in cloud cover and cloud optical thickness over the TP during the daytime from 2003 to 2015 are analysed using the Aqua-MODIS level 2 atmospheric product data MYD06. Results show that the annual average cloud cover over the TP decreases from the southeast to the northwest. The cloud cover of the western TP is highest in spring and lowest in autumn, while the cloud cover of the eastern TP is higher in spring and summer. The cloud covers in most areas of the TP exceed 30% in spring and summer, and the cloud optical thickness in the southeastern TP exceeds 10 in summer, with substantial cloud cover and cloud optical thickness changes. Compared to other seasons, the cooling effect of the near surface cloud net radiative forcing is greater during daytime in summer, which is likely associated with thick cloud optical thickness or large cloud cover. The results of the analysis of relationships among cloud cover, water vapour and air temperature show that positive correlations exist between cloud cover and water vapour, and that significantly negative correlations exist between cloud cover and air temperature over the TP. Combined with the analysis of variation features in the cloud parameters and meteorological factors, we find that water vapour variations during the daytime over the TP lead to cloud cover changes, which affect the air temperature variations over the TP by the cooling effects of clouds, especially in summer.

In this work, the fluorescence sensor for the detection of heavy and transition metal (HTM) ions has been extensively studied in aqueous solution. The results of the present study indicate that the obtained CA-CdS QDs could detect Cu2+ with high sensitivity and selectivity. It found that the existence of Cu2+ has a significant fluorescence quenching with a large red shifted (from greenish-yellow to yellowish-orange), but not in the presence of 17 other HTM ions. As a result, Cu2S, the energy level below the CdS conduction band, could be formed at the surface of the CA-CdS QDs and leads to the quenching of fluorescence of CA-CdS QDs. Under optimal conditions, the copper ions detection range using the synthesized fluorescence sensor was 1.0 x 10(-8) M to 5.0 x 10(-5) M and the limit of detection (LOD) is 9.2 x 10(-9) M. Besides, the as-synthesized CA-CdS QDs sensor exhibited good selectivity toward Cu2+ relative to other common metal ions. Thus, the CA-CdS QDs has potential applications for detecting Cu2+ in real water samples.

The gas-sensing performances of sensors based on different ratios of Pd-functionalized SnO2 composites were measured. All results indicate that the sensor based on 5 mol % Pd-functionalized SnO2 composites exhibited significantly enhanced gas-sensing performances toward butane. With regard to pure SnO2, enhanced levels of gas response and selectivity were observed. With 5 mol % Pd-functionalized SnO2 composites, detection limits as low as 10 ppm with responses of 1.38 +/- 0.26 were attained. Additionally, the sensor exhibited rapid response/recovery times (3.20/6.28 s) at 3000 ppm butane, good repeatability and long-term stability, demonstrating their potential in practical applications. The excellent gas-sensing performances are attributed to the unique one-dimensional morphology and the large internal surface area of sensing materials afforded using bio-templates, which provide more active sites for the reaction between butane molecules and adsorbed oxygen ions. The catalysis and "spillover effect" of Pd nanoparticles also play an important role in the sensing of butane gas as further discussed in the paper.

The Lagrangian duality technique has been widely adopted to solve the cross-layer optimization problem, but it is slowly convergent and sensitive to the iterative step size, especially for large networks. In this paper, a joint congestion control and power allocation second-order algorithm (JCCPA) is proposed, in which the joint optimization problem is modeled as a network utility maximization (NUM) framework, and the primal-dual interior-point method is used to solve the NUM problem. The JCCPA updates the primal variables and dual variables simultaneously according to their Newton directions; as a result,resulting in a faster convergence speed is reached. Moreover, the matrix-splitting technology is utilized to decompose the computation of the Hessian matrix and its inverse into different nodes and links so that the distributed update of source rate and node power can be implemented. The simulation results demonstrate that the JCCPA not only significantly improves energy efficiency but also has a faster convergence speed and is insensitive to step size.

Prevailing in the local habitat, indigenous microalgae are more successful for wastewater treatment processes. Integrated microalgae-based biofuel and bioproduct production with wastewater treatment is a successful practice of modern research. This report describes the isolation and identification of 61 microalgal strains from lakes, springs, ponds, creeks, and rivers of the gigantic area of Malakand, Pakistan. Our study involves the seasonal existence of Chlorophyta in the area, with most dominant flora identified in the summer season followed by spring, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The highest ratio of microalgae was found in stagnant waters followed by slow-running water and running water, respectively. However, algal species were reported from all water bodies throughout the year. Commercially important genera like Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Chlamydomonas were also reported, attracting the research area for further analysis regarding biofuel, bioproduct production, and simultaneous wastewater treatment.

In this study, five genes encoding different CaMKs were characterized in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. These CaMKs, which were retrieved from the A. oligospora genome according to their orthologs in fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, were expressed at a low level in vitro during mycelial growth stages. Five deletion mutants corresponding to these CaMKs led to growth defects in different media and increased sensitivity to several environmental stresses, including H2O2, menadione, SDS, and Congo red; they also reduced the ability to produce conidia and traps, thus causing a deficiency in nematicidal ability as well. In addition, the transcriptional levels of several typical sporulation-related genes, such as MedA, VelB, and VeA, were down-regulated in all CaMK mutants compared with the wild-type (WT) strain. Moreover, these mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to heat shock and ultraviolet-radiation stresses compared with the WT strain. These results suggest that the five CaMKs in A. oligospora are involved in regulating multiple cellular processes, such as growth, environmental stress tolerance, conidiation, trap formation, and virulence.

The evolution of connections between networks occurs according to the following rule: if a player often wins against its opponent (regardless of its strategy), it is allowed to form an external link with the corresponding partner in another network to obtain additional benefit; otherwise, the opportunity to increase its benefit is lost. Through numerical simulation, it is unveiled that cooperation can be significantly promoted due to interdependent network reciprocity. Interestingly, the synchronization of evolutionary processes emerges on both networks, and individuals can take advantage of interdependent network reciprocity when both the strategies and the coevolving times in the two networks are synchronous.

First, the incident wave (IW) and reflected wave (RW) at a certain position over a common carotid artery (CCA) are estimated. Then, the propagating pulse waves (PWs) along the CCA are modelled with the synthesizations of the estimated IWs and RWs, whose occurrences are delayed in opposite sequences according to a preset PWV. In ultrasound simulation, a geometric model of a CCA is built, and the dynamic scatterer models are constructed by moving the scatterer positions according to the synthesized PWs. The RF signals are generated using Field II. To characterize the PW propagations of different arterial stiffnesses consistent with clinical ones in the model, 30 healthy subjects from young, middle-aged, and elderly groups are recruited for extractions of IWs and RWs. To quantitatively verify the effectiveness of the simulation model, the normalized root-mean-squared errors (NRMSEs) are used to compare the estimated and preset PWs, time delays (TDs), and PWVs. Results show that for the three age groups, the estimated PWs, TDs, and PWVs conform to the preset ones with the mean NRMSEs of 0.92%, 18.47%, and 8.55%, respectively. Moreover, the model can characterize the effect of the wave reflection on the local PW propagation as its clinical manifestation. Therefore, the proposed model can be effective as a data source for the validation of TT -based local PWV estimation algorithms, particularly the effects of RWs on the estimation performance.

Despite there being an abundance of reports of large numbers of NPs having bioactivity in preliminary cell-based assays of anti-inflammatory potential, their further optimization and exploration are limited by the lack of a comprehensive understanding of their effective scaffold structure or biological targets. To facilitate target-based studies of anti-inflammatory NPs, the details of 665 NPs reported to have anti-inflammatory activity were extracted from the literature and compiled into a data set we termed InflamNat. The physicochemical properties of the NPs were analyzed, and the distribution of their structures and scaffolds is presented. A compound-target network was constructed from data in the PubChem Bioassay database. The results demonstrated that, compared to natural anticancer compounds in the NPACT database, compounds from the InflamNat data set contained a comparable distribution of compound types but with a higher proportion satisfying Lipinski's rule. The all-atom structures and scaffold of the compounds were diverse and barely convergent, with flavonoids and triterpenoids being the groups with the greatest abundance. The biological targets of the InflamNat compounds were identified as belonging to a variety of protein families that had varied function. Seventy-two percent of InflamNat compounds involved in the network were identified as having more than one biological target, highlighting the potential for multitarget anti-inflammatory drug development. In conclusion, anti-inflammatory NPs provide a good library for the screening of target-based leads or fragment-based drug design. Thus, elucidation of their biological targets is fundamental for either a specific single-target or multitarget drug development strategy. Meanwhile, a large proportion of the chemical space of anti-inflammatory NPs is still unexplored, with novel active scaffolds remaining to be discovered.

In contrast to the previous methods that primarily rely on fixed intensity threshold, our method adopts an adaptive parameter selection strategy in different regions of the processing image. This adaptive parameter selection strategy allows different intensity thresholds and different amplitude magnification factors in different pixels, moreover, a different remapping functions are adopted to process each pixel. At the same time, we propose an efficient and flexible method for obtaining the representation of image local variation, and based on the representation to select local Laplacian filters parameters adaptively. Our experiments shows that high-quality results in the detail enhancement and detail smoothing can be produced by our methods.

Image rendering methods with non-photorealistic rendering based can simulate different illustrations and increase its aesthetic appeal. Despite many kinds of methods have been put forward to obtain various styles, technical subtleties and stylistic potential of the embroidery simulation are litter attention. This paper offers a detailed review of the embroidery art style simulating approach from a 2D photograph, and performs an evaluation features for these tasks. The primary novelty of this method is that the stitch features are generated through an embroidery stroke model, and stitch stoke will be merged to source image. Therefore, it avoids irregular needling embroidery, and highlights the stereoscopic effect which is not revealed in other rendering methods. Firstly, we generate noise image through gray adaptive method to guide the embroidery lines produced. After that, an improved line integral convolution technique is presented to generate stitch strokes, and scattered noise is normalizing to a certain line based on Hough transform. Next, the paper focuses on the raised strokes, which are rendered and obtained through bulging process technique in this paper. Finally, we can exploit mergence strategy based on mapping method to produce embroidery art style. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, this paper compares its simulating results with the real embroidery work and measure of image MSSIM is also used to evaluate the simulation quality. In all cases, the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve embroidery style stitch visual quality and rich the aesthetic expression.

To reveal its molecular basis responsible for ecological adaptation, large-scale transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina sequencing with pooled mRNA extracted from whole plants and pseudobulbs during drought and rainy seasons. Based on the target transcript selection, the differentially expressed genes were related to 8 well-known drought-tolerant categories, and to morphological traits in resistance to water stress including pseudobulbs and roots. Further gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that nucleoside/nucleotide and ribonucleoside/ribonucleotide metabolic processes' and response to stimulus' were the two most important aspects in resistance to drought stress with respect to the whole plant. In addition, the difference in the number and category of differentially expressed genes in whole plant and stem suggested the involvement of genes specifically localized in the stem, such as GTP-binding protein, lipases, signaling related transcripts and those involved in the ATP metabolic process. The comprehensive analysis of the epiphytic orchid in response to water deprivation indicates that integral tactics lead to active adaptation as a basal defense response to drought stress by the endangered epiphyte, including the collaboration of metabolic processes, responses to a various stimulus and other candidate genes contribute to its extreme drought tolerance. Insights from this study can be further utilized to understand stress-responsive genes in other medicinally important species and to improve the drought tolerance of food crops.

Various methods based on different principles of technology have been used to deal with this issue. In recent years, the Web API ecosystem has accumulated a wealth of knowledge that can be used to enhance the recommendation models, and however, current concerns in this regard still remain. To cope with this issue, we present a graph-based algorithmic framework for the task of mashup-oriented API recommendation. Especially, we design a concise schema of the knowledge graph to encode the mashup-specific contexts and model the mashup requirement with graphic entities. We then exploit random walks with restart to assess the potential relevance between the mashup requirement and the Web APIs according to the knowledge graph. In addition, we propose the query-specific weighting strategies to enhance the knowledge graph construction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is much superior to some state-of-the-art methods, also achieves robust effects on reducing computational overhead, and suppresses the negative Matthew effect in APIs' recommendation.

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based health service system, labeling a large number of medical data requires high cost and relevant domain knowledge. Therefore, how to use a small number of labeled medical data reasonably to build an efficient and high-quality clinical decision support model in the IoT-based platform has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach in association with generative adversarial networks (GANs) for supporting clinical decision making in the IoT-based health service system. In our approach, GAN is adopted to not only increase the number of labeled data but also to compensate the imbalanced labeled classes with additional artificial data in order to improve the semi-supervised learning performance. Extensive evaluations on a collection of benchmarks and real-world medical datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others and provides a potential solution for practical applications.

The existing methods based on competent cell transformation and stable isotope probes are generally inefficient and not strictly quantitative. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a rigorously quantitative and efficient approach to monitor the decomposition dynamics of the soil extracellular DNA.Materials and methodsA soil was collected from a Tibetan alpine meadow. Extracellular DNA was simulated by modified exogenous plasmids. The plasmid solution was sprayed onto the fresh soil and thoroughly homogenized. Then, the soil was incubated for 4weeks, during which they were sampled and immediately stored at -20 degrees C on days 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 28 of the incubation. Finally, thetotal soil DNA was extracted, and the exogenous plasmid copies remained in the soils were determined using real-time PCR. Additionally, another similar experiment was conducted with a sterilized soil to assess the abiotic influences on the changes in the exogenous plasmid copies.Results and discussionIn the fresh soil, the exogenous plasmid DNA copies decreased quickly in the first 12h of the incubation, remained stable in the following 36h, and gradually dropped to 1.10-5.20% of the initial plasmid copies at sampling time 0after being incubated for 4weeks. The variations in the soil plasmid DNA copies fitted well with the modified exponential decay model. As for the sterilized soil, the exogenous plasmid copies remained stable during the 16day's incubation. However, they dramatically dropped after being incubated for 28days, which was probably elicited by the recolonization of microbes in the soil. Collectively, the decrease in the exogenous plasmid DNA copies could be mainly attributed to biological activities.ConclusionsExtracellular DNA can persist in soil for more than 4weeks. Exogenous plasmid amendment coupled with real-time PCR provides a convenient and rigorously quantitative approach for monitoring extracellular DNA degradation in soils.

It was first described by Andres in 1953, and was subsequently treated as a synonym of Monotropastrum Andres (1987); however, the phylogenetic placement of this genus has not, to date, been investigated. In this study, phylogenetic analyses were undertaken using DNA sequences from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer from all species of Monotropoideae available in GenBank. Comparative morphological studies on Eremotropa, Monotropastrum, and Monotropa L. were also carried out. The molecular phylogenetic evidence suggests that Eremotropa is sister to a clade formed by Monotropa and the remaining species of Monotropastrum, thus rendering Monotropastrum not monophyletic. Morphologically, Eremotropa differs from Monotropastrum in plant color, inflorescence type, length of the style, and size of the baccate fruit. Consequently, molecular and morphological evidence supports the resurrection of Eremotropa, which contains only one species, E. sciaphila Andres, as distinct from Monotropastrum.

Historical interactions are predicted to be disrupted under future climate change: The case of lace lichen and valley oak	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						climate change; co-occurrence; ecological niche modelling; migration; Quercus lobata; Ramalina menziesii	WIND-POLLINATED TREE; QUERCUS-LOBATA; RAMALINA-MENZIESII; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; EPIPHYTIC LICHEN; LOBARIA-PULMONARIA; POLLEN MOVEMENT; POPULATION; DISPERSAL; RESPONSES	Aim The distributions and interactions of co-occurring species may change if their ranges shift asymmetrically in response to rapid climate change. We aim to test whether two currently interacting taxa, valley oak (Quercus lobata) and lace lichen (Ramalina menziesii), have had a long-lasting historical association and are likely to continue to associate in the future. Location Central western California, western United States of America Methods Using population genetic analyses and MaxEnt software for ecological niche modelling, we estimate species' distributions during the Last Interglacial, the Last Glacial Maximum, present, and future periods. Mantel and vertex (genetic connection) tests were used to examine the spatial congruence among taxa. To compare the modelled response to climate change, we estimated migration speed between respective time periods using vector analysis. Results We found significant genetic congruence between valley oak and the lichen's green algal photobiont, independent of geographic isolation and habitat isolation, which is consistent with long-term association. Ecological niche models under past and future climate scenarios indicate that overlap of climatic niche sharing between valley oak and lace lichen might decrease in the future. Our models indicate that the speed of shifts in climate niches between these two taxa differed significantly in past periods from that of the present period. Main conclusions Our findings reveal that historical interactions between valley oak and lace lichen correlate with long-term sharing of past climate niches. However, the future association of lace lichen with valley oak may be disrupted in parts of its current distribution due to differential discordance of climate niche shifts, species' movements and generation times. This study illustrates the processes and patterns that allow long-term association during historic climate change and how they are likely to change during rapid climate change.

J	Chen, LH; Liu, Z; Chen, D				Chen, Li-Hui; Liu, Zhong; Chen, Dong			Climatological analysis of the seeing at Fuxian Solar Observatory	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						observational; high angular resolution; turbulence; site testing	TELESCOPE; SCINTILLATION	There is a significant seasonal variation in the seeing of Fuxian Solar Observatory (FSO). The seeing in summer and autumn is better than that in winter and spring. The overall seeing is divided into the boundary layer seeing and free atmosphere seeing to investigate the climatic phenomena or meteorological events that might lead to seasonal variation in the seeing. The overall seeing was measured by the solar difference image motion monitor (SDIMM). The boundary layer seeing is calculated from the temperature difference between air and water. The analysis results show that the seasonal variation in seeing is caused by the alternation of subtropical high and westerly jet. The decrease of seeing in winter and spring at FSO is probably related to the westerly jet. A complete analysis of the seeing at FSO is given in this paper. It is also the first time to describe FSO's boundary layer seeing and its measurement method.

Research on its age can provide critical constraints on the origin of the stellar halo and further on the formation of our Galaxy. So far, different approaches and samples have been used to estimate the age of the Galactic halo. In our previous paper. we carefully selected 63 field halo turn-off stars within 1 kpc from the literature using a kinematic approach, then estimated the age of the halo. In this following work, we not only update the data from LAMOST DR4 and Gaia DR1, but also try a different method to select a clean halo sample by combining the metallicity and orbital parameters. Then we compare this halo turn-off sample with the GARSTEC model in the B - V vs. metallicity plane. After Monte Carlo simulations are performed, the age is estimated to be 10.5 +/- 1.4Gyr, highly consistent with our previous result and other studies. However. due to the limited common sources between LAMOST DR4 and Gaia DR1, the final sample in this paper is still quite small. The estimated age will be more robust with the much larger Gaia DR2.

Although several studies have addressed individual environmental elements in the study area, efforts for integrated analysis of environmental factors and human settlements are still lacking. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial distribution of physical environments for human settlements to support population distribution planning. This study includes 10 factors (topography, landform, vegetation, elevation, fault, rock, soil, earthquake intensity, temperature, and precipitation) as indicators for the assessment of human settlement suitability based on the analytic hierarchy process and grey correlation methods. Geographic information system functions were used to help understand the spatial distribution of human settlements and the causal factors. This study reveals different spatial units of the watershed suitable for human habitation from the viewpoint of physical environment and provides recommendations for urban planning and siting, land use planning, and disaster mitigation in the watershed.

Guo et al. in 2011 and Pan et al. in 2013 determined all pentavalent symmetric graphs of order 4pq. In this paper, we shall generalize this result by determining all connected pentavalent symmetric graphs of order four times an odd square-free integer. It is shown in this paper that, for each such graph Gamma, either the full automorphism group Aut Gamma is isomorphic to PSL(2, p), PGL(2, p), PSL(2, p) x Z(2) or PGL(2, p) x Z(2), or Gamma is isomorphic to one of 9 graphs.

J	Zhao, DM; Wu, J				Zhao, Deming; Wu, Jian			Evaluating land use change impacts on rainfall in various categories using the Weather Research and Forecasting-mosaic approach	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						land use change; mosaic approach; rain areas and number of rain days; rainfall intensity; storm and heavy storm rain		To evaluate land use change impacts on rainfall in various categories, satellite-based images representing land use change between 1980 and 2010 were adopted to perform numerical experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting regional climate model. The mosaic approach, rather than the dominant approach, was employed to describe the land surface characteristics and their corresponding changes, for which the changes in the land surface physical parameters were closer to the actual values. Changes in rainfall displayed marked subregional characteristics, which could be interpreted by changes in local upward and large-scale moisture fluxes. Meanwhile, changes in the total rainfall (RCN) in various categories displayed remarkably different characteristics. Among these characteristics, storm and heavy storm rain expressed larger changes (relative values) and displayed stronger sensitivities over semi-arid subregions. Storm and heavy storm rainfall increased up to 10.5% in the eastern part of northwestern China (NWE) and 13.6% over northeastern China and decreased up to 6.5% over the Tibetan Plateau and 11.9% over NWE. According to changes in the convective (RC) and non-convective (RN) rainfall, the RCN for both storm and heavy storm rain were influenced by changes not only in the RC, RN, and RCN intensities, but also in the rain areas and number of rain days. The impacts of land use change on the summed RC, RN, and RCN for various categories might be less, whereas changes in the RC, RN, and RCN for individual various categories could be much larger. The rainfall impacts in various categories were higher over the subregions of China compared to China overall or the East Asian land areas, and those impacts demonstrated smaller influences at the regional scale (country-wide, China) compared to the local scale (subregions of China). Therefore, the impacts of land use change on rainfall in various categories are important for climatic change studies.

IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Learning index; RNN; hash function; LSTM		The booms of big data and graphic processing unit technologies have allowed us to explore more appropriate data structures and algorithms with smaller time complexity. However, the application of machine learning as a potential alternative for the traditional data structures, especially using deep learning, is a relatively new and largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network-based learned inverted index, called Pavo, to efficiently and flexibly organize inverted data. The basic hash function in the traditional inverted index is replaced by a hierarchical neural network, which makes Pavo be able to well adapt for various data distributions while showing lower collision rate as well as higher space utilization rate. A particular feature of our approach is that a novel unsupervised learning strategy to construct the hash function is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no similar results, in which the unsupervised learning strategy is employed to design hash functions, in the existing literature. Extensive experimental results show that the unsupervised model owns some advantages than the supervised one. Our approaches not only demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning-based data structures for index purpose but also provide benefits for developers to make more accurate decisions on both the design and the configuration of data organization, operation, and parameters tuning of neural network so as to improve the performance of information searching.

More than 23 000 images in the V band taken from 2008 January to 2017 February with different telescopes, complemented with 90 images in the B band in 2014 and 2017, were reduced, and light curves were derived in V for 5653 stars. By analysing these light curves, we detected 147 variable stars (85 of them being new discoveries), including 110 periodic variables, 15 eclipsing binaries, and 22 non-periodic variables. Proper motions, radial velocities, and colour-magnitude and two-colour diagrams were used to identify the cluster membership of these variable stars, resulting in 84 members. Periodic variable members were then classified into different variability types, mainly according to their magnitudes and to their periods of variability, as well as to their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the early-type stars. As a result, among main-sequence periodic variable members, we identified five beta Cep candidates, seven slowly pulsating B-type candidates, and thirteen fast-rotating pulsating B-type (FaRPB) candidates (one of which is a confirmed classical Be star). While most of the FaRPB stars display properties similar to the ones discovered in NGC 3766 by Mowlavi et al., five of them have periods below 0.1 d, contrary to expectations. Additional observations, including spectroscopic, are called for to further characterize these stars. We also find a binary candidate harbouring a delta-Scuti candidate.

Metallicity distributions of mono-age stellar populations of the Galactic disc from the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Galaxy: abundances; Galaxy: disc; Galaxy: evolution; Galaxy: formation; Galaxy: structure	CHEMICAL EVOLUTION; MILKY-WAY; ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS; PLANETARY-NEBULAE; THICK DISK; GAC; STARS; PARAMETERS; EMERGENCE; MIGRATION	We have investigated the metallicity distributions of mono-age stellar populations across the disc for 6 <= R <= 12 kpc and |Z| less than or similar to 2 kpc using samples selected from the main-sequence turnoff and subgiant (MSTO-SG) stars targeted by the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys. Both the mean values and the profiles of the distributions exhibit significant variations with age and position. We have found that the oldest (> 11 Gyr) stars have nearly flat radial [Fe/H] gradients at all heights above the disc but show negative vertical [Fe/H] gradients. For stars younger than 11 Gyr, the radial [Fe/H] gradients flatten with |Z|, while the vertical [Fe/H] gradients flatten with R. Stars of 4-6 Gyr exhibit steeper negative radial I [Fe/H] gradients than those of either younger or older ages. The values of [alpha/Fe] of mono-age stellar populations also show significant radial and vertical gradients, with patterns varying with age. The [Fe/H] distribution profiles of old (>8 Gyr) stars vary little with R, while those of younger stars exhibit strong radial variations, probably as a consequence of significant radial migration. The radial distribution profiles of [alpha/Fe] show the opposite patterns of variations with age to those of [Fe/H]. We have also explored the impact of stellar mixing by epicycle motions (blurring) on the [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] distributions, and found that blurring changes mainly the widths of the distribution profiles. Our results suggest that the disc may have experienced a complex assemblage history, in which both the 'inside-out' and 'upside-down' formation processes may have played an important role.

The relativistic e(+/-) pairs lose energy through inverse-Compton scattering (ICS) photons of the cosmic microwave background or plasma instabilities. The dominant energy-loss process is under debate. Based on the assumption that the dominant energy-loss process is ICS, the resulting cascade GeV radiation is usually used to constrain the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). Here, we include the energy-loss due to plasma oblique instability in the calculation of cascade gamma-ray flux, and investigate the impact of the plasma instability on the constraint of IGMF. Up-to-date GeV data and archival TeV data of the blazar 1ES 0229+ 200 are used. The results indicate that even if the oblique instability cooling is dominating ICS cooling, the cascade flux could still be used to constrain the IGMF. It is found that with the ratio between the cooling rates of the oblique instability and the ICS varying from 0.1,1 to 10, the lower limit of the IGMF of the cascade flux and the gamma-ray data changes from 8 x 10(-1)8 G, 5 x 10(-18) G to 10(-18) G. If the ratio between the two cooling rates is 30, the estimate of IGMF based on the cascade flux is invalid.

Then the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike intervals is used to measure the phenomenon of coherence resonance. The simulating and empirical results indicate that (i) the phenomenon peak death is induced by higher noise strength and system parameters; (ii) the phenomenons of coherence and anti-coherence resonance are observed in the function of CV vs. noise strength; (iii) the critical phenomenon of resonance enhancement and inhibition is induced by some values of system parameters.

With electrochemical measurement and surface analysis, it was found that B. cereus biofilm could inhibit SS pitting corrosion, attributing to the blocking effect of bacterial biofilm on extracellular electron transfer (EET). Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results also showed that B. cereus biofilm clearly impeded the EET. The proposed mechanism for the decreased corrosion rates of SS involves the interactions of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) with SS and biofilm formation blocking electron transfer, preventing the passive layer from destroying. After biofilm formation following initial attachment of cells and EPS, electron transfer between SS and the cathodic depolarizer (oxygen) was hindered.

If the competence level or the "reputation," which can be explained as the probabilities of annotating the right label, for each crowdsourcing annotators is equal and biased to annotate the right label, majority voting (MV) is the optimal decision rule for merging the multiple labels into a single reliable one. However, in practice, the competence levels of annotators employed by the crowdsourcing labeling systems are often diverse very much. In these cases, weighted MV is more preferred. The weights should be determined by the competence levels. However, since the annotators are anonymous and the ground-truth labels are usually unknown, it is hard to compute the competence levels of the annotators directly. In this paper, we propose to learn the weights for weighted MV by exploiting the expertise of annotators. Specifically, we model the domain knowledge of different annotators with different distributions and treat the crowdsourcing problem as a domain adaptation problem. The annotators provide labels to the source domains and the target domain is assumed to be associated with the ground-truth labels. The weights are obtained by matching the source domains with the target domain. Although the target-domain labels are unknown, we prove that they could be estimated under mild conditions. Both theoretical and empirical analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Large performance gains are shown for specific data sets.

Achieving the precise classification of ore requires the high quality of rock particle image. In order to retain the details and intensity information of rock particle image, a novel fusion method based on sparse representation(SR) and non-subsampled contourtlet transform(NSCT) for rock particle image is proposed. By using NSCT, the detailed information of rock particle images can be revealed in different scales. Furthermore, salient features of rock particle images can be effectively extracted by using sparse representation.

Electric-field modulation of linear dichroism and Faraday rotation in few-layer phosphorene	2D MATERIALS			English	Article						few-layer phosphorene; optical conductivity; linear dichroism; Faraday rotation; tight-binding method; self-consistent calculation		Electro-optical modulators, which use an electric voltage (or an electric field) to modulate a beam of light, are essential elements in present-day telecommunication devices. Using a self-consistent tight-binding approach combined with the standard Kubo formula, we show that the optical conductivity and the linear dichroism of few-layer phosphorene can be modulated by a perpendicular electric field. We find that the field-induced charge screening plays a significant role in modulating the optical conductivity and the linear dichroism. Distinct absorption peaks are induced in the conductivity spectrum due to the strong quantum confinement along the out-of-plane direction and to the field-induced forbidden-to-allowed transitions. The field modulation of the linear dichroism becomes more pronounced with increasing number of phosphorene layers. We also show that the Faraday rotation is present in few-layer phosphorene even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This optical Hall effect is induced by the reduced lattice symmetry of few-layer phosphorene. The Faraday rotation is greatly influenced by the field-induced charge screening and is strongly dependent on the strength of perpendicular electric field and on the number of phosphorene layers.

In this method, ethylenediamine was used as both the nitrogen source and morphology controller besides the P123 triblock copolymer as main structure directing agent, to control the texture and morphology of the catalyst. The microstructure and chemical composition of N-doped Bi2O3 photocatalyst were characterized with XRD, XPS, SEM-EDS, DR UV-vis, and N-2 physisorption. The prepared hierarchical N-doped Bi2O3 was used for the photocatalytic degradation of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) under visible light. The absorption edge of prepared N doped Bi2O3 appeared an obvious red shift comparing with pure phase Bi2O3. This would help photocatalyst make full use of light source to degrade E-2. Under the same conditions of the photocatalytic reaction, the rate constant of degradation of E-2 over N-doped Bi2O3 was 6.3 times of that obtained over Bi2O3. The stability of N-doped Bi2O3 and the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of E-2 under visible light were studied.

However, it is largely unknown whether the environment drives the morphological variation in riverine fish otoliths, which are potential phenotypic markers. In this study, we investigated morphological variations in the otoliths of an endemic Chinese fish (Schizothorax nukiangensis Tsao) collected from seven sites with varying environmental gradients along the Nu-Salween River. We compared morphological characters of S. nukiangensis otoliths among sampling sites and identified environmental sources of otolith morphological variation using multivariate regression trees and multiple factor analysis. Results showed that S. nukiangensis otoliths collected from different habitats were significantly different in morphology, mainly at the rostrum, excisura and posterior rim. Variations in otolith morphology (specifically the increase in otolith length) were predominantly governed by average river gradient; this might be a functional response to hydrogeomorphic conditions. Other environmental gradients (i.e., altitude, latitude and average annual temperature) played a minor role in otolith shape. This study highlighted the role of environmental factors in determining the otolith shape in riverine fish; thus, species and population discriminations based on otolith morphology should consider intraspecific variability.

J	Wen, LM; Badal, J; Hu, JF				Wen, Liming; Badal, Jose; Hu, Jiafu			Anisotropic H-k stacking and (revisited) crustal structure in the southeastern margin of Tibet	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Anisotropic H-k stacking; Pms-wave splitting-based anisotropy; Moho depth; Poisson's ratio; Southeastern Tibet	LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCE; VELOCITY STRUCTURE; POISSONS RATIO; UPPER-MANTLE; SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; SPLITTING ANALYSIS; RECEIVER FUNCTIONS; CONTINENTAL-CRUST; PLATEAU; DEFORMATION	P receiver functions (PRFs) and the H-k stacking technique are tools often used to constrain the thickness of the crust and the ratio between the velocities of P and S waves. Both the crustal depth and the Poisson's ratio are very important parameters to study the tectonic evolution of the lithosphere, but they can be significantly affected by the presence of crustal anisotropy. In order to address this problem, we have extended the isotropic stacking approach to include six converted P-to-S phases that are generated in the anisotropic case, instead of only three phases considered in the isotropic case, and we have examined the feasibility of the stacking technique using synthetic and real data. Based on PRFs acquired by 108 permanent broadband seismic stations deployed in the southeastern margin of Tibet including the Sichuan and Yunnan areas, we have applied the anisotropic H-k stacking scheme to investigate the crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio. The results reveal that the crustal thickness varies from similar to 60 km in the Songpan-Ganzi fold system and the northern part of the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond-shaped block, near the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, to similar to 33 km in southern Yunnan, and that the Poisson's ratio varies mostly from 0.24 to 0.32. The highest values of 0.28-0.30 are found along the axis formed by the Longmenshan fault, the Lijiang-Jinhe fault and the Xiaojiang fault, and are attributed to the accumulation of lower crustal flow in front of the Sichuan Basin. The highest value of similar to 0.32 is observed at the Tengchong volcano area to the north of the Indochina block, and is attributed to the upwelling of hot mantle associated to the eastward subduction of the Indian plate, rather than to the expansion of east Tibet. Comparing with the results provided by the isotropic stacking scheme, it is appreciated that the crustal depth determined by the anisotropic stacking method well adjusts the observed pattern of gravity anomaly. We conclude that the results obtained by anisotropic stacking yield a much better constraint on the estimation of the crustal depth and Poisson's ratio when compared to those achieved by isotropic stacking.

The carbon microsphere was used as template to regulate the morphology of Ag-LaFeO3, and will be burning off after annealing. The synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The gas-sensing performance of Ag-LaFeO3 molecular imprinting spheres (MIT Ag-LaFeO3 spheres) was compared with that of Ag-LaFeO3 nanoparticles. The gas sensors fabricated with the MIT Ag-LaFeO3 spheres samples possess high sensitivity and good selectivity than that of Ag-LaFeO3 nanoparticles. At the optimal operating temperature of 155 degrees C, the response of the MIT AgLaFeO3 spheres sensor to 5 ppm acetone is 23.3, which is 16 higher than that of Ag-LaFeO3 sensor, and the response and recovery times are 55 s and 60 s, respectively. It was found that the MIT Ag-LaFeO3 spheres exhibited excellent acetone gas-sensing properties.

The enzymatic product is accumulated on the surface of the LC sensing film by means of silver deposition, and the birefringent signal (observed with a polarizing microscope) is strongly enhanced as a result. The presence of AuNPs also enhances the sensitivity by about 4 orders of magnitude. The bright spots in polarized optical microscopy (POM) images increase with increasing activities of ALP. The signal intensities of the spots are then calculated by using Photoshop software and by multiplying the average brightness of the spots by the pixel value. The detection limit for ALP is 1.2 nUmL(-1), which is 5-7 orders of magnitude lower than other colorimetric or fluorometric methods. The method was applied to a highly sensitive immunoassay for the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by integrating immunomagnetic separation. The immunoassay was applied to the analysis of complex samples without tedious sample pretreatment, and a detection limit as low as 0.35pgmL(-1) of CEA was achieved. The method has attractive features in that it provides an ultrasensitive multicolor visualization approach for enzymes such as ALP, but also paves the way to a new kind of immunoassay coupled to immunomagnetic separation.

Inspired by this, we thus study the evolution of public cooperation on two interdependent networks that are connected by means of an asymmetric information sharing updating function, which can construct the interdependent networks in two different classes in order to simulate asymmetric influence of multiple networks which exist in from bacteria to animals as well as human societies. Interestingly, we find that interdependence by means of asymmetric information sharing function can dramatically promote the evolution of cooperation by restraining negative feed-back effect to provide a better environment for cooperators to mushroom. The result shows that the stronger the level of asymmetry, the higher the level of cooperation. And we further inquiry why this asymmetric information sharing updating mechanism can strikingly promote the cooperation in the upper network and find that the value of combined Fermi-Dirac Function of defector in the upper network is relatively larger than the original Fermi-Dirac Function, which can eventually lead to the fraction of cooperation to one in the upper network. Our work can reveal some essential principles in asymmetric interdependent networks that ubiquitously exists in biological and human social systems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

New nanoporous graphyne monolayer as nodal line semimetal: Double Dirac points with an ultrahigh Fermi velocity	CARBON			English	Article						Nanoporous structure; Double Dirac points; Ultrahigh Fermi velocity; 2D nodal line semimetal; H-4,H-4,H-4-graphyne	CARBON ALLOTROPE; GRAPHENE; PLANAR; SEPARATION; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK	Two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials play an important role in nanomaterials. We propose a new carbon monolayer, named hexagonal-4,4,4-graphyne (H-4,H-4,H-4-graphyne), which is a nanoporous structure composed of rectangular carbon rings and triple bonds of carbon. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the structure, stability, and band structure of this new material. We found that its total energy is lower than that of experimentally synthesized beta-graphdiyne and it is stable at least up to 1500 K. In contrast to the single Dirac point band structure of other 2D carbon monolayers, the band structure of H-4,H-4,H-4-graphyne exhibits double Dirac points along the high-symmetry points and the corresponding Fermi velocities (1.04-1.27 x 10(6) m/s) are asymmetric and higher than that of graphene. The origin of these double Dirac points is traced back to the nodal line states, which can be well explained by a tight-binding model. The H-4,H-4,H-4-graphyne forms a moire superstructure when placed on top of a hexagonal boron nitride substrate. These properties make H-4,H-4,H-4-graphyne a promising semimetal material for applications in high-speed electronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little is known about how heavy metals are accumulated and redistributed in the WLFZ of reservoirs with a high background value of the heavy metal in soil. The site chosen for this case study is the Nuozhadu mega reservoir in the upper Mekong River Basin, which is held back by a dam with a height exceeding 250 m. Five sampling transects were established around the reservoir. Each transect contained three vertical sampling lines representing three land-use types: forest, farmland, and rubber plantations. Soil samples were collected both in the WLFZ and in the infralittoral reference zone (IRZ), and the concentrations of the heavy metals Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Fe (%) were measured in these samples. We found that the average concentrations of each of these heavy metals were higher in the WLFZ than in the IRZ. The land use types, especially the rubber plantations and farmlands, determine the redistribution of the heavy metals in the soil of the WLFZ. The heavy metals Cu, Mn, and Ni increased with increasing elevation within the WLFZ, but the metals Cr and Zn decreased with elevation. The results of analysis of variance indicate that the soil properties had certain differences under different land-use types and inundation durations at various elevations, which partly determined the accumulation and redistribution of heavy metals in the WLFZ. We suggest that long-term monitoring of the concentration of heavy metals is needed for soil and water management in the WLFZ of the Nuozhadu reservoir.

In particular, in this work, it is assumed that the nonlinearities satisfy Lipschitz condition for obtaining the required results. By choosing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a new set of sufficient conditions is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which ensures the finite-time boundedness and dissipativeness of the resulting closed-loop system. Meanwhile, the solvability condition for the observer-based finite-time nonfragile control is also established, in which the control gain can be computed by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example based on the electric-hydraulic system is provided to illustrate the applicability of the developed control design technique.	[Sakthivel, R.; Priya, R.

We first define a dynamic comparative ratio instead of the logical comparison to describe the linear difference between neural inner state and dynamic threshold. Then a nearly accurate formula about the passive pulse period is given by using the max lower limit of dynamic comparative ratios, and the rationality of which is proved based on the error analysis between estimated and real passive pulse periods. Moreover, we deduce a stable pulse period from estimated pulse period such that the neuron could nonperiodically and periodically pulse in two different time phases, successively.

Genetic diversity, core collection and breeding history of Pleurotus ostreatus in China	MYCOSCIENCE			English	Article						Core set; Cultivation history; Genetic structure; Microsatellite; Strain fingerprinting	MUSHROOM FLAMMULINA-VELUTIPES; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; OYSTER MUSHROOMS; SSR MARKERS; CULTIVARS; INFERENCE; SOFTWARE; PROGRAM	Pleurotus ostreatus is one of the most widespread and favourably cultivated mushrooms in China. The cultivated strains of this species have been frequently exchanged domestically and internationally, but no detailed breeding history has been documented. The frequent domestic and international exchange of strains combined with a non-detailed historical documentation of breeding might have led to confusion about strain names and genetic background. In this study, 91 strains of P. ostreatus, including 57 cultivated and 34 wild strains, were analysed using 21 simple sequence repeat markers developed from the genomic sequence of "P. cf. floridanus". Among the cultivated strains, 46 were found to possess different allelic patterns. The remaining 11 strains were clustered into five groups, each with their own private alleles, suggesting that 10.5% (6/57) of the cultivated strains were previously labelled with improper names. Our analyses indicate that wild strains harbored greater genetic diversity than the cultivated strains. With regard to the cultivation history of P. ostreatus, the cultivated strains in China have three sources: direct introduction from Europe, domestication from wild strains from China, or hybridisation of the European and Chinese strains. Furthermore, we propose a core collection of P. ostreatus with 34 strains, including 13 wild and 21 cultivated strains. The allele retention proportion of the core collection for the entire collection was 100%. (C) 2018 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The understanding of the molecular regulatory signatures of CRC may lead to the identification of biomarkers for the early detection, prevention and clinical intervention of CRC. Epidemiological studies have indicated that cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) serves an active function in colon carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying COX-1 regulation in CRC remains unknown. In the present study, COX-1 was identified to be markedly upregulated in colorectal tissues of patients with CRC, and in the CRC cell lines HCT116 and HT29. To determine the function of COX-1 in cancer development, short hairpin RNA knockdown of COX-1 was employed in HCT116 and HT29 CRC cells in the present study. The results demonstrated that silencing of COX-1 depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited adenosine triphosphate production, induced the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and triggered caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, depletion of COX-1 suppressed anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 and enhanced pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein expression by inhibiting the p65 subunit phosphorylation of nuclear factor B (NF-B). Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that COX-1 inhibition significantly triggered cell death by destroying the mitochondrial function that is associated with deactivation of the NF-B signaling pathway. These results suggest COX-1 as a potential anticancer target in CRC.

The discrete correlation function between the gamma-ray and the R band (AZT-8) shows a highly significant (>99.9% confidence) correlation with the gamma-ray variations leading the R band by about 75 days. The spectral energy distributions are modeled, with the adoption of a synchrotron self-Compton plus external Compton (EC) model, to discuss the reasons of transition between the low- and high-flux states. In both the pre-flare and flare states, the EC seed photons might be dominated by reprocessed emission from the dusty torus rather than the broadline region (BLR). This implies the location of radiating blob outside the BLR and inside the dusty torus. From the pre-flare state to the flare state, delta and B decrease, whereas N-0 and gamma(max) increase accordingly. The results of the modeling suggest that the increase in the total number of emitting electrons and hardening of the power spectrum of emitting electrons are primary causes of the flare in gamma-rays.
