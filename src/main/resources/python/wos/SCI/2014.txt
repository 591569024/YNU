The aim of this study was to demonstrate the in vivo bactericidal effects of a combination of vancomycin (VAN) and fosfomycin (FOS) against MRSA in a rat carboxymethyl cellulose-pouch biofilm model. The results of the time-kill assay showed that the combination therapy was capable of killing at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) (1/2 x MIC VAN + 1 x MIC FOS and 1 x MIC VAN + 1 x MIC FOS). In the in vivo study, a synergistically bactericidal effect was observed when using the combination therapy on MRSA embedded in the mature biofilm model. In comparison with the untreated control group and the groups receiving either VAN or FOS alone, the rats treated with combination therapy had lower MRSA colony counts in exudates from the pouch, lower white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in peripheral blood. Furthermore, histological analysis of the pouch wall indicated combination therapy resulted in disappearance of biofilm-like structures, marked decrease in necrosis, and formation of granular tissue. In conclusion, the combination of VAN with FOS had a synergistic bactericidal effect on chronic MRSA infection embedded in biofilm, providing an alternative approach to treating this condition.

Big-bounce genesis	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DARK-MATTER; INFLATIONARY UNIVERSE; STRING COSMOLOGY; COSMIC-RAY; PARTICLES; BANG; PERTURBATIONS; DAMA/LIBRA	We report on the possibility of using dark matter particle's mass and its interaction cross section as a smoking gun signal of the existence of a big bounce at the early stage in the evolution of our currently observed universe. A model independent study of dark matter production in the pre-bounce contraction and the post-bounce expansion epochs of the bounce universe reveals a new venue for achieving the observed relic abundance of our present universe, in which a significantly smaller amount of dark matter with a smaller cross section-as compared to the prediction of standard cosmology-is produced and the information about the bounce universe evolution is preserved by the out-of-thermal-equilibrium process. Once the value of dark matter mass and interaction cross section are obtained by direct detection in laboratories, this alternative route becomes a signature prediction of the bounce universe scenario.

J	Tang, NS; Yu, B; Tang, ML				Tang, Nian-Sheng; Yu, Bin; Tang, Man-Lai			Testing non-inferiority of a new treatment in three-arm clinical trials with binary endpoints	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Approximate unconditional test; Bootstrap-resampling test; Non-inferiority trial; Rate difference; Saddlepoint approximation; Three-arm design	UNITY RELATIVE RISK; ASSESSING NONINFERIORITY; NULL HYPOTHESIS; EQUIVALENCE; DIFFERENCE; DESIGN; RATIO; PROPORTIONS; STATISTICS; INFERENCE	Background: A two-arm non-inferiority trial without a placebo is usually adopted to demonstrate that an experimental treatment is not worse than a reference treatment by a small pre-specified non-inferioritymargin due to ethical concerns. Selection of the non-inferioritymargin and establishment of assay sensitivity are two major issues in the design, analysis and interpretation for two-arm non-inferiority trials. Alternatively, a three-arm non-inferiority clinical trial including a placebo is usually conducted to assess the assay sensitivity and internal validity of a trial. Recently, some large-sample approaches have been developed to assess the non-inferiority of a new treatment based on the three-arm trial design. However, these methods behave badly with small sample sizes in the three arms. This manuscript aims to develop some reliable small-sample methods to test three-arm non-inferiority. Methods: Saddlepoint approximation, exact and approximate unconditional, and bootstrap-resampling methods are developed to calculate p-values of the Wald-type, score and likelihood ratio tests. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate their performance in terms of type I error rate and power. Results: Our empirical results show that the saddlepoint approximation method generally behaves better than the asymptotic method based on the Wald-type test statistic. For small sample sizes, approximate unconditional and bootstrap-resampling methods based on the score test statistic perform better in the sense that their corresponding type I error rates are generally closer to the prespecified nominal level than those of other test procedures. Conclusions: Both approximate unconditional and bootstrap-resampling test procedures based on the score test statistic are generally recommended for three-arm non-inferiority trials with binary outcomes.

Monthly AOD retrievals from 2006 to 2009 using the new parameters were compared with MISR AOD in the same period. AOD retrieved with the new parameters can capture the extreme values better than the inversion result with the original parameters, and the root-mean-square error between retrieval and MISR AOD reached the minimum of 0.047 in northwest China and the maximum of 0.102 in the Huang-Huai River Basin, respectively. The spatial distribution and seasonal features of monthly AOD from 1960 to 2009 in China were also analyzed. The monthly AOD in China for past 50 years, from 1960 to 2009, exhibited an increasing trend, especially during 1960-1985, with a linear rate of increase of 0.004/year. No distinct trend can be found for AOD from 1985 to 1995; then it increased obviously from 1996 to 2009 with an annual rate of 0.002. Seasonal change in AOD showed that it reached a maximum value in summer with the average value between 0.34 and 0.36 for the whole China, while a minimum value was reached in winter with a mean value between 0.2 and 0.22. It is noted that the aerosol vertical profile was a sensitive factor to the inversion result. The root-mean-square error using Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport aerosol profiles was increased 1.9 to 5.7 times than using the traditional three-segment profile in northwest, southwest, northeast, and northern China, which meant that the retrieval AOD was sensitive to aerosol vertical profile in these regions; at the same time, the root-mean-square error was decreased 1.13 to 1.37 times in other regions.

J	Guo, W; Mei, DC				Guo, Wei; Mei, Dong-Cheng			Stochastic resonance in a tumor-immune system subject to bounded noises and time delay	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Tumor-immune system; Stochastic resonance; Cross-correlated sine-Wiener noises; Time delay	NON-GAUSSIAN NOISES; CLIMATIC TRANSITIONS; MODEL; APPROXIMATION; SURVEILLANCE; COHERENCE	Immunotherapy is one of the most recent approaches in cancer therapy. A mathematical model of tumor-immune interaction, subject to a periodic immunotherapy treatment (imitated by a periodic signal), correlative and bounded stochastic fluctuations and time delays, is investigated by numerical simulations for its signal power amplification (SPA). Within the tailored parameter regime, the synchronous response of tumor growth to the immunotherapy, stochastic resonance (SR), versus both the noises and delays is obtained. The details are as follows (i) the peak values of SPA versus the noise intensity (A) in the proliferation term of tumor cells decrease as the frequency of periodic signal increases, i.e. an increase of the frequency restrains the SR; (ii) an increase of the amplitude of periodic signal restrains the SR versus A, but boosts up the SR versus the noise intensity B in the immune term; (iii) there is an optimum cross-correlated degree between the two bounded noises, at which the system exhibits the strongest SR versus the delay time tau(alpha), (the reaction time of tumor cell population to their surrounding environment constraints); (iv) upon increasing the delay time tau(alpha) double SR versus the delay time tau(beta) (the time taken by both the tumor antigen identification and tumor-stimulated proliferation of effectors) emerges. These results may be helpful for an immunotherapy treatment for the sufferer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure and the morphology of the hierarchical ZnO characterized by X-ray diffraction spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution show that hierarchical ZnO is assembled with six nanorods arrays, standing perpendicular to a central axis of prism ZnO nanorods. The nanorod arrays epitaxially grow on the side face of the central ZnO nanorod with a 6-fold symmetry. A formation mechanism of hierarchical ZnO is also proposed in the paper.

Robust Ag nanocrystals can be reproducibly fabricated by soaking halloysite nanotubes in ethanolic solutions of AgNO3 and butylamine. By simply adjusting the molar ratio of AgNO3 and butylamine, Ag nanoparticles with tunable size and quantity on halloysite nanotube are achieved. It reveals that the Ag nanoparticles are well-dispersed on the surface of halloysite nanotubes. The halloysite nanotube supported Ag nanoparticles heteroarchitectures can serve as active catalysts for the polymerization of an allcylsilane C18H37SiH3 with water to form silanol/siloxane composite microspheres and exhibit interesting superhydrophobicity ascribed to the micro/nanobinary structure.

The Riemann problems are constructively solved. The Riemann solutions include two kinds of interesting structures. One involves a cavitation where both state variables tend to zero forming a singularity, the other is a delta shock wave in which both state variables contain Dirac delta function simultaneously. The generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition are proposed to solve the delta shock wave. Moreover, with the limiting viscosity approach, we show all of the existence, uniqueness and stability of solution involving the delta shock wave. The generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation is also confirmed. Then our theory is successfully applied to two typical systems including the geometric optics equations. Finally, we present the numerical results coinciding with the theoretical analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Fang, J; Yu, H; Zhang, L				Fang, Jun; Yu, Huan; Zhang, Li			Simulated morphologies of non-thermal emission from the supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 in a turbulent medium	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						MHD; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; ISM: individual: RX J0852.0-4622; ISM: supernova remnants	VERY-HIGH-ENERGY; MAGNETIC-FIELD; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; NORTHWESTERN RIM; SHOCK-WAVES; VELA JR; SN 1006; AMPLIFICATION; G266.2-1.2; RX-J0852.0-4622	The morphologies of the X-rays from synchrotron radiation and the gamma-rays produced via either inverse Compton scattering or proton-proton interaction for the supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 are investigated using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The simulation is initiated with the supernova ejecta imbedded in the turbulent environment, and the distributions of the density and the magnetic field within the shock wave can be obtained. Assuming that the number of the protons accelerated by the forward shock is proportional to the local density since more protons can be injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process with a higher density, the morphology of the emission produced via the inelastic collisions between the accelerated protons with the ambient matter is achieved. Furthermore, the X-ray map of the synchrotron radiation and the gamma-ray image of the inverse Compton scattering can be obtained with the assumption that the relativistic electrons have a similar spatial distribution as the protons. The results show that the shock front is distorted by the turbulent medium, and the morphologies of the non-thermal emission from RX J0852.0-4622, which shows a broken shell with bright rims at the shock in the observed images both in the X-ray band and in the TeV gamma-ray band, can be generally reproduced using the model. It can be concluded that the observed broken morphologies of the non-thermal emission with bright regions along the shock are the result of the remnant evolving in a turbulent plasma.

Monodispersed ultrafine palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) with a uniform size of similar to 2.3 nm were successfully obtained on the TiO2-SiC surface via a chemical reduction method. The Pd-loaded TiO2-SiC nanohybrid (Pd@TiO2-SiC) was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. A method for the simultaneous electrochemical determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and bisphenol A (BPA) using a Pd@TiO2-SiC nanocomposite-modified glassy carbon electrode was established. Utilizing the favorable properties of Pd NPs, the Pd@TiO2-SiC nanohybrid-modified glassy carbon electrode exhibited electrochemical performance superior to those of TiO2-SiC and SiC. Differential pulse voltammetry was successfully used to simultaneously quantify HQ and BPA within the concentration range of 0.01-200 mu M under optimal conditions. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of the Pd@TiO2-SiC nanohybrid electrode for HQ and BPA were 5.5 and 4.3 nM, respectively. The selectivity of the electrochemical sensor was improved by introducing 10% ethanol to the buffer medium. The practical application of the modified electrode was demonstrated by the simultaneous detection of HQ and BPA in tap water and wastewater samples. The simple and straightforward strategy presented in this paper are important for the facile fabrication of ultrafine metal NPs@metal oxide-SiC hybrids with high electrochemical performance and catalytic activity.

A chancelloriid-like metazoan from the early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstatte, China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SMALL SHELLY FOSSILS; BURGESS SHALE; ARTHROPOD; PRESERVATION; HALKIERIIDS; SCLERITES; GREENLAND; EVOLUTION; SIBERIA; SYSTEM	Nidelric pugio gen. et sp. nov. from the Cambrian Series 2 Heilinpu Formation, Chengjiang Lagerstatte, Yunnan Province, China, is an ovoid, sac-like metazoan that bears single-element spines on its surface. N. pugio shows no trace of a gut, coelom, anterior differentiation, appendages, or internal organs that would suggest a bilateral body plan. Instead, the sac-like morphology invites comparison with the radially symmetrical chancelloriids. However, the single-element spines of N. pugio are atypical of the complex multi-element spine rosettes borne by most chancelloriids and N. pugio may signal the ancestral chancelloriid state, in which the spines had not yet fused. Alternatively, N. pugio may represent a group of radial metazoans that are discrete from chancelloriids. Whatever its precise phylogenetic position, N. pugio expands the known disparity of Cambrian scleritome-bearing animals, and provides a new model for reconstructing scleritomes from isolated microfossils.

The simulation results show: (1) When noise does not exist and the biasing force is small, there is no probability flow in the system, but when the biasing force is small, the noise on the heat balance disturbance can also make particles transport, and it can induce and eliminate the absolute negative mobility of the particle; (2) The absolute negative mobility of particle is eliminated by increasing the potential height. Study of the influence of barrier height on the absolute negative mobility of particle will provide a certain theoretical basis for the control of negative movement.

Cells of strain EGI 80099(T) were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-endospore-forming cocci. The predominant menaquinones were MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. The major cellular fatty acids (>10%) were anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. Analysis of the cell wall showed the presence of peptidoglycan of the type L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu, variation A4 alpha. Cells of the isolate contained phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unknown phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid as polar lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 63.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 80099(T) belongs to the genus Nesterenkonia, sharing 95.68-97.37% sequence similarities with the type strains of recognized species within this genus. DNA-DNA hybridization of strain EGI 80099(T) with the type strains of species that showed the highest sequence similarities, Nesterenkonia aethiopica DSM 17733(T) (97.37%), Nesterenkonia flava CAAS 251(T) (97.23%) and Nesterenkonia xinjiangensis YIM 70097(T) (97.02%), gave relatedness values of 8.7-62.2%. Data from DNA-DNA hybridizations and physiological and biochemical tests indicated that strain EGI 80099(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed.

The strain was Gram-reaction-positive, strictly aerobic, motile and catalase-positive and produced spherical to slightly ellipsoidal endospores with subterminal position on swollen sporangia. The genomic DNA G+C content was 46.9 molok. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iSO-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The predominant quinones were MK-6 (89.3 %) and MK-7 (8.7 %). The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified phospholipid. meso-Diaminopimelic acid (type My) was present in the cell-wall peptidoglycan and the major whole-cell sugars were glucose and ribose. The closest phylogenetic neighbours were identified as Domibacillus robiginosus DSM 25058(T) (98.0% similarity) and Domibacillus indicus DSM 28032(T) (97.2% similarity), other species of the genus Bacillus displayed below 96% similarity.

Here we report a defensive mechanism used by certain bacteria to mobilize nematode-trapping fungi to kill nematodes. These bacteria release urea, which triggers a lifestyle switch in the fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora from saprophytic to nematodepredatory form; this predacious form is characterized by formation of specialized cellular structures or 'traps'. The bacteria significantly promote the elimination of nematodes by A. oligospora. Disruption of genes involved in urea transport and metabolism in A. oligospora abolishes the urea-induced trap formation. Furthermore, the urea metabolite ammonia functions as a signal molecule in the fungus to initiate the lifestyle switch to form trap structures. Our findings highlight the importance of multiple predator-prey interactions in prey defense mechanisms.

J	Drewes, J; Zhu, WN; Melcher, D				Drewes, Jan; Zhu, Weina; Melcher, David			Dissociation between spatial and temporal integration mechanisms in Vernier fusion	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Vernier; Spatial integration; Temporal integration	PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; OBJECT; TIME	The visual system constructs a percept of the world across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This raises the questions of whether different scales involve separate integration mechanisms and whether spatial and temporal factors are linked via spatio-temporal reference frames. We investigated this using Vernier fusion, a phenomenon in which the features of two Vernier stimuli presented in close spatio-temporal proximity are fused into a single percept. With increasing spatial offset, perception changes dramatically from a single percept into apparent motion and later, at larger offsets, into two separately perceived stimuli. We tested the link between spatial and temporal integration by presenting two successive Vernier stimuli presented at varying spatial and temporal offsets. The second Vernier either had the same or the opposite offset as the first. We found that the type of percept depended not only on spatial offset, as reported previously, but interacted with the temporal parameter as well. At temporal separations around 30-40 ms the majority of trials were perceived as motion, while above 70 ms predominantly two separate stimuli were reported. The dominance of the second Vernier varied systematically with temporal offset, peaking around 40 ms ISI. Same-offset conditions showed increasing amounts of perceived separation at large ISIs, but little dependence on spatial offset. As subjects did not always completely fuse stimuli, we separated trials by reported percept (single/fusion, motion, double/segregation). We found systematic indications of spatial fusion even on trials in which subjects perceived temporal segregation. These findings imply that spatial integration/fusion may occur even when the stimuli are perceived as temporally separate entities, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for temporal segregation and spatial integration may not be mutually exclusive.

Chloroplasts have been previously reported in fossil plants in the US, Canada, and Russia. Here, we report on fossil chloroplasts with internal ultrastructure in a fossil leaf of Nelumbo changchangensis from the Eocene of Hainan Island, South China. The chloroplasts in this fossil demonstrate great similarity to their counterparts in living relative as well as those in the previous reports. The well-preserved chloroplasts in plant fossils call for more attention to ultrastructures and the fossilizing mechanisms of cytoplasm.

During 2006 to 2009, we investigated phototaxis in nocturnal migrants at Jinshan Yakou in Xinping County (N23 degrees 56', E101 degrees 30'; 2400 m above sea-level), and at the Niaowang Mountain in Funing County (N23 degrees 30', E105 degrees 35'; 1400 m above sea-level), both in the Yunnan Province of Southwest China. A total of 5069 birds, representing 129 species, were captured by mist-netting and artificial light. The extent of phototaxis effect on bird migration was examined during all four seasons, three phases of the moon, and under two weather conditions (mist and wind). Data were statistically analyzed to determine the extent to which these factors may impact phototaxis of nocturnal migrants. The results point to phototaxis in birds migrating in the spring and autumn, especially in the autumn. Furthermore, migrating birds were more readily attracted to artificial lights during nights with little moonlight, mist, and a headwind. Regardless of the initial orientation in which birds flew, either following the wind or against the wind, birds would always fly against the wind when flying towards the light. This study broadens our understanding of the nocturnal bird migration, potentially resulting in improved bird ringing practices, increased awareness, and better policies regarding bird protection.

From a combined dataset of mitochondrial (ND2) and nuclear (28S) DNA sequences, we reconstructed the phylogeny of 46 species of Epilachnini from Asia, Africa, America, and the Australian region: 16 species in Epilachna, 24 species in Henosepilachna, and one species each in Adira, Afidenta, Afidentula, Afissula, Chnootriba, and Epiverta. In our phylogenetic trees, both Epilachna and Henosepilachna were reciprocally polyphyletic. Asian Epilachna species were monophyletic, except for the inclusion of Afissula sp. Asian and Australian Henosepilachna species likewise formed a monophyletic group, excluding H. boisduvali. African Epilachna and Henosepilachna species did not group with their respective Asian and American congeners, but were paraphyletic to other clades (Epilachna species) or formed a separate monophyletic group (Henosepilachna species) together with Chnootriba similis. The American Epilachna species were monophyletic and formed a clade with American Adira clarkii and Asian Afidentula manderstjernae bielawskii; this clade was the sister group to Asian and Australian Henosepilachna, but was distant from Asian Epilachna. Chnootriba was embedded in the African Henosepilachna clade, and Afissula in the Asian Epilachna clade. Epiverta, which is morphologically unique, was the sister group to Asian Epilachna, although with weak support. From reconstructions of biogeographical distribution and host-plant utilization at ancestral nodes, we inferred an African origin for the common ancestor of the species studied, and found the frequency of host shifts to differ greatly between the two major lineages of Epilachnini examined.

The products were characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis-NIR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Scanning electron micrograph was employed to examine the morphology of PAN Is fabricated in the presence of different transition metals. Experimental results showed that transition metal ions had been successfully incorporated into the polymer, and there was a strong interaction between the transition metal ions and the PANI chains. The electrical conductivity of PANI doped with Zn2+ and Cu2+ is 0.37 and 0.21 S/cm, respectively, which is higher than that of HCl doping PANI corresponding to 0.052 S/cm. The cyclic voltammetric study has indicated that incorporation of metal ions in PANI backbone results in increasing of specific capacitance compared to that of HCI doping PAM.

Development of Pre-Tensioning Device for CFRP Strips and Applicability to Repair of Cracked Steel Members	ADVANCES IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						CFRP strip; pre-tensioning device; debonding; creep; repair of fatigue crack	FATIGUE	A method of repairing cracked steel members with pre-tensioned CFRP strips was investigated experimentally. Since a compressive force is introduced into the steel members by releasing the pre-tension in the CFRP strips after bonding, this technique is an effective fatigue crack repair method. With the aim of applying the method to a real structure, a simple, compact pre-tensioning device prototype was developed, and the effectiveness of the repair method was verified experimentally. The preliminary experiments were conducted using flat steel plates and varying the pre-tension of the CFRP strips. Results of tensile and creep tests revealed that it was possible to introduce a compressive force of approximately 36 kN into the steel plate rationally. Moreover, strain in the steel plate was measured for approximately 3 yrs. after introducing the compressive force, and a pre-stress loss of approximately 20% due to creep of the adhesive joint was observed under room-temperature conditions. Fatigue test results confirm that the application of this method to fatigue crack repair is feasible.

The size and complexity of folksonomy-based systems can unfortunately lead to information overload and reduced utility for users. Consequentially, the increasing need for recommender services from users has arisen. Many efforts have been made to address recommendation accuracy as well as other issues with respect to personalized recommendation in such systems. A key challenge facing these systems is that the most useful individual recommendations are to be found among diverse niche resources while increasing diversity most often compromises accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet elegant method-Diversity-aware Personalized PageRank (DaPPR)-to address this challenge from the aggregate perspective. DaPPR exploits a balance factor to adjust the influence of a personalized ranking vector and a unified non-personalized ranking vector based on PageRank. By this, it can reduce the impact of resource popularity on recommendations and then generate more diverse and novel recommendations to users. A hybrid DaPPR model that combines two ranking processes on the user-resource and the resource-tag bipartite graphs is specifically designed to meet the requirements in folksonomy-based systems. According to solid experiments, our proposed method yields better results balancing both aggregate accuracy and aggregate diversity (novelty). Improvements of all performance metrics are also obtained compared with the existing algorithms.

To attack this issue, various disambiguation methods combined with separate disambiguation features have been put forward. In this paper, we offer an unsupervised Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) based hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm for author disambiguation tasks. Distinct from existing methods, we exploit the DST in combination with Shannon's entropy to fuse various disambiguation features and come up with a more reliable candidate pair of clusters for amalgamation in each iteration of clustering. Also, some solutions to determine the convergence condition of the clustering process are proposed. Depending on experiments, our method outperforms three unsupervised models, and achieves comparable performances to a supervised model, while does not prescribe any hand-labelled training data.

Previous attempts to model the population sex ratios of such species have assumed that helping is cost-free and only involves benefits to parents, resulting in offspring sex ratio biases towards the helping sex. However, parents may also incur costs in maintaining helpers. We incorporated costs and benefits of helping to predict the sex ratio of offspring in a theoretical model. Our model showed that the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) sex ratio strongly depends on three parameters: (1) the average number of helpers per female; (2) the benefits that a helper brings to its mother's offspring production (MOP); and (3) the cost-benefit ratio of helping. When one sex of elder siblings provides help, the ESS sex ratio is biased towards the helping sex if MOP costs are less than the benefits, (i.e., the cost-benefit ratio <1). However, the ESS sex ratio becomes biased towards the non-helping sex if MOP costs exceed the benefits (i.e., the cost-benefit ratio >1). Additionally, our model shows that the ESS sex ratio becomes biased in favor of the more helpful sex when both male and female elder siblings provide help. These results explain why sex ratios may become biased towards the helping sex, as well as the non-helping sex, in some species.

NOV.; BACTERIAL; IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; ACTINOMYCETE; RELATEDNESS; CAVE; SOIL	Hundung Limestone habitat, Manipur, India is an unexplored site for microbial diversity studies. Using polyphasic taxonomy, a Streptomyces strain, MBRL 172(T), has been characterized. The strain was found to show highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Streptomyces coeruleofuscus NBRC 12757(T) (99.2 %). The DNA relatedness between MBRL 172(T) and S. coeruleofuscus NBRC 12757(T), and between MBRL 172(T) and Streptomyces nogalater NBRC 13445(T), were 36.8 +/- A 4.4 and 52.5 +/- A 2.7 %, respectively. Strain MBRL 172(T) was found to contain ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and glucose, mannose and xylose as the major sugars in whole cell hydrolysates. The polar lipids in the cell membrane were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositolmannoside. The predominant menaquinones detected were MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-8). The cellular fatty acids identified were mainly saturated fatty acids: anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 and iso-C-15:0. Based on differences in the biochemical and molecular characteristics from its closest relatives, the strain can be proposed to represent a novel taxon in the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces canchipurensis is proposed, with the type strain MBRL 172(T) (=JCM 17575(T) = KCTC 29105(T)).

Cells were observed to be motile rods by means of peritrichous flagella and colonies were observed to be convex, yellow, circular and showed catalase-positive and oxidase-negative reactions. Strain YIM h-19(T) was able to grow at 4-45 A degrees C, pH 6.0-8.0 and 0-3 % NaCl (w/v). The predominant respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7. Major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and C-16:0. The polar lipids were found to be phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified polar lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 54 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed the strain YIM h-19(T) was most closely related to Paenibacillus hordei RH-N24(T) and Paenibacillus hunanensis FeL05(T) with similarities of 98.30 and 94.64 % respectively. However, DNA-DNA hybridization data indicated that the isolate represented a novel genomic species with the genus Paenibacillus. All data from genotypic and phenotypic analyses support the conclusion that strain YIM h-19(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus nicotianae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM h-19(T) (=CGMCC1.12819(T) = NRRL B-59112(T)).

The results showed: (i) the changes in the distribution range of major vegetation types in the study area. In the 6 statistic years after 1976, in the study area, the distribution range of the secondary vegetation shrank greatly in 4 different subareas (northeast, southeast, northwest and northwest subarea), at 4 different altitudes (1500-1800 m, 1800-2100 m, 2100-2400m and 2400-2700m), on 4 different gradients (0-8 degrees, 8-15 degrees, 15-25 degrees, 25-35 degrees) and on 4 different aspects but the flat land (sunny slope, semi-sunny slope, semi-shadowy slope, and shadowy slope); by contrast, in the study area, the distribution range of artificial vegetation expanded greatly in all the subareas, at 2 different altitudes (1800-2100 m and 2100-2400 m), on 3 different gradients (0-8 degrees, 8-15 degrees, 15-25 degrees), and on the 4 different aspects but the flat land. (ii) The increase and decrease in distribution area of major vegetation types in the study area. During the research period, the total area of major vegetation fluctuated between 1471.92 and 1196.94 km(2), averaging 1255.52 km(2) annually, with the fluctuation rate between -4.67% and 17.24%. In the second statistic year (1989), the total area of major vegetation decreased sharply, and then remained relatively stable afterward. During the research period, the distribution area of the secondary vegetation decreased sharply in the 6 statistic years after 1976, in contrast to the sharp increase in the distribution area of artificial vegetation in such 6 years. During the research period, the total area of major vegetation decreased by 258.73 km(2) in total, among which the total area of the secondary vegetation decreased by 342.52 km(2) in contrast to the increase in artificial vegetation by 83.78 km(2) in total. Thus, it indicated that the secondary vegetation in the study area had been damaged seriously, and the construction of artificial vegetation lagged behind, so there was a potential danger in ecological safety, which should be concerned and precautioned.

However, there is still no report regarding a systematic proteomic analysis of seed proteins in the wild rice species. Also, the relationship between the contents of seed total proteins and rice nutritional quality has not been thoroughly investigated. Results: The total seed protein contents, especially the glutelin contents, of the three wild rice species were higher than those of the two cultivated rice materials. Based on the protein banding patterns of SDS-PAGE, O. rufipogon was similar to the two cultivated rice materials, followed by O. officinalis, while O. meyeriana exhibited notable differences. Interestingly, O. meyeriana had high contents of glutelin and low contents of prolamine, and lacked 26 kDa globulin band and appeared a new 28 kDa protein band. However, for O. officinali a 16 kDa protein band was absent and a row of unique 32 kDa proteins appeared. In addition, we found that 13 kDa prolamine band disappeared while special 14 kDa and 12 kDa protein bands were present in O. officinalis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis revealed remarkable differences in protein profiles of the wild rice species and the two cultivated rice materials. Also, the numbers of detected protein spots of the three wild rice species were significantly higher than those of two cultivated rice. A total of 35 differential protein spots were found for glutelin acidic subunits, glutelin precursors and glutelin basic subunits in wild rice species. Among those, 18 protein spots were specific and 17 major spots were elevated. Six differential protein spots for glutelin acidic subunits were identified, including a glutelin type-A 2 precursor and five hypothetical proteins. Conclusion: This was the first report on proteomic analysis of the three wild rice species. Overall results suggest that there were many new types of glutelin subunits and precursor in the three wild rice species. Hence, wild rice species are important genetic resources for improving nutritional quality to rice.

The calculated results indicate that within the frame of several-band coupled model, the bonding-antibonding ground-state transition and a bonding-antibonding energy anti-crossover phenomenon are observed with interdot distance increasing. These results have not been observed previously in those single-band model calculations. The analysis of the wavefunction component of bonding-antibonding hole state shows that the contribution ratios of light, heavy and spin-orbital-split-off hole states to the characteristic hole wavefunction vary with the increase of the vertical coupled distance, resulting in the ground state wavefunction changing from bonding states to antibonding ones finally.

In this work we report findings that the band structure of MoO3 can be significantly altered by a distortion in the octahedral coordination structure. We discovered that, in addition to epitaxial type of structural strain, chemical force such as hydrogen inclusion can also cause extended lattice distortion. The lattice distortion in hydrogenated MoO3 led to a significant reduction of the energy gap, overshadowing the Moss-Burstein effect of band filling. Charge doping simulations revealed that filling of conduction band drives the lattice distortion. This suggests that any charge transfer or n-type electron doping could lead to lattice distortion and consequentially a reduction in energy gap.

We use Q(+) and Z(+) to denote the sets of positive rational numbers and positive integers, respectively. For any connected mixed graph G = (V, E boolean OR A; w; l, u) with a length function w : E boolean OR A -> Q(+) and two integer functions l, u : E boolean OR A -> Z(+) satisfying l(e) <= u(e) for each e is an element of E boolean OR A, we are asked to determine a minimum length tour T traversing each e is an element of E boolean OR A at least l(e) and at most u(e) times. This new constrained arc routing problem generalizes the mixed Chinese postman problem. Let n = vertical bar V vertical bar and m = vertical bar E boolean OR A vertical bar denote the number of vertices and edges (including arcs), respectively. Using network flow techniques, we design a (1 + 1/l(0))-approximation algorithm in time O(n(2)m(3) log n) to solve this constrained arc routing problem such that l(e) < u(e) holds for each edge e is an element of E, l(e) <= u(e) holds for each arc e is an element of A and l(0) = min{l(e)vertical bar e is an element of E}. In addition, we present two optimal combinatorial algorithms in times O(n(3)) and O(nm(2) log n) to solve this problem for the cases A = empty set and E = empty set, respectively.

They represent mainly a series of early instars, exhibiting some delicate structures and morphological variation associated with their trunk segmentation and early development. Morphometric and statistical analyses indicate that the transverse joint appears to occur with the full growth of the third axial ring of the protopygidium, which increases in size much more rapidly than its corresponding protocephalon with growth. The 'one by one' sequential release of thoracic segments from a transitory pygidium does not progress exactly in accordance with the development of the pygidial axis, whose axial rings increase at a relatively faster rate, and an 'immature ring' always appears initially at the rear end of the axis. These new data set up a testable model for revealing trilobite segmentation and provide fresh insights into the development, evolution and taphonomic surroundings associated with the Cambrian trilobites.

Despite many bionomics studies and massive controlling efforts, research on its population genetics is extremely limited. The present study, aimed at investigating the origin and dispersal of this important forestry pest, analyzed the population genetic structure and demographic history using a mitochondrial cox1 gene fragment. Our results showed that T. yunnanensis most likely originated from the Central-Yunnan Altiplano, and the divergence time analysis placed the origin approximately 0.72 million-years ago. Host separation and specialization might have caused the speciation of T. yunnanensis. Genetic structure analyses identified two population groups, with six populations near the origin area forming one group and the remaining six populations from western and eastern Yunnan and southwestern Sichuan comprising the other. Divergence time analysis placed the split of the two groups at approximately 0.60 million-years ago, and haplotype phylogenetic tree, network, as well as migration rate suggested that populations of the latter group were established via a small number of individuals from the former one. Migration analysis also showed a certain degree of recent expansion from southwestern Sichuan to eastern Yunnan. Our findings implied that T. yunnanensis underwent both historical expansion and recent dispersal. The historical expansion may relate to the oscillation of regional climate due to glacial and interglacial periods in the Pleistocene, while human-mediated transportation of pine-wood material might have assisted the relocation and establishment of this pest in novel habitats.

Optical rotation and electronic circular dichroism were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p)//PCM/B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) or other levels in the gas phase and/or in solution. Computational results exhibited that the early reported absolute configuration of four among the seven may not be the best structures after comparing the computed optical rotations, electron circular dichroisms to the experimental data. Then four favorable structures are suggested based on the comparison of predicted optical rotations and electronic circular dichroisms to the experimental results. It is the first time to find that the different position of carbonyl group on aromatic ring (planar structure changes) in Griseusins can lead to the ECD curve reversed instead of the stereogenic center changes. In traditional opinion, ECD curve reversal happens only when stereogenic center configuration reverses, such as from AC of (R) to (S). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper explores the solvent extraction of phenol from wastewater using bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfoxide (BESO) as extractant. Various parameters such as equilibrium time, the volume percentage of BESO, pH value, and ionic strength of the aqueous solution on the phenol extraction were investigated. The results indicated that BESO exhibited excellent performance of phenol extraction. The extraction percentage increased from 97.26% to 99.47%, varying the BESO concentration from 10% (v/v) to 30% (v/v). The extraction percentage decreased with increasing temperature in the range of 298-343 K. FTIR spectra of fresh and phenol loaded BESO organic phase indicated the existence of the hydrogen bonding interactions between S=O groups and phenol molecules. The relationship between log D and log [BESO] suggested the stoichiometry of the extracted species was a 1:1 complex, namely, [PhOH]center dot[BESO]. Phenol stripping from the loaded organic phase by sodium hydroxide was feasible, and more than 99% of phenol could be stripped when the NaOH concentration was 0.5 mol L-1. The results obtained established that BESO/kerosene extraction system has potential for practical application in the phenol removal and recovery.

Quantum chemical calculation of density function theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to theoretically determine the relationship between molecular structure and inhibition efficiency. The results show that two aminopyrimidine derivatives act as good inhibitors, and inhibition efficiency follows the order: DAP > AP. The adsorption of each inhibitor on steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Both AP and DAP are arranged as mixed-type inhibitors. EIS diagram appears a large capacitive loop at high frequencies (HF) followed by a small inductive loop at low frequencies (LF), and the addition of aminopyrimidine inhibitor increases the impedance of electrode. The electron densities of both HOMO and LUMO are localized principally on the pyrimidine ring, which could be both the acceptor of the electron and the donor of the electron. The donating electrons to metal follows the order: DAP > AP, which is in completely accordance with that of inhibitive performance. MD simulations reveal both aminopyrimidine molecules adsorb on the Fe(0 0 1) surface in the nearly flat manner, and the sequence of either adsorption energy (E-ads) or binding energy (E-bin) agrees well with that of inhibition efficiency.

Sieving was used to determine the size distribution of the AgNi15 particles. The morphology, rapidly solidified structure and metastable solution expansion of the AgNi15 particles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The results show that the AgNi15 composite particles are spherical and well-dispersed, and the mass fractions of the particles with diameters <74 mu m and <55 mu m are 99.5% and 98%, respectively. The rapidly solidified structure of the AgNi15 particles consists of spherical nickel-rich beta(Ni)-phase particles dispersed throughout a silver-rich alpha(Ag)-phase matrix and alpha(Ag)-phase nanoparticles dispersed throughout larger beta(Ni)-phase particles. The silver and nickel in the AgNi15 particles form a reciprocally extended metastable solution, and the solid solubility of nickel in the silver matrix at room temperature is in the range of 0.16%-0.36% (mole fraction).

In order to search for potent steroidal aromatase inhibitors (SAIs) with lower side effects and overcome cellular resistance, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed on a series of SAIs to build 3D QSAR models. The reliable and predictive CoMFA and CoMSIA models were obtained with statistical results (CoMFA: q(2) = 0.636, r(ncv)(2) = 0.988, r(pred)(2) = 0.658; CoMSIA: q(2) = 0.843, r(ncv)(2) = 0.989, r(pred)(2) = 0.601). This 3D QSAR approach provides significant insights that can be used to develop novel and potent SAIs. In addition, Genetic algorithm with linear assignment of hypermolecular alignment of database (GALAHAD) was used to derive 3D pharmacophore models. The selected pharmacophore model contains two acceptor atoms and four hydrophobic centers, which was used as a 3D query for virtual screening against NCI2000 database. Six hit compounds were obtained and their biological activities were further predicted by the CoMFA and CoMSIA models, which are expected to design potent and novel SAIs.

K91 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The monomeric enzyme exhibited a theoretical molecular mass of 24.5 kDa and an optimal activity around 50 degrees C at pH 9.0. A model of Est8 was constructed using a hypothetical YxiM precursor structure (2014_A) from Bacillus subtilis as template. The structure showed an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and indicated the presence of a typical catalytic triad consisting of Ser-11, Asp-182, and His-185, which were investigated by site-directed replacements coupled with kinetic characterization. Asp-182 and His-185 residues were more critical than the Ser-11 residue in the catalytic activity of Est8. A comparison of the amino acid sequence showed that Est8 could be grouped into the GDSL family and further classified as an SGNH hydrolase. Est8 is a new member of the SGNH hydrolase subfamily and may employ a different catalytic mechanism.

Nevertheless, few efforts have been performed to evaluate the sequence data quality. Herein, we conducted a phylogenetic survey of these complete or near-complete mtDNA sequences based on mtDNA haplogroup trees for the eight animals. We show that errors due to artificial recombination, surplus of mutations and phantom mutations do exist in 14.5% (194/1342) of mtDNA sequences and all of them should be treated with wide caution. We propose some caveats for future mtDNA studies of domestic animals.

Further study on SPR and its ligand family from different taxa will not only provide insight into ligand-receptor coevolution but also facilitate finding new approaches for pest control. Our previous studies on the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura (Fabricius, 1775) showed that mating usually results in marked changes in female behaviour and determined that factors from male accessory gland (MAG) secretions play a key role in such switches in females after mating. In the present study, we report the cloning of a transcript encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor from S.litura. This 3kb transcript contains an ORF encoding a protein of 421 amino acids that shared significant amino acid identity to the SPR identified in Drosophila. Real-time PCR showed that the expression levels of the receptor in adults correlate well with the process of sexual maturation and mating rates; mating resulted in distinct sexual dimorphic differences in gene expression. Our results suggest that this gene is involved in mediating reproductive behaviour in adult moths. To test the hypothesis, we further studied the possible function of this receptor (SplSPR) on mediating female post-mating behaviour by using RNA interference (RNAi) and treatment with MAG secretions. RNAi reduced the expression levels of SplSPR by 65-88% and significantly prevented the effect of MAG secretions. Injection of MAG secretions causes normal virgin females to behave as though they had mated (they are sexually unreceptive and start to lay eggs), whereas SPR RNAi females fail to respond to MAG factors and continue to show virgin behaviours (lay very few eggs and copulate readily). These results support the hypothesis that the SplSPR functions in mediating female post-mating behaviour and the existence of an SP-like ligand in MAG secretions in S.litura.

Recently, it has become a potentially good subject for evaluating the effects of addictive drugs on the nervous systems. Our previous study has found that acute morphine injection affected associative memory and locomotor activity in honeybees. In the current study, the effect of chronic morphine treatment and its cessation in honeybees were assessed. The results demonstrated that 1) chronic morphine (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml) treatment for 7 days severely diminished associative memory in honeybees; 2) 1 mg/ml morphine consumption for 5, 7 and 10 but not 3 days impaired the olfactory memory; 3) Bees withdrawn from morphine for 1 day but not 3 days showed amnesia in the PER conditioning. We also found that bees displayed hyperactivity and tolerance in response to chronic morphine administration. In addition, morphine dose-dependently altered the sucrose responsiveness of bees. The data indicated that chronic morphine has sensory-motor effects and may impair learning and/or memory in honeybees, which were comparative to that in vertebrates.

Issues that surround a clear definition of terminology, as well as the consequences of poor terminology in such legislation, are highlighted, as well as the question of the propriety of the application of cultural legislation to palaeontological objects. Examples are given of ways in which foreign researchers can work legally with institutions in China on Chinese fossil material, as models of best practice to be followed.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 694-706.

However, relatively little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of parasitoidism. Here, we investigate the spatial patterns of genetic variation of Chinese cordyceps, including both the parasitoidal fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis and its host insects. We sampled broadly from alpine regions on the Tibetan Plateau and obtained sequences on seven fungal and three insect DNA fragments from each of the 125 samples. Seven and five divergent lineages/cryptic species were identified within the fungus and host insects, respectively. Our analyses suggested that O.sinensis and host insects originated at similar geographic regions in southern Tibet/Yunnan, followed by range expansion to their current distributions. Cophylogenetic analyses revealed a complex evolutionary relationship between O.sinensis and its host insects. Significant congruence was found between host and parasite phylogenies and the time estimates of divergence were similar, raising the possibility of the occurrence of cospeciation events, but the incongruences suggested that host shifts were also prevalent. Interestingly, one fungal genotype was broadly distributed, consistent with recent gene flow. In contrast, the high-frequency insect genotypes showed limited geographic distributions. The dominant genotypes from both the fungus and the insect hosts may represent ideal materials from which to develop artificial cultivation of this important Chinese traditional medicine. Our results demonstrate that both historical and contemporary events have played important roles in the phylogeography and evolution of the O.sinensis-ghost moth parasitoidism on the Tibetan Plateau.

A simple organic diode structure with strong rectifying characteristics	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Organic diodes; Rectifying characteristics; Charge transfer exciton recombination; Organic/organic heterojunction	HETEROJUNCTION; RECTIFICATION; INTERFACES; ENERGY; FILMS	A simple organic diode structure has been made based on N,N'-bis(naphthalen-l-yl)-N, N'-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPB)/Fullerene (C-60) heterojunction. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show an energy level alignment at the heterojunction as such that no potential barrier near this heterojunction to hinder the formation of charge transfer excitons, which recombines at a very fast rate. This fast exciton recombination at this heterojunction makes NPB/C-60 behave like an ideal Ohmic contact and thus leads to an extremely high 7.8 x 10(4) rectifying ratio from the electrode/organic contacts.

Cells of the strains were gram positive and non-motile, displayed a rod-coccus life cycle and formed cream to light grey colonies on nutrient agar. Strain NIO-1008(T) had the chemotaxonomic markers that were consistent for classification in the genus Arthrobacter, i.e. MK-9(H-2) (50.3 %), as the major menaquinone, and the minor amount of MK-7 (H-2-27.5 %), MK-8 (H-4-11.6 %) and MK-8 (H-2-10.4 %). anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 and C-15:0 were the predominant fatty acids. Galactose, glucose and rhamnose are the cell-wall sugars, and DNA G+C content was 61.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, showed that the strains were most similar to Arthrobacter equi IMMIB L-1606(T), Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus DSM 12829(T), Arthrobacter defluvii KCTC 19209(T) and Arthrobacter niigatensis CCTCC AB 206012(T) with 98.5, 98.4, 98.0 and 97.8 %, respectively, and formed a separate lineage. Combined phenotypic data and DNA-DNA hybridization data supported the conclusion that strains NIO-1008(T) represent a novel species within the genus Arthrobacter, for which the name Arthrobacter enclensis sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is NIO-1008(T) = (NCIM 5488(T) = DSM 25279(T)).

The stem of T. yunnanense is small, c. 30 mm in diameter, and comprises an ectophloic siphonostele without leaf gaps. Pith is bilayered and consists of longitudinally elongated cells. Cortex is not differentiated into an inner parenchymatous and outer sclerenchymatous zone characteristic of members of the Osmundaceae, and possesses longitudinally elongated cells and large secretory cells. Leaf traces are numerous (>100) and adaxially curved, with two endarch protoxylem strands upon departing the stele, increasing to more than four protoxylem strands as the trace passes the cortex, all distributed along the adaxial side of the leaf trace. Leaf traces have more-or-less incurved lateral tips, and are encircled by a vascular bundle sheath. A mass of thick-walled, longitudinally elongated cells occur in the adaxial concavity of the leaf trace. Adventitious roots arise singly from the abaxial and lateral margin of individual departing leaf traces, and extend in a sinuous manner horizontally and longitudinally. Abundant tyloses-like contents occur in cells of the cortex and represent the first account of these within fossil Osmundales, but unlike other plant groups in which they occur within xylem, fibre-tracheids and lactifers, in T. yunnanense they occur in longitudinally elongated cortex cells where they presumably impeded fungal hyphae growth. Radially aligned 'secondary' parenchyma within the stem appears to represent a wound reaction in the cortex in the living plant Due to its siphonostele without leaf gaps, Tiania is interpreted as an evolutionary intermediate between the protostelic thamnopterids and the more advanced dictyostelic osmundaleans. Biogeographic implications of Tiania are discussed from which it is concluded that the osmundalean diversity from the Late Permian of South China is unusually high and that these plants are likely to play an increasingly important rote in our understanding of the early evolutionary history and systematic relationships of the Osmundales.

Colonies of the two strains were observed to be pink-pigmented. The cells were found to be Gram-stain negative, coccoid and non-motile. The organisms were found to be aerobic and could grow in an NaCl range of 6-35 % (optimum 18 %), temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees C (optimum 37-42 degrees C), pH range from 6.0-8.5 (optimum pH 7.0-7.5) and Mg2+ range from 0 to 1.5 M (optimum 0.5-1.0 M); Mg2+ was not necessary for growth. Cells were not observed to lyse in distilled water. Strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Haladaptatus cibarius JCM 15962(T) (97.6 and 97.9 %, respectively). In addition, the DNA-DNA hybridizations of strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) with type strains H. cibarius JCM 15962(T), Haladaptatus litoreus JCM 15771(T) and Haladaptatus paucihalophilus JCM 13897(T) were 37.2 and 38.2 %, 36.6 and 39.0 % and 27.9 and 27.7 %, respectively. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) were determined to be 56.0 and 57.4 mol%. The major polar lipids of the two strains were identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate, sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether and other four unidentified glycolipids. On the basis of physiological, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic analysis, the strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) can be classified as a novel species of the genus Haladaptatus, for which the name Haladaptatus pallidirubidus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 93656(T) (= JCM 17504(T) = CCTCC AB2010454(T)).

The results suggest that the 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole ring, and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-bromophenacyl group, were vital for modulating inhibitory activity of cell growth. In particular, 1-((N-Boc-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-(2-naphthylacyl)-1H-5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolium bromide was found to be the most potent derivative and more selective against myeloid liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721), lung carcinoma (A549) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7), with IC50 values 1.9-fold, 1.7-fold and 4.8-fold lower than DDP. This compound can induce significant cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relations and entropy condition of delta shock waves and left(right)-contact delta shock waves are proposed and clarified. Secondly, with the help of the convex hull, seven kinds of structures of Riemann solutions are obtained. The solutions fall into three broad categories with a series of geometric structures involving simultaneously contact discontinuities, vacuums and delta shock waves. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis.

The proposed procedure can avoid the effects of the nonparametric estimator on the variable selection for the parameters components. Under some regularity conditions, the rate of convergence and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators are established. In addition, to improve efficiency for regression coefficients, the estimation of the working covariance matrix is involved in the proposed iterative algorithm. Some simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method performs well.

(2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method. A new family of two-wave solution, rational breather wave solution, is obtained by extended homoclinic test method, and it is just a rogue wave solution.

The total phenolic contents (TPC), total flavonoid contents (TFC), total ketosteroid contents (TKC), and antioxidant activities [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPTZ) radical-scavenging activity, reducing power, and ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP)] of the above extracts were investigated. Their main antioxidant components were further determined and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results revealed that the aqueous ethanol and aqueous methanol were more efficient in extracting antioxidant constituents from cornhusk, corncob, and stigma maydis. Eight main antioxidant components were detected from above three by-products, and the contents of four main antioxidant components were determined. The present work revealed that the cornhusk and corncob showed similar high TPC, TFC, TKC, and antioxidant activities with stigma maydis, and could be used as potential candidates for the prevention of diseases related to various oxidant by-products of human metabolism.

Moreover, without adding extra cobalt source, cobalt doped mesoporous titania was also synthesized by using cobalt resinate as both template and cobalt source. These mesoporous samples were characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as N-2 adsorption/adsorption isotherm, UV-vis diffuse reflectance, X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, XPS, and FT-IR. They were used for the photodegradation of methyl blue and Rhdamine B under visible light. It was found that P25 and mesoporous TiO2 synthesized using resin acid as template did not exhibit any meaningful activity for the photodegradation of two dyes under visible light. By contrast, cobalt doped mesoporous titania synthesized by using resin acid as template exhibited more significant photocatalytic yield (94%) for Rhdamine B. Moreover, cobalt doped mesoporous titania synthesized by using cobalt resinate as template also exhibited similar high photocatalytic activity for methyl blue to the former. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Feng, Z; Rossler, R; Annacker, V; Yang, JY				Feng, Zhuo; Roessler, Ronny; Annacker, Volker; Yang, Ji-Yuan			Micro-CT investigation of a seed fern (probable medullosan) fertile pinna from the Early Permian Petrified Forest in Chemnitz, Germany	GONDWANA RESEARCH			English	Article						Micro-Computer Tomography; Medullosales; Pollen organ; Petrified Forest in Chemnitz; Permian	POLLEN ORGAN; NORTH-AMERICA; GEN-N; EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE; ILLINOIS; FROND; BASIN; PTERIDOSPERMS; DOLEROTHECA; FERAXOTHECA	A new bipinnate fertile pinna, Sterzelitheca chemnitzensis, bearing alternate synangia, is described from the Chemnitz Petrified Forest, Germany. The specimen occurs in the basal volcanic ash of the Zeisigwald Tuff Horizon, Leukersdorf Formation, Lower Permian. Because it is partially embedded in the tuffaceous matrix, X-ray microcomputer tomography was employed to investigate the complete morphology without mechanical preparation of the hand specimen. The pinna is 66 mm long and branched once at least, the ultimate pinnae alternately positioned on the penultimate axis at angles of 45-55 degrees. Stalked synangia are bell-like, borne alternately on both the terminal portion of the penultimate axis and the ultimate axes at angles of 25-60 degrees. The smooth walled stalk is 3-7 mm long, 1-1.5 mm wide. Individual synangia are up to 6.5 mm in diameter and 10 mm long, and bear 12-14 elongated sporangia. Tubular sporangia are thin walled, circular in transverse section, arranged at the rim of the circular synangial pad around a central hollow. The unique preservational mould of the studied specimen is neither a permineralisation nor a compression-impression. It is three-dimensionally preserved, but lacks any organic remains. We provide the first detailed three-dimensional features of a probable medullosan male reproductive organ from the Chemnitz Fossil Lagerstatte. The relatively simple structure of the specimen offers a better understanding of the Palaeozoic seed ferns. (C) 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Production of branched tetraether lipids in Tibetan hot springs: A possible linkage to nitrite reduction by thermotolerant or thermophilic bacteria?	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers; Hot springs; Tibet; Nitrite reduction	DIALKYL GLYCEROL TETRAETHERS; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; PALEOTEMPERATURE PROXY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SEDIMENTS; ARCHAEAL; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSTRAINTS; TEMPERATURE	Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) are produced by bacteria and originally identified from soils and peat bogs; recently, however, in situ production of bGDGTs in hot springs has been reported. Consequently, we designed this study to evaluate the linkage between the distribution of bGDGTs, their biological sources and inferred metabolic processes based on the distribution and abundance of bGDGTs, pertinent water chemistry, the nirS gene (possibly in Beta-and Gamma-proteobacteria) and available 16S rRNA (tag) gene pyrosequencing data from 37 Tibetan hot springs. The absolute and relative concentrations of intact polar and core bGDGTs suggest that bGDGTs are predominantly produced in situ in these hot springs. Redundancy analyses revealed correlations between the distribution of bGDGTs and concentrations of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate and the abundance of nirS gene, which are better reflected in the core bGDGT fraction than in the respective intact polar bGDGT fraction. Reanalysis of published bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that residence of members of the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes correlated positively with a new methylation index (R((III + II)/) (I)) of bGDGTs. Some representatives of these taxa examined in this study are capable of nirS-encoded nitrite reduction, suggesting that bGDGT-synthesizing bacteria might be affiliated with these two phyla in Tibetan hot springs.

In DMSO, compound 1 proved to be an effective and selective colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for recognition of GMP, TMP, and UMP over other structurally similar nucleotides. Among all the tested nucleotides, only the addition of GMP, TMP, and UMP resulted in a fluorescence color change from blue to brown with a fluorescence enhancement of more than 600-fold, with the colorless solution turning brown. NMR spectroscopic titration, theoretical calculations, and spectral tests performed using various solvent compositions confirmed that compound 1 formed multiple hydrogen bonds with the related base groups in the nucleotide.

However, how M. bicoloratus parasitism regulates the host signaling pathways to induce DNA fragmentation during apoptosis remains unclear. To address this question, we performed a new RNAseq-based comparative analysis of the hemocytes transcriptomes of non-parasitized and parasitized S. litura. We were able to assemble a total of more than 11.63 Gbp sequence, to yield 20,571 unigenes. At least six main protein families encoded by M. bicoloratus bracovirus are expressed in the parasitized host hemocytes: Ankyrin-repeat, Ben domain, C-type lectin, Egf-like and Mucin-like, protein tyrosine phosphatase. The analysis indicated that during DNA fragmentation and cell death, 299 genes were up-regulated and 2,441 genes were down-regulated. Data on five signaling pathways related with cell death, the gap junctions, Ca2+, PI3K/Akt, NF-kappa B, ATM/p53 revealed that CypD, which is involved in forming a Permeability Transition Pore Complex (PTPC) to alter mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), was dramatically up-regulated. The qRT-PCR also provided that the key genes for cell survival were down-regulated under M. bicoloratus parasitism, including those encoding Inx1, Inx2 and Inx3 of the gap junction signaling pathway, p110 subunit of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and the p50 and p65 subunit of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These findings suggest that M. bicoloratus parasitism may regulate host mitochondria to trigger internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This study will facilitate the identification of immunosuppression-related genes and also improves our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying polydnavirus-parasitoid-host interaction.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of infinite crystalline lattices with metal clusters and organic linkers may provide opportunities for protease mimic which has remained unknown. Herein, we report that Cu-2(C9H3O6)(4/3) MOF (which is well known as HKUST-1 and denoted as Cu-MOF here), possesses an intrinsic enzyme mimicking activity similar to that found in natural trypsin to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein. The Michaelis constant (K-m) of Cu-MOF is about 26,000-fold smaller than that of free trypsin indicating a much higher affinity of BSA for Cu-MOF surface. Cu-MOF also exhibited significantly higher catalytic efficiency than homogeneous artificial metalloprotease Cu(II) complexes and could be reused for ten times without losing in its activity. Moreover, Cu-MOF was successfully used to simulate trypsinization in cell culture since it dissociated cells in culture even without EDTA.

Recently, a significant impact of changes in pupil size on gaze position as measured by camera-based eye trackers has been reported. In an attempt to improve the understanding of the magnitude and population-wise distribution of the pupil-size dependent shift in reported gaze position, we present the first collection of binocular pupil drift measurements recorded from 39 subjects. The pupil-size dependent shift varied greatly between subjects (from 0.3 to 5.2 deg of deviation, mean 2.6 deg), but also between the eyes of individual subjects (0.1 to 3.0 deg difference, mean difference 1.0 deg). We observed a wide range of drift direction, mostly downward and nasal. We demonstrate two methods to partially compensate the pupil-based shift using separate calibrations in pupil-constricted and pupil-dilated conditions, and evaluate an improved method of compensation based on individual look-up-tables, achieving up to 74% of compensation.

In this paper, high-resolution RegCM3 driven by ECHAM5 is applied to generate both control climate for 1980-2000 and regional climate projections for the 21st century (2010-2098) under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario. For control climate, RegCM3 can well reproduce the spatial patterns of precipitation and surface air temperature with more detailed representation of fine scale topography. Wet and cold biases are produced in the simulation, but overall improvement by RegCM3 is evident compared to the driving global climate model (GCM) of ECHAM5. In the future projection, the model demonstrates significant warming over the whole analysis domain. Precipitation on the other hand shows mixed signals of reduction and increase over simulation domain, while the areas of precipitation reduction extend with increasing integration time and finally covermost parts of the domain at the end of 21st century. As projection time increases, high altitude region will experience more precipitation reduction in summer and less reduction or even increase in winter. The winter warming at the high elevation area gets more evident than that at the low elevation area, which may be due to the snow feedback. Analyzing the change of probability distributions of surface climate, it can be concluded that the frequency of heavy precipitation in winter tends to increase with time indicating more extreme precipitation events in the future. The spectrum of temperature probability density functions (PDFs) moves toward higher end.

The complex with beta-CD was characterized by means of UV, XRD, DSC, TG, H-1, and 2D NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we investigated the main aspects of the interaction between GA-13316 and beta-CD using both experimental and molecular modeling approaches. The complex still maintained its anticancer activity, as shown by in vitro cell survival assay on the human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116) and the human lung cancer cell line (H460). The results showed that the use of beta-CD could be obviously improved the water solubility and stability of GA-13316, implying that the inclusion complex could be a promising future therapeutic agent.

Moreover, individuals showing moderate running in circles (one kind of obsessive compulsive behavior) in confined spaces typically performance compared to those without the circling behavior or to those with a serious circling behavior (which can be defined as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)). To determine whether the candidate gene CDH2, Cadherin , which is associated with OCD in the Doberman pinscher breed of dogs and in humans was linked with this behavioral character in the BM, population genetic analyses were performed on a BM population and a natural population of the Chinese indigenous dog (CID). Many genetic signals of balancing selection were detected for one specific region of the CDH2 gene, which suggests that a genomic block, which is included in the CDH2 gene, experienced balancing selection in the BM, and that the CDH2 gene might be associated with the behavioral characteristics of the BM dog la balance between circling behavior and work performance). Moreover one specific variant, G63913941A, which creates a predicted transcription factor-binding site, may be the key mutation in the CDH2 gene affecting the behavior of by allowing the binding of a transcription factor and increasing CDH2 expression.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	SEARCH FOR GeV GAMMA-RAY BURSTS WITH THE ARGO-YBJ DETECTOR: SUMMARY OF EIGHT YEARS OF OBSERVATIONS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astroparticle physics; gamma-ray burst: general	HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; CHERENKOV TELESCOPE ARRAY; SELF-COMPTON EMISSION; FERMI OBSERVATIONS; SPECTRAL CATALOG; SCALER MODE; GRB 090510; COMPONENT; AFTERGLOW; SWIFT	The search for gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission in the energy range of 1-100 GeV in coincidence with the satellite detection has been carried out using the Astrophysical Radiation with Ground-based Observatory at YangBaJing (ARGO-YBJ) experiment. The high-altitude location (4300ma.s.l.), the large active surface (similar to 6700 m(2) of Resistive Plate Chambers), the wide field of view (similar to 2 sr, limited only by the atmospheric absorption), and the high duty cycle (>86%) make the ARGO-YBJ experiment particularly suitable to detect short and unexpected events like GRBs. With the scaler mode technique, i. e., counting all the particles hitting the detector with no measurement of the primary energy and arrival direction, the minimum threshold of similar to 1 GeV can be reached, overlapping the direct measurements carried out by satellites. During the experiment lifetime from 2004 December 17 to 2013 February 7, a total of 206 GRBs occurring within the ARGO-YBJ field of view (zenith angle. similar to 45.) have been analyzed. This is the largest sample of GRBs investigated with a ground-based detector. Two light curve models have been assumed and since in both cases no significant excess has been found, the corresponding fluence upper limits in the 1-100 GeV energy region have been derived, with values as low as 10-5 erg cm(-2). The analysis of a subset of 24 GRBs with known redshift has been used to constrain the fluence extrapolation to the GeV region together with possible cutoffs under different assumptions on the spectrum.

There is no consensus on the origin of the ancient Mesopotamians. They may be descendants of migrants, who founded regional Mesopotamian groups like that of Terqa or they may be merchants who were involved in trans Mesopotamia trade. To identify the Indian source population showing linkage to the ancient Mesopotamians, we screened a total of 15,751 mitochondrial DNAs (11,432 from the literature and 4,319 from this study) representing all major populations of India. Our results although suggest that south India (Tamil Nadu) and northeast India served as the source of the ancient Mesopotamian mtDNA gene pool, mtDNA of these ancient Mesopotamians probably contributed by Tamil merchants who were involved in the Indo-Roman trade.

The genetic benefit models require sperm from different males to fertilize eggs competitively or the offspring be fathered by multiple males. To maximize genetic benefits from multiple mating, females have evolved strategies to prefer novel versus previous mates in their subsequent matings. However, the reproductive behavior during mate encounter, mate choice and egg laying in relation to discrimination and preference between sexes has been largely neglected. In the present study, we used novel and previous mate treatments and studied male and female behavior and reproductive output in Spodoptera litura. The results of this study do not support the sperm and nutrient replenishment hypotheses because neither the number of mates nor the number of copulations achieved by females significantly increased female fecundity, fertility and longevity. However, females showed different oviposition patterns when facing new versus previous mates by slowing down oviposition, which allows the last male has opportunities to fertilize her eggs and the female to promote offspring diversity. Moreover, females that have novel males present called earlier and more than females that have their previous mates present, whereas no significant differences were found on male courtship between treatments. These results suggest that S. litura females can distinguish novel from previous mates and prefer the former, whereas males generally remate regardless of whether the female is a previous mate or not. In S. litura, eggs are laid in large clusters and offspring competition, inbreeding and disease transfer risks are thus increased. Therefore, offspring diversity should be valuable for S. litura, and genetic benefits should be the main force behind the evolution of female behavioral strategies found in the present study.

Based on Laplace's equation, we propose a method to design thermal cloak of arbitrary shape. For a thermal cloak of regular shape, the thermal conductivity expression is derived by analytically solving the Laplace's equation under certain boundary conditions; for a thermal cloak of irregular shape, the distribution of thermal conductivity can also be obtained based on the numerical solution of Laplace's equation. Results of full wave simulation show that no heat fluxes emerge in the internal stealth area both for two-dimensional and three-dimensional thermal cloak of arbitrary shape. Meanwhile, the heat fluxes return to their original pathways, resulting in a perfect thermal invisible effect. This research provides a feasible method to design a thermal cloak of non-conformal cross section and has a guiding significance for the design and manufacturing of thermal cloak.

Thus, the testis is a major source for the generation of new genes in animals. The source tissue for new genes in plants is unclear. Here, we find that new genes in plants show a bias in expression to mature pollen, and are also enriched in a gene coexpression module that correlates with mature pollen in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transposable elements are significantly enriched in the new genes, and the high activity of transposable elements in the vegetative nucleus, compared with the germ cells, suggests that new genes are most easily generated in the vegetative nucleus in the mature pollen. We propose an "out of pollen" hypothesis for the origin of new genes in flowering plants.

The strains differed in phylogenetic position and drug-resistance profiles. The taxonomic position of strain IFM 10348(T) was clarified by phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences clearly demonstrated that strain IFM 10348(T) occupied a distinct clade within the genus Gordonia and was related closely to Gordonia malaquae DSM 45064(T) and Gordonia hirsuta DSM 44140(T) (97.3 and 97.1% similarities, respectively). Strain IFM 10348(T) was also clearly differentiated from G. malaquae DSM 45064(T) and G. hirsuta DSM 44140(T) based on gyrB and secA1 gene sequence similarity values. Strain IFM 10348T had MK-9(H-2) as the predominant menaquonine, contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose, galactose and glucosamine as cell-wall components, and contained C-18:1 omega 9c, summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) and C-16:0 as the major cellular fatty acids. Mycolic acids were present. The DNA G + C content of strain IFM 10348T was 68.0 mol%. DNA DNA relatedness data coupled with the combination of genotypic and phenotypic data indicated that strain IFM 10348(T) represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia iterans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IFM 10348(T) (= CCTCC M2011245(T)=NCCB 100436(T)).

The antioxidant activities were evaluated in three different test systems [DPPH, ABTS radical-scavenging activity, and ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP)]. It was found that the extract of Helminthosporium maydis fermented B. formosana (FBF) possessed the highest TPC and exhibited a significant antioxidant activity compared with non-fermented product and other fermented products. Correlation analysis between antioxidant activities and TPC was also investigated. The good correlation between antioxidant activities and TPC revealed that the phenolic compounds might be the major contributors for the high antioxidant activities of the fermented B. formosana. Two phenolic compounds, curvularin and dehydrocurvularin, were isolated from H. maydis FBF, which had never been reported from plant of orchidaceae or H. maydis. Curvularin exhibited significant antioxidant activities, and was also present at a high concentration (0.373 mg/mg extract sample), implying an important role for the antioxidant activity of H. maydis FBF. This study suggested that proper fermentation processing could improve TPC and antioxidant activities of B. formosana. (c) 2014, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

Changes in Soil Properties and Quality for a Eucalyptus Introduction Area: A Case Study in Lancang County, Yunnan Province	JOURNAL OF RESIDUALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; NUTRIENT; CHINA; SPAIN	Establishment of exotic species in the natural secondary forest and Pinus kesiya forest regions is common in Lancang County, southwestern Yunnan province, but their effects on soil properties and quality have not been fully studied. This research analyzed the effects of Eucalyptus plantation on soil physical and chemical properties, and evaluated the soil quality after Eucalyptus plantation replaced natural secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest and Pinus kesiya plantation. It was found that soil porosity, soil water content, soil pH, soil organic matter, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium and microelement decreased, soil bulk density increased and soil aeration permeability became very low after establishment of Eucalyptus. However, with forest litter retained, the contents of soil N, P and K had been rising in the case of applying fertilizer at the initial stage of Eucalyptus introduction. The soil quality indexes (SQI) under Eucalyptus plantation were lower than those under the natural secondary evergreen broadleaved forest and Pinus kesiya plantation. The SQI of soils in Eucalyptus plantation which replaced Pinus kesiya plantation lands (SQI = 0.208) was lower than that of soils in Eucalyptus plantation which replaced natural secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest lands (SQI = 0.269). The study results showed that replacement of natural secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest and Pinus kesiya plantation by Eucalyptus plantation has changed soil properties and lowered soil quality.

Riviere) leaves using a series of C2H5OH-water solutions (20%-80% (volume fraction)). The solutions were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. The total flavonoid content of the PSLE was determined. The inhibition effect of PSLE toward the corrosion of aluminum in HCl solution was studied by weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations including solvent effects were used to investigate the adsorption of light by the two major components vientin and isovientin. The results show that PSLE is a good inhibitor and the adsorption of PSLE on the aluminum surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The inhibition efficiency increases with PSLE concentration while it decreases with temperature and HCl concentration. A good correlation exists between the total flavonoid content and the inhibition performance. This implies that the flavonoids are the major contributor to inhibition activity. PSLE behaves as a cathodic inhibitor. The EIS spectra are characterized by one large capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a large inductive loop at low frequency values. The impedance value increases with increasing inhibitor concentration. SEM results confirm that the corrosion of aluminum is retarded remarkably by PSLE. The quantum calculation results indicate that the adsorption center of either vientin or isovientin is mainly a flavonoid backbone structure (FBS).

The phospholipid bilayer membrane used in the work was one type of lecithin phospholipid bilayer membrane called the 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphate dylcholine (POPC) bilayer membrane, and the molecular dynamics simulation was performed with the Gromacs program. The free energy barrier for methyldopa to permeate through the POPC bilayer membrane was 99.9 kJ.mol(-1) (310 K) from the molecular dynamics simulation, suggesting that methyldopa is capable of permeating through the cell membrane. The free energy barrier for methyldopa to diffuse through the POPC bilayer membrane was 16.9-27.7 kJ.mol(-1) (310 K), which indicates that it is easy for methyldopa to diffuse through the cell membrane. Therefore, the results of the free energy barrier give information of the mechanism for methyldopa to metabolize in the human body. Furthermore, the results help to understand the mechanism for methyldopa in treating hypertension disease, and have significance for developing new drugs to control hypertension.

Based on a two-subband model, the dynamical dielectric function matrix is derived under the random-phase approximation. An optic-like branch and an acoustic-like branch, which are free of Landau damping, are observed for both plasmon and surface-plasmon modes. Interestingly, for surface-plasmon modes, we find that two branches of the dispersion relation curves converge at a wavevector q(z) = q(max) beyond which no surface-plasmon mode exists. Moreover, we examine the dependence of these excitation modes on sample parameters such as the radius of the nanowires. It is found that in metallic nanowires realized by state-of-the-art nanotechnology the intra-and inter-subband plasmon and surface-plasmon frequencies are in the terahertz bandwidth. The frequency of the optic-like modes decreases with increasing radius of the nanowires, whereas that of the acoustic-like modes is not sensitive to the variation of the radius. This study is pertinent to the application of metallic nanowires as frequency-tunable terahertz plasmonic devices.

GN25 isolated from feces of Grus nigricollis. InuAGN25 showed the highest identity of 54.3% with a putative levanase recorded in GenBank. Molecular-Activity strategy was proposed to predict InuAGN25 to be a low-temperature-active exo-inulinase before experiments performance. Molecular analyses included progressive sequential, phylogenetic and structural analyses. InuAGN25 was effectively expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant InuAGN25 showed characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes: (1) the enzyme retained 55.8% of the maximum activity at 20 degrees C, 35.8% at 10 degrees C, and even 8.2% at 0 degrees C; (2) the enzyme exhibited 75.8, 30.5 and 10.8% of the initial activity after preincubation for 60min at 45, 50 and 55 degrees C, respectively; (3) K-m values of the enzyme toward inulin were 2.8, 3.0, 3.2 and 5.8 mg ml(-1) at 0, 10,20 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Fructose was the main product of inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers hydrolyzed by the purified recombinant InuAGN25 at room temperature, 10 degrees C and 0 degrees C. These results suggested the Molecular-Activity strategy worked efficiently and made InuAGN25 promising for the production of fructose at low temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

China's transboundary waters: new paradigms for water and ecological security through applied ecology	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Review						Asian Mainland; climate change; geological issues; Himalayas; hydropower; Lancang-Mekong; Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region; Nu-Salween; Tibetan plateau; transboundary ecosystems	MEKONG RIVER; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; HYDROPOWER; DRIVERS; IMPACTS; YUNNAN; BASIN	1. China is Asia's most important upstream riparian country, sharing 110 rivers and lakes with 18 downstream countries. Consequently, China's management of transboundary water resources must consider both environmental and geopolitical risks. 2. The major threats to and conflicts over international rivers in China revolve around biotic homogenisation due to the installation of transport links, water allocation, water pollution, alteration of natural flow patterns and disruption of fisheries due to the installation of hydropower dams, and droughts and floods exacerbated by climate change. Because these problems have an international component, they fall under China's Peaceful Rise strategy, mandating that transboundary conflicts be resolved amicably as part of the overarching goal of increasing regional economic growth with as little conflict as possible. 3. Science-backed policy is more likely to result in long term, mutually agreeable solutions; the results of applied ecological research have already resulted in a number of mitigation measures, including setting operational thresholds to reduce the downstream impact of dams, designating protected areas along key river stretches where dams cannot be installed (one dam in a critical location has been cancelled), and the installation of terrestrial protected-area networks. 4. Synthesis and applications. Applied ecology will continue to play an important role in the diagnosis and resolution of environmental threats to China's transboundary waters. More importantly, applied ecology can inform the development of a transboundary environmental compensation mechanism and regional consultative mechanisms that support informed, cooperative decision-making for China and its riparian neighbours.

The results show that peak stress increases with decreasing temperature and increasing strain rate, and the apparent activation energy of this alloy was determined to be about 494 kJ/mol. The constitutive equation which can be used to relate the peak stress to the absolute temperature and strain rate was obtained. The processing maps for hot working developed on the basis of flow stress data and the dynamic materials model were adopted to optimize the hot workability. It is found that the features of the maps obtained in the strain range of 0.2 to 1.0 are fundamentally similar, indicating that the strain does not have a substantial influence on processing map. The combination of processing map and microstructural observations indicates that the favorable hot deformation conditions are located in two domains of processing map. The first domain occurs in the temperature range of 980 to 1035 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.001 to 0.01 s(-1) with a peak efficiency of 55%. The second domain appears in the temperature range of 1120 to 1180 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.3 to 3 s(-1) with peak efficiency of 35%. Compared to other stable domains, the specimens deformed in these two domains exhibit full dynamic recrystallization grains with finer and more uniform sizes. An instability domain occurs at temperatures below 1100 degrees C and strain rate above 0.1 s(-1), and flow instability is manifested in the form of flow localization.

The treatment of pretreated coking wastewater by flocculation-coagulation, alkali out, air stripping, and three-dimensional (3-D) electrocatalytic oxidation was performed (gap between the used beta-PbO2/Ti anode and titanium cathode, 12 mm; mass ratio of Cu-Mn/granular activated carbon (GAC) to effluent, 1:4; cell voltage, 7 V). The results showed that the pH adjusting from 3.7 to 6.1 was necessary for coagulants; alkali out played an important role because it brought up precipitation containing higher fatty acids as well as other contaminants to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent, and it had also forced the reduction of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) by incorporating with air stripping; for 3-D electrocatalytic oxidation with a bleaching liquid assisting, the initial pH 8.5 of effluent was suitable for Cu-Mn/GAC; moreover, it was considered that its Cu component was dedicated to the decrease of COD and NH3-N, while the Mn component specialized in the decay of NH3-N. The residual COD and NH3-N values in the final effluent with pH 6.5 were 95.8 and 8.8 mg/L, respectively, demonstrating that the whole processes applied were feasible and low in cost.

Cells were Gram-staining-positive, motile, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, spore-forming rods. The isolate grew aerobically at 30-50 degrees C (optimum at 45 degrees C), pH 2.0-6.0 (optimum pH 3.2) and 0-5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1% NaCl). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain ACK006(T) belongs to the genus Alicyclobacillus with the sequence similarity of 92.3, 92.4, 92.5, and 92.8% to Alicydobacillus cycloheptanicus SCHT, Alicyclobacillus ferrooxydans TC-34(T), Alicydobacillus contaminans 3-A191(T) and Alicydobacillus disulfidooxidans SD-11(T), respectively. Similarity to other species of the genus Alicydobacillus was 90.3-92.8% and similarity to species of the genus Tumebacillus was 85.9-87.8%. The genomic DNA G+C content was 53.7 mol%. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. Major fatty acids were omega-cydoheptane C-18:0, iso-C-17:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was the Al gamma type; containing meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. On the basis of polyphasic analysis from this study, strain ACK006(T) represents a novel species of the genus Alicydobacillus for which the name Alicydobacillus tengchongensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ACK006(T) (=KCTC 33022(T) =DSM 25924(T)).

Methods and Results: By in vitro bioassay, 53 NEB strains showing nematicidal efficacies of > 50% against J2 of M. incognita were isolated from wasabi. Basing on 16S rRNA gene sequences, these NEB were identified into 18 species of 11 genera. In greenhouse, incorporation of selected NEB culture or FWR into potted soil significantly reduced infection of M. incognita on tomato. Treating tomatoes with either FWR or NEB of Raoultella terrigena RN16 and Pseudomonas reinekei SN21 in the field yielded excellent control efficacies against M. incognita, especially the combinations of FWR with either R. terrigena RN16 or Ps. reinekei SN21 at doses of 50 g plus 100 ml per plant or more. Conclusions: The results established that R. terrigena RN16 and Ps. reinekei SN21 applied separately or combined with FWR have the potential to provide bioprotection agents against M. incognita. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides novel way for disease management using combination of endophyte and host residue.	[Li, G. J.; Dong, Q. E.; Ma, L.; Huang, Y.; Mo, M.

Little is known about the spatial distribution and environmental factors controlling soil carbon in mountainous regions. This study analyzed the spatial patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) density in mountainous regions and evaluated the impact of various environmental factors on SOC density. This study focused on Yunnan Province, a typical high-elevation, mountainous region in southwest China. A soil database was constructed based on 684 soil profiles documenting 12 environmental factors. Significant differences in SOC density among the upper and subsoil layers were found. Forestland and grassland SOC density were significantly higher than that of cropland. The widely distributed forestland in Yunnan Province had a higher SOC storage capacity than non-forested areas. The forests of the northwestern mountainous region had higher SOC densities than those of the agricultural areas of the southeastern plateau region. Environmental factors affected SOC density more strongly in forestland than grassland and cropland, and those factors were better correlated to the 0-20 cm layer of soils than the 20-100 cm layer. Elevation is the major controlling factor controlling SOC density for the three land uses. Correlating topography to SOC density proved difficult. SOC densities were highest when annual temperatures ranged from 0-2 A degrees C. SOC density decreased with increased precipitation up to 800 mm per year and then remained constant. The SOC density increased with elevation up to 4,000 m then decreased. The results indicate that both the local land use development plans and regional climatic change scenarios may result in a decrease in SOC storage in this region and increase the CO2 flux into the atmosphere. In consideration of the high sensitivity of the regional response to global warming, effective ecological compensation mechanisms and active forest protection should be undertaken in this region.

Variations preparation in the different alkali solution concentration, hydrothermal temperature, and reaction times were explored to shed light on the morphology of the rod-like nanostructures. The thorough structural characterization including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) were employed to examine the morphology and the microstructure of the final products. It was found that alkali solution concentration, hydrothermal temperature and time have important influence on the morphology of the rod-like nanostructures. The dye removal efficiency of ZnO nanorods was explored by the decoloration of azo dye Congo red (CR). In order to obtain the optimum removal conditions of Congo red, the performance of removing CR with various initial concentrations by ZnO nanorods on Zn substrates with different morphologies was tested under various ambient conditions (visible light illumination and darkness). All prepared samples showed an excellent dye removal efficiency for organic pollutants CR from wastewater, making them promising candidates for the wastewater treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal growth of the strain was found to occur at 28 A degrees C, pH 7.0 and without NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain SYP-B575(T) clearly belongs to the genus Sinomonas and should be considered as a candidate of novel species within this genus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain SYP-B575(T) and the other Sinomonas type strains ranged from 97.3 to 96.0 %. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was identified as MK-9(H-2) and the major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The polar lipids were found to consist of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and glycolipids. The major cell-wall amino acids were identified as Lys, Ala, Glu, Gly and Ser. The whole-cell sugars were identified as mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucose and galactose. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 66.6 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between SYP-B575(T) and its closest phylogenetic neighbours were lower than 35.5 %. On the basis of this polyphasic taxonomic study, strain SYP-B575(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sinomonas, for which the name Sinomonas notoginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed.

The reaction was performed with three readily available starting materials: heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) (1), acenaphthylene-1,2-dione (2), and ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate (3). In the one-step cascade reaction, two C-C bonds, two C-Hetero bonds, four consecutive quaternary stereocenters, and two heterocycles were constructed. The established protocol presented outstanding diastereoselectivity (up to 99:1) and provided a valuable route to access highly functionalized polycyclic pyrroles with conciseness, rapidness, and practicability. The reaction is particularly attractive due to the following advantages: atom economy, optimum convergence, high bond-forming efficiency, and operational simplicity.

Quantum chemical calculation of OFT including the solvent effect was applied to investigate the adsorption mode through light on chemical molecular structure. The results show that PMLE is a good inhibitor for both steel and zinc in 0.2 M H3C6H5O7 solution, and inhibition efficiency follows the order: zinc > steel. The adsorption of PMLE on both metal surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yin, CY; Yang, L; Zhao, H; Li, CP				Yin, Chunyan; Yang, Long; Zhao, Hui; Li, Can-Peng			Improvement of antioxidant activity of egg white protein by phosphorylation and conjugation of epigallocatechin gallate	FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Egg white protein; Phosphorylation; Epigallocatechin gallate; Antioxidant activity	ABSORBENCY CAPACITY ASSAY; GREEN-TEA; BETA-LACTOGLOBULIN; SERUM-ALBUMIN; POLYPHENOL; PEPTIDES; RADICALS; HEAT	Egg white protein (EWP) was phosphorylated by dry heating in the presence of pyrophosphate. The antioxidant activity of phosphorylated EWP (PP-EWP) was then investigated before and after conjugation of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The binding interaction between EWPs and EGCG was investigated by UV and FTIR, which indicated that more EGCG bound to PP-EWP than to native EWP and dry-heated EWP. The antioxidant activities including ABTS(+) free-radical scavenging capacity, oxygen radical antioxidant capacity, reducing power, chelating capacity, and superoxide anion scavenging activity of EWP were remarkably improved by phosphorylation before and after conjugation of EGCG. The improved antioxidant property of PP-EWP can be attributed to the introduced phosphate group, more exposed hydrophobic group, increased surface thiol group of protein, and more EGCG bound to EWP. The secondary structure of PP-EWP decreased with more bound EGCG. This study is the first to describe an improvement in the antioxidant property of EWP by phosphorylation and conjugation of EGCG, thereby providing insight into the design of food protein antioxidant.

Here we report a strain prioritization method for natural product discovery. Central to the method is the application of real-time PCR, targeting genes characteristic to the biosynthetic machinery of natural products with distinct scaffolds in a high-throughput format. The practicality and effectiveness of the method were showcased by prioritizing 1911 actinomycete strains for diterpenoid discovery. A total of 488 potential diterpenoid producers were identified, among which six were confirmed as platensimycin and platencin dual producers and one as a viguiepinol and oxaloterpin producer. While the method as described is most appropriate to prioritize strains for discovering specific natural products, variations of this method should be applicable to the discovery of other classes of natural products. Applications of genome sequencing and genome mining to the high-priority strains could essentially eliminate the chance elements from traditional discovery programs and fundamentally change how natural products are discovered.

Differential temperature and pH controls on the abundance and composition of H-GDGTs in terrestrial hot springs	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						H-GDGTs; Archaea; Hot springs; Yellowstone National Park; Tengchong; Tibet	GLYCEROL TETRAETHER LIPIDS; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; THERMOPHILIC ARCHAEA; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; CRENARCHAEOL; GEOCHEMISTRY; ARCHAEBACTERIA; BIOSYNTHESIS; SEDIMENTS; MARINE	H-shaped glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (H-GDGTs), also called glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (GMGTs), are a unique group of membrane lipids found in several lineages of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Their function in these taxa is, however, not well understood. Here we show their presence in both core lipid and polar lipid fractions from microbial biomass sampled from hot springs in Tibet, China (21.9-80.0 degrees C; pH 7.0-9.1), Tengchong, China (55.1-93.6 degrees C; pH 2.5-9.4) and Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA (16.3-86.7 degrees C; pH 2.1-9.6) using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The number of cyclopentyl rings ranged from zero (H-GDGT-0) to six (H-GDGT-6) in lipid fractions in Tengchong and YNP and from zero to four (H-GDGT-4) in those from Tibet. While H-GDGT-0 was the most abundant H-GDGT in Tibetan springs, H-GDGT-4 predominated in Tengchong and H-GDGT-6 predominant in YNP, resulting in higher ring indices in the latter springs. While pH appeared to be the most important factor affecting the variation in the relative abundance and average number of cyclopentane rings in H-GDGTs from YNP communities, both temperature and pH appeared to be important controls on the abundance of H-GDGT lipids in Tengchong communities, whereas neither pH nor temperature appeared to influence the abundance or average number of cyclopentane rings in H-GDGTs from Tibetan spring communities. Furthermore, the relative abundance of H-GDGTs to total iGDGTs was greater in hot springs with acidic pH, particularly those from YNP. This finding, coupled with taxonomic profiling of archaeal 16S rRNA genes recovered from the same YNP springs, indicates that H-GDGTs in acidic springs may be synthesized by members of the archaeal order Thermoplasmatales, which are adapted to acidic pH.

The Ag3PO4/RGO/Ag that consists of close chemical bonding between RGO and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles as well as dispersive plasmonic Ag nanocrystals on the RGO sheets exhibited superior photocatalytic activity and stability to bare Ag3PO4, Ag/Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4/GO in degradation of Rhodamine B and phenol under visible light. It is suggested that the photo-generated electrons in Ag3PO4 can be transferred to RGO/Ag, leading to efficient separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, under light irradiation, the plasmonic Ag nanocrystals also generate electron-hole pairs through surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which the active electrons can facilitate the formation of additional active species of O-2 center dot(-) for photocatalysis whereas the holes can be filled by electrons from RGO. As a result, both the photocorrosion of Ag3PO4 and the recombination of electron-hole pairs are suppressed due to the special electron transfer route of Ag3PO4 -> RGO -> Ag in the heterostructure. This work suggests that the reasonable combination of semiconductors and graphene decorated with noble metallic nanocrystals can provide a versatile strategy for the synthesis of high efficient heterostructed photocatalysts.

The oxidation of SO32- by photogenerated hole on g-C3N4 will induce a chain reaction initialed by SO32- to form (OH)-O-center dot while the hole oxidation of SO32- increases the separation of photogenerated electron and hole, which process promotes the photogenerated electron induced multistep reduction of O-2 generating (OH)-O-center dot to proceed. On the other hand, the cation, Na+, can interact with the negatively charged nitrogen pots in the C3N4 sheets via the ion dipole interaction. Such ion dipole interaction significantly improves the charge separation and transport, thus accelerating the formation of active species ((OH)-O-center dot). As a result of positive effect of Na+ and SO32- on photocatalysis of g-C3N4, the degradation rates of organic pollutants over g-C3N4 were significantly increased. Our studies offer the new opportunities for using the g-C3N4 with low cost and facile adjustable function to treat industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Infrared to terahertz absorption window in mono- and multi-layer graphene systems	OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Graphene; AB-stacking; ABC-stacking; Light transmittance; Optical conductance		We present a theoretical study on optical properties such as optical conductance and light transmission coefficient for mono- and multi-layer graphene systems with AB- and ABC-stacking. Considering an air/graphene/dielectric-water structure, the optical coefficients for those graphene systems are examined and compared. The universal optical conductance sigma(N)(0)=N pi e(2)/(2h) for N layer graphene systems in the visible region is verified. For N 3 layer graphene, the mini-gap induced absorption edges can be observed in odd layers AB-stacked multilayer graphene, where the number and position of the absorption edges are decided by the layers number N. Meanwhile, we can observe the optical absorption windows for those graphene systems in the infrared to terahertz bandwidth (0.2-150 THz). The absorption window is induced by different transition energies required for inter- and intra-band optical absorption channels. We find that the depth and width of the absorption window can be tuned not only via varying temperature and electron density but also by changing the number of graphene layers and the stacking order. These theoretical findings demonstrate that mono- and multi-layer graphene systems can be applied as frequency tunable optoelectronic devices working in infrared to terahertz bandwidth.

Brain structure resolves the segmental affinity of anomalocaridid appendages	NATURE			English	Article							BURGESS SHALE; ARTHROPOD; EVOLUTION; ONYCHOPHORA; ORIGIN; PERIPATOPSIDAE; ORGANIZATION; MORPHOLOGY; SUGGESTS; LABRUM	Despite being among the most celebrated taxa from Cambrian biotas, anomalocaridids (order Radiodonta) have provoked intense debate about their affinities within the moulting-animal clade that includes Arthropoda. Current alternatives identify anomalocaridids as either stem-group euarthropods(1-3), crown-group euarthropods near the ancestry of chelicerates(4), or a segmented ecdysozoan lineage with convergent similarity to arthropods in appendage construction(5). Determining unambiguous affinities has been impeded by uncertainties about the segmental affiliation of anomalocaridid frontal appendages. These structures are variably homologized with jointed appendages of the second (deutocerebral) head segment, including antennae and 'great appendages' of Cambrian arthropods, or with the paired antenniform frontal appendages of living Onychophora and some Cambrian lobopodians. Here we describe Lyrarapax unguis-pinus, a new anomalocaridid from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota, southwest China, nearly complete specimens of which preserve traces of muscles, digestive tract and brain. The traces of brain provide the first direct evidence for the segmental composition of the anomalocaridid head and its appendicular organization. Carbon-rich areas in the head resolve paired pre-protocerebral ganglia at the origin of paired frontal appendages. The ganglia connect to areas indicative of a bilateral pre-oral brain that receives projections from the eyestalk neuropils and compound retina. The dorsal, segmented brain of L. unguispinus reinforces an alliance between anomalocaridids and arthropods rather than cycloneuralians. Correspondences in brain organization between anomalocaridids and Onychophora resolve pre-protocerebral ganglia, associated with pre-ocular frontal appendages, as characters of the last common ancestor of euarthropods and onychophorans. A position of Radiodonta on the euarthropod stem-lineage implies the transformation of frontal appendages to another structure in crown-group euarthropods, with gene expression and neuroanatomy providing strong evidence that the paired, pre-oral labrum is the remnant of paired frontal appendages(1).

Novel anti-clotting and biodegradable multi-block polyurethanes were then prepared by EDTA-diol and biodegradable poly(1,4-butylene adipate glycol) (PBA) as the soft chain, and 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the hard chain, respectively. The effect of the EDTA-diol content in the soft chain of the prepared polyurethanes on mechanical properties, thermal stability, hydrophilicity, and anticoagulant ability was largely investigated by tensile tests, thermogravimetric analysis, contact angle and water absorption measurements, and hemolytic measurement. Self-assembly behaviors of the resulting polyurethanes were also evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The prepared polyurethanes have large potential applications in the fields of biomedical materials such as tissue engineering and drug carriers.

All of these approaches indicated that picoplatin was able to form an inclusion complex with gamma-CD, and that the picoplatin/gamma-CD inclusion compounds exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from free picoplatin. The stoichiometry of the complex was 1:1; the pyridine group of picoplatin was deeply inserted into the cavity of gamma-CD and the amine platinum group of picoplatin was near the narrower rim of gamma-CD. The calculated apparent stability constant of the complex was 10,318 M-1. Moreover, the water solubility of picoplatin was significantly improved, according to phase-solubility studies. The complex maintained its anticancer activity, as shown by an in vitro cell-survival assay on A549 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. All of these results showed that inclusion complexation may be a promising strategy to design a novel formulation of picoplatin as an anticancer therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanism of such effects in the Asian monsoon region remains unclear. This study revisits Fu's two-parameter climate elasticity index and enhances it by using the Gardner function to strengthen the former's prediction reliability when the future climate condition is beyond the historical range. Then the improved method was applied to study the elasticity change with temperature and precipitation in the eastern monsoon basins of China, whereas to explore the mechanism of climate change on runoff. Furthermore, the runoff change and the elasticity of the study area from 2020 to 2050 under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were predicted. Results show that the trend of elasticity change assumes a centrosymmetric picture with the symmetric point (0,0). Different catchments respond differently to the same climate change scenario: the sensitivity of the Haihe Basin is the highest; those of Yellow, Huaihe, Liaohe, Songhua, Pearl, Yangtze, and Southeast Rivers are lower, in descending order. The changing mode of precipitation and temperature differs greatly to keep the runoff unchanged. For semi-humid regions in which the mean annual temperature ranges from 0.71 degrees C to 9.0 degrees C, such as the basins of Songhua, Liaohe, Haihe, and Yellow, a 1 degrees C increase in temperature requires a corresponding 3.2-4.0% increase in precipitation to keep the runoff unchanged. However, in wet regions, such as the basins of Yangtze, Southeast Rivers, and Pearl, the same change in temperature requires a less than 2.8% increase in precipitation to keep the runoff unchanged. In the future, the runoff in most basins may decrease in different degrees. The decreasing velocity of the runoff is the fastest in the RCP8.5 scenario and the decreasing trend of the runoff slows down under the RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios. The proposed method can be applied to other basins to assess potential climate change effects on annual runoff. The results of the basins studies can inform planning of long-term basin water management strategies taking into account global change scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Three of these consist of finely crystalline ('amorphous') apatite that replaced digested organic matter and possibly muddy sediment, while a fourth is composed of bioclasts belonging to the prey animals of either palaeoscolecid dermal sclerites, bradoriid carapaces or lingulate brachiopod valves. Pellets occur in elongate clusters of up to about 100 ellipsoids. These clusters indicate that the producers' digestive systems were able to compress ingested material into individual pellets which were then expelled en masse without being shaped by muscle contractions in the latter portion of the intestine and anus. On the other hand, rod-like faeces with irregular annular grooves indicate a process of extrusion of digested material involving strong muscle contraction and compaction. Rods packed with sclerites and valves indicate that these hard parts are undigested organism fragments. Sinusoidal faeces point to ingestion of a great deal of material before extrusion, and possibly accompanied by movement of the anus-bearing posterior. The coiled morphotype suggests defecation of loosely compacted material from a long animal with a correspondingly long gut. Pellet clusters were produced by either a suspension feeder or a deposit feeder. Two or more types of invertebrates consumed organic matter and possibly lime mud, probably as deposit-feeders, while at least one other preyed upon worms, bradoriids and/or brachiopods. The different shapes and contents of these uniquely preserved coprolites confirm that the middle Cambrian benthic community exhibited a complex trophic structure involving a wide array of nutritional behaviours, including predator prey and scavenger relationships, possibly along with prey selectivity in the context of prey life cycles.

The chlorine doped GQDs (C1-GQDs) have been fabricated by chemical exfoliation of HCl treated carbon fibers (CFs), which were prepared from decreasing cotton through an annealing process at 1000 degrees C for 30 min, Raman study shows that both G and 2D peaks of GQDs may be redshifted (softened) by chlorine doping, leading to an n-type doping. The first vertical (C1)-GQDs based photovoltaic detectors have been demonstrated, both the light absorbing and electron-accepting roles for (C1)-GQDs in photodctection have been found, resulting in an exceptionally big ratio of photocurrent to dark current as high as similar to 10(5) at room temperature using a 405 nm laser irradiation under the reverse bias voltage. The study expands the application of (C1)-GQD5 to the important optoelectronic detection devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Four possible interconversion mechanisms, A, B, C and D, were put up. At B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level in gas phase, the optimized activation energies of TS1 and TS2 in mechanism A were all distinctively more than 120 kJ/mol. But as for mechanism D, the optimized activation energies of TS1 and TS2 were dramatically decreased. Further results showed that the solvation effects of water also reduced the activation energy. Meanwhile, the single point energy were calculated at MP2/6-311++G( 2d,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+G( d,p) level. Finally the activation energies of TS1 and TS2 in mechanism D were 106.24 and 107.37 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, mechanism D was the most possible pathway for the interconversion between compounds 1 and 2 at room temperature. This preferred mechanism pathway was a special water-catalyzed intramolecular oxoester alcoholysis, which also was a conventional nucleophilic addition, producing a novel tetrahedral alcoholic intermediate.

It is found that simple tri-layered yellow and white OLEDs can be achieved by co-depositing CuI and TCIQ with tuning ratios. The compound TCIQ serves a dual role as both a ligand for forming the emissive Cu(I) complex and as a host matrix for the formed emitter in yellow OLEDs, and a third role as a blue emitter in white OLEDs.

An analytical expression which describes the temperature distribution in the concentrator is deduced from the heat conduction equation and coordinate transformation relations. The expression is validated by numerical experiments based on COMSOL. Influence of the anisotropy due to cladding and device geometry on the performance of the thermal concentrator is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the greater the anisotropy, the better the thermal concentration effect. Besides, increasing the aspect ratio between the cladding and the core radius also gives rise to a better performance. Based on the temperature distribution relations between the core and the background region, we further explore a method to practically realize such a thermal concentrator by using naturally available materials. It is suggested that different levels of thermal concentration can be achieved by arranging alternately two isotropic conductivities along the azimuth direction and tuning their thermal localizations respectively.

J	Fu, YX				Fu, Yunxin			An Efficient Estimator of the Mutation Parameter and Analysis of Polymorphism from the 1000 Genomes Project	GENES			English	Article						mutation parameter; coalescent; allelic genealogy; 1000 Genomes Project	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; INFERENCE	The mutation parameter theta is fundamental and ubiquitous in the analysis of population samples of DNA sequences. This paper presents a new highly efficient estimator of theta by utilizing the phylogenetic information among distinct alleles in a sample of DNA sequences. The new estimator, called Allelic BLUE, is derived from a generalized linear model about the mutations in the allelic genealogy. This estimator is not only highly accurate, but also computational efficient, which makes it particularly useful for estimating theta for large samples, as well as for a large number of cases, such as the situation of analyzing sequence data from a large genome project, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. Simulation shows that Allelic BLUE is nearly unbiased, with variance nearly as small as the minimum achievable variance, and in many situations, it can be hundreds-or thousands-fold more efficient than a previous method, which was already quite efficient compared to other approaches. One useful feature of the new estimator is its applicability to collections of distinct alleles without detailed frequencies. The utility of the new estimator is demonstrated by analyzing the pattern of theta in the data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Preparation and photocatalytic activity of Nd doped ZnO nanoparticles	MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Nd doped; ZnO; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Cong red	VISIBLE-LIGHT IRRADIATION; FERRITE COMPOSITE NANOPARTICLES; RAY PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; BIOMATERIAL SYSTEM; MAGNETIC CORE; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; METHYL-ORANGE; AZO-DYE; DEGRADATION; DECOLORIZATION	As an important II-VI semiconductor, zinc oxide has attracted a great deal of attention as a photocatalytic material. The quick recombination of charge carriers is the main factor influencing the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. In order to improve the photocatalytic activity, different kinds of ions were doped into ZnO by different methods to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Nd doped ZnO study is mainly on the optical performances. However, the Nd-ZnO nanoparticles have reported little work on the photodegradation of organic contaminants under visible light irradiation. In this paper, the mainly research is focused on the preparation process and removal properties of organic pollutants Cong red from the wastewater using the Nd doped zinc oxide nanoparticles. The proposed research investigates the Nd doped zinc oxide nanoparticles with varied Nd content that are important in understanding the structure, morphology and the photocatalytic performances. The undoped and Nd doped zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared by sol-gel technique using zinc acetate dehydrate and dysprosium chloride and neodymium chloride as precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the morphology and microstructure of the nanoparticles. The analysed results indicate that the nanoparticles have a pure hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure with the good crystal quality and the Nd ion was in a 3+ charge state in the crystal lattice of ZnO. The performance of Nd doped ZnO powders as efficient photocatalyst was further demonstrated in the degradation of Cong red (CR) under visible light irradiation. The Nd doped ZnO nanoparticles show good photocatalytic activity during the degradation of CR under visible light. It was found that an appropriate amount of Nd dopant can greatly increase photocatalytic activity and the sample with 4% Nd doping exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency.	[Zhang, J.; Deng, S.

In the software design and development process, an effective evaluation of the trustworthiness of a software architecture can help making scientific and reasonable decisions on the architecture, which are necessary for the construction of highly trustworthy software. In consideration of lacking the trustworthiness evaluation and measurement studies for software architecture, this paper provides one trustworthy attribute model of software architecture. Based on this model, the paper proposes to use the Principle of Maximum Entropy (POME) and Grey Decision-making Method (GDMM) as the trustworthiness evaluation method of a software architecture and proves the scientificity and rationality of this method, as well as verifies the feasibility through case analysis.

Further, we propose the string theory of DNA and general biological string. Some solutions and functions of these theories may describe probably DNA, biological things and their motions.

GC/MS Analyses led to the identification of 68 components, representing more than 96% of the total oil. By focusing on the woody note fraction of the essential oil, one new bisabolane-type sesquiterpenoid, bisabola-2,7(14), 11-trien-10-ol (1), together with ten known compounds, bisabolol oxide B (2), ylangenol (3), copaborneol (4), guai-11-en-10-ol (5), spathulenol (6), aromadendran-10-ol (7), caryophyllenol (8), 5 alpha,7 alpha-eudesm-11(13)-en-4 alpha-ol (9), gamma-costic acid (10), and eudesma-4(15), 11(13)-diene- 12,5 beta-olide (11), were isolated by using olfactory-guided fractionation. The structures of the eleven compounds were determined by NMR and MS analyses. All the volatile compounds reported here were isolated for the first time from this plant. On the basis of preliminary odor assessment, the odor of the woody-note fractions of the essential oil was assumed to be due to these isolated sesquiterpenoids.

J	Jiang, R				Jiang, Rong			An Information-Entropy-based Risk Measurement Method of Software Development Project	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						risk measurement; software development project; information entropy; risk checklist; measurement method	MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS	Risk is the major reason for the failure of software development projects. The risk measurement can provide the decision-making data for the risk management and control. The traditional risk measurement method usually assesses in terms of the occurrence probability and the loss of the risk factors, which usually are assessed by experts subjectively. Therefore, they are greatly influenced by artificial factors. In this way, it is difficult to realize the objective and effective measurement. This paper proposes one risk measurement method of software development project based on information entropy, which makes up for the shortcomings of the former studies. This method makes use of information entropy to measure the amount of information so as to measure the software development project risk. In this paper, a new risk checklist is given. First of all, it obtains the risk information through the checklist. Then it obtains the information amount of risk factors by aid of information entropy. This paper concludes that the larger the information amount of the risk factors is, the larger the removed uncertainty is, the smaller the information entropy is and the smaller the risk is. In short, there is a positive correlation between risk and entropy. This paper demonstrates the scientificity and rationality of the method theoretically. Compared with other risk measurement methods, this method manifests certain advantage. The case analysis prove the rationality and feasibility of this method.

Yangzonghai Lake, a deep lake located in southwest China that was treated with flocculants after an accident resulted in As-contamination, was selected as a case study. We attempted to elucidate how As migrates and transforms in the lake based on water simulation experiments. The results were expected to facilitate evaluation of the suitability and safety of the technology when used in a natural water body. The results showed that the As that had already been precipitated into the sediment by FeCl3 would be released again into the water body due to the increasing activity of anaerobic microorganisms, thereby causing secondary pollution. This phenomenon was especially evident during summer because water temperature stratification reduced the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the sediment surface and led to anaerobic conditions, which enhanced the anaerobic activity at the bottom of the lake. In summer, the concentration of As in the water column increased with increasing depth. In contrast, during winter, the concentration of As was quite similar at all depths of the lake because the water temperature was uniform during this period. As was released from sediments to the aqueous phase in the form of trivalent As [As(III)] upon anaerobic incubation and was oxidized gradually into pentavalent As [As(V)], by the higher DO in the upper layers of the lake water. Contrary to expectation, the disturbance (turnover in the fall) did not increase, but rather decreased the As concentration in the lake, which might result in further coagulation and precipitation through intensive mixture of the unsaturated flocculants from the sediments.

This was obtained separately by Tetsuo Moriya in 2008 and Shyr and Yu in 1994. In this paper, we prove that if the length of p is divisible by the length of q and the length of p is less than or equal to m times the length of q, then p(n)q(m) is a primitive word for any n, m >= 1 and (n, m) not equal (1, 1). Then we show that if uv, u are non-primitive words and the length of u is divisible by the length v or one of the length of u and uv is odd for any two nonempty words u and v, then u is a power of v.

However, to date, its sister, the anti-Nenitzescu reaction and the corresponding synthetic methodology for 3a-hydroxy-indol-6-one derivatives, has remained an unexplored area. We discovered herein an environmentally benign, mild, and catalyst-free reaction in ethanol for the site-selective construction of rarely fused [1,2-a]indotone derivatives (3) from quinones (1) and heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) (2) via an unexpected anti-Nenitzescu strategy. This unconventional methodology suggests that it will be suitable for the site-selective synthesis of 3a-hydroxy-indol-6-one derivatives from a green perspective. On the other hand, the developed target compounds 3 have a promising future for the further synthesis of aromatic 6-hydroxyindoles or de-hydroxylated indol-6-ones in situ. In order to systematically elucidate the mechanistic details and controlling factors of the two Nenitzescu reactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed. According to the computational results, the origin of site-selectivity can be explained by the following reasons: all energy barriers for the anti-Nenitzescu reaction can be overcome at room temperature, yet the extremely high energy barrier of imine-enamine tautomerization for the Nenitzescu reaction indicates its failure under the same conditions. The reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis hinted that the greater thermodynamic stability of the Nenitzescu product 3h' mainly depends on the release of the strong steric effect.

In this paper we report results of petrologic, geochronological and geochemical investigations on the Huashiban granites from the Ailaoshan tectonic zone in western Yunnan (SW China). Zircon grains separated from the two samples (10HH-119A and 10HH-120A) yield the weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 229.9 +/- 2.0 Ma and 229.3 +/- 2.3 Ma, respectively, interpreted as the crystallization ages of the granites. Based on our results, in combination with the existing U-Pb geochronological data for the Ailaoshan metamorphic rocks, we propose that the Ailaoshan Group might be a rock complex composed of the Mesoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, Hercynian, Indosinian and Himalayan components, rather than a part of the crystalline basement of the Yangtze block. The zircon grains show highly depleted Lu-Hf isotope compositions, with positive E > (Hf)(t) values ranging from 8.4 to 13.1. The Huashiban granites have high SiO2 (72.66 wt%-73.70 wt%), low Mg-# (0.28-0.34) with A/CNK=1.01-1.05, and can be classified as peralumious high-K calc-alkaline I-type granites. A synthesis of these data indicates that the Ailaoshan tectonic zone had evolved into a post-collisional setting by the Late-Triassic (229 Ma). Genesis of the Huashiban high E > (Nd)(t)-E > (Hf)(t) granites involved into two processes: (1) underplating of the sub-arc mantle into the lower crust, and (2) remelting of the juvenile crustal materials in response to the upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle in the post-collisional setting.

Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of our results and our results also show that the continuous-time neural network and its discrete-time analogue have the same dynamical behaviors. The results of this paper are completely new even when the time scale T = R or Z and show that the delays in the leakage term do harm to the existence and global exponential stability of almost automorphic solutions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Eutrophic water body; Submerged macrophytes; Restoration pattern; Water quality; Sediment geochemistry	WATER-QUALITY; MACROPHYTE GROWTH; SEDIMENT; RESTORATION; VEGETATION	The research interest on the critical role of macrophytes in aquatic ecosystems has been mounting in recent years. Whereas the selection of plant species and restoration pattern still need further evaluations for better understanding of their relationship with aquatic ecosystem. In this study, two popular submerged macrophytes, Ceratophyllum demersum L. and Myriophyllum verticillatum L., were chosen and manipulated growing in mimic systems. Their individual and combined planting effects on water quality and sediment biogeochemistry were assessed, and their overall performance was ranked. The results showed that water quality was significantly improved, especially more than 70% reductions in turbidity and Chlorophyll a (Chl. a) concentration (P< 0.05). No significant effect of the macrophytes was detectable on total phosphorus (TP), organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), total nitrogen (TN) and organic matter (OM) contents in the sediments (13> 0.05). Overall, the differences among three experimental systems were slight; however, considering C. demersum having better potential in removing the nutrients from waters and other factors, such as the importance of species richness, their ranking performance is in the order of: combined plants (C. demersum and M. verticillatum) > C. demersum > M. verticillatum.

Ten phenolic compounds were isolated from this plant. They are gallic acid (1), caffeic acid methyl ester (2), guaiacylglycerol (3), 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-acrylic acid 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methoxy carbonyl ethyl ester (4), thero-guaiacylglycerol 8-O-beta-d-glycopyranoside (5), quercitrin (6), buein (7), (2R, 3S)-5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanonol (8), isoquercitrin (9) and 1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-hepta-4E, 6E-dien-3-one (10). In addition, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 possessed potent strong free radical scavenging activity. Compounds 1 and 10 with powerful activity showed the higher content, implying important roles of 1 and 10 for the antioxidant activity of Musa basjoo flower. The study suggested that components of Musa basjoo flower possessed good antioxidant capacities and the species could be used in the prevention of diseases related to oxidant by-products of human metabolism.

HJ14 was grouped in a separated cluster with another six Bacillus endoxylanases which have not been characterized. These Bacillus endoxylanases showed less than 52 % amino acid sequence identity with other endoxylanases and far distance with endoxylanases from most microorganisms. Signal peptide was not detected in the endoxylanase. The endoxylanase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the purified recombinant enzyme (rXynAHJ14) was characterized. rXynAHJ14 was apparent optimal at 62.5 A degrees C and pH 6.5 and retained more than 55 % of the maximum activity when assayed at 40-75 A degrees C, 23 % at 20 A degrees C, 16 % at 85 A degrees C, and even 8 % at 0 A degrees C. Half-lives of the enzyme were more than 60 min, approximately 25 and 4 min at 70, 75, and 80 A degrees C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited more than 62 % xylanase activity and stability at the concentration of 3-30 % (w/v) NaCl. No xylanase activity was lost after incubation of the purified rXynAHJ14 with trypsin and proteinase K at 37 A degrees C for 60 min. Different components of oligosaccharides were detected in the time-course hydrolysis of beechwood xylan by the enzyme. During the simulated intestinal digestion phase in vitro, 11.5-19.0, 15.3-19.0, 21.9-27.7, and 28.2-31.2 mu mol/mL reducing sugar were released by the purified rXynAHJ14 from soybean meal, wheat bran, beechwood xylan, and rapeseed meal, respectively. The endoxylanase might be an alternative for potential applications in the processing of sea food and saline food and in aquaculture as agastric fish feed additive.

The morphology and impact properties of these blends were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The presence of PBO particles dispersed in the PTFE continuous phase exhibited a coarse morphology. Increasing PBO contents in the blend improved the impact properties at weak deformation. It was found that the interfacial adhesion played an important role in the creation of an interphase that was formed by the interaction between the PTFE and the PBO. This induced an improvement in impact properties. In addition, the optimum impact properties were obtained when the content of PBO is 30 vol%.

The organism was found to grow at 4-30 A degrees C, pH 7.0-8.5 and in 0-8 % (w/v) NaCl, with optimal growth occurring at 28 A degrees C, pH 7.5 and in 1 % NaCl. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, strain 1111S-42(T) was found to belong to the genus Sporosarcina and to be most closely related to Sporosarcina contaminans CCUG53915(T) (97.3 %) and Sporosarcina soli I80(T) (97.2 %). The main polar lipids were found to include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0 (34.4 %), iso-C-15:0 (29.8 %) and anteiso-C-17:0 (22.4 %). The DNA G+C content of strain 1111S-42(T) was determined to be 39 mol %. The values of DNA-DNA relatedness between the strain 1111S-42(T) and related type strains of the genus Sporosarcina were less than 30 %. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, along with extensive physiological and chemotaxonomic testing, we conclude that the bacterium represents a novel species of the genus Sporosarcina, for which the name Sporosarcina siberiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 1111S-42(T) (=CGMCC 1.12516(T) = LMG 27494(T)).

In this approach, the MEMD algorithms, which include the bivariate empirical mode decomposition with a nonuniform sampling scheme for adaptive selection of projection directions (NS-BEMD) and the trivariate empirical mode decomposition with noise assistance (NA-TEMD), are directly employed to adaptively decompose the complex-valued quadrature composite signals echoed from both bidirectional blood flow and moving wall into a small number of zero-mean rotation components, which are defined as complex intrinsic mode functions (CIMFs). Then the relevant CIMFs contributed to blood flow components are automatically distinguished in terms of the break of the CIMFs' power, and then directly added up to give the quadrature blood flow signal. Specific simulation and human subject experiments are taken up to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of this novel method for quadrature clutter rejection in bidirectional Doppler ultrasound signals. Due to eliminating the extra errors induced by the Hilbert transform or complex FIR filter algorithms used in the traditional clutter rejection approaches based on the directional separation process, the proposed method provides improved accuracy for clutter rejection, and preserve more slow blood blow components, which could be helpful to early diagnose arterial diseases.

The results showed the area fluctuation of main vegetation types in the study area during the research period. There was no great change in the total area of main vegetation, with the fluctuation area ranging from 12,579.84 to 14,698.75 km(2), averaging 13,664.48 km(2) annually, and with the fluctuation ratio between -7.94% and 7.57%. The area of natural vegetation (tropical rainforest, tropical seasonal moist forest, tropical seasonal rainforest, and tropical mountainous evergreen broad-leaved forests) increased at first and gradually decreased afterwards, and the ratio of its distribution area to the total area of main vegetation was featured with an annual decrease, especially in 2005 and 2010. Both the distribution area and ratio of artificial vegetation (Rubber plantation) to the total area of main vegetation were characterized with the tendency of a gradual increase, especially in 2005 and 2010. Thus, the establishment of artificial vegetation (Rubber plantation) not only led to the decrease in natural vegetation (3641.16 km(2)) but also covered 343.66 km(2) of lands for other uses. The results also showed the distribution succession of main vegetation types in the study area during the research period. In the later research period (after 1999), compared with the early research period (before 1999), the distribution range of natural vegetation was characterized with a certain decrease in the following aspects as at different altitudes (<600m, 600-800m, 800-1000 m, 1000-1200m, 1200-1400m, and >1400m), and on different slopes (0-5 degrees, 5-8 degrees, 8-15 degrees, 15-25 degrees, 25-35 degrees, and >35 degrees). By contrast, the artificial vegetation was just the opposite whose distribution range was characterized with a tendency of a rapid growth at different altitudes, and on different slopes. It indicated that the establishment of artificial vegetation had broken the original ecological pattern in Xishuangbanna, which would bring direct threats to the regional ecological security and environment healthy development, thus countermeasures were urgent to be taken in order to prevent it from worsening.

Good growth was observed at 50-55 degrees C and pH 7.0. Aerial mycelium was absent on all media tested. Substrate mycelium was well-developed, long and moderately flexuous, and formed abundant, single, warty, ornamented endospores. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two strains indicated that they belong to the family Thermoactinomycetaceae. Similarity levels between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two strains and those of type strains of members of the Thermoactinomycetaceae were 88.33-93.24 %; the highest sequence similarity was with Hazenella coriacea DSM 45707(T). In both strains, the predominant menaquinone was MK-7, the diagnostic diamino acid was mesodiaminopimelic acid and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-14:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, unidentified polar lipids and unidentified phospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 77562(T) and YIM 77580 were 45.5 and 44.2 mol%, respectively. DNA-DNA relatedness data suggest that the two isolates represent a single species. Based on phylogenetic analyses and physiological and biochemical characteristics, it is proposed that the two strains represent a single novel species in a new genus, Geothermomicrobium terrae gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Geothermomicrobium terrae is YIM 77562(T) (=CCTCC AA 2011022(T)=JCM 18057(T)).

We studied the floral development of Cardiopteris to clarify floral morphology and document floral development. Cardiopteris has three carpel primordia, which are separate at their tips but congenitally fused at their bases. The synascidiate zone (the fused proximal part) develops into the unilocular ovary; the three discrete carpel apices diverge in development: the apex of the adaxial carpel differentiates into a style and stigma, while the apices of the two lateral-abaxial carpels elongate and develop into a fleshy appendage only after fertilization. The ovules are attached to the lateral-abaxial carpels. At anthesis, the ovules are ategmic and orthotropous without funicles (morphologically undifferentiated). Functional differentiation occurs in the three carpels of Cardiopteris: the adaxial one is the site of pollination, while the lateral-abaxial two produce ovules. The ategmic orthotropous ovule is unusual in Cardiopteridaceae and is an apomorphy of Cardiopteris.

At high altitude, lower temperature and hypoxia are two important factors influencing survival. Mitochondria, as the ultimate oxygen transductor, play an important role in aerobic respiration through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of six high-altitude phasianidae birds and sixteen low-altitude relatives in an attempt to determine the role of mitochondrial genes in high-altitude adaptation. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of these phasianidae birds and relatives and found at least four lineages that independently occupied this high-altitude habitat. Selective analyses revealed significant evidence for positive selection in the genes ND2, ND4, and ATP6 in three of the high-altitude lineages. This result strongly suggests that adaptive evolution of mitochondrial genes played a critical role during the independent acclimatization to high altitude by galliform birds.

Numerical experimental studies were performed to justify the correctness and effectiveness of this new global parameter. The results indicate that the measured displacement error was related to the mean intensity of the second derivative of the speckle patterns when they had equal mean intensity gradients. The results also indicate that the measurement accuracy was affected by both the mean intensity gradient and the mean intensity of the second derivative. Therefore, high quality speckle patterns should have a large mean intensity gradient and a small mean intensity of the second derivative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Radon contribution to single particle counts of the ARGO-YBJ detector	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Low energy cosmic instrumentation; Extensive air shower; Radon; Natural radioactivity	RESISTIVE PLATE CHAMBER; MODEL	The ARGO-YBJ experiment is an air shower detector for gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray studies with an energy threshold of similar to 500 GeV. Working in "single particle mode", i.e. counting the single particles hitting the detector at fixed time intervals, ARGO-YBJ can monitor cosmic ray and gamma ray transients at energies of a few GeV. The single particle counting rate is modulated by the atmospheric pressure and temperature, and is affected by the local radioactivity from soil and air. Among the radioactive elements, radon gas is of particular importance since its concentration in air can vary significantly, according to environmental conditions. In this paper we evaluate the contribution of the radon daughter gamma ray emitters to the single particle counting rate measured by ARGO-YBJ. According to our analysis, the radon gas contribution is roughly 1-2%, producing a counting rate modulation of the same order of magnitude of the atmospheric effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sarcosysts of a new species, Sarcocystis eothenomysi n. sp., were found in 14 out of 56 E. miletus (25%); they possessed a striated cyst wall, c.1-2 mu m thick. Under transmission electron microscopy the cysts of S. eothenomysi exhibited numerous small, irregular protrusions, which may appear T-shaped in some sections. A phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA gene sequences indicated that S. eothenomysi shares closest affinity with those species of Sarcocystis Lankester, 1982, which use cobra or viperid snakes as definitive hosts. We therefore, hypothesise that a venomous snake may serve as the definitive host for S. eothenomysi. This is the first species of Sarcocystis reported from Eothenomys spp.	[Hu, Jun-Jie; Liu, Qiong; Yang, Yan-Fen] Yunnan Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Esch, Gerald W.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA; [Guo, Yan-Mei] Kunming Med Univ, Haiyuan Coll, Kunming 650101, Peoples R China; [Zou, Feng-Cai] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China	Hu, JJ (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.	jjhu@ynu.edu.cn			Natural Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30770257]; Foundation for Science of School of Life Sciences Yunnan University [2013S206]	This study was funded by the Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Grant 30770257) and the Foundation for Science of School of Life Sciences Yunnan University (Grant 2013S206).		33	3	3	0	6	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0165-5752	1573-5192		SYST PARASITOL	Syst.

A common assumption for joint models is that random effects are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as multivariate normal distribution. The fully parametric distribution assumption of random effects is relaxed by specifying a centered Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (CDPMM) for a general distribution of random effects because of some good properties of CDPMM such as inducing zero mean and continuous probability distribution of random effects. A computationally feasible Bayesian case-deletion diagnostic based on the phi-divergence is proposed to identify the potential influential cases in the joint models. Several simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate our proposed methodologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A study in Lake Erhai	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Paleolimnology; Nutrient levels; Fish introduction; Cladoceran microfossil	ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY; BOSMINA-LONGIROSTRIS; PHYTOPLANKTON INTERACTIONS; PLANKTIVOROUS FISH; BRACKISH LAKES; FOSSIL RECORD; TOP-DOWN; SHALLOW; ASSEMBLAGES; CRUSTACEA	Environmental controls on cladoceran community structure in lake ecosystems are complex and may involve many environmental parameters including trophic state and fish populations. In Lake Erhai, a plateau lake located in southwest China, it was hypothesized that a combination of lake eutrophication and planktivorous fish introduction would increase the abundance of cladoceran, while also decreasing cladoceran size. To test this hypothesis, we examined temporal changes in cladoceran microfossils in the sediments of Lake Erhai over the past century. The influence of changing macrophyte coverage within the littoral region of the lake was also considered. Results demonstrated that cladoceran abundance (measured as flux of cladoceran fossils in the sediments) increased markedly accompanying eutrophication of the lake. In addition, there was a shift in the dominant cladoceran species from those species that prefer oligotrophic conditions to those that prefer mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions. A reduction in the ephippium length of Daphnia spp. was observed and attributed to the introduction of the planktivorous fish Neosalanx taihuensis. Our findings indicated that eutrophication and fish introduction were the main controls affecting cladoceran community structure during the recent decades, and predation by planktivorous fish had an important impact on Daphnia body size.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that autophagy plays a protective role against infectious diseases by diminishing intracellular pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, the mechanism by which autophagy regulates innate immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that autophagy is involved in host defense against a pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans. P. aeruginosa infection induces autophagy via a conserved extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Intriguingly, impairment of autophagy does not influence the intestinal accumulation of P. aeruginosa, but instead induces intestinal necrosis. Inhibition of necrosis results in the survival of autophagy-deficient worms after P. aeruginosa infection. These findings reveal a previously unidentified role for autophagy in protection against necrosis triggered by pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans and implicate that such a function of autophagy may be conserved through the inflammatory response in diverse organisms.

Coupling g-C3N4 with other materials has been demonstrated to be an effective way to facilitate the separation and transport of charge carriers. Herein we report a composite of conductive carbon black and carbon nitride intercalation compound synthesized through facile one-step molten salt method. The as-prepared carbon black/carbon nitride intercalation compound composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption spectrum and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The carbon black nanoparticles, homogeneously dispersed on the surface of carbon nitride intercalation compound, efficiently enhanced separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, thus improving the visible-light photocatalytic activity. The composite of 0.5 wt% carbon black and carbon nitride intercalation compound exhibited a H-2 production rate of 68.9 mu mol h(-1), which is about 3.2 times higher than hydrogen production on pristine carbon nitride intercalation compound.

The observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array with a spatial resolution of similar to 1.'' 5 and sensitivity of about 0.07 K and similar to 0.18 K for continuum and line, respectively. The observational results showed that the gas in the Orion KL region consists of jet-propelled cores at the ridge and dense cores east and south of the region that are shaped like a wedge ring. The outflow has multiple lobes, which may originate from an explosive ejection, and is not driven by young stellar objects. Four infrared bubbles were found in the Spitzer/IRAC emissions. These bubbles, the distributions of the previously found H-2 jets, the young stellar objects, and molecular gas suggest that BN is the explosive center. The burst time was estimated to be similar to 1300 yr. At the same time, signatures of gravitational collapse toward Source I and the hot core were detected with material infall velocities of 1.5 km s(-1) and similar to 0.6 km s(-1), corresponding to mass accretion rates of 1.2 x 10-3M(circle dot)/yr and 8.0 x 10-5M(circle dot)/yr, respectively. These observations may support the belief that high-mass stars form via the accretion model, similar to their low-mass counterparts.

For concreteness, the pressure is taken as a modified Chaplygin gas pressure. Firstly, the Riemann problem for the Aw-Rascle model with the modified Chaplygin gas pressure is solved constructively. Secondly, it is shown that as the pressure tends to the Chaplygin gas pressure, some Riemann solutions containing a shock and a contact discontinuity tend to a delta-shock solution, whose propagation speed and strength are different from those of deltashock solution to the Aw-Rascle model with a Chaplygin gas pressure. Besides, it is also proven that the rest Riemann solutions converge to a two-contact-discontinuity solution, which is exactly the solution to the Aw-Rascle model with a Chaplygin gas pressure. Thirdly, some numerical results are presented to exhibit the process of formation of delta-shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Absorption of surface acoustic waves by topological insulator thin films	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-GAS; HGTE QUANTUM-WELLS; CHANNEL; PHASE	We present a theoretical study on the absorption of the surface acoustic waves (SAWs) by Dirac electrons in topological insulator (TI) thin films (TITFs). We find that due to momentum and energy conservation laws, the absorption of the SAWs in TITFs can only be achieved via intraband electronic transitions. The strong absorption can be observed up to sub-terahertz frequencies. With increasing temperature, the absorption intensity increases significantly and the cut-off frequency is blue-shifted. More interestingly, we find that the absorption of the SAWs by the TITFs can be markedly enhanced by the tunable subgap in the Dirac energy spectrum of the TI surface states. Such a subgap is absent in conventional two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) and in the gapless Dirac 2DEG such as graphene. This study is pertinent to the exploration of the acoustic properties of TIs and to potential application of TIs as tunable SAW devices working at hypersonic frequencies. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

It is difficult to explain why the public good is produced by strong individuals in some cooperation systems, and by weak individuals in others. Viewing the asymmetric volunteer's dilemma game as an evolutionary game, we find that whether the strong or the weak players produce the public good depends on the initial condition (i.e., phenotype or initial strategy of individuals). These different evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) associated with different initial conditions, can be interpreted as the production modes of public goods of different cooperation systems. A further analysis revealed that the strong player adopts a pure strategy but mixed strategies for the weak players to produce the public good, and that the probability of volunteering by weak players decreases with increasing group size or decreasing cost-benefit ratio. Our model shows that the defection probability of a "strong'' player is greater than the "weak'' players in the model of Diekmann (1993). This contradicts Selten's (1980) model that public goods can only be produced by a strong player, is not an evolutionarily stable strategy, and will therefore disappear over evolutionary time. Our public good model with ESS has thus extended previous interpretations that the public good can only be produced by strong players in an asymmetric game.

Two kinds of the EEDs formed in different acceleration and cooling processes are assumed: a power law with an exponential cut-off (PLC) EED and a log-parabolic (LP) EED. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the model parameters in our fits. The results show that the LP model fits the spectral energy distributions better in both steady and flare states than PLC model, and the changes of model parameters from steady state to flare state can be explained reasonably. Therefore, it is concluded that the EEDs and the acceleration mechanisms in both steady and flare states would be the same for Mrk 501. Compared to Mrk 421 having different EEDs in different states, our analysis indicates that both acceleration and cooling processes are different in the jets of these two sources.

By adjusting the tilt angle of the uncoated glass plate inserted in the laser cavity, we can control the cavity losses of two polarized directions. The output wavelengths are 1339 nm in alpha-axis polarization and 1341 nm in c-axis polarization, respectively, which are orthogonal to each other. At an incident pump power of 17.3 W, the cw output power obtained at 1339 and 1341 nm is 1.6 and 2.3 W, respectively. Furthermore, intracavity sum-frequency mixing at 1339 and 1341 nm was then realized in a KTiOPO4 (KTP) crystal to reach the red range. To our knowledge, this is the first work realizing an orthogonally polarized dual-wavelength Nd: YAP laser based on the F-4(3/2)-I-4(13/2) transition. Such a dual-wavelength laser would be especially valuable as a compact laser source to generate terahertz emission because the frequency difference between 1339 and 1341 nm is about 0.9 THz.

The etching process induced an apparent absorption peak shift of silver triangular nanoplates from 580 to 530nm. The shift degree of the absorption peak has a good linear relationship with the amount of Hg2+ added; thus, Hg2+ with a concentration from 0.2 to 1.5 mu M can be quantitatively detected by measuring silver triangular absorption. The interaction between mercury and silver triangular nanoplates proposed here is also a new example of silver triangular nanoplate etching and important for explaining the etching mechanism.

The homology models of gp120 comprising the N- and C-termini and loops V3 and V4 in the CD4-bound and CD4-unbound states were built and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the differences in dynamic properties and molecular motions between them. The results indicate that the CD4-bound gp120 adopted a more compact and stable conformation than the unbound form during simulations. For both the unbound and bound gp120, the large concerted motions derived from essential dynamics (ED) analyses can influence the size/shape of the ligand-binding channel/cavity of gp120 and, therefore, were related to its functional properties. The differences in motion direction between certain structural components of these two forms of gp120 were related to the conformational interconversion between them. The free energy calculations based on the metadynamics simulations reveal a more rugged and complex free energy landscape (FEL) for the unbound than for the bound gp120, implying that gp120 has a richer conformational diversity in the unbound form. The estimated free energy difference of similar to-6.0 kJ/mol between the global minimum free energy states of the unbound and bound gp120 indicates that gp120 can transform spontaneously from the unbound to bound states, revealing that the bound state represents a high-probability "ground state" for gp120 and explaining why the unbound state resists crystallization. Our results provide insight into the dynamics-and-function relationship of gp120, and facilitate understandings of the thermodynamics, kinetics and conformational control mechanism of HIV-1 gp120.

Distribution modeling can predict the effects of climate changes and potentially their effects on genetic diversity. DNA barcoding quickly identifies patterns of genetic diversity. As a case study, we use DNA barcodes and distribution models to predict threats under climate changes in the frog Nanorana parkeri, which is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Barcoding identifies major lineages W and E. Lineage W has a single origin in a refugium and Lineage E derives from three refugia. All refugia locate in river valleys and each greatly contributes to the current level of intraspecific genetic diversity. Species distribution models suggest that global climate changes will greatly influence N. parkeri, especially in the level of genetic diversity, because two former refugia will fail to provide suitable habitat. Our pipeline provides a novel application of DNA barcoding and has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity in southern areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

It is more prevalent in males. To assess the possible Y chromosomal contribution to severe acne risk in Han Chinese males, we analyzed 2041 Y chromosomal SNPs (Y-SNPs) in 725 severe acne cases and 651 controls retrieved from our recent genome-wide association study data. After data filtering, we assigned 585 cases and 494 controls into 12 Y chromosomal haplogroups based on 307 high-confidence Y-SNPs. No statistically significant difference in the distribution of Y chromosomal haplogroup frequencies was observed between the case and control groups. Our results showed a lack of association between the incidence of severe acne and the different Y chromosomal haplogroup in the Han Chinese population.

For a diallelic marker locus in human, the parental-asymmetry tests Q-PAT(c) with any constant c were developed to detect parent-of-origin effects for quantitative traits. However, these methods can only be applied to deal with nuclear families and thus are not suitable for extended pedigrees. In this study, by making no assumption about the distribution of the quantitative trait, we first propose the pedigree parental-asymmetry tests Q-PPAT(c) with any constant c for quantitative traits to test for parent-of-origin effects based on nuclear families with complete information from general pedigree data, in the presence of association between marker alleles under study and quantitative traits. When there are any genotypes missing in pedigrees, we utilize Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and estimation and develop the Q-MCPPAT(c) statistics to test for parent-of-origin effects. Various simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods, for different sample sizes, genotype missing rates, degrees of imprinting effects and population models. Simulation results show that the proposed methods control the size well under the null hypothesis of no parent-of-origin effects and Q-PPAT(c) are robust to population stratification. In addition, the power comparison demonstrates that Q-PPAT(c) and Q-MCPPAT(c) for pedigree data are much more powerful than Q-PAT(c) only using two-generation nuclear families selected from extended pedigrees.

Phylogenetic analysis comparisons based on 16S rRNA gene sequences between strain MO-1009(T) and other members of the genus Rhodococcus revealed that strain NI0-1009(T) had the closest sequence similarity to Rhodococcus kroppenstedtii DSM 44908(T) and Rhodococcus corynebacterioides DSM 20151(T) with 99.2 and 99.1%, respectively. Furthermore, DNA-DNA hybridization results showed that R. kroppenstedtii DSM 44908(T) and R. corynebacterioides DSM 20151(T) were 39.5 (3.0%) and 41.7 (2.0%) with strain NIO-1009(T), respectively, which were well below the 70% limit for any novel species proposal. Phylogenetically strain NIO-1009(T) forms a stable clade with and R. kroppenstedtii DSM 44908(T) and R. corynebacterioides DSM 201511 with 100% bootstrap values. Strain NI-1009(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and galactose and arabinose as the cell wall sugars. The major fatty acids were C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c, C-16:1(omega 6C and/or omega 7c) and 10-methyl C-18:0. The only menaquinone detected was MK-8(H-2), while the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and one unknown phospholipid. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 66.9 molok. The phenotypic and genotypic data showed that strain NIO-1009(T) warrants recognition as a novel species of the genus Rhodococcus for which the name Rhodococcus enclensis sp. nov., is proposed; the type strain is NIO-1009(T) (=NCIM 5452(T)=DSM 45688(T)).

This Gram-staining-positive, aerobic actinobacterium did not produce substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae, and no diffusible pigments were produced on the media tested. The optimum growth occurred at 30 degrees C, 1 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 8.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolate belongs to the genus Nocardioides, with low levels (<= 96.2%) of sequence similarity with respect to Nocardioides kribbensis KSL-2(T) and other members of the genus Nocardioides. Whole-organism hydrolysates of the strain contained LL-2,6-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-4), with MK-8 in a minor amount. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, hydroxphosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, were the main polar lipids detected, while iso-C-16:0 and C-18:1 omega 9c were the major fatty acids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.5 mol%. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the isolate represents a member of the genus Nocardioides, and the name Nocardioides nanhaiensis sp. nov.

The isolate grew with 10-35% multi-salts, and did not grow without NaCl or MgCl2. The isolate formed a white aerial mycelium, and long chains of arthrospores with more than 10 spores per chain. The spores were spherical or oval with warty surfaces, and sterile mycelium was present between individual spores. The isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and a small proportion of LL-diaminopimelic acid as cell-wall diamino acids, and galactose and arabinose as whole-cell sugars. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and three unknown phospholipids. Major fatty acids were iso-C-(16:0), iso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The DNA G+C content of strain AFM 10251(T) was 66.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AFM 10251(T) and the genus Actinopolyspora formed a distinct lineage. Analysis of the secondary structures of variable areas of the 16S rRNA gene showed that strain AFM 10251(T) was different from all recognized species of the genus Actinopolyspora and members of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. Analysis of the signature nucleotides of the 16S rRNA gene showed that strain AFM 10251(T) and Actinopolyspora halophila formed a single group, but with base pair differences at positions 127 : 234 and 183:194. On the basis of analysis of chemical and molecular characteristics, strain AFM 10251(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Actinopolysporaceae, for which the name Halopolyspora alba gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Halopolyspora alba is AFM 10251(T) (=DSM 45976(T)=CGMCC 4.7114(T)).

The slowly growing, Gram-stain-positive, aerobic strain produced branched substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae, and no diffusible pigment was produced on the media tested. At maturity, spore chains were formed on aerial hyphae and substrate mycelium was not fragmented. Whole-cell hydrolysates of the strain contained meso-diaminopinnelic acid and galactose, glucose, ribose and rhamnose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-4) and MK-10(H-2). The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and ninhydrin-positive phosphoglycolipids. The major fatty acid was iso-C-16:0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.2 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain was shown to be most closely related to species of the genus Actinophytocola. DNA DNA hybridization relatedness values (<70%) of the isolate with its closest neighbour Actinophytocola xinjiangensis QAIII60(T) supported classification of the isolate as a representative of a novel species. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, and phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the new isolate belongs to a novel species of the genus Actinophytocola, for which the name Actinophytocola sediminis sp. nov.

According to the morphology and phonon vibration information obtained by AFM and Raman spectroscopy, the formation and evolution mechanism are studied in detail. Experimental results indicate that the amorphous Ge films have been converted to Ge dots with a density of 8.5 x 10(9) cm(-2) after 675 degrees C annealing for 30 min. By using Ostwald ripening theory, surface diffusion model, and calculation of the activation energy, the surface transfer and the dot formation behavior of Ge atoms can be well interpreted. Based on the fabrication technique of Ge/Si nanodots at a high deposition rate combined with the thermal annealing, we have provided a theoretical support for the experiment on self-assembled growth of Ge quantum dots.

Mutations in the lineage of cells leading to the sperm or eggs are of particular importance because many such mutations may be shared by somatic tissues and also may be inherited, thus having a lasting consequence. For decades, little has been known about the pattern of the mutation rates along the germline development. Recently it was shown from a small portion of data that resulted from a large-scale mutation screening experiment that the rates of recessive lethal or nearly lethal mutations differ dramatically during the germline development of Drosophila melanogaster males. In this paper the full data set from the experiment and its analysis are reported by taking advantage of a recent methodologic advance. By analyzing the mutation patterns with different levels of recessive lethality, earlier published conclusions based on partial data are found to remain valid. Furthermore, it is found that for most nearly lethal mutations, the mutation rate at the first cell division is even greater than previous thought compared with those at other divisions. There is also some evidence that the mutation rate at the second division decreases rapidly but is still appreciably greater than those for the rest of the cleavage stage. The mutation rate at spermatogenesis is greater than late cleavage and stem-cell stages, but there is no evidence that rates are different among the five cell divisions of the spermatogenesis. We also found that a modestly biased sampling, leading to slightly more primordial germ cells after the eighth division than those reported in the literature, provides the best fit to the data. These findings provide conceptual and numerical basis for exploring the consequences of differential mutation rates during individual development.

In this study, the corrosion behavior of titanium in artificial saliva with and without lactic acid were investigated by open-circuit potentials (OCPs), polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). OCP firstly increased with the amount of lactic acid from 0 to 3.2 g/L and then tended to decrease from 3.2 to 5.0 g/L. The corrosion of titanium was distinctly affected by lactic acid, and the corrosion rate increased with increasing the amount of lactic acid. At each concentration of lactic acid, the corrosion rate clearly increased with increasing the immersing time. Results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also indicated that lactic acid accelerated the pitting corrosion in artificial saliva. A probable mechanism was also proposed to explain the experimental results.

The historical optical data during different periods have been collected and compiled. Light curves spanning 35 yr have been constructed. The R-band light curve has been analyzed by means of three methods: the epoch folding method, the Jurkevich method and the discrete correlation function method. It is derived that there is an evident periodic component of 317 d (i.e. 0.87 yr) superposed on a long-term trend with large-amplitude variation in the light curve. The variability of this source is accompanied by a slight color variation, and the brightness and color index are correlated with each other. On a long-term time scale, PKS 2155-304 exhibits a tendency of bluer-when-brighter, which means the spectrum becomes flatter when the source brightens.

Biometrika. 1974; 61: 439-447] broadened the application scope of generalized linear models (GLM) by specifying the mean and variance function instead of the entire distribution. However, in many situations, complete specification of variance function in the quasi-likelihood approach may not be realistic. Following Fahrmeir's [Maximum likelihood estimation in misspecified generalized linear models. Statistics. 1990; 21: 487-502] treating with misspecified GLM, we define a quasi-likelihood nonlinear models (QLNM) with misspecified variance function by replacing the unknown variance function with a known function. In this paper, we propose some mild regularity conditions, under which the existence and the asymptotic normality of the maximum quasi-likelihood estimator (MQLE) are obtained in QLNM with misspecified variance function. We suggest computing MQLE of unknown parameter in QLNM with misspecified variance function by the Gauss-Newton iteration procedure and show it to work well in a simulation study.

The tribological changes were evaluated by friction and wear tests as well as scanning electron microscopic analysis of the worn surfaces. It was found that the irradiation induced the degradation of UHMWPE molecular chains and the interfacial cross-linking was formed. The addition of HDPE significantly increased the wear resistance of UHMWPE composites. Friction and wear tests indicated that HDPE improved the tribological properties of the materials before and after irradiation. HDPE and irradiation exhibited a good synergistic effect for improving the wear resistant and tribological properties of UHMWPE material.

Lung cancer in this area is called Gejiu squamous cell lung carcinoma (GSQCLC). Research has demonstrated that overexpression of miR-21 occurs in many cancers. However, the unique relationship between miR-21 and its target genes in GSQCLC has never been investigated. The molecular mechanism involved in GSQCLC must be compared to other non-small cell lung cancers in order to establish a relation and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the current study, we initially found overexpression of miR-21 occurring in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines when compared to the immortalized lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. We also demonstrated that high expression of miR-21 could increase tumor cell proliferation, invasion, viability, and migration in GSQCLC cell line (YTMLC-90) and NSCLC cell line (NCI-H157). Additionally, our results revealed that miR-21 could suppress YTMLC-90 and NCI-H157 cell apoptosis through arresting cell-cycle at G(2)/M phase. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PTEN, RECK and Bcl-2 are common target genes of miR-21 in NSCLC. Finally, our studies showed that down-regulation of miR-21 could lead to a significant increase in PTEN and RECK and decrease in Bcl-2 at the mRNA and protein level in YTMLC-90 and NCI-H157 cell lines. However, we have not observed any remarkable difference in the levels of miR-21 and its targets in YTMLC-90 cells when compared with NCI-H157 cells. Conclusions/Significance: miR-21 simultaneously regulates multiple programs that enhance cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumor invasiveness by targeting PTEN, RECK and Bcl-2 in GSQCLC. Our results demonstrated that miR-21 may play a vital role in tumorigenesis and progression of lung squamous cell carcinoma and suppression of miR-21 may be a novel approach for the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma.

However, coeval ovules have been scarce in other regions of the world. Specimens of the seed plant Cosmosperma polyloba gen. et sp. nov. Wang et al. were recently obtained from the Upper Devonian (Famennian) Wutong Formation, at Fanwan Village, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, China. This new seed plant has cupulate ovules, the uniovulate cupules with up to 16 distal segments and with minute spines on the outer surface, synangiate pollen organs bearing six to eight microsporangia fused only at the base, and planate and highly dissected pinnules in alternate arrangement. It differs from other Devonian seed plants mainly in the organization and position of the uniovulate and ornamented cupule, and in the highly dissected pinnules. Cosmosperma Wang et al. represents the first Devonian ovules recovered from China or eastern Asia and further illustrates the diversity of early spermatophytes. As for the Late Devonian seed plants, it is suggested that the pollen organs are synangiate and simple in organization, and the branches and leaves are generally planate.

Several species of the zebra sole have been recorded from the coastal waters of China. Morphological analysis of 1 107 specimens of the zebra sole from 15 successive localities along the China's coast demonstrated that no significant variations among these localities were found on the basis of meristic counts and morphometric characters. Phylogenetic analysis based on COI gene sequences of 14 individuals and D-loop of 22 individuals from eight localities showed that they were indistinguishable among these localities. Therefore, both morphological and molecular evidence supported the occurrence of a single species of the zebra sole along the China's coast. The available name for this species is Zebrias zebrinus (Temminck and Schlegel, 1846) instead of Z. zebra (Bloch, 1787). Zebrias fasciatus (Basilewsky, 1855) and Solea ommatura (Richardson, 1846) are considered here as two synonyms of Z. zebrinus.

The taxonomic position of strain YIM 78087(T) was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 78087(T) belongs to the genus Streptomyces and is closely related to Streptomyces fimbriatus DSM 40942(T), Streptomyces marinus DSM 41968(T) and Streptomyces qinglanensis DSM 42035(T) (97.18, 97.05 and 97.1 % similarity, respectively). Combined with the low values of DNA-DNA hybridization between strain YIM 78087(T) and its closest neighbours, these analyses indicated that this new isolate represents a different genomic species in the genus Streptomyces. The predominant menaquinones of strain YIM 78087(T) were identified as MK-9 (H-4) and MK-9 (H-6). The major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C-15:0 (28.4 %), anteiso-C-17:0 (23.0 %) and iso-C-16:0 (15.1 %). The whole-cell hydrolysates found to contain glucose, mannose and ribose. The DNA G+C content was determined to be 73.0 mol%. Based on the comparative analysis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strain YIM 78087(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces calidiresistens sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78087(T) (=BCRC 16955(T)=DSM 42108(T)=JCM 19629(T)).

NOV.; BACTERIUM; FAMILY; HALOTOLERANT; MEMBER; ACID	Two Gram-stain negative, moderately halophilic, aerobic, motile bacteria, designated strains YIM QH88(T) and YIM QH103, were isolated from the Qiaohou salt mine in Yunnan, southwest China. Cells of the strains were observed to be rod-shaped and produce creamy-coloured colonies. Growth of the two strains was observed at 10-45 A degrees C (optimum 25-37 A degrees C), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum 7.0-8.0), and in the presence of 0.5-20 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2-6 %). The two strains were found to contain summed feature 8 (C18:1 omega 7c/omega 6c), C19:0 cyclo omega 8c and C16:0 as the major cellular fatty acids. The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and unknown phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strains YIM QH88(T) and YIM QH103 were determined to be 64.6 and 64.2 mol%, respectively, and the predominant respiratory quinone detected was ubiquinone 9. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strains YIM QH88(T) and YIM QH103 formed a distinct lineage within the genus Halomonas and were most closely related to Halomonas pantelleriensis DSM 9661(T) with 97.3 and 97.5 % of 16S rRNA sequence similarity respectively. The DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness value for strains YIM QH88(T) and YIM QH103 was 95.2 +/- A 0.8 %. The levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between each of these two strains and the type strains of phylogenetically closely related Halomonas species were clearly below 70 %. On the basis of their phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strains YIM QH88(T) and YIM QH103 should be classified as a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas qiaohouensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM QH88(T) (=DSM 26770(T) =CCTCC AB 2012965(T)).

Isolation was aided by using a resuscitation-promoting factor, suggesting the strain was recovered from a viable but non-culturable state. Strain ZYR 51(T) was characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Growth was found to occur at 10-45 A degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and 0-9 % NaCl (w/v). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that strain ZYR 51(T) belongs to the genus Gordonia and showed low level similarities (below 97 %) with all other members of this genus. The strain was found to possess meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP), along with MK-9(H-2) as the predominant menaquonine. Mycolic acids were found to be present. C-16:0 (34.9 %), 10-methyl C-18:0 (30.3 %), iso-C-18:0(8.2 %), and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c as define by MIDI; 18.8 %) were identified as the major cellular fatty acids. The polar lipid profile of strain ZYR 51(T) was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and some unknown lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ZYR 51(T) was determined to be 67.7 mol%. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia jinhuaensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain is ZYR 51(T) (=CGMCC 1.12827(T) = NBRL B-59111(T) = NBRC 110001(T)).

Herein, we introduce a pipeline to retrieve Y-SNP data. We introduce the software YTool (http://mitotool.org/ytool/) to handle conversion, filtering, and annotation of the data. Genome-wide SNP data from populations in Myanmar are used to construct a haplogroup tree for 117 Y chromosomes based on 369 high-confidence Y-SNPs. Parallel genotyping and published resequencing data of Y chromosomes confirm the validity of our pipeline. We apply this strategy to the CEU HapMap data set and construct a haplogroup tree with 107 Y-SNPs from 39 individuals. The retrieved Y-SNPs can discern the parental genetic structure of populations. Given the massive quantity of data from GWAS, this method facilitates future investigations of Y chromosome diversity.

For the development of conjugation estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) double-layer tablets, techniques of thermal, isothermal stress testing (IST), and molecular vibrational spectroscopy analysis were performed to access the compatibility. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were used as an important and complementary tool during preformulation to determine drug-excipient compatibility. On the basis of DSC results, MPA was found to be compatible with polyethylene glycol 6000. However, the results of Raman and IST studies showed that all the excipients defined in the prototype formula were found to be compatible with MPA. Overall, the compatibility of selected excipients with MPA was successfully evaluated using a combination of thermal and IST methods, and the formulations developed using the compatible excipients were found to be stable.

J	Wang, J; Pfefferkorn, HW; Feng, Z				Wang, Jun; Pfefferkorn, Hermann W.; Feng, Zhuo			Noeggerathiales as coal-forming plants in Cathaysia: conclusions from an Early Permian vegetational Pompeii in Inner Mongolia	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Noeggerathiales; Paleoecology; Peat-forming swamp; Permian; Wuda	SP-NOV; CHINA; WUDA; PARATINGIA; TUFF	Noeggerathiales are an extinct group of spore-bearing plants of uncertain systematic position that are known from Carboniferous and Permian age Euramerican and Cathaysian floras that occurred in present-day Europe, North America, and East Asia. The order Noeggerathiales includes over 50 species of more than 20 fossil genera, but their paleoecology is not well understood yet. Previously this group had been found only in extrabasinal floras or those inhabiting clastic wetlands. Noeggerathiales have never been recorded in coal ball floras. Thus, it is up to now uncertain whether this group has contributed to the formation of coal. Recent investigations of an Early Permian peat-forming flora of the Taiyuan Formation near Wuda, Inner Mongolia, which was preserved in a volcanic ash fall has provided evidence that noeggerathialean plants not only existed in the peat-forming vegetation but could even be the dominant group in some areas of the coal swamp. The Noeggerathiales in this particular peat-forming forest include Tingia unita, Paratingia wudensis, and a new species of Paratingia. Exceptionally well-preserved specimens indicate that these noeggerathialean plants are small trees with a canopy of compound leaves and strobili near the top of an unbranched (monocaulous) stem.

Argo-Ybj Collaboration	IDENTIFICATION OF THE TeV GAMMA-RAY SOURCE ARGO J2031+4157 WITH THE CYGNUS COCOON	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						acceleration of particles; cosmic rays; gamma rays: general	MGRO J2019+37; YBJ DETECTOR; EMISSION; J2032+4130; REGION; FERMI; CALIBRATION; DISCOVERY; GALAXY; MODEL	The extended TeV gamma-ray source ARGO J2031+4157 (or MGRO J2031+41) is positionally consistent with the Cygnus Cocoon discovered by Fermi-LAT at GeV energies in the Cygnus superbubble. Reanalyzing the ARGO-YBJ data collected from 2007 November to 2013 January, the angular extension and energy spectrum of ARGO J2031+4157 are evaluated. After subtracting the contribution of the overlapping TeV sources, the ARGO-YBJ excess map is fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function in a square region of 10 degrees x 10 degrees, finding a source extension sigma(ext) = 1 degrees.8 +/- 0 degrees.5. The observed differential energy spectrum is dN/dE = (2.5 +/- 0.4) x 10(-11)(E/1 TeV)(-2.6 +/- 0.3) photons cm(-2) s(-1) TeV-1, in the energy range 0.2-10 TeV. The angular extension is consistent with that of the Cygnus Cocoon as measured by Fermi-LAT and the spectrum also shows a good connection with the one measured in the 1-100 GeV energy range. These features suggest to identify ARGO J2031+4157 as the counterpart of the Cygnus Cocoon at TeV energies. The Cygnus Cocoon, located in the star-forming region of Cygnus X, is interpreted as a cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays related to the Cygnus superbubble. The spectral similarity with supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates that the particle acceleration inside a superbubble is similar to that in an SNR. The spectral measurements from 1 GeV to 10 TeV allows for the first time to determine the possible spectrum slope of the underlying particle distribution. A hadronic model is adopted to explain the spectral energy distribution.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

Swept charge devices (SCDs) are selected as detectors for the Low Energy X-ray Telescope. As SCDs are sensitive to proton irradiation, irradiation tests were carried out on the HI-13 accelerator at the China Institute of Atomic Energy. The beam energy was measured to be 10 MeV at the SCD. The proton fluence delivered to the SCD was 3x10(8)protons/cm(2) over two hours. By comparing the performance before and after irradiation, it is concluded that proton irradiation affects both the dark current and the charge transfer inefficiency of the SCD. The energy resolution of the proton-irradiated SCD is 212 eV@5.9 keV at -60 degrees C, while it before irradiated is 134 eV. Moreover, better performance can be reached by lowering the operating temperature of the SCD in orbit.

Some sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for such class of impulsive BAM neural networks. The results are essentially new when T = R or T = Z. It is the first time that the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for impulsive BAM neural networks are obtained on time scales. Furthermore, an example and numerical simulations are given to illustrate our effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies of humans on the Tibetan plateau and in the Andes Mountains have identified statistical signatures of selection in different sets of loci. Here, we first measured the hemoglobin levels in village dogs from Tibet and those from Chinese lowlands. We found that the hemoglobin levels are very similar between the two groups, suggesting that Tibetan dogs might share similar adaptive strategies as the Tibetan people. Through a whole-genome sequencing approach, we have identified EPAS1 and HBB as candidate genes for the hypoxic adaptation on the Tibetan plateau. The population genetic analysis shows a significant convergence between humans and dogs in Tibet. The similarities in the sets of loci that exhibit putative signatures of selection and the hemoglobin levels between humans and dogs of the same environment, but not between human populations in different regions, suggests an extraordinary landscape of convergent evolution between human beings and their best friend on the Tibetan plateau.

The effect of contact time, initial concentration, and solution temperature on calcite adsorption of lead ions was studied using a batch technique. The maximal adsorption capacity of calcite for Pb2+ was 3347.02 mg/g with a minimum contact time of 60 min. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir/Freundlich isotherms were proposed for modeling kinetic and equilibrium data, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as a dagger G (0), a dagger H (0), and a dagger S (0) were calculated to reveal the nature of sorption. Original calcite and the products of adsorption were characterized using SEM, TEM/EDAX, SAED, XRD, and BET. Dissolution of calcite followed by precipitation of lead carbonate was found to be the main operating mechanism for Pb2+ adsorption by calcite.

The evolution of structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis spectrophotometer and four-probe instrument. The analyzed results indicate that the obtained films are of good crystal quality with the wurtzite-type ZnO structure and a highly c-axis preferred orientation. The thin films with the different surface morphologies and thicknesses were obtained under the different heat-treating processes. After post-heating treatment, the energy band gap decreases from 3.21 eV to 3.14 eV and the resistivity from 3.22 Omega cm to 1.42 Omega cm, while the average transmittance in the range of 400-700 nm increases from 82.9% to 86.7%. As-prepared Al-doped ZnO thin films were used directly as a sensing device to investigate the sensing properties in ethanol atmosphere. The home-built Al-doped ZnO thin film sensors showed high response, fast response, and recovery times toward ethanol gas, making these thin films not only interesting for sensor devices, but also for a number of related electrochemical applications.

By using the 2010 version of the W-D code, it is found that the star is a deep (59.5-62.7%) contact binary system, with an extreme mass ratio (0.143-0.183). The period of the system increases with a rate dP/dt = +1.95( +/- 0.06) x 10(-7) days/year. We propose that the system contains a post-main-sequence component which may be in an expanding phase. The time scale of the orbital increase nearly equals to the time for the post-main-sequence star to evolve into a subgiant. The age of the primary is estimated to be 5.34 Gyr.

We compiled a spatial database on the distributions of ecosystem-and species-level conservation features, and modeled a human disturbance index (HDI) by aggregating information using several socioeconomic proxies. We ran Marxan with two scenarios (HDI-ignored and HDI-considered) to investigate the effects of human disturbance, and explored the geographic patterns of the optimized spatial conservation priorities. Compared to when HDI was ignored, the HDI-considered scenario resulted in (1) a marked reduction (similar to 9%) in the total HDI score and a slight increase (similar to 7%) in the total area of the portfolio of priority units, (2) a significant increase (similar to 43%) in the total irreplaceable area and (3) more irreplaceable units being identified in almost all environmental zones and highly-disturbed provinces. Thus the inclusion of human disturbance is essential for cost-effective priority-setting. Attention should be targeted to the areas that are characterized as moderately-disturbed, <2,000 m in altitude, and/or intermediately-to extremely-rugged in terrain to identify potentially important regions for implementing cost-effective conservation. We delineated 23 primary large-scale priority areas that are significant for conserving China's biodiversity, but those isolated priority units in disturbed regions are in more urgent need of conservation actions so as to prevent immediate and severe biodiversity loss. This study presents a spatially optimized national-scale portfolio of conservation priorities - effectively representing the overall biodiversity of China while minimizing conflicts with economic development. Our results offer critical insights for current conservation and strategic land-use planning in China. The approach is transferable and easy to implement by end-users, and applicable for national- and local-scale systematic conservation prioritization practices.

In this study, we compared fungi associated with grass (Poaceae) roots from two ecosystems: the temperate pine barrens in New Jersey, USA and tropical rain forests in Yunnan, China, using the same sampling, isolation and species identification methods. A total of 426 fungal isolates were obtained from 1600 root segments from 80 grass samples. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and morphological characteristics, a total of 85 fungal species (OTUs) belonging in 45 genera, 23 families, 16 orders, and 6 classes were identified, among which the pine barrens had 38 and Yunnan had 56 species, with only 9 species in common. The finding that grass roots in the tropical forests harbor higher fungal species diversity supports that tropical forests are fungal biodiversity hotspots. Sordariomycetes was dominant in both places but more Leotiomycetes were found in the pine barrens than Yunnan, which may play a role in the acidic and oligotrophic pine barrens ecosystem. Equal number of undescribed fungal species were discovered from the two sampled ecosystems, although the tropical Yunnan had more known fungal species. Pine barrens is a unique, unexplored ecosystem. Our finding suggests that sampling plants in such unexplored habitats will uncover novel fungi and that grass roots in pine barrens are one of the major reservoirs of novel fungi with about 47% being undescribed species.

By utilizing the exponential dichotomy of linear dynamic equations on time scales, Banach's fixed point theorem and the theory of calculus on time scales, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for this class of neural networks. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility of our results and also shows that the continuous-time neural network and the discrete-time analogue have the same dynamical behaviors. The results of this paper are completely new and complementary to the previously known results even when the time scale T = R or Z.

A combination of chemical screening, genome analyses, and genetic manipulation led to the identification of the thermolide biosynthetic genes from sister thermophilic fungi T. thermophilus and Thermomyces lanuginosus and a new thermolide. The biosynthetic locus for the thermolides' mixed polyketide/amino acid structure encodes a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS). Our results reveal the first fungal hybrid iterative PKS-NRPS genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial-like hybrid macrolactones instead of typical fungal tetramic acids-containing metabolites. The finding provides an insight into the convergent biosynthetic end products that bridge the gap between the modular and iterative PKS-NRPS hybrids.

Wild boar has a worldwide distribution with its geographic origin in Southeast Asia, but genetic diversity and genetic structure of wild boar in East Asia are poorly understood. To characterize the pattern and amount of genetic variation and population structure of wild boar in East Asia, we genotyped and analyzed microsatellite loci for a total of 238 wild boar specimens from ten locations across six countries in East and Southeast Asia. Results: Our data indicated that wild boar populations in East Asia are genetically diverse and structured, showing a significant correlation of genetic distance with geographic distance and implying a low level of gene flow at a regional scale. Bayesian-based clustering analysis was indicative of seven inferred genetic clusters in which wild boars in East Asia are geographically structured. The level of genetic diversity was relatively high in wild boars from Southeast Asia, compared with those from Northeast Asia. This gradient pattern of genetic diversity is consistent with an assumed ancestral population of wild boar in Southeast Asia. Genetic evidences from a relationship tree and structure analysis suggest that wild boar in Jeju Island, South Korea have a distinct genetic background from those in mainland Korea. Conclusions: Our results reveal a diverse pattern of genetic diversity and the existence of genetic differentiation among wild boar populations inhabiting East Asia. This study highlights the potential contribution of genetic variation of wild boar to the high genetic diversity of local domestic pigs during domestication in East Asia.

In the present study, two sample preparation methods were tested for their suitability on the mature, recalcitrant leaves of six representative perennial plants (grape, plum, pear, peach, orange, and ramie). An improved sample preparation method was obtained: Tris and Triton X-100 were added together instead of CHAPS to the lysis buffer, and a 20% TCA-water solution and 100% precooled acetone were added after the protein extraction for the further purification of protein. This method effectively eliminates nonprotein impurities and obtains a clear two-dimensional gel electrophoresis array. The method facilitates the separation of high-molecular-weight proteins and increases the resolution of low-abundance proteins. This method provides a widely applicable and economically feasible technology for the proteomic study of the mature, recalcitrant leaves of perennial plants.

However, the essential pharmacophore of charged phosphotyrosine or its mimetic confer low selectivity and poor cell permeability. Starting from our previously reported aryl diketoacid-based PTP1B inhibitors, a drug-like scaffold of 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid was introduced for the first time as a novel surrogate of phosphotyrosine. An optimal combination of hydrophobic groups installed at C-6, N-1 and C-3 positions of the quinolone motif afforded potent PTP1B inhibitors with low micromolar IC50 values. These 4-quinolone-3-carboxylate based PTP1B inhibitors displayed a 2-10 fold selectivity over a panel of PTP's. Furthermore, the bidentate inhibitors of 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acids conjugated with aryl diketoacid or salicylic acid were cell permeable and enhanced insulin signaling in CHO/hIR cells. The kinetic studies and molecular modeling suggest that the 4-quinolone-3-carboxylates act as competitive inhibitors by binding to the PTP1B active site in the WPD loop closed conformation. Taken together, our study shows that the 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid derivatives exhibit improved pharmacological properties over previously described PTB1B inhibitors and warrant further preclinical studies.

Using Au@SiC as electrode material and using ferricyanide as mediator, the proposed immunosensor provides a simple and economic method with higher sensitivity and a wider concentration range for detection of hCG. Under the optimal condition, the approach provided a good linear response range from 0.1 to 5 IU/L and 5 to 1000 IU/L with a low detection limit of 0.042 IU/L. The immunosensor showed good selectivity, acceptable stability and reproducibility. Satisfactory results were obtained for determination of hCG in human serum samples. The proposed method provides a promising platform of clinical immunoassay for other biomolecules. In addition, the bio-functionalization of SiC combined with other nanomaterials will provide promising approach for electrochemical sensing and biosensing platform. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Smitinand) K. Hill. (Cycadaceae) is an endangered species in China. There were seven populations and 118 individuals that we could collect were genotyped in this study. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of this species. Results: Analyses of data of DNA sequences (two maternally inherited intergenic spacers of chloroplast, cpDNA and one biparentally inherited internal transcribed spacer region ITS4-ITS5, nrDNA) and sixteen microsatellite loci (SSR) were conducted in the species. Of the 118 samples, 86 individuals from the seven populations were used for DNA sequencing and 115 individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study. We found high genetic diversity at the species level, low genetic diversity within each of the seven populations and high genetic differentiation among the populations. There was a clear genetic structure within populations of C. simplicipinna. A demographic history inferred from DNA sequencing data indicates that C. simplicipinna experienced a recent population contraction without retreating to a common refugium during the last glacial period. The results derived from SSR data also showed that C. simplicipinna underwent past effective population contraction, likely during the Pleistocene. Conclusions: Some genetic features of C. simplicipinna such as having high genetic differentiation among the populations, a clear genetic structure and a recent population contraction could provide guidelines for protecting this endangered species from extinction. Furthermore, the genetic features with population dynamics of the species in our study would help provide insights and guidelines for protecting other endangered species effectively.

High water level impedes the adaptation of Polygonum hydropiper to deep burial: Responses of biomass allocation and root morphology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DONGTING LAKE; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; PLANT-RESPONSES; GROWTH; SEDIMENTATION; ELONGATION; PLASTICITY; SURVIVAL; TOLERANCE	Many studies have investigated the individual effects of sedimentation or inundation on the performance of wetland plants, but few have examined the combined influence of these processes. Wetland plants might show greater morphological plasticity in response to inundation than to sedimentation when these processes occur simultaneously since inundation can negate the negative effects of burial on plant growth. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by assessing growth of the emergent macrophyte Polygonum hydropiper under flooding (0 and 40 cm) and sedimentation (0, 5, and 10 cm), separately and in combination. Deep burial and high water level each led to low oxidation-reduction potential, biomass (except for 5-cm burial), and growth of thick, short roots. These characteristics were generally more significant under high water level than under deep burial conditions. More biomass was allocated to stems in the deep burial treatments, but more to leaves in the high water level treatments. Additionally, biomass accumulation was lower and leaf mass ratio was higher in the 40-cm water level + 10-cm burial depth treatment than both separate effects. Our data indicate that inundation plays a more important role than sedimentation in determining plant morphology, suggesting hierarchical effects of environmental stressors on plant growth.

Thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional topological insulators doped with nonmagnetic impurities	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ENVELOPE-FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; HGTE QUANTUM-WELLS; PHASE	We present a theoretical study on the thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs) doped with nonmagnetic impurities. We develop a tractable model to calculate the electronic band structure without additional input parameters and to evaluate the thermoelectric properties of 2DTIs based on CdTe/HgTe quantum wells. We find that with increasing the doping concentration of nonmagnetic impurity, the edge states dominate the thermoelectric transport and the bulk-state conduction is largely suppressed. For typical sample parameters, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT (a quantity used to characterize the conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric device between the heat and electricity) can be much larger than 1, which is a great advance over conventional thermoelectric materials. Furthermore, we show that with decreasing the 2DTI ribbon width or the Hall-bar width, ZT can be considerably further improved. These results indicate that the CdTe/HgTe 2DTIs doped with nonmagnetic impurities can be potentially applied as high-efficiency thermoelectric materials and devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Adsorption capacities under optimum conditions were determined. According to the results, the optimum operating conditions for platinum extraction by the microspheres were octyl benzothiazolyl sulfoxide content = 35 % (w/w), hydrochloric acid concentration = 4.0 mol L-1 and contact time = 10 min. Under these optimum operating conditions, Pt(IV) ions adsorption capacities increased with increasing initial Pt(IV) ions concentration and it reached the maximum value at 39 mg g(-1). Successful striping of Pt(IV) from the microspheres were achieved with 0.4 wt % sodium hydroxide solution. The microspheres can be reused at least in ten cycles of extraction-stripping process.

Rogue waves in the form of the rational homoclinic solution are derived when the periods of breather homoclinic wave go to infinite. Some novel features of homoclinic wave solutions are discussed and presented. In contrast to the normal bright rogue wave structure, a structure like a four-petaled flower in temporal-spatial distribution is exhibited. Further with the change of the wave number of the plane wave, the bright and dark rogue wave structures may change into each other. The bright rogue wave structure results from the full merger of two nearby peaks, and the dark rogue wave structure results from the full merger of two nearby holes. The dark rogue wave for the uncoupled Boussinesq equation is finally obtained. Its structural properties show that it never takes on bright rogue wave features with the change of parameter. It is hoped that these results might provide us with useful information on the dynamics of the relevant fields in physics.

NOV.	A Gram-negative, moderately halophilic, strictly aerobic strain, designated YIM 95345(T), was isolated from a soil sample of a hypersaline mine in Yunnan province, PR China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain YIM 95345(T) grew at 15-45 degrees C (optimum 30-35 degrees C), 3.0-23.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10.0-11.0%, w/v) and pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0-8.0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism belongs to the genus Aquisalimonas and exhibited sequence similarity of 96.6% to the sole type strain Aquisalimonas asiatica CG12(T). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-8 and the major fatty acids were C-16:0, C-19:0 cyclo omega 8c and C-18:1 omega 7c. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, three aminolipids and three unidentified phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 59.4 mol%. Based on the results of our comparative phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological analyses, the new isolate is assigned to a novel species of the genus Aquisalimonas, for which the name Aquisalimonas halophila sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain YIM 95345(T) (=DSM 25902(T)=CCTCC AB 2012043(T)).

NOV.; SUBORDER CORYNEBACTERINEAE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ACID; MEMBER; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MENAQUINONES; SEQUENCES; BACTERIA	A Gram-staining-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, irregular rod-shaped actinobacterium, designated YIM C00895(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from Jiuxiang Scenic Region, Yunnan province, south-west China. The strain was able to grow at 10-28 degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and 0-11 % NaCl (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA (95.3%) gene sequences revealed the highest similarity to Tomitella biformata AHU1821(T). The whole-cell hydrolysates of strain YIM C00895(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose and galactose, indicating chemotype IV. The muramic acids in the peptidoglycan were glycolated. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and an unidentified glycolipid. MK-9(H-2) was the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were C-14:0, C-16:0, C-16:1 and C-18:1 omega 9c and tuberculostearic acid (10-methyl C-18:0) was present in relatively small amounts (4.5%). TLC analysis of its cellular mycolic acids showed a similar profile to Tomitella biformata DSM 45403(T). The DNA G+C content of the strain was 67.5 mol%. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed strain YIM C00895(T) to be differentiated phenotypically from Tomitella biformata DSM 45403(T). On the basis of evidence from this polyphasic study, the novel species Tomitella cavernea sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Tomitella cavernea is YIM C00895(T) (=DSM 45788(T)=JCM 18542(T)).

Phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data for the organism supported that it belonged to the genus Janibacter. Strain 0704P10-1(T) showed 97.2-98.7% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to the type strains of recognized members of the genus Janibacter. It contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall. MK-8(H-4) was the only menaquinone detected. The major fatty acids were iso-C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 8c and 10-methyl C-17:0. Meanwhile, the results of DNA-DNA hybridization studies and other physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain 0704P10-1(T) from closely related species. Thus, strain 0704P10-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Janibacter, for which the name Janibacter indicus sp. nov. is proposed.

Different developmental stages of the same animal occupy different ecological niches to avoid competing for food or other essential resources. Here, we describe an exceptionally preserved larval stage of the short great appendage (SGA) arthropod (megacheiran) Leanchoilia illecebrosa from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota of China. The larval specimen preserves fine details of the main feeding limb, the SGA, which are unknown in the adult of the same species. This discovery demonstrates that niche differentiation during ontogeny was developed in this species of megacheiran-a group of fossil arthropods that has been considered to be early representatives of Chelicerata, which includes horseshoe crabs and arachnids. Hence, this type of niche differentiation, which is common today, originated from the early Cambrian.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AUM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the morphology and microstructure of the thin films. Optical properties of the thin films were determined by photoluminescence (PL) and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The analyzed results indicates that the obtained films are of good crystal quality and have smooth surfaces, which have a pure hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure without any Mn related phases. Room temperature photoluminescence is observed for the ZnO and Mn-doped ZnO thin films. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LSGMC electrolyte materials can form a very stable structure with perosvkite phase according to calculation of tolerance factor and average electronegtivity difference. Oxygen nonstoichiometric values of LSGMC increase with increasing of doping Co amount, showing that the adsorption oxygen in LSGMC material lattice enhances when the doping Co amount reduces. SSR can acquire denser LSGMC materials than GNP, while GNP can get narrower particle size distribution than SSR. Excellent conductivity of LSGMC materials with 0.217 S/cm at 800 degrees C, and 0.193 S/cm at 750 degrees C is obtained.

Tidal stress components on different kinds of seismogenic fault and its variation characteristics with depth were analyzed. Using Coulomb failure stress criterion, the effect of tidal triggering on various earthquakes was obtained. The Schuster's test was used to analyze the effect of tidal stress on earthquakes of different magnitude and tectonic types. Using the two methods above mentioned comprehensively, we explored the effect of tidal triggering on earthquakes of different magnitude, tectonic district, seismogenic fault and depth. Our results show that tidal triggering was obvious on normal and thrust fault earthquakes in Indian block and Lhasa block, strike and oblique slip fault earthquakes in Yunnan-Myanmar-Thailand block, Indochina block and Songpan-Garze block, oblique slip fault earthquakes in Sichuan-Yunnan Diamond block. Moreover, the effect of tidal triggering depended on the depth and magnitude of earthquake, the fault of seismogenic fault and regional tectonic stress field.

In this study, we performed high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA of blood and pocket tissue from 54 asymptomatic CIED patients as well as blood from 30 normal individuals (normal controls). Firstly, we observed a significant increase of blood bacterial diversity in patients as compared with blood of normal subjects or patient tissues. We also found significant differences in 13 blood-associated bacterial genera between patients and normal subjects, and 14 bacteria genera between blood and tissues within patients. Secondly, we found that the serum levels of four inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and MCP-1) in CIED patients were significantly higher than those in normal subjects. Thirdly, we found that there were significant correlations between 43 bacterial species and these inflammatory markers. Taken together, our results reveal a high diversity in the microbial community in CIED patients, and suggest the potential roles of multiple bacteria co-occurrence in the CIED subclinical infections.

It is expected that the respective atmospheric response will be different. In order to identify differences in the responses to these two phenomena, we examine the Community Atmosphere Model Version 4 simulations forced with observed monthly sea surface temperature during 1979-2010 and compare with the corresponding observations. For CP El Nio, a triple precipitation anomaly pattern appears over East Asia. During EP El Nio, the triple pattern is not as significant as and shifts eastward and southward compared to CP El Nio. We also examine the influence of CP La Nia and EP La Nia on East Asia. In general, the impact of CP (EP) La Nia on tropics and East Asia seems to be opposite to that of CP (EP) El Nio. However, the impacts between the two types of La Nia are less independent compared to the two types of warm events. Both types of El Nio (La Nia) correspond to a stronger (weaker) western North Pacific summer monsoon. The sensitivity experiments support this result. But the CP El Nio (La Nia) may have more significant influence on East Asia summer climate than EP El Nio (La Nia), as the associated low-level anomalous wind pattern is more distinct and closer to the Asian continent compared to EP El Nino (La Nina).

Although its pharmacokinetics has been intensively explored, little is known about complexed caffeine (C-CAF) in aqueous extraction of fermented Pu-er tea. The major components of C-CAF are oxidative tea polyphenols (OTP) and caffeine. Furthermore, the C-CAF can be precipitated in low pH solution. After administering the same amount of total caffeine and comparing the peak level of plasma caffeine with the coffee (contains 0.11 +/- 0.01% C-CAF) group, the results showed that the caffeine/OTP (contains 66.67 +/- 0.02% C-CAF) group and the instant Pu-er tea (contains 23.18 +/- 0.02% C-CAF) group were 33.39% and 25.86% lower, respectively. The concentration of the metabolites of caffeine supports the idea that the absorption of the C-CAF was inhibited in mice. Congruent with this result, the amount of caffeine detected in mice excrement showed that more caffeine was eliminated in the caffeine/OTP group and the Pu-er tea group. The locomotor activity tests of mice demonstrated that the stimulating effect of caffeine in caffeine/OTP and Pu-er tea was weaker than in coffee. Our findings demonstrate that caffeine can be combined with OTP and the absorption of C-CAF is inhibited in mice, thus decreasing the irritation effect of caffeine. This may also be developed as a slow release formulation of caffeine.

The halloysite clay nanotubes can adsorb the target precursor and induce inorganic/metallic nanocrystals to grow in situ. The crystalline phase and morphology of the composite clay nanotubes is tunable. By simply tuning the acidity of the titania sol, the crystalline titania-clay nanotubes with tunable crystalline phases of anatase, a mixture of anatase and rutile or rutile are achieved. The approach is general and has been extended to synthesize the representative perovskite oxide (barium and strontium titanate)-halloysite composite nanotubes. Metallic nickel nanocrystal can also be grown on the surface of halloysite nanotubes at low temperature. The traditional thermal treatment for crystallite transformation is not required, thus intact contour of halloysite nanotubes and the crystallinity structure of halloysite nanotubes can be guaranteed. The combined properties from inorganic/metallic nanocrystal (high refractive index, high dielectric constant and catalytic ability) and the halloysite clay nanotubes are promising for applications such as photonic crystals, high-k-gate dielectrics, photocatalysis and purification.

The neural and protonated molecular structures of o-phenanthroline were studied by quantum chemical calculation. The results show that o-phenanthroline is a good inhibitor, and the adsorption obeys Langmuir isotherm. From polarization curves, o-phenanthroline acts as a cathodic inhibitor. EIS spectra exhibit a large capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a large inductive one at low frequencies. The inhibition action is confirmed by SEM images.

The phases and the morphologiesof the resulting materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), respectively. The results showed that the ZnCd composites have a coral- like shape with a size of tens of micrometersand exhibit the hierarchically porous morphology, in which the walls of the macropores contain smallermesopores. The 3D hierarchical architecture consisted of nanoparticles. The gas-sensing characteristicsof the resulted porous ZnO-CdO composites for isopropanol were investigated. Indirect- heating sensorsusing porous ZnO-CdO composites as sensitive materials were fabricated on an alumina tube with Auelectrodes and platinum wires. All measurements were performed at several operating temperaturesfrom 175 to 315 degrees C. Good gas-sensing performances to isopropanol have been found for the preparedsample of porous ZnO-CdO composite with a content of 10 at% CdO (ZnCd10). It is shown that the sensorexhibits the highest gas response and selectivity at the operating temperature of 248 degrees C, making thempromising candidates as practical detectors for isopropanol.

Examination of the acquired samples using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement has provided fundamental insight into the structure and properties of the Mn2O3/MCM-41 composite. It is found that the as-prepared Mn2O3/MCM-41 composite has a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 793 m(2) g(-1). The performance of Mn2O3/MCM-41 composite as a remover was further demonstrated in the removal of azo dyes of methyl orange (MO), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), and rhodamine B (RB) with/without visible light irradiation at room temperature.

Photometric investigation of the deep-contact binary V409 Hya	NEW ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Stars: binaries: close; Stars: binaries: eclipsing; Stars: individual (V409 Hya); Stars: stellar evolution	STAR LIGHT; SYSTEMS; CURVES; CYGNI	V409 Hya is a newly discovered W UMa-type binary star with a period of 0.47226 days. Complete light curves in V, 12,, and I bands are presented and analyzed with the W-D (Wilson and Devinney) method. It is discovered that V409 Hya is a deep contact binary with a contact degree of integral = 60.6(+/- 1.4)%. It is an A-type, low-mass-ratio contact binary with a mass ratio of 0.22. The derived orbital inclination (i = 89.8 degrees) indicates that it is a total eclipsing binary and the determined parameters are reliable. By combining several determined times of light minimum with the others compiled from the literature, the period changes of V409 Hya were investigated. The general trend of the (O-C) curve reveals that the period of the binary is increasing continuously at a rate of dP/dt = +5.41(+/- 0.06) x 10(-7) days/year. The continuous period increase can be explained by a mass transfer from the secondary to the primary. As the matter is being transferred, the mass ratio of the binary system is decreasing. After it meets the more familiar criterion that the orbital angular momentum is less than 3 times the total spin angular momentum, the deep contact binary may finally evolve into a rapid-rotating single star.

This genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic approaches, DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". However, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. We use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of Streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. Genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. Population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including Pyogenic, Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups, and the other including Mitis, Anginosus and Unknown groups. Phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. Distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. We suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a conjugated polymer with thymidine side chain bases and polythiophene backbones (PTT) instead of phosphate bonds in DNA, and the PTT exhibits exceptional fluorescence quenching efficiency upon binding of Cu2+ ions in aqueous medium, which is suggested to be electron transfer from the pi* orbit at the excited state of PTT to the 3d orbit of Cu2+ ions and subsequent Cu2+-mediated interpolymer pi-stacking aggregation. Furthermore, Cu2+ ions can be selectively and easily monitored by the fluorescence quenching of PTT, which can be used for detection of Cu2+ ions with good selectivity and high sensitivity in aqueous medium. Both experimental and theoretical methods have been devoted to demonstrate the strong affinity and steric interaction of PTT toward Cu2+. These findings will illustrate new directions for the design of nucleobase-functionalized materials with transition metals responsive activity.

J	Li, JC; Li, C; Mei, DC				Li, Jiang-Cheng; Li, Chun; Mei, Dong-Cheng			Effects of time delay on stochastic resonance of the stock prices in financial system	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Time delay; Stock prices; Stochastic resonance	HESTON MODEL; REVERSE-RESONANCE; MULTI-RESONANCE; BISTABLE SYSTEM; ADDITIVE NOISE; MARKET MODEL; CHAOTIC MAPS; VOLATILITY; DYNAMICS; RETURNS	The effect of time delay on stochastic resonance of the stock prices in finance system was investigated. The time delay is introduced into the Heston model driven by the extrinsic and intrinsic periodic information for stock price. The signal power amplification (SPA) was calculated by numerical simulation. The results indicate that an optimal critical value of delay time maximally enhances the reverse-resonance in the behaviors of SPA as a function of long-run variance of volatility or cross correlation coefficient between noises for both cases of intrinsic and extrinsic periodic information. Moreover, in both cases, being a critical value in the delay time, when the delay time takes value below the critical value, reverse-resonance increases with the delay time increasing, however, when the delay time takes value above the critical value, the reverse-resonance decrease with the delay time increasing.

To evaluate the performance of the ARBFNN, a 51 dBm DPA and a 25 MHz mixed test signal were used in modelling and linearisation measurement. Compared with the memory polynomial (MP) model and the real-valued time-delay neural network (RVTDNN), the ARBFNN is highly effective, leading to 3 and 5 dB improvements in the normalised mean square error. More importantly, the ARBFNN predistorter represents a significant improvement over the RVTDNN and MP in the suppression of the out-of-band spectral regrowth. In addition, the ARBFNN has a similar linearisation capability as the generalised MP model, but has much better numerical stability.

The properties of the electrochemical sensor modified with PPT. imprinted membrane were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under the optimum conditions, it was found that the response of peak currents was linear to the concentration of PPT in range of 1.0-120 mu mol/L with the detection limit of 0.47 mu mol/L. The sensor not only showed high selectivity, but also exhibited good stability and reproducibility. The sensor was satisfactorily applied to the determination of PPT in podophyllum hexandrum and human serum samples with the relative standard deviation (RSD) below 3.9% and recovery ranging from 95.0% to 103.3%.

The ratio of the transition rates R of the particles from the middle well to the side wells is obtained by stochastic simulations. The results indicate that R as a function of the recycled noise intensity shows a non-monotonic behavior with a maximum or a minimum, and the other parameters such as the delay time and recycling strength can cause a deviation of R from unity, implying that the recycled noise may induce symmetry breaking and a variation of the relative stability of the two side wells with respect to the middle one. These observations illustrate that noise recycling may be used as an effective scheme for controlling the distribution of the products in the course of a parallel reaction by deliberately adjusting the parameters of the recycled noise.

Strain EGI 80088(T) formed fragmented aerial hyphae and short spore chains, and rod-like spores aggregated at maturity. Whole-cell hydrolysates of the isolate contained LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and glucosamine, mannose, galactose, glucose and rhamnose as the marker sugars. The major fatty acids identified (>5%) were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, summed feature 4 (iso-C17:1I/anteiso-C17:1B), iso-C-16:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain EGI 80088(T) was 70.6 mol%. EGI 80088(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to its closest phylogenetic neighbour Haloactinopolyspora alba YIM 93246(T) (98.5 W). The DNA DNA relatedness value of the strain EGI 800881 and H. alba YIM 93246(T) was 59.3 +/- 5.2 %.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM M13235(T) belonged to the genus Bacillus. The strain grew optimally at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2-4% (w/v) NaCl. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was present in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Strain YIM M13235(T) exhibited a menaquinone system with MK-7, and the major polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, four unknown phospholipids and one unknown glycolipid. The major fatty acids (>5%) were iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-17:1 omega 10c and summed feature 4 (anteiso-C-17:1 and/or iso-C-17:1). The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.1 mol%. The DNA DNA relatedness values between strain YIM M13235(T) and its close relatives (16S rRNA gene sequence similarities >97%) including Bacillus halmapalus DSM 8723(T), Bacillus horikoshii DSM 8719(T) and Bacillus zhanjiangensis JSM 099021(T) were 41%, 44% and 44%, respectively. On the basis of genotypic, phenotypic and DNA DNA relatedness data, it is apparent that strain YIM M13235(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus tianshenii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M13235(T) (=DSM 25879(T)=KCIC 33044(T)).

Cells had a mean diameter of 0.3 mu m and length of 4.0 mu m, and formed filaments that typically ranged in length from 20 to 200 mu m. Filaments were negative for the Gram stain reaction, spores were not formed and motility was not observed. The optimum temperature for growth was 72.5-75 degrees C, with a range of 67.5-75 degrees C, and the optimum pH for growth was 6.75, with a range of pH 6.5-7.75. Peptone, tryptone or yeast extract were able to support growth when supplemented with vitamins, but no growth was observed using a variety of defined organic substrates. Strain JAD2(T) was microaerophilic and facultatively anaerobic, with optimal growth at 1% (v/v) O-2 and an upper limit of 8% O-2. The major cellular fatty acids (>5%) were C-16:0, C-19:0, C-18:0, C-20:0 and C-19:1. The genomic DNA G+C content was 69.3 mol%. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses using sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and other conserved genes placed JAD2(T) within the phylum Chloroflexi, but not within any existing class in this phylum. These results indicate that strain JAD2(T) is the first cultivated representative of a novel lineage within the phylum Chloroflexi, for which we propose the name Thermoflexus hugenholtzii gen. nov., sp. nov., within Thermoflexia classis nov., Thermoflexales ord. nov. and Thermoflexaceae fam. nov. The type strain of Thermoflexus hugenholtzii is JAD2(T) (=JCM 19131(T)=CCTCC AB-2014030(T)).

Furthermore, the triggering relationship between the Wenchuan earthquake and Lushan earthquake is studied. The results show that the peak value of dynamic stress change on the Lushan earthquake fault induced by Wenchuan earthquake is 0. 127 MPa. With the 5-year accumulation of the viscoelastic relaxation in the middle-lower crust and upper mantle, the post-seismic stress change on the Lushan earthquake fault is 0. 025 MPa. The results indicate that the process of the nucleation and failure for the Lushan earthquake fault is affected by the post-seismic Coulomb failure stress change, dynamic stress change and static stress change induced by the Wenchuan earthquake, and the effect of dynamic stress change is more obvious than the others. Finally, we investigate the field of stress changes in the studied area after the Lushan earthquake.

The pathway analyses for the collection of anticancer targets screened were carried out based on the KEGG pathway database, followed by the forecast of potential pharmacological activities and pathways of the effects of cryptotanshinone, and verification of some of the targets screened using whole cell tests. The results showed that a total of eight targets with anticancer potential were screened, including MAP2K1, RAR alpha, RXR alpha, PDK1, CBK1, AR, Ang-1 R, and Kif11. These targets are mainly related to four aspects of the cancer growth: the cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and androgen receptor. The cell tests showed that cryptotanshinone can inhibit the viability of human hepatoma cells SMMC-7721, which is related to the reduction of expression of MAP2K1 mRNA. This method provides a strong clue for the study of the anticancer effects and mechanisms of action of cryptotanshinone in the future.

In this study, methanogen-related archaeal populations were investigated by 16S rRNA gene clone library, T-RFLP analysis, and methanogen enrichment in Pearl River estuarine sediments. The majority of obtained sequences in clone libraries and T-RF peaks from T-RFLP analysis were assigned mainly to Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales/ANME. The fragments of Methanosarcinales/ANME were most dominant group (mean 47%) and composed largely of ANME-2a which are characterized as anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea in broad environments. Furthermore Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobiales accounted for 23 and 29% of fragments, respectively, for all depths. Therefore, the presence of Methanomicrobiales and Methanosaeta in Pearl River estuarine sediments was indicative of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.

Genetic Structure and Colonization History of the Fruit Fly Bactrocera tau (Diptera: Tephritidae) in China and Southeast Asia	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						gene flow; dispersal; migration; mitochondrial DNA; biological invasion	POPULATIONS; INVASION; HAPLOTYPES; BIOLOGY; COMPLEX; FLIES	Bactrocera tau (Walker), a major invasive pest worldwide, was first described in Fujian (China) in 1849 and has dispersed to tropical and subtropical Asia and the South Pacific region. Few data are available on its colonization history and expansion processes. This pilot study attempted to reconstruct the colonization history and pathways of this pest in China and neighboring Southeast Asian countries based on mitochondrial DNA. Results of the study showed six genetic groups corresponding to geographical characteristics, although the pattern was relatively weak. Homogeneous genetic patterns were observed within southern and central China, and northern Vietnam. Continuous colonization from the coast of southern China to inland regions of China and northern Vietnam was suggested. Strong genetic structure was observed in western China, Thailand, and Laos. The isolation of four of the six groups was most probably attributable to major topographical barriers of western China. Yunnan acted as a contact zone of B. tau in China and neighboring Southeast Asia. The absence of isolation by distance and the overall low phylogeographic structure of B. tau suggested that long distance dispersal events and human activities could play a major role in the colonization and expansion patterns of B. tau. By analyzing the genetic diversity, gene flow, haplotype phylogeny, and demographic history of 23 fly populations, we hypothesized that B. tau could have been introduced long ago in southern China, from which it further expanded or that southern China could correspond to the native range of this species.

To date, several studies have investigated the binding sites of MTERF1 on mitochondrial genome and the regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription, but the more intricate connection between mitochondrial genes transcription regulation, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and cell proliferation is still poorly understood. In this study, we constructed over-expression and knockdown vectors of MTERF1 that were transfected into HeLa cells to investigate the functions of MTERF1. Results showed that although MTERF1 is a positive regulatory factor of mitochondrial genes transcription, it had no significant effect on the replication of mitochondrial DNA. Over-expression of MTERF1 increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity and promoted ATP synthesis, cyclin D1 expression, and cell proliferation, while its knockdown inhibited ATP synthesis, decreased cyclin D1 expression, and slowed the cell growth. These results suggested that MTERF1 may promote cell proliferation by regulating oxidative phosphorylation activity in HeLa cells. Ultimately, these findings create a foundation for further and more conclusive studies on the physiological functions of MTERF family by providing novel insights into the potential mechanisms underlying cell proliferation regulation.

With benefits of scalability and reliability, the Cloud storage systems have become an attractive choice for large-scale data processing. However, most Cloud storage systems currently adopt a hash-like approach to retrieve data that only support simple keyword-based enquiries, but lack various forms of information search. In this paper, we propose a novel SkipNet and B+ tree based index structure, called SNB-index, for Cloud computing systems. SNB-index adopts a two-layer architecture. In the lower layer, it uses the B+ tree to construct efficient local index. In the upper layer, it adaptively selects among local index nodes to form a SkipNet based global overlay. Our scalable auxiliary Cloud index can efficiently support a variety of types of queries (e.g. point-query, range-query, similarity-query), and provide high availability. Some new routing algorithms and mapping processing algorithms are designed to enhance performance. Experimental results show that SNB-index is valid and can be an alternative approach for constructing an auxiliary index in Cloud computing systems.

We study the performance of a variety of unconditional method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER) methods of combining separate confidence intervals for two single Poisson rates to form a confidence interval for their ratio. We consider confidence intervals derived from (1) the Fieller's theorem, (2) the logarithmic transformation with the delta method and (3) the substitution method. We evaluate the performance of 13 such types of confidence intervals by comparing their empirical coverage probabilities, empirical confidence widths, ratios of mesial non-coverage probability and total non-coverage probabilities. Our simulation results suggest that the MOVER Rao score confidence intervals based on the Fieller's theorem and the substitution method are preferable. We provide two applications to construct confidence intervals for the ratio of two Poisson rates in a breast cancer study and in a study that examines coronary heart diseases incidences among post menopausal women treated with or without hormones.

The GLFs of BL Lacs in the frame of the pure density evolution (PDE), the pure luminosity evolution (PLE), and the luminosity-dependent density (LDDE) models are determined by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, respectively. Our results suggest that the PDE model can give best description for BL Lac GLF based on the combination of constraints of model parameters and good fits to the observed data of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) BL Lacs, but other two models (PLE and LDDE) cannot be excluded. Based on our constructed GLFs, the contribution to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background (EGRB) from BL Lacs is estimated, and similar to 1-5 per cent of the EGRB in the 0.1-100 GeV band is found to come from unresolved BL Lacs (including the cascade emission). In addition, it is found that the BL Lac GLF is very different from flat spectrum radio quasar GLF and then the contribution of blazars to the EGRB should be estimated separately.

Using potentiostatic deposition, wurtzite ZnO with controlled microstructure and morphology has been deposited. While all ZnO deposits exhibit a band gap value of around 3.2 eV, impurity states determined by photoluminescence (PL) measurements show strong deposition potential influences. Both the green and red emissions corresponding to respective oxygen vacancies and oxygen rich impurity states can be identified. Thermal annealing can greatly reduce oxygen vacancy concentration but has limited effects on the oxygen rich defects. This study suggests a cost-effective and high-throughput approach in deposition of ZnO nanostructures suitable for photovoltaic applications.

In terms of the contingent cone and tangent derivative, we extend the Abadie CQ to more general convex multifunction cases and introduce the strong ACQ for both multifunctions and inequality systems. Some seemly unrelated notions are unified by the new ACQ and strong ACQ. Relationships among ACQ, strong ACQ, basic constraint qualification (BCQ) and strong BCQ are discussed. Using the strong ACQ, we study calmness of a closed and convex multifunction between two Banach spaces and, different from many existing dual conditions for calmness, establish several primal characterizations of calmness. As applications, some primal characterizations for error bounds and linear regularity are established; in particular, some existing results are improved.

J	Hu, JG; Xu, W				Hu JiaGuang; Xu Wen			The Brillouin zones and band gaps of a two-dimensional phononic crystal with parallelogram lattice structure	SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY			English	Article						phononic crystal; band gap; lattice basis vectors; plane wave expansion method	RODS; SHAPES	We present a detailed theoretical study on the acoustic band structure of two-dimensional (2D) phononic crystal. The 2D phononic crystal with parallelogram lattice structure is considered to be formed by rigid solid rods embedded in air. For the circular rods, some of the extrema of the acoustic bands appear in the usual high-symmetry points and, in contrast, we find that some of them are located in other specific lines. For the case of elliptic rods, our results indicate that it is necessary to study the whole first Brillouin zone to obtain rightly the band structure and corresponding band gaps. Furthermore, we evaluate the first and second band gaps using the plane wave expansion method and find that these gaps can be tuned by adjusting the side lengths ratio R, inclined angle theta and filling fraction F of the parallelogram lattice with circular rods. The results show that the largest value of the first band gap appears at theta=90A degrees and F=0.7854. In contrast, the largest value of the second band gap is at theta=60A degrees and F=0.9068. Our results indicate that the improvement of matching degree between scatterers and lattice pattern, rather than the reduction of structural symmetry, is mainly responsible for the enhancement of the band gaps in the 2D phononic crystal.

SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY			English	Article						stars: rotation; stars: evolution; stars: binaries	STELLAR EVOLUTION; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION; MASSIVE STARS; INTERIOR	During the evolution of the binary system, many physical processes occur, which can influence the orbital angular velocity and the spin angular velocities of the two components, and influence the non-synchronous or synchronous rotation of the system. These processes include the transfer of masses and angular momentums between the component stars, the loss of mass and angular momentum via stellar winds, and the deformation of the structure of component stars. A study of these processes indicates that they are closely related to the combined effects of tide and rotation. This means, to study the synchronous or non-synchronous rotation of binary systems, one has to consider the contributions of different physical processes simultaneously, instead of the tidal effect alone. A way to know whether the rotation of a binary system is synchronous or non-synchronous is to calculate the orbital angular velocity and the spin angular velocities of the component stars. If all of these angular velocities are equal, the rotation of the system is synchronous. If not, the rotation of the system is non-synchronous. For this aim, a series of equations are developed to calculate the orbital and spin angular velocities. The evolutionary calculation of a binary system with masses of 10M (aS (TM)) + 6M (aS (TM)) shows that the transfer of masses and angular momentums between the two components, and the deformation of the components structure in the semidetached or in the contact phase can change the rotation of the system from synchronous into non-synchronous rotation.

Such impacts are especially prevalent in densely populated countries undergoing rapid development, and their effects are felt most strongly where regional fish diversity is high. We reviewed studies of the distribution of freshwater fish species throughout China to map a biogeographical pattern and ascertain the environmental factors contributing to this distribution. We then linked this information to identify geographic areas to be recommended as the focus of conservation efforts. A total of 920 species in 302 genera, 54 families and 21 orders were recorded. Among the recorded species, 73% were Cypriniformes and 12% were Siluriformes. Cyprinidae was the most dominant family with 473 species, followed by Balitoridae with 157 species. The administrative division of the biogeography of China's freshwater fishes consisted of nine regions, including the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Region, Oriental Region, Northwest Region, South Region, Loess Plateau Region, Heilongjiang Region, Upper Yangtze Region, 3H Plain Region and Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain Region. The river system was the primary factor in determining China's freshwater fish biogeography. Under stepwise regression analysis, river discharge was found to be the most influential factor in determining richness, followed by population size and net primary productivity. The higher level of fish endemicity and sensitivity to environmental change led to the identification of Southwest China and the higher areas of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as the primary areas to be considered for fish conservation and potential natural reserves.

The pig is an important domesticated animal, however, pig lincRNAs remain poorly characterized and it is unknown if they were involved in the domestication of the pig. Here, we used available RNA-seq resources derived from 93 samples and expressed sequence tag data sets, and identified 6,621 lincRNA transcripts from 4,515 gene loci. Among the identified lincRNAs, some lincRNA genes exhibit synteny and sequence conservation, including linc-sscg2561, whose gene neighbor Dnmt3a is associated with emotional behaviors. Both linc-sscg2561 and Dnmt3a show differential expression in the frontal cortex between domesticated pigs and wild boars, suggesting a possible role in pig domestication. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of pig lincRNAs.

Under the assumptions that the activation functions only satisfy the so-called extended global Lipschitz condition and the behaved functions only satisfy global Lipschitz condition, we apply linear matrix inequality (LMI) method and homeomorphism theory to propose a new LMI-based sufficient condition for global asymptotic stability of the concerned neural networks. In our results, the extended global Lipschitz condition on the activation functions is less conservative than the assumptions for boundedness and monotonicity and is weaker than the assumption for the general global Lipschitz condition, the global Lipschitz condition on the behaved functions is also less conservative than the assumptions for monotonicity and differentiability in existing papers.

To shed light on the early evolutionary events leading to the assembly of the pathway, we investigated the distributions, domain architectures and phylogenies of component enzymes using a bioinformatic procedure based on Hidden Markov Model profiles. The aro genes for the canonical shikimate pathway had most wider distribution in prokaryotes; and the variant pathway coordinated by 2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threohept-6-ulosonic acid (ADH) synthase and type II 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ) synthase could be identified in most of archaeal species. In addition, the ancient bidirectional horizontal gene transfer events had happened between two prokaryotic domains: Bacteria and Archaea. Besides 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, the phylogenetically distinct subfamilies of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase and chorismate synthase had ever emerged in the evolutionary history of shikimate pathway. These findings provide new insight into the early evolution of the shikimate pathway and advance our understanding of the evolution of metabolic pathways. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Together with earlier studies in Euryodendron and Adinandra, 6 out of 12 genera of Pentaphylacaceae have now been studied for their floral development. The usually pentamerous flowers of these taxa share a number of developmental features: the perianth organs appear in a clockwise or anticlockwise spiral sequence on the floral apex with relatively long plastochrons between successive organs, resulting in conspicuous size differences among perianth organs during early developmental stages. The early development of the usually polystemonous androecium is characterized by an indistinct ring-primordium and a mostly concave floral apex; individual stamens appear subsequently on this ring-primordium. However, further development of the androecium differs conspicuously among taxa and we describe three main developmental patterns for the family including features such as centripetal stamen whorls and stamens fascicles. Unusual features of floral development and organization of Pentaphylacaceae include: (1) a pronounced spiral sequence of organ appearance during early floral development in perianth and androecium; (2) the occurrence of paired organs in the corolla and the androecium of some species; (3) sepals and petals that are positioned opposite from each other in the genera Anneslea and Ternstroemia; and (4) a concave floral apex at the beginning of androecium development. From a systematic point of view our results clearly support a close relationship between Anneslea and Ternstroemia and also suggest a closer relationship among Adinandra, Cleyera, and Euryodendron on the one hand and between Eurya and Visnea on the other. Further, our developmental study stresses the differences between Pentaphylacaceae and Theaceae, which earlier where thought to form a natural group of plants. While high stamen numbers are achieved via centripetal pattern of stamen formation in the former family, stamens are formed centrifugally in the latter.

Plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes in graphene in the presence of a driving electric field	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							TERAHERTZ PLASMON; SEMICONDUCTOR; SUPERLATTICES; DISPERSION; DIFFUSION; SYSTEM; GAS	We present a theoretical study of the plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes induced by intraband electron-electron interaction in graphene in the presence of driving dc electric field. We find that the electric field dependence of these collective excitation modes in graphene differs significantly from that in a conventional two-dimensional electron gas with a parabolic energy spectrum. This is due mainly to the fact that graphene has a linear energy spectrum and the Fermi velocity of electrons in graphene is much larger than the drift velocity of electrons. The obtained results demonstrate that the plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes in graphene can be tuned by applying not only the gate voltage but also the source-to-drain field. The manipulation of plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes by source-to-drain voltage can let graphene be more conveniently applied as an advanced plasmonic material.	[Zhao, C.

It has been believed that the RNASE1 gene duplications are correlated with the plant-feeding adaptation of foregut-fermenting herbivores. Here, we characterized RNASE1 genes from Caniformia, which has a simple digestive system and lacks microbial digestion typical of herbivores, in an unprecedented scope based on both gene sequence and tissue expression analyses. Remarkably, the results yielded new hypotheses regarding the evolution and the function of Caniformia RNASE1 genes. Four independent gene duplication events in the families of superfamily Musteloidea, including Procyonidae, Ailuridae, Mephitidae and Mustelidae, were recovered, rejecting previous Mustelidae-specific duplication hypothesis, but supporting Musteloidea duplication hypothesis. Moreover, our analyses revealed pronounced differences among the RNASE1 gene copies regarding their selection pressures, pI values and tissue expression patterns, suggesting the differences in their physiological functions. Notably, the expression analyses detected the transcription of a RNASE1 pseudogene in several tissues, raising the possibility that pseudogenes are also a potential source during the RNase functional diversification. In sum, the present work demonstrated a far more complex and intriguing evolutionary pattern and functional diversity of mammalian ribonuclease than previously thought.

Given its growing popularity in immunological models, we investigated the structure and function of chemokine CXCL12 protein in tree shrews. We found that CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in tree shrew had structural similarities to their homologous human proteins. Phylogenetic analysis supports the view that tree shrew is evolutionarily-close to the primates. Our results also showed that the human recombinant CXCL12 protein directly enhanced the migration of tree shrew's lymphocytes in vitro, while AMD3100 enhanced the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from bone marrow into peripheral blood in tree shrew in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggested that chemokines in tree shrews may play the same or similar roles as those in humans, and that the tree shrew is a viable animal model for studying human immunological diseases.

A new lobopodian species, Diania cactiformis Liu etal., 2011, was recently reported from the Chengjiang Lagerstatte (south-west China; Cambrian Series 2). This animal was interpreted as bearing arthropod-like articulated appendages and was resolved as the sister taxon to Arthropoda in a cladistic analysis. A reanalysis of the published dataset did not reproduce the phylogenetic placement of D. cactiformis, and the interpretation of its appendage morphology is controversial. New observations on D. cactiformis are made using newly collected material, rejecting the evidence for sclerotized, segmented and articulated appendages; instead the appendages compare more closely to lobopods. The criteria for defining arthropodized appendages are further discussed through comparative studies among fossil lobopodians, anomalocaridids and arthropods. Our study challenges the previous description of anteroposterior orientation, terminal claws and trunk tagmosis as expressed by differentiated anterior and posterior appendages. A synthesis of four recent datasets for lobopodians and stem-group arthropods is used to revisit the phylogeny of stem arthropods. Irrespective of how characters are weighted, D. cactiformis is resolved at a much more basal position to arthropods, indicating that the morphology of this animal's appendages does not fundamentally inform on the evolution of arthropodization.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation confirms the formation of spinel Co3O4 phase. Owing to the mismatch between Co3O4 and substrate, the Co3O4 NRs initially grouped into bundle structure and then formed dispersed NRs. The length of Co3O4 NRs varies from several micrometers up to tens of micrometers with uniform diameter of about 1 mu m. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Characterization demonstrated that the NRs are stacked layer-by-layer from single grains in 50-200 nm. This facile hydrothermal method for preparation of Co3O4 NRs is significant in the synthesis and future applications of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It was observed that large band gaps can be achieved in low frequency regions by adjusting one of the lattice constants. Meanwhile, effects similar to interstitial impurity detects can be achieved with the increase of lattice constant of the phononic crystal. The corresponding defect modes can be stimulated in band gaps. The larger the lattice constant, the stronger the localization effect of defect modes on the wave. In addition, the change of the filling fraction of impurity exerts great influence on the frequency and localization ordered modes. Furthermore, the change of the position of impurity has notable influence On the frequency of defect modes and their localization. However, the geometry structure and orientation of impurity have little effect on the frequency of defect modes and their localization in the band gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the Riemann problem of the isentropic Euler equations for a modified Chaplygin gas is solved analytically. Secondly, it is rigorously shown that, as the pressure vanishes, any two-shock Riemann solution to the isentropic Euler equations for a modified Chaplygin gas tends to a delta-shock solution to the transport equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted delta-measure that forms the delta-shock; any two-rarefaction-wave Riemann solution to the isentropic Euler equations for a modified Chaplygin gas tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations, the nonvacuum intermediate state between the two rarefaction waves tends to a vacuum state. Finally, some numerical results exhibiting the formation of delta-shocks and vacuum states are presented as the pressure decreases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Owing to a lack of proofreading capacity during reverse transcription and a high replication rate, HBV exhibits as quasispecies. To detect the genetic mutations of HBV, many methods with different sensitivities and throughputs were developed. According to documentary records, HBV mutation and evolution were important vial parameters in predicting disease progression and therapeutic outcome. In this review, we separately discussed the correlation between HBV genomic mutations in four open reading frames and liver disease progression. Since some of the results were controversial from different laboratories, it remains to be seen whether functional analyses will confirm their role in modifying the course of infection.

The mixed phases SnO2 nanorods were obtained by calcinations of SnC2O4 synthesized with a chemical precipitation method using SnCl2 center dot 2H(2)0 and PEG 400 as precursors. The resulting nanorods appear as polycrystalline composed of spherical mixed phases SnO2 nanocrystals and have a high surface area. It was observed that the calcination temperature was the key parameter determining the content of the orthorhombic phase. The as-synthesized compounds were used as sensing materials of the sensors of indirect heating structure and tested for their ability to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as isopropanol, acetone, alcohol, and formaldehyde. Gas sensing tests showed that these mixed phases SnO2 nanorods are highly promising for gas sensor applications, as the gas response for isopropanol was significantly enhanced by the presence of orthorhombic phase (S = 61.5 at 1000 ppm isopropanol and response time and recovery time of 4 and 10 s). The as-prepared two phases SnO2 nanorods with the highest content of the orthorhombic phase exhibit excellent gas response, selectivity, and stability toward isopropanol gas at the optimized operating temperature of 255 degrees C. The enhancement in sensitivity is attributed to the presence of small orthorhombic SnO2 crystals with average radius shorther than the Debye screening length of 7 nm for SnO2.

In the autonomous stochastic system with quadratic time-delayed feedback or under positive feedback, the nonlinear delay time fails to possess the role improving the noisy state of the system. In the autonomous stochastic system with cubic time-delayed feedback and under negative feedback, the nonlinear delay time can improve the noisy state, tuning the signal output, and generating incoherence and coherence maximization. We reveal a new kind of anti-coherence and coherence resonance phenomena induced by the nonlinear time delay in the autonomous stochastic system without external periodic force, discussing further the effects of the noise strength, the control parameter, and the feedback strength on anti-coherence and coherence resonance.

In this article, we consider such a design based on rate ratio in the presence of incomplete data. The rate ratio is one of the most frequently used indices in comparing efficiency of two treatments in clinical trials. In this article, we propose 10 confidence-interval estimators for the rate ratio in incomplete matched-pair designs. A hybrid method that recovers variance estimates required for the rate ratio from the confidence limits for single proportions is proposed. It is noteworthy that confidence intervals based on this hybrid method have closed-form solution. The performance of the proposed confidence intervals is evaluated with respect to their exact coverage probability, expected confidence interval width, and distal and mesial noncoverage probability.

It commonly occurs in angiosperm leaves after their initial appearance during the Early Cretaceous. This type of feeding behavior rarely has been documented in pre-Mesozoic fossils. We describe the earliest evidence of insect-skeletonized leaves of Dictyophyllum nathorstii Zeiller, affiliated with the extant fern family Dipteridaceae in the Late Triassic Yipinglang flora from southwestern China. The skeletonization generally is located adjacent to the pinna rachilla of the distal free portion of the leaf. In the skeletonized area, the interveinal tissue is completely removed, exposing the pinna rachilla, pinnule midveins, and lateral veins. Most non-vascular tissue has been removed between the vascular bundles, the latter forming polygonal meshes of varying size. Our report of insect-mediated skeletonization of fern leaves from southwestern China fills a spatiotemporal gap in the published data on the paleogeographical distribution and stratigraphic occurrence of plant-arthropod associations, and indicates an antagonistic relationship between a fern host and its insect herbivore.

Standard monitoring measures (tourist surveys and counting and tracking techniques) are not sufficient to accomplish this task, in particular for off-road travel. This article predicts tourists' spatial use patterns through an alternative approach: park accessibility measurement. Naismith's rule and geographical information system's anisotropic cost analysis are integrated into the modeling process, which results in a more realistic measure of off-road accessibility than that provided by other measures. The method is applied to a mountainous United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in northwest Yunnan Province, China, where there is increasing concern about potential impacts of unregulated tourist use. Based on the assumption that accessibility tends to attract more tourists, a spatial pattern of predicted off-road use by tourists is derived. This pattern provides information that can help park managers develop strategies that are effective for both tourism management and species conservation.

In the study, a PT gene 1632 bp long (named BePT) was cloned, identified, and functionally characterized from Boletus edulis. BePT was expected to encode a polypeptide with 543 amino acid residues. The BePT polypeptide belonged to the major facilitator superfamily and showed a high degree of sequence identity to the Pht1 family. A topology model revealed that BePT exhibited 12 transmembrane helices, divided into two halves, and connected by a large hydrophilic loop in the middle. A yeast mutant complementation analysis suggested that BePT was a functional PT which mediated orthophosphate uptake of yeast at micromolar concentrations. Green fluorescent protein BePT fusion proteins expressed Were extensively restricted to the plasma membrane in BePT transformed yeast, and its activity was dependent on electrochemical membrane potential. In vitro, quantitative PCR confirmed that the expression of BePT was significantly upregulated at lower phosphorus availability, which may enhance phosphate uptake and transport under phosphate starvation. Our results suggest that BePT plays a key role in phosphate acquisition in the ectomycorrhizal fungus B. edulis. (C) 2014 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The feasibility of using the layered device in antenna protection is also investigated. Full-wave simulation is carried out for verification.

The associations between plant sexual systems and morphology are unique, for example, the subnival belt of the Hengduan Mountains has harsh climatic conditions, but hosts remarkable biodiversity. However, these associations have received surprisingly little attention. We analyzed the associations in this region, and compared the pattern of sexual systems with that of other floras, and we also reviewed the breeding system of 36 alpine species. Information on plant sexual systems and these traits were mainly based on published information, herbarium collections, and field observations. The results showed that there was a high proportion of hermaphroditic species and a low proportion of dioecious and monoecious species. Hermaphroditism was strongly associated with showy floral displays, specialist entomophily, and perennial forbs. Dioecy was strongly associated with inconspicuous, pale-colored flowers, anemophily, and shrubs, whereas monoecy was strongly associated with inconspicuous, pale-colored flowers, generalist entomophily, and perennial grasses. Although no association was found between sexual systems and fruit type, plants with dry fruits (98.1%) were predominant in our study region. With respect to the plant breeding systems in the alpine region of southwest China, we predicted that pollination service might be particularly low; most of the plants lacked enough outcrossing pollinators. Our data revealed that 97.1% of the hermaphroditic species were self-compatible, and 88.2% of them showed autonomous or facilitated selfing. The plant sexual systems identified might serve to optimize the probability of pollination and thus ensure reproductive success.

It covers correspondingly wide geological, topographical, and climatic gradients, and thus hosts greater biodiversity than surrounding lowlands and other high elevation regions. Due to its extreme environmental and biological diversity, the QTP is an ideal region for studying adaptations of plant species under harsh environmental conditions at multiple evolutionary levels. Many recent ecological studies have revealed functions of distinctive morphological features of various plants in the region that improve their reproductive success. Examples include large and showy bracts, hairy inflorescences, and drooping flowers. Numerous other investigations have examined QTP plants' sexual systems, patterns of biomass allocations, and biotic interactions.

The structural and morphological characterizations of the products were performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). La(OH)(3) nanorods were shape-preserved transformed to La2O2CO3 nanorods at 400 degrees C for 2 h. TEM images indicate that the as-obtained La2O2CO3 entirely consists of uniform nanorods in high yield with diameter of 13-15 nm and length of 100-150 nm. The indirect-heating sensor using La2O2CO3 nanorods as sensitive material was fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. The sensing properties of the sensor based on La2O2CO3 nanorods were investigated. It is shown that the sensor exhibits high gas response for CO2 gas at operating temperature of 325 degrees C, making it to be potential candidate for practical detectors for CO2 gas.

The kinetically controlled products 4 could be synthesized within 1 h but would irreversibly transform to thermodynamically controlled products 5 over an additional 5 h. At the same time, the transformative synthesis of 5a from 4a by controlling the oxygen or nitrogen proved the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, the DFT calculation also corroborated that the stability of products 5 are a 100,000 times more thermodynamically stable than products 4. Finally, the origin of the greater stability of 5 could be explained by the reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis, which hinted that the crucial factors are the formation of a new intramolecular hydrogen bond and the release of the steric effect of the crowded rings. In conclusion, this novel synthetic strategy offers an alternative method using thermodynamic or kinetic control for regioselective construction of biologically meaningful fused pyrrole architectures from, a concise, rapid, and environmentally friendly vision.

It is a challenge for the scheduler to organize available resources efficiently and to allocate them for parallel advance reservation jobs with deadline constraint appropriately. This paper provides a slot-based data structure to organize available resources of multiprocessor systems in a way that enables efficient search and update operations and formulates a suite of scheduling policies to allocate resources for dynamically arriving advance reservation requests. The performance of the scheduling algorithms were investigated by simulations with different job sizes and durations, system loads, and scheduling flexibilities. Simulation results show that job sizes and durations, system load and the flexibility of scheduling will impact the performance metrics of all the scheduling algorithms, and the algorithm becomes the best algorithm for the scheduler with the highest acceptance rate of advance reservation requests, and the jobs with the algorithm experience the lowest average slowdown. The data structure and scheduling policies can be used to organize and allocate resources for parallel advance reservation jobs with deadline constraint in large-scale computing systems.

The PL spectrum of MPSiNWs obtained from the oxidized silicon wafers show a large blue-shift, which can be attributed to the deep Q. C. effect induced by numerous mesoporous structures. The effects of HF and AgNO3 concentration on formation of SiNWs were carefully investigated. The results indicate that the higher HF concentration is favorable to the growth of SiNWs, and the density of SiNWs is significantly reduced when Ag+ ions concentrations are too high. The deposition behaviors of Ag+ ions on oxidized and unoxidized silicon surface were studied. According to the experimental results, a model was proposed to explain the formation mechanism of porous SiNWs by etching the oxidized starting silicon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, eukaryotic microorganisms in hypersaline samples were investigated by 454 pyrosequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene libraries. In total, 4,645, 1,677, and 5,912 reads were obtained from ITS libraries of waterlogged samples, salt crusts, and saline loess from the alkaline Huama Lake in Shaanxi, China. Analyses of pyrosequencing data revealed that the dominant genera were Dunaliella, Alternaria and Chlamydomonas, which dominated the microbial assemblages in the waterlogged sediments, the salt crusts and the saline loess from the lake banks, respectively. The various infrequent species were not commonly shared by the three types of samples, demonstrating that the eukaryotic microbial compositions of the different environments were distinct. However, the micro-eukaryotic assemblages associated with similar environmental conditions shared some components and were phylogenetically related. The eukaryotic microbial community composition was correlated with the pH value of the site (p = 0.001; r(2) = 0.99), but not with the concentration of total nitrogen or the inorganic ions investigated in this study. The results of this study demonstrated that the hypersaline ecosystems hosted surprisingly diverse eukaryotic microbial community.

Cells of strain YIM 78007(T) were observed to be aerobic and short rod-shaped. The colonies were observed to be orange-red, convex and circular. 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain YIM 78007(T) clustered with members of the genus Roseomonas (with similarities from 97.2 to 92.2 %). Optimal growth of strain YIM 78007 occurs at 40-50 A degrees C and pH 8.0-10.0. The predominant ubiquinone was identified as Q-10 and the major fatty acids were identified as C-18:1 omega 7c and C-16:0. The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified aminolipids and one unknown phospholipid. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 63 mol %. The levels of DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness between strain YIM 78007(T) and its closet neighbours (Roseomonas lacus JCM 13283(T) and Roseomonas terrae JCM 14592(T)) were well below the threshold required for the proposal of a novel species. The results of physiological and biochemical characteristics, the phylogenetic analysis, as well as low DNA-DNA hybridization values, allowed the phenotypic and genotypic differentiation of strain YIM 78007(T) from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Therefore, strain YIM 78007(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Roseomonas, for which the name Roseomonas alkaliterrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78007(T) (=BCRC 80644(T) = JCM 19656(T)).

Graphene Sandwiches as a Platform for Broadband Molecular Spectroscopy	ACS PHOTONICS			English	Article						broadband sensing; infrared spectroscopy; graphene plasmons; plasmonic sensing	PLASMONICS; PHOTONICS	Sensing is to date one of the most successful applications of surface plasmons thanks to the exceptional field amplification and sensitivity of these modes in metallic nanostructures. Here we introduce a promising detection scheme based on the propagation of strongly confined antibonding plasmons supported by graphene sandwiches. Instead of measuring changes in the refractive index or enhancing a restricted number of molecular absorption lines, the proposed device can recover an extended portion of the infrared spectrum of a molecule. Moreover, the extreme compression of light in graphene means that a diluted 2 nm-thick analyte can cause up to 3 dB intensity changes. The broadband capability and sensitivity also imply that one can easily identify different chemicals in a mixture and extract their respective concentration. We conclude by presenting a simple experimental setup based on this mechanism for infrared spectroscopy that could become a cheap Fourier transform infrared accessory and an alternative to crystal-based attenuated total reflection spectroscopy.

Morphology and structure of the pores are characterized by SEM and AFM. Results show that a large area of defect-free polystyrene (PS) monolayer film can be obtained when the volume ratio of PS solution to methanol solution is 9: 11. A larger volume ratio or a smaller volume ratio will induce similar bilayer structure and defects (point and line) in the PS film, respectively. The lateral size and depth of the nanopore will increase with the etching time, and its morphology will change from circular to inverted pyramid type gradually. But the orderly arranged structure will be destroyed as the etching time is over 10 min. On the other hand, ordered Ge/Si nanoislands and nanorings will be grown on nanopore-patterned Si (100) substrates (inverted pyramid and circular nanopores, respectively) by ion beam sputtering. In addition, reasonable interpretations have been proposed for the formation mechanism of the ordered Ge/Si nanostructure.

Causes of the new phenomenon were analyzed tentatively from the perspective of ecology. It was pointed out that ecological degradation of Eucalyptus plantation and strong invasiveness of A. adenophora are two apparent reasons for formation of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora complex system. Basic view of the authors on causes of the new phenomenon was put forward that resistance unbalance between chemical defensive potential of Eucalyptus trees and chemical invasive potential of A. adenophora might be the fundamental reason for formation of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora complex system, based on the two apparent reasons respectively connected with allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora as dominant species of the complex system. Some proofs from studies on chemical components and biological activities of Eucalyptus species and A. adenophora have proved the basic view of the authors. It was discussed that formation of the complex system would influence some environmental elements such as soil environment, hydrology environment, and biology environment. It was proposed that three key scientific issues, namely chemical mechanism of formation of the complex system, ecological effects of formation of the complex system, and succession trends and impact factors of the complex system should be mainly studied as special researches to probe ecological relationship of exotic species because of absence study on the complex system and objective requirements of production practice in future. It was emphasized that the proposed researches might be of guidance significance to scientific management and sustainable operation of Eucalyptus plantation under the condition of biological invasion.

With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.	[Kondolf, G.

In this work, cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.) were used as biotemplate to synthesize titania structure. The synthesized titania sample had similar morphology to that of the original template in spite of the fragile unicellular structures and extremely high water content of cyanobacterial cells. Incorporation of biogenic C, as well as the morphology inherited from biotemplate improved visible-light absorbance of the titania structure. The sample exhibited higher visible-light photocatalytic activity than commercial titania photocatalyst Degussa P25 for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. Compared with those C-doped titania photocatalysts prepared by other methods, cyanobacteria templated titania photocatalyst offer some potential for competitive advantages. The reported strategy opened up a new use for the cyanobacteria. It could also be used for titania in applications such as treatment of polluted water, dye-sensitized solar cells, or other regions.

After the Ti3+ doping, the reduced TiO2 sample exhibits a wide visible-light absorption ranged from 400 nm to 800 rim. The intrinsic hollow core-shell microstructure can make multiple reflections of light within the chamber, and thus results in more efficient use of the light source compared with solid structure. Besides, the large surface area can render the sample with a high activity. Therefore, Ti3+ self-doped yolk-shell structure titanium oxide exhibits a superior photocatalytic activity under visible light. This strategy is simple, cheap and mass-productive, which may shed light on a new avenue for large scale production of self-doped yolk-shell structural nano functional materials for catalyst, sensors, energy storage and other new applications.

Tibetan Mastiff (TM), a native of the Tibetan Plateau, was derived from the domesticated Chinese native dog and, like Tibetans, has adapted to the extreme environment of high altitude. Here, we genotyped genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 32 TMs and compared them with SNPs from 20 Chinese native dogs and 14 gray wolves (Canis lupus). We identified 16 genes with signals of positive selection in the TM, with 12 of these candidate genes associated with functions that have roles in adaptation to high-altitude adaptation, such as EPAS1, SIRT7, PLXNA4, and MAFG that have roles in responses to hypoxia. This study provides important information on the genetic diversity of the TM and potential mechanisms for adaptation to hypoxia.

Statistical analysis system (SAS) 8.1 was used to analyze the nucleoside data. The pattern of nucleoside distribution was analyzed in the sampled populations of C. cicadae, O. sinensis and C. militaris, using descriptive statistical analysis, nested analysis and Q cluster analysis. The total amount of the 10 nucleosides in coremium was 1,463.89-5,678.21 mu g/g in 10 populations of C. cicadae, 1,369.80-3,941.64 mu g/g in sclerotium. The average contents of the 10 analytes were 4,392.37 mu g/g and 3,016.06 mu/g in coremium and sclerotium, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) of nucleosides ranged from 8.36% to 112.36% in coremium of C. cicadae, and from 10.77% to 155.87% in sclerotium of C. cicadae. The CV of the nucleosides was wide within C. cicadae populations. The nested variation analysis by the nine nucleosides' distribution indicated that about 42.29% of the nucleoside variability in coremium was attributable to the differentiation among populations, and the remaining 57.71% resided in the populations. It was also shown that about 28.94% of the variation in sclerotium was expressed between populations, while most of the variation (71.06%) corresponded to the populations.

Improvement of response to formaldehyde at Ag-LaFeO3 based gas sensors through incorporation of SWCNTs	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						Gas sensor; LaFeO3; Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Formaldehyde	CARBON NANOTUBES; SENSITIVITY; TRANSISTORS	The LaFeO3 modified by silver (Ag-LaFeO3) further modified by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs-Ag-LaFeO3) with different weight ratio were prepared using a sol-gel method combined with the microwave chemical synthesis. The phase structures and micro-morphology of SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. Indirect-heating sensors using SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3 sensitive materials were fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. Gas-sensing characteristic of SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3 to formaldehyde was investigated. It is found that the structure of SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3 is of orthogonal perovskite. The gas-sensing properties of the Ag-LaFeO3 sample modified by SWCNTs with 0.75% weight ratio (0.75%SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3) are the best. The response of 0.75%SWCNT5-Ag-LaFeO3 powder to 0.5 ppm formaldehyde is 23 at 86 degrees C. The detect limit to formaldehyde is 0.2 ppm. The response and recovery times are 6s and 20s, respectively. Those good properties make them the promising candidates for practical detectors to formaldehyde. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, Y. M.; Zhang, J.; Zhu, Z. Q.; Liu, Q.

Biomass accumulation, BG:AG ratio, and the starch content of both species generally decreased with increasing burial depth and burial time, except for higher biomass accumulation in P. arundinacea in the first month. In the first month, adventitious roots of both species, and first-order laterals of P. arundinacea, were shorter and thicker in the buried plants than in the controls. The ADH activity in both species and the soluble sugar content of P. arundinacea increased with increasing burial depth in the first month. Only the diameter of adventitious roots and the soluble sugar content of P. arundinacea were affected by burial depth after two or three months. It is concluded that P. arundinacea is more tolerant to sedimentation than M. sacchariflorus due to more efficient acclimation strategies in root morphology, and soluble sugar content. However, the ability to acclimate becomes weaker over time due to consistently decreasing starch content and the trade-off between tolerance to sedimentation and plant growth.

The effects of H2O2 concentration on the nanostructure of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were investigated. The experimental results indicate that porous structure can be introduced by the addition of H2O2 and the pore structure could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of H2O2. The H2O2 species replaces Ag+ as the oxidant and the Ag nanoparticles work as catalyst during the etching. And the concentration of H2O2 influences the nucleation and motility of Ag particles, which leads to formation of different porous structure within the nanowires. A mechanism based on the lateral etching which is catalyzed by Ag particles under the motivation by H2O2 reduction is proposed to explain the PSiNWs formation.

Traditionally, the coherent effect of two identical point sources only takes place when the optical path is an integer number of wavelengths. In this paper, we show that mu and epsilon near zero (MENZ) metamaterials can be used to realize a perfectly constructive and isotropic interference. No matter how many point sources are embedded in the MENZ region, the wavefronts overlap perfectly. This translates into a total relaxation of the conventional condition for coherence enabled by the apparent infinite wavelength of the fields within MENZ metamaterials. Furthermore, we investigate crucial parameters such as the shape and size of the MENZ region. We demonstrate that flat sided geometries give rise to constructive interference beams serving as a powerful design mean. We also reveal the importance of relying on deeply sub-wavelength MENZ volumes as larger sizes increase the impedance and therefore reduce the output power of the device. The proposed concepts bear significance for current trends in antenna design which are inspired by the recent developments of electromagnetic metamaterials. Moreover, the perfect coherence effect can be appealing for power combiners, especially in the terahertz where sources are dim, as the irradiation intensity scales with the square of the number of embedded sources.

However, convergent morphological evolution and rapid species radiation result in much ambiguity in the group. Further, matrilineal (mtDNA) genealogies conflict with trees based on nuclear DNA retrotransposable elements. Herein, we analyze 39 nearly complete mitochondrial genomes (three new) and up to seven nuclear DNA segments. We combine these multiple unlinked, more informative genetic markers to infer historical relationships of the major groups of phasianids. The nuclear DNA tree is largely congruent with the tree derived from mt genomes. However, branching orders of mt/nuclear trees largely conflict with those based on retrotransposons. For example, Gallus/Bambusicola/Francolinus forms the sister-group of Coturnix/Alectoris in the nuclear/mtDNA trees, yet the tree based on retrotransposable elements roots the former at the base of the tree and not with the latter. Further, while peafowls cluster with Gallus/Coturnix in the mt tree, they root at the base of the phasianids following Gallus in the tree based on retrotransposable elements. The conflicting branch orders in nuclear/mtDNA and retrotransposons-based trees in our study reveal the complex topology of the Phasianidae.

By simply tuning the etching time, the colloid shape evolves from nanotubes to partially collapsed nanotubes and porous nanorods. The microstructure and chemical composition of the etched hydrophobically modified halloysite are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectrophotometer and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The results indicate the interior Al2O3 can be controlled etched. Labeling experiments demonstrate the hydrophilic nanoparticles are predominantly located onto the coarse region of the etched nanotubes. Selective etching of hydrophobically modified halloysite creates Janus nanotubes with a hydrophobic exterior surface and a hydrophilic interior surface. An enhanced capacity for emulsification of the Janus nanotubes toward immiscible mixture is shown. Furthermore, by a favorable growth of other functional materials, composition of the Janus nanotubes can be further extended, enabling different applications from magnetic separation to water purification, drug immobilization and controlled release.

In this Letter, non-associative star products in trimodal iterative dynamical systems are considered. As the left and right operations have different effects, right-associative star products break the conventional Feigenbaum's metric universality. Through high precision parallel computation, it is found that period-p-tupling bifurcation processes described by right-associative star products exhibit a superconvergent universality of double exponential form.

The distribution of genetic diversity of T. gondii in cats is of importance to understand the transmission of this parasite. The objective of this study was to genetically characterize T. gondii isolates from cats in Yunnan province, southwestern China. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 5-10 g cat tissue samples (brain, tongue, heart, and liver). Using multilocous polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology, we determined genetic diversity of T. gondii isolates from cats in Yunnan province. Result: In total, 175 stray cats were tested for T. gondii DNA, respectively, 44 (25.14%) of which were found to be positive for the T. gondii B1 gene by PCR amplification. The positive DNA samples were typed at 11 genetic markers, including 10 nuclear markers, namely, SAG1, 5 '-3 ' SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, GRA6, L358, PK1, BTUB, c22-8, c29-2 and an apicoplast locus Apico. Of these, 16 isolates from cats were genotyped with data for more than 9 loci, revealed 5 genotypes in total, of which 11 of 16 samples were identified as ToxoDB#9, two samples may belong to genotye #225, one was Type II, one was ToxoDB#3 , and one was ToxoDB#20 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/). Conclusions: The results of the present study indicated a wide distribution of T. gondii infection in cats in Yunnan province, which may pose significant public health concerns. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of T. gondii prevalence and genotypes in cats in southwestern China, and the first report of Type II T. gondii from cats in China.

AN MHD MODEL FOR MAGNETAR GIANT FLARES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instabilities; magnetic reconnection; magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); stars: flare; stars: magnetic field; stars: neutron	CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; CRUSTAL PLATE-TECTONICS; SOFT GAMMA-REPEATERS; X-RAY PULSAR; FLUX-ROPE MODELS; SOLAR ERUPTIONS; NEUTRON-STARS; SGR 1900+14; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; RADIATIVE MECHANISM	Giant flares on soft gamma-ray repeaters that are thought to take place on magnetars release enormous energy in a short time interval. Their power can be explained by catastrophic instabilities occurring in the magnetic field configuration and the subsequent magnetic reconnection. By analogy with the coronal mass ejection events on the Sun, we develop a theoretical model via an analytic approach for magnetar giant flares. In this model, the rotation and/or displacement of the crust causes the field to twist and deform, leading to flux rope formation in the magnetosphere and energy accumulation in the related configuration. When the energy and helicity stored in the configuration reach a threshold, the system loses its equilibrium, the flux rope is ejected outward in a catastrophic way, and magnetic reconnection helps the catastrophe develop to a plausible eruption. By taking SGR 1806-20 as an example, we calculate the free magnetic energy released in such an eruptive process and find that it is more than 10(47) erg, which is enough to power a giant flare. The released free magnetic energy is converted into radiative energy, kinetic energy, and gravitational energy of the flux rope. We calculated the light curves of the eruptive processes for the giant flares of SGR 1806-20, SGR 0526-66, and SGR 1900+14, and compared them with the observational data. The calculated light curves are in good agreement with the observed light curves of giant flares.	[Meng, Y.; Lin, J.; Zhang, Q.

Extensive material from the Burgess Shale provides a detailed picture of its morphology and ontogeny, but the fossil record outside this lagerstatte is scarce, and complete wiwaxiids are particularly rare. Here we report small articulated specimens ofWiwaxia foliosa sp. nov. from the Xiaoshiba fauna (Cambrian Stage 3, Hongjingshao Formation, Kunming, south China). Although spines are absent, the fossils' sclerites - like those of W. corrugata - are symmetrically arranged in five distinct zones. They form rows across the body, and were individually added and shed throughout growth to retain an approximately symmetrical body shape. Their development pattern suggests a molluscan affinity. The basic body plan of wiwaxiids is fundamentally conserved across two continents through Cambrian Stages 3-5 - revealing morphological stasis in the wake of the Cambrian explosion.

The basic properties of the resin and bonding strength of bonded plywood panels were tested. The reaction mechanism of the addition of G to MMU was investigated theoretically at the BLYP/DND/COSMO level of quantum chemistry using density functional theory (DFT) method. The results showed that the addition reaction of G with MMU under weakly acidic conditions mainly involves the reactions of MMU with protonated glyoxal (p-G), protonated 2,2-dihydroxyacetaldehyde (p-G1), and protonated bis-hemidiol (p-G2) to form the two important reactive carbocation intermediates C-p-G MMU and C-p-G1-MMU and the two important hydroxyl compounds N-p-G-MMU and N-p-G1-MMU. The G-MMU resin was characterized by FTIR and C-13 NMR spectroscopies, and the results were found to be quite compatible with those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, polycondensation reactions for G-MMU resin are proposed.

Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) belongs to the genus Streptomyces and exhibited 99.51 and 97.37% similarity to Streptomyces sedi YIM 65188(T) and Streptomyces specialis GW41-1564(T), respectively, whereas low similarity values (<97%) distinguished strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) from all other species of the genus Streptomyces with validly published names. Two tree-making algorithms also supported the position that strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) formed a distinct clade with Streptomyces sedi YIM 65188T and Streptomyces specialis GW41-1564(T). However, levels of DNA DNA relatedness between strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) and Streptomyces sedi YIM 65188(T) and Streptomyces specialis GW41-1564(T) were 45.59 and 31.90%, respectively. A comparative study between strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) and the type strains of closest related species of the genus Streptomyces revealed that it differed from them in morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. Therefore, strain NEAU-LZS-5(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces zhaozhouensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-LZS-5(T) (=CGMCC 4.7095(T)=DSM 42101(T)).

The synthesis route had a good reproducible and high yield up to 99.2%. The morphology of ZnO structures could be tuned by changing the quality of NaBH4 and the reaction temperature rather than using surfactants. Detailed structural observation showed that spindle ZnO structure was assembled by thin layer sheets. ZnO spindles self-assembled into flowers while increasing the quantity of NaBH4. The prepared ZnO structures were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.

We consider an exponential tilting model for the nonignorably missing mechanism, and propose modified estimating equations by imputing missing data through a kernel regression method. We establish some asymptotic properties of the maximum EL estimators of the unknown parameters under different scenarios. With the use of auxiliary information, the maximum EL estimators are statistically more efficient. Simulation studies are used to assess the finite sample performance of our proposed maximum EL estimators. We apply the proposed maximum EL estimators to investigate a data set on earnings obtained from the New York Social Indicators Survey.

It is well known that the resulting estimates and tests may be sensitive to these assumptions as well as to outlying observations. In this paper, we introduce various perturbations to modeling assumptions and individual observations, and then develop a formal sensitivity analysis to assess these perturbations in the Bayesian analysis of statistical models with missing data. We develop a geometric framework, called the Bayesian perturbation manifold, to characterize the intrinsic structure of these perturbations. We propose several intrinsic influence measures to perform sensitivity analysis and quantify the effect of various perturbations to statistical models. We use the proposed sensitivity analysis procedure to systematically investigate the tenability of the non-ignorable missing at random (MNAR) assumption. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate our methods, and a dataset is analyzed to illustrate the use of our diagnostic measures.

The activation energy of 496 kJ/mol was calculated by a hyperbolic-sine type equation over the entire range of strain rates and temperatures. In order to obtain optimum hot working conditions, processing maps consisting of power dissipation map and instability map were constructed at different strains. The power dissipation map exhibits two domains with relatively high efficiencies of power dissipation. The first domain occurs in the temperature range of 990-1,070 degrees C and the strain rate range of 0.01-0.1 s(-1). Microstructure observation in this domain indicates the partial dynamic recrystallization (DRX) accompanied with precipitation of tetragonal sigma phase. The second domain occurs in the temperature range of 1,140-1,200 degrees C and the strain rate range of 0.01-1 s(-1) with a peak efficiency of power dissipation of 39%, and in this domain, the microstructure observation reveals the full DRX. The instability map shows that flow instability occurs at the temperatures below 1,140 degrees C and the strain rates above 0.1 s(-1).

Within the tailored parameter regime, the diffusion coefficient evolving after a considerably long time develops a sharp peak closely related to the inflection points of the mean velocity upon an increase of the damping constant. The diffusion peak here depends on the super diffusion motion of the particle. Also, negative velocity (for a positive bias) depending on the subdiffusive motion, i.e. dispersionless transport in the asymptotic long time limit, is obtained. Moreover, an enhancement of diffusion phenomenon can be observed. These results may be helpful for separating particles under some conditions by adjusting the external forces applied.

Recently, Pir proteins have become increasingly used as anchor proteins in yeast cell surface display systems. These display systems are classified into three types: N-terminal fusion, C-terminal fusion, and inserted fusion. In addition to the GPI (glycosylphosphatidyl inositol) and the FL/FS anchor proteins, these three Pir-based systems significantly increase the choices for target proteins to be displayed. Furthermore, Pir proteins can also be used as a fusion partner for target proteins to be effectively secreted into culture medium. Here, we summarize the development and application of Pir proteins as anchor proteins.

The structures of the new compounds were determined by analyses of their NMR, MS, electronic circular dichroism, and X-ray diffraction data. The esterification at C-25 by 4-hydroxyphenylpropanoic acid and the hydroxylation at C-2' are unique in this unusual class of natural products. In addition to the known cytotoxicity, an array of biological activities, including antifeedant, nematicidal, antifungal, and NO and AChE inhibitory activities, were observed for this class of compounds. These findings suggested that dichapetalin hybrid triterpenoids as a class have broad biologically active cellular functions including defense against insect herbivores and pathogens.

J	Yan, DH; Zeng, HD; Zhang, L				Yan, Dahai; Zeng, Houdun; Zhang, Li			The physical properties of Fermi BL Lac objects jets	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; galaxies: active; galaxies: jets	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; GAMMA-RAY EMISSION; EMITTING ELECTRONS; MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS; STOCHASTIC ACCELERATION; COMPTON ANALYSIS; BLAZAR; RADIATION; MODEL; VARIABILITY	We investigate the physical properties of BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) jets by modelling the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 Fermi BL Lacs in the frame of a simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. We obtained the best-fitting model parameters and their uncertainties for each BL Lac through the chi(2)-minimization procedure and discussed their implications on the physical processes. The modelling results show that the one-zone SSC model can successfully fit the SEDs of high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (IBLs), but fails to explain the SEDs of low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. The statistical analysis results for model parameters are summarized as follows. (1) No correlation is found between magnetic field (B) and the broken energy of relativistic electrons distribution (gamma'(b)) for HBLs and IBLs, but there are inverse correlations between gamma'(b) and the radius of emitting blob (R'(b)) as well as the electrons number K'(e) for HBLs and IBLs. It is therefore concluded that the variation of gamma'(b) is mainly caused by that of R'(b) rather than B for HBLs and IBLs. (2) The Poynting flux in jets cannot account for the observed radiations since the power in Poynting flux is smaller than the radiative power, and the cold protons could be the primary energy carrier in the jets.

An exceptionally preserved arthropod cardiovascular system from the early Cambrian	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CIRCULATORY-SYSTEM; BURGESS SHALE; FUNCTIONAL-MORPHOLOGY; HEAD; CRUSTACEA; EUARTHROPODS; ORGANIZATION; MALACOSTRACA; FUXIANHUIA; CHILOPODA	The assumption that amongst internal organs of early arthropods only the digestive system withstands fossilization is challenged by the identification of brain and ganglia in early Cambrian fuxianhuiids and megacheirans from southwest China. Here we document in the 520-million-year-old Chengjiang arthropod Fuxianhuia protensa an exceptionally preserved bilaterally symmetrical organ system corresponding to the vascular system of extant arthropods. Preserved primarily as carbon, this system includes a broad dorsal vessel extending through the thorax to the brain where anastomosing branches overlap brain segments and supply the eyes and antennae. The dorsal vessel provides segmentally paired branches to lateral vessels, an arthropod ground pattern character, and extends into the anterior part of the abdomen. The addition of its vascular system to documented digestive and nervous systems resolves the internal organization of F. protensa as the most completely understood of any Cambrian arthropod, emphasizing complexity that had evolved by the early Cambrian.

The influence of three different ancillary ligands, namely acetylacetonato (acac), picolinate (pic) and pyridyl-1,2,4-triazolyl (pytrz), on phosphorescence quantum efficiency and excimer emission is examined. Pt(II) compounds with a p-Bptrz ligand consistently emit a blue-green color with an emission wavelength= 490-500 nm while those with a m-Bptrz ligand emit a blue color with (em) = 450-460 nm and a quantum efficiency as high as 0.97. In addition to the blue monomer emission peak, Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds display an excimer emission peak at approximate to 550 nm in a solid matrix whose intensity is dependent on the substituent group on pytrz and the doping concentration. As a result of the monomer and excimer emission, bright white phosphorescence is observed for several members of Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds. Intramolecular CHN hydrogen bonds are found to play an important role in the high stability and high phosphorescent quantum efficiency of Pt(m-Bptrz)(pytrz) compounds. Single-dopant blue and white electrophosphorescent devices using Pt(m-Bptrz)(CF3-pytrz-Me) or Pt(m-Bptrz)(t-Bu-pytrz-Me) as the emitter are successfully fabricated. White electroluminesencedevices with external quantum efficiency of 15.6% and CIE (xy) of 0.31, 0.44 are achieved.

J	Yu, H; Fang, J; Zhang, L				Yu Huan; Fang Jun; Zhang Li			Hadronic Scenarios for Gamma-Ray Emission from Three Supernova Remnants Interacting with Molecular Clouds	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							DIFFUSIVE SHOCK ACCELERATION; COSMIC-RAYS; COINCIDENT; PARTICLES; OVERTAKEN; TORNADO; NEBULA; WAVES; EYE; W44	GeV gamma-rays detected with the large area telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope in the direction of IIB21, MSII 17-39 and G337.0-0.1 have been recently reported. The three supernova remnants (SNRs) show interactions with molecular clouds, and they are effective gamma-ray emitters as the relativistic protons accelerated by the SNR shocks inelastically colliding with the dense gas in the clouds. The origin of the observed gamma-rays for the three remnants is investigated in the scenario of the diffusive shock acceleration. In the model, a part of the SNR shock transmits into the nearby molecular clouds, and the shock velocity is greatly reduced. As a result, a shock with a relatively low Alfven Mach number is generated, and the spectra of the accelerated protons and the gamma-ray photons produced via proton-proton interaction can be obtained. The results show that the observed gamma-ray spectra for the three SNRs interacting with the molecular clouds can be reproduced. It can be concluded that the hadronic origin of the gamma-rays for the three SNRs is approved, and the ability of SNR shocks to accelerate protons is also supported.

Focusing on representing the associations of behaviors and the corresponding uncertainties, we propose the method for constructing a Markov network (MN) from the results of frequent pattern mining, called item-associative Markov network (IAMN), where nodes and edges represent the frequent patterns and their associations respectively. We further discuss the properties of a probabilistic graphical-model to guarantee the IAMN's correctness theoretically. Then, we adopt the concept of chordal to reflect the closeness of nodes in the IAMN. Adopting the algorithm for constructing join trees from an MN, we give the algorithm for IAMN-based associative categorization by hierarchical bottom-up aggregations of nodes. Experimental results show-the effectiveness, efficiency and correctness of our methods.

It possesses dichotomous axes, linear and smooth sterile leaves, rhomboidal leaf cushions with ligule pits and oval-oblanceolate leaf scars, and terminal sterile shoots or probable megasporangiate strobili. Leaves may have been persistent or not. Leaf cushions or bases bearing a ridge are helically arranged in parastichies on wide axes. Smooth megasporophylls with vertically expanded base borne in helices include a pedicel, a heel and an upturned linear lamina. The pedicel consists of a distinct keel and horizontal alations and the lamina has the distal part reflexed abaxially. A single ellipsoidal and sessile megasporangium occurs on the adaxial side of the pedicel and produces Lagenicula-type megaspores with delicate spines. Changxingia may be assigned to the Dichostrobiles of the Isoetales sensu lato and is compared with related taxa of the Late Palaeozoic. Fertile units (megasporophyll-sporangium complexes) are interpreted to have functioned as spore dispersal units. Heterosporous lycopsids with monosporangiate strobili are scarce in the Devonian, and Changxingia thus contributes to understanding of their early evolutionary history and megaspore dispersal mechanisms.

A perturbation manifold is defined. The metric tensor is employed to select an appropriate perturbation vector. Several Bayesian local influence measures are proposed to quantify the degree of various perturbations to statistical models based on the first and second-order approximations to the objective functions including the phi-divergence, the posterior mean distance and 'Bayes factor. We develop two Bayesian case influence measures to detect the influential observations in GPLMMs based on the phi-divergence and Cook's posterior mean distance. The computationally feasible formulae for Bayesian influence analysis are given. Several simulation studies and a real example are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies.

J	Chen, SH; Chen, ZW				Chen, Shi-Hao; Chen, Ziwei			Electron-photon backscattering lasers	LASER PHYSICS			English	Article						lasers; photon-electron backscattering; coherent conditions; free-electron lasers		In this work a scheme is investigated such that a laser with its wavelength lambda(f) is produced by backscattering of incident laser with its wavelength lambda(i) and an incident electron beam with its velocity v(0) passing through a magnetic field with its period lambda(W). According to the scheme, the coherent conditions are n lambda(f) = (c/v(0) - 1) lambda(W),lambda(W) = l lambda(i) = lm lambda(f) and s < (1 + v(0)/c) lambda(i)/4, where s is the longitudinal length of an effective backscattering region, n, l and m are integers. When v(0) is large enough, lambda(f) << lambda(i). The condition sigma < lambda(f) is no longer necessary, here sigma is the longitudinal length of a clustering. Waggle magnets covered by superconductivity sheets can markedly decrease s. A laser resonator parallel with an incident electron beam can produce an incident laser with large enough intensity. It is possible that the power of the output laser beam is larger than that of the incident laser beam, although the number of the photons of the output laser beam is less than that of the incident laser beam.

The colonies were light brown, convex and circular. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YIM 78140(T) indicated that it was clustered with members of beta-Proteobacteria (with the similarity from 96.9 to 93.6 %). Good growth occurred at 40-50 A degrees C, pH 8.0-9.0 and in the presence of 0-3 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant ubiquinones were Q-8 and Q-9. The major fatty acids were C-16:0,C- C-17:0 cyclo, C-18:1 omega 7c and summed feature 3. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 70.8 mol%. The results of physiological and biochemical characteristics, phylogenetic analysis allowed the phenotypic and genotypic differentiation of strain YIM 78140(T) from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Therefore, the strain YIM 78140(T) represents a novel genus of the family Comamonadaceae, for which the name Zhizhongheella caldifontis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78140(T) (= BCRC 80649(T) = KCTC 32557(T)).

The new isolate showed morphological and chemotaxonomic properties typical of members of the genus Streptomyces. Phylogenetic analysis of the near-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain JXJ 0074(T) should be affiliated to the genus Streptomyces and exhibited highest similarities to Streptomyces shenzhenensis DSM 42034(T) (98.99 %) and Streptomyces lucensis NBRC 13056(T) (98.60 %), while the similarities to other members of the genus are lower than 98.22 % similarity. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain JXJ 0074(T) and S. shenzhenensis DSM 42034(T) or S. lucensis NBRC 13056(T) were 46.2 +/- A 2.6 and 32.6 +/- A 3.1 %, respectively. Thus, on the basis of the polyphasic data, strain JXJ 0074(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces jiujiangensis sp. nov. is proposed.

The results show that all oxime compounds are good inhibitors, and inhibition efficiency follows the order: CO > BO > AO. The adsorption of each inhibitor on aluminium surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. All these oxime compounds act as cathodic inhibitors.

WO3/WO3 center dot H2O mixtures were deposited on the graphene nanosheets (GNS) to form the GNS-W composite. The GNS-W composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared GNS-W composite was directly fabricated into a supercapacitor electrode for potential energy storage application, and electrochemically tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The GNS-W composite electrode exhibits a better electrochemical performance than that of the WO3/WO3 center dot H2O mixtures electrode. A high specific capacitance of about 143.6 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) for the GNS-W composite delivers significant improvement than that for the WO3/WO3 center dot H2O mixtures and GNS electrodes. The impedance studies also suggest that the GNS-W composite electrode shows the lower resistance and high conductivity due to the good interaction between the graphene nanosheets and the WO3/WO3 center dot H2O mixtures. The good electrochemical performance for the GNS-W composite may be attributed to the interaction between the WO3/WO3 center dot H2O mixtures and the edges of graphene nanosheets, which increases the ion diffusion rate as well as the conductivity.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the microstructure and morphology. The analysis reveals that the obtained compounds are one-dimensional (1D) rod-like nanostructures. The photodegradation of La(OH)(3):Ln(3+) nanorods was tested by measuring the degradation of am dye Congo red (CR). The experiments demonstrated that La(OH)(3):Ln(3+) nanorods degraded CR much faster than undoped La(OH)(3) nanorods and the photodegradation efficiency of La(OH)(3):Ln(3+) nanorods was significantly higher than that of undoped La(OH)(3) nanorods.

Although the change of the secondary structure in the OVA molecule by selenization was small, the enthalpy change for denaturation and tryptophan fluorescence intensity of OVA decreased greatly by selenization. The digestibility of OVA was significantly improved by selenization. The results all together demonstrated that molten globule conformation of OVA was formed by selenization. Some selenized tryptic peptides from Se-OVA were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Remarkably, the antioxidant activity of OVA was improved when selenite was conjugated compared with free selenite. These results indicate that the enhanced antioxidant activity of Se-OVA is ascribed to the conjugated Se and the formation of a molten globule conformation of protein. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ARGO YBJ Collaboration	Evidence of a geomagnetic effect on extensive air showers detected with the ARGO-YBJ experiment	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO; FIELD; CALIBRATION; EMISSION	The geomagnetic field causes not only the east-west effect on primary cosmic rays but also affects the trajectories of the secondary charged particles in the shower, causing their lateral distribution to be stretched. Thus, both the density of the secondaries near the shower axis and the trigger efficiency of detector arrays decrease. The effect depends on the direction of the showers, thus, introducing a modulation in the measured azimuthal distribution. The azimuthal distribution of the events collected by the ARGO-YBJ detector is deeply investigated for different zenith angles in light of this effect.	[Bartoli, B.; Catalanotti, S.; Piazzoli, B.

The results show that peak stress increases with decreasing of temperature and increasing of strain rate. The apparent activation energy of this alloy is about 469 kJ/mol. The processing maps for hot working were developed on the basis of flow stress data and the dynamic materials model. It is found that the features of the maps obtained in the strain range of 0.2-1.0 are fundamentally similar, indicating that the strain does not have a significant influence on processing map. The maps exhibited two domains. The first domain occurs in the strain rate range of 0.01-0.4 s(-1) and temperature range of 1030-1150 degrees C with a peak efficiency of about 49%, which is considered as the optimum window for hot working. The microstructure observations of the specimens deformed in this domain showed the full dynamic recrystallization (DRX) structure with finer and more homogeneous grain sizes. The second domain occurs at the temperatures higher than 1160 degrees C and strain rates lower than 0.1 s(-1) with a peak efficiency of about 41%, the microstructure observations in this domain also indicated the typical DRX structure accompanied with grain growth. A instability domain occurs at temperatures below 1175 degrees C and strain rate above 0.1 s(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use DNA barcoding using COI (550 bp) to re-examine the levels of genetic divergence and taxonomic status of 21 described species of Vietnamese bent-toed geckos. Tree-based analyses resolve all sampled species and identify potential undescribed taxa. Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances between the described species average 21.0 +/- 4.2% and range from 4.3% to 28.7%. Further, our analyses discover two potentially new species from Vietnam, two from Laos and one from China. Herein we describe the new species Cyrtodactylus puhuensis sp. nov. from Vietnam on the basis of both genetics and morphology. Genetically, it differs from the remaining species by an average K2P distance of 24.0 +/- 1.8%. Morphologically, the new species is diagnosed by its medium-size (snout-vent length 79.24 mm and tail length 82.59 mm, for the single known individual), in having a series of moderately enlarged transverse subcaudals and a series of moderately enlarged femoral scales that extend from precloacal scales, in possessing femoral scales without pores, with males having five precloacal pores, and in exhibiting 8 supralabials, 10 infralabials, 23 narrow subdigital lamellae on its fourth toe, and 36 transverse ventrals.

A nanocomposite interconnecting layer for tandem small molecular organic photovoltaic cells	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; SOLAR-CELLS; POLYMER	A nanocomposite interconnecting layer of C60:LiF/Ag/MoOx had been applied in the tandem structure of organic photovoltaic cells to achieve high short circuit current (J(sc)) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The J(sc) had been enhanced 40% after applying the nanocomposite interconnecting layer into a tandem structure compared to the conventional interconnecting layer of Bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag/MoOx. The improvement is due to the enhancement of the light absorption of the devices. A tandem device PCE of 3.04% was achieved by further improving the light absorption in the individual subcell units in the tandem structure by means of a bi-functional buffer layer of C60: LiF/BCP.

In the present study, a Gram-negative, rodshaped bacterium that forms red colonies, was isolated from sands of the Takalamakan desert. It was designated H4X(T). Phylogenetic and biochemical analysis indicated that the isolate is a new species of the genus Pontibacter. The 16S rRNA gene of H4X(T) displays 94.2-96.8% sequence similarities to those of other strains in Pontibacter. The major respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7 (MK-7). The DNA G+C content is 46.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C-15:0, C-16:1 omega 5c, summed feature 3 (containing C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c) and summed feature 4 (comprising anteiso-C17:1B and/or iso-C17:1I). The major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), one aminophospholipid (APL) and some unknown phospholipids (PLs). It is interesting to see that this bacterium can grow very well in a nitrogen-free medium. PCR amplification suggested that the bacterium possesses at least one type of nitrogenase gene. Acetylene reduction assay showed that H4X(T) actually possesses nitrogen-fixing activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that H4X(T) is a new diazotroph. We thus referred it to as Pontibacter diazotrophicus sp. nov. The type strain is H4X(T) (= CCTCC AB 2013049(T) = NRRL B-59974(T)).

However, when PNS bacteria utilize sugars as a carbon source, such as glucose and sucrose, the substrate conversion efficiency is relatively low. In order to investigate the contributions of the glucose catabolic pathways in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 6016 to its hydrogen production, the cfxA gene from the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, edd from the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, and kdg from the semi-phosphorylative ED bypass were knocked out to construct the mutant strains edd(-), cfxA(-), and kdg(-), respectively. Additionally, two of these three genes were knocked out to construct the mutant strains kdg(-)edd(-), kdg(-)cfxA(-), and cfxA(-)edd(-). Hydrogen productions by these mutant strains were compared to that of the wild type strain 6016 using 25 mM glucose as a carbon source. Compared to 6016, variations in hydrogen production and growth were detected in the edd mutant strains (kdg(-) edd(-), cficA(-)edd(-), and edd), while no obvious changes were detected in the others. Notably, the kdg(-)edd(-) mutant did not produce hydrogen, and its maximum growth was 70% less than that of R. sphaeroides 6016. These results indicate that the ED pathway and semi-phosphorylative ED bypass have a governing impact on cell growth and hydrogen production from glucose in R. sphaeroides 6016. The potential synergistic function of the ED pathway and semi-phosphorylative ED bypass and the reasons for the low hydrogen yield from sugar carbon sources in R. sphaeroides 6016 are discussed.

Based on the calculations of coseismic Coulomb stress changes (Delta CFS) from the larger earthquake and post-seismic stress changes due to viscoelastic stress relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle, we examined the temporal evolution of seismic triggering. The ETAS (epidemic type aftershocks sequence) model shows that the seismic rate in the aftershock area over similar to 10 years was higher than the background seismicity before the mainshocic. Moreover, we discuss long-term (years to decades) triggering and the evolution of stress changes for the sequence of five large earthquakes of M >= 7.0 that ruptured the Kunlun fault system since 1937. All subsequent events of M 7.0 occurred in the regions of positive accumulated Delta CFS. These results show that short-term (up to 200 days in our case) triggering along the strike-slip Kunlun fault is governed by coseismic stress changes, while long-term triggering is somewhat due to post-seismic Coulomb stress changes resulting from viscoelastic relaxation.

Surface plasmon polaritons in a topological insulator embedded in an optical cavity	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							HGTE QUANTUM-WELLS; BI2TE3; PHASE	Very recently, the surface plasmons in a topological insulator (TI) have been experimentally observed by exciting these collective modes with polarized light [P. Di Pietro, M. Ortolani, O. Limaj, A. Di Gaspare, V. Giliberti, F. Giorgianni, M. Brahlek, N. Bansal, N. Koirala, S. Oh, P. Calvani, and S. Lupi, Nat. Nanotechnol. 8, 556 (2013)]. Motivated by this experimental work, here we present a theoretical study on the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) induced by plasmon-photon interactions in a TI thin film embedded in an optical cavity. It is found that the frequencies of SPP modes are within the terahertz (THz) bandwidth and can be tuned effectively by adjusting the surface electron density and/or the optical cavity length. Since the surface electron density can be well controlled by the gate-voltage applied perpendicular to the TI surface, our theoretical results indicate that gated TI thin films may have potential applications in the electrically tunable THz plasmonic devices.

We obtain the distribution curves of the auto-correlation function C-x(s) and C-y(s), and the cross-correlation function C-xy(s) and C-yx(s) of the stochastic dynamic variables by the stochastic simulation method. The delay time changes prominently the behaviors of the dynamical variables of an autonomous stochastic system, which makes the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation of the autonomous stochastic system alternate oscillate periodically from positive to negative, or from negative to positive, decrease gradually, and finally tends to zero with the decay time. The delay time and the noise strength have important impacts for the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation of the autonomous stochastic delay system. The delay time enhances the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation, on the contrary, the noise strength lowers the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation. Under the time delay, by comparison we further show differences of the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation between the dynamical variables x and y. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, their ability to coexist in the crowns of the same trees during the shoot-feeding phase has not been elucidated. In our study, we investigated and compared the shoot-feeding ecology of the three species of pine shoot beetle in P. yunnanensis in Anning County, Yunnan Province. Shoot-feeding by T. yunnanensis, T. minor, and T. brevipilosus initiated in April, May, and June, and ended in February, April, and May, respectively. Individual T. yunnanensis and T. minor adults fed in shoots for about seven months, and T. brevipilosus for nine months, before initiating reproduction. All three Tomicus species fed in the current-year shoots close to the apical bud. No specific overwintering behavior was observed prior to reproduction. The entrance hole of T. yunnanensis was furthest away from the apical bud, and T. minor was the closest to the apical bud. Differences in the spatial distribution of these shoot-feeding sites might reduce competition among the three beetle species. The long-lasting and overlapping shoot-feeding by the three Tomicus species may reduce the resistance of P. yunnanensis and facilitate the reproduction of these beetles in the trunks of living trees, and thus help explain the severe damage by Tomicus in P. yunnanensis.

The two intersecting coplanar circles have four intersection points in the projective plane: two real points and two circular points. In the image plane, the diagonal triangle - on which the image of the four intersection points composes a complete quadrangle - is a self- polar triangle for the projection curves of the circles. The vertex of the self- polar triangle is the null space of the degenerate conic formed by the image of the four intersection points. By solving the three vertices of the self- polar triangle using the image coordinates of the two real intersection points, the degenerate conic can be obtained. The image of the two circular points is then computed from the intersection points of the degenerate conic. Using the image of the circular points from the three images of the same planar pattern with different directions, the intrinsic parameters can be linearly determined.

At the same time, It can be enriched highly by solid phase extraction column of reversed phase bonded silica gel. Therefore, we proposed a new method of extracting gold with high enrichment multiple. What enriched by the solid phase extraction column can be eluted by ethanol and the gold in the eluent can be determinated with spectrophotometry. The solid phase extraction column was not easily damaged and it can repeat using. The method is used to extract trace amounts of gold from alkaline cyanide solution and the recovery rate of gold is higher than 98% under the optimal experimental condition.

Previous genetic surveys, mainly using Y-chromosome polymorphisms and/or mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms suggested a substantially reduced geneflow between populations belonging to these two phyla. These studies, however, have mainly focussed on populations residing far to the north and/or south of this mountain range, and have not been able to study geneflow patterns within the greater Himalayan region itself. We now report a detailed, linguistically informed, genetic survey of Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European speakers from the Himalayan countries Nepal and Bhutan based on autosomal microsatellite markers and compare these populations with surrounding regions. The genetic differentiation between populations within the Himalayas seems to be much higher than between populations in the neighbouring countries. We also observe a remarkable genetic differentiation between the Tibeto-Burman speaking populations on the one hand and Indo-European speaking populations on the other, suggesting that language and geography have played an equally large role in defining the genetic composition of present-day populations within the Himalayas.

Alfred Nicholson Leeds and the first fossil egg attributed to a 'saurian'	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						dinosaur egg; Alfred Nicholson Leeds; Callovian; Oxford Clay	ENGLAND	Discovered by the nineteenth century collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds, the first object to be described (1898) as a fossil reptile egg is a unique find from the Oxford Clay near Peterborough. It also comes from one of a very small number of Jurassic localities worldwide that can claim to have yielded a fossil egg. Given its historical and contemporary significance, this object is reassessed in the light of increased understanding of such objects. Data from scanning electron microscopy, computerised tomography, synchrotron imaging, X-ray diffraction and petrographic thin sectioning prove inconclusive. However, the presence of apparent external openings resembling angusticanaliculate pores - a pore type common only to certain types of dinosaur eggshell - in both size and sparseness of distribution prevents its summary dismissal as not being a dinosaurian egg.

We review several dynamics studies on serine protease proteinase K and HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of investigating the dynamic behaviors and molecular motions for a complete understanding of their structure-function relationships. Using computer simulations and essential dynamic (ED) analysis approaches, the dynamics data obtained revealed that: (i) proteinase K has highly flexible substrate-binding site, thus supporting the induced-fit or conformational selection mechanism of substrate binding; (ii) Ca2+ removal from proteinase K increases the global conformational flexibility, decreases the local flexibility of substrate-binding region, and does not influence the thermal motion of catalytic triad, thus explaining the experimentally determined decreased thermal stability, reduced substrate affinity, and almost unchanged catalytic activity upon Ca2+ removal; (iii) substrate binding affects the large concerted motions of proteinase K, and the resulting dynamic pocket can be connected to substrate binding, orientation, and product release; (iv) amino acid mutations 375 S/W and 423 I/P of HIV-1 gp120 have distinct effects on molecular motions of gp120, facilitating 375 S/W mutant to assume the CD4-bound conformation, while 423 I/P mutant to prefer for CD4-unliganded state. The mechanisms underlying protein dynamics and protein-ligand binding, including the concept of the free energy landscape (FEL) of the protein-solvent system, how the ruggedness and variability of FEL determine protein's dynamics, and how the three ligand-binding models, the lock-and-key, induced-fit, and conformational selection are rationalized based on the FEL theory are discussed in depth.

The ability to sense attractive odor is mainly accomplished by the AWA and AWC neurons. Previous studies have shown the components of the olfaction signal pathway in these two amphid chemosensory neurons, but integration of the individual signaling components requires further elucidation. Here we review the progresses in our understanding of signal pathways for attractive olfaction involving AWA and AWC neurons, and discuss how the different signal molecules might employ the common molecular cascades to transduce the olfactory system and guide behavior in each neuron.

The strain produced branched substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae, but no diffusible pigments were produced on the media tested. At maturity, substrate mycelium was fragmented and spore chains were formed on aerial hyphae and substrate mycelium. Optimum growth occurred at 28 degrees C, 1-3% (w/v) NaCl and pH 7.0. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the isolate belongs to the genus Pseudonocardia, showing highest levels of similarity with respect to Pseudonocardia sichuanensis KLBMP 1115(T) (97.1%), Pseudonocardia tetrahydrofuranoxydans K1(T) (97.1 %) and Pseudonocardia kunmingensis YIM 63158(T) (97.0%). Whole-organism hydrolysates of the strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the sugars galactose, glucose, mannose and arabinose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-4). The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unknown phosphoglycolipids and two glycolipids. The major fatty acid was iso-C-16:0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 73.1 molok. DNA DNA relatedness with P. tetrahydrofuranoxydans DSM 44239(T) was 42.8 +/- 3.5 % (mean +/- SD). Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Pseudonocardia, for which the name Pseudonocardia sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M13141(T) (=DSM 45779(T)=JCM 18540(T)).

The isolate, designated NIO-1021(T), was a Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-motile and coccoid. Strain NIO-1021(T) was identified as a member of the genus Kocuria by a polyphasic approach. Strain NIO-1021(T) could be differentiated from other members of the genus Kocuria on the basis of physiology and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of strain NIO-1021(T) to the most closely related species, Kocuria marina KCTC 9943(T), was 98.6% with 19 nt differences). Furthermore, DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that the novel strain had lower relatedness with the type strains of other members of the genus Kocuria. The strain formed a monophyletic clade with K. marina with 100% bootstrap values. The major phospholipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7(H-2). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-(16:0) and anteiso-C-17:0. The DNA G+C content of strain NIO-1021(T) was 60.5 mol%. Chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic properties of the strain were consistent with its classification as representing a member of the genus Kocuria. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotypic and molecular characteristics, strain NIO-1021(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Kocuria, for which the name Kocuria indica sp. nov. is proposed, with strain NIO-1021(T) (=NCIM 5455(T)=DSM 25126(T)=CCTCC AA 209050(T)) as the type strain.

The effects of time delay and intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations on the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system are analyzed. The results indicate that the SNR exhibits a maximum as a function of the intensities of the intrinsic and extrinsic noises, identifying the occurrence of the SR effect. An increase of the delay time always suppresses the SR effect, while an increase of correlation strength between noises may suppress or enhance it SNR also shows a resonant behavior as a function. of the correlation strength between noises, and it can be weakened by the time delay.

According to transformation thermodynamics method, material parameter expressions for thermal concentrator with an arbitrary cross section are derived, and thermal concentrator with special symmetrical profiles, such as circle, ellipse, and pentagon, as well as thermal concentrator with arbitrary conformal/non-conformal cross section are designed on this basis. Full wave simulation results show that these thermal concentrators can bend the isotherm and heat flux towards their compressive regions, making the heat diffuses faster on the side near heat source and slower on the opposite side. Heat concentrated into a tiny region may have potential applications in thermal engineering. In addition, research on layered realization method of cylindrical thermal concentrator is conducted. Results reveal that the thermal concentrator can be realized through alternatively filling isotropic materials into layers along the angular direction. This work has a guiding significance for the design and manufacturing of thermal concentrator.

Such stochastic resonance manifests a more adjustable character in small-scale systems where confinement and noise play a prominent role. The magnitude of the effect is sensitive to the geometry modification, thus leading to various resonance conditions.

Meanwhile, gallium in the coal dust dissolved fully into germanium distillation residual liquid. After the filtering process, gallium and residual germanium got into the vinasse. The vinasse acidity was adjusted to 5.6 mol/L to extract gallium by 260(#) solvent oil solution of tributyl phosphate (TBP). A small amount of germanium in the vinasse was extracted as well, and subsequently went into the organic phase. Then sodium hydroxide solution was taken to conduct re-extraction. Afterwards, its pH was adjusted to 6.5 similar to 6.7 and it was heated up to 85 similar to 95 degrees C to hydrolyze gallium and,germanium. As a result, hydrogen gallium oxide precipitation and germanium dioxide precipitation were produced. Finally germanium and gallium concentrates were obtained via filtering and drying process. By taking the above procedures, the distillation recovery rate of germanium is as high as 92.37%, and the recovery rate of germanium in the vinasse is 86.18%. Hydrochloric acid leaching rate of gallium is above 81.23% and tributyl phosphate recovery rate and re-extraction rate of gallium is 98.81% and 99.11%, respectively. And the neutralized precipitation straight yield rate is 93.20%. Thus, the hydrochloric acid distillation-tributyl phosphate extraction process is a kind of economic and efficient extraction method, enjoying the qualities of short procedures, easier process control, high recovery rate, less time and less assumption of material.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the structures of complexes 1 and 2 were isomorphic and exhibited two-dimensional (2D) double-layered sql nets. Complex 3 had an interesting 2D -> three-dimensional (3D) inclined polycatenation net based on 4(4)-sql subunits. Complex 4 featured an uncommon 3D 2-fold cds network, while complex 5 possessed a rare uninodal self-penetrating 10-connected pentacobalt-cluster-based ile-(3(6).4(34).5(3).6(2)) framework. Complex 6 displayed a 2-fold interpenetrated 3D six-connected pcu topology. These different intriguing architectures indicated that the coordination behaviors of metal ions and the coordination modes, the position isomers of carboxylate, and different steric hindrances of aromatics played important roles in the construction of CPs; moreover, bpdb ligands with conformational freedom may affect the formation of the final architectures. The photoluminescence properties of 1, 2, and 6 in the solid state and the magnetic properties of 5 were studied. Moreover, thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis were also performed.

The exceptional preservation of the animal reveals morphological details that allow direct comparison with extant priapulids. The body is divisible into a partially eversible pharynx, a smooth collar, a scalid-bearing introvert, a neck with triangular scalids, an unsegmented trunk with annulations, and a distinctly expanded terminal region. Several specialized regions of the alimentary canal are recognized: a pharynx (lined by cuticle and bearing teeth), esophagus, midgut, hindgut, and a terminal anus. The sample includes a putative juvenile. The animal is inferred to have been an active burrower using a double-anchor strategy, practicing both deposit feeding and camivory. Inclusion of Eximipriapulus in the most recent character matrix for cladistic analysis of fossil and Recent priapulids resolves the new genus within the priapulid crown group.

Controlled hollow structure is achieved by adjusting the ratio of ethylene glycol to water and reaction time of solvothermal alcoholysis. Amorphous carbon can be loaded on the NiO nanoparticles uniformly in the solvothermal alcoholysis process, and the subsequent calcination results in the formation of hollow NiO-C hybrid nanoparticle aggregates. As anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 622 mAh g(-1), and capacity retention keeps over 90.7% after 100 cycles at constant current density of 200 mA g(-1). The NiO-C electrode also exhibits good rate capabilities. The unique hollow structures can shorten the length of Li-ion diffusion and offer a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. The hybrid carbon in the particles renders the electrode having a good electronic conductivity. Here, the hollow NiO-C hybrid electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance.

A mathematical model for simulating spring discharge and estimating sinkhole porosity in a karst watershed	GRUNDWASSER			English	Article						Sinkhole porosity; Watershed balance; Karst aquifer; Turbulent flow; Analytical model	CONDUIT FLOW; AQUIFERS; RESPONSES	Documenting and understanding water balances in a karst watershed in which groundwater and surface water resources are strongly interconnected are important aspects for managing regional water resources. Assessing water balances in karst watersheds can be difficult, however, because karst watersheds are so very strongly affected by groundwater flows through solution conduits that are often connected to one or more sinkholes. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to approximate sinkhole porosity from discharge at a downstream spring. The model represents a combination of a traditional linear reservoir model with turbulent hydrodynamics in the solution conduit connecting the downstream spring with the upstream sinkhole, which allows for the simulation of spring discharges and estimation of sinkhole porosity. Noting that spring discharge is an integral of all aspects of water storage and flow, it is mainly dependent on the behavior of the karst aquifer as a whole and can be adequately simulated using the analytical model described in this paper.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in HSCs has been identified as a key event in liver fibrosis, and as the molecular link between inflammation and liver fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), one of the main medicinal components of propolis, on the pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic phenotypes of LPS-stimulated HSCs. HSCs from rats were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Following treatment with LPS, HSCs showed a strong pro-inflammatory phenotype with an upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, and a fibrogenic phenotype with enhanced collagen synthesis, mediated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). CAPE significantly and dose-dependently reduced LPS-induced nitrite production, as well as the transcription and protein synthesis of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). CAPE further reduced the TGF-beta 1-induced transcription and translation (protein synthesis) of the gene coding for collagen type I alpha 1 (col1A1), in LPS-stimulated HSCs. Following LPS stimulation, the phosphorylation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) inhibitor I kappa B alpha and consequently, the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, were markedly increased in the HSCs, and these changes were reversed by pre-treatment with CAPE. In conclusion, CAPE attenuates the pro-inflammatory phenotype of LPS-stimulated HSCs, as well as the LPS-induced sensitization of HSCs to fibrogenic cytokines by inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling. Our results provide new insight into the treatment of hepatic fibrosis through regulation of the TLR4 signaling pathway.

As the genomic sequences for increasing number of organisms are completed, research into how proteins can perform such a variety of functions has become much more intensive because the value of the genomic sequences relies on the accuracy of understanding the encoded gene products. Although the static three-dimensional structures of many proteins are known, the functions of proteins are ultimately governed by their dynamic characteristics, including the folding process, conformational fluctuations, molecular motions, and protein-ligand interactions. In this review, the physicochemical principles underlying these dynamic processes are discussed in depth based on the free energy landscape (FEL) theory. Questions of why and how proteins fold into their native conformational states, why proteins are inherently dynamic, and how their dynamic personalities govern protein functions are answered. This paper will contribute to the understanding of structure-function relationship of proteins in the post-genome era of life science research.

In this study, we identified the AoMls gene from the nematode-trapping fungus Arthobotrys oligospora. The gene contains 4 introns and encodes a polypeptide of 540 amino acids. To characterize the function of AoMls in A. oligospora, we disrupted it by homologous recombination, and the Delta AoMls mutants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. The growth rate and colony morphology of the Delta AoMls mutants showed no obvious difference from the wild-type strains on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate. However, the disruption of gene AoMls led to a significant reduction in conidiation, failure to utilize fatty acids and sodium acetate for growth, and its conidia were unable to germinate on minimal medium supplemented with sodium oleate. In addition, the trap formation was retarded in the Delta AoMls mutants, which only produced immature traps containing one or two rings. Moreover, the nematicidal activity of the Delta AoMls mutants was significantly decreased. Our results suggest that the gene AoMls plays an important role in conidiation, trap formation and pathogenicity of A. oligospora.

However, the biology of the protein and the pathophysiology of these diseases remain largely unknown. It has been speculated that additional factor or factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Recently, a PrP-like protein, recognized as shadow of prion protein (Shadoo, Sho), is thought to be an interesting candidate factor because both the prion protein and Sho have been shown to have overlapping expression patterns and shared functions. Therefore, extensive study of Sho may advance our understanding of the enigmatical biology of prion and prion diseases. In this review, recent studies on Sho associated with prion diseases and functions are summarized. These studies have demonstrated the functional importance of Sho, and they further need to investigate its biological roles in prion diseases.

We first derive biharmonic equation for rotationally symmetric maps between rotationally symmetric 2-manifolds. We then apply the equation to obtain a classification of biharmonic maps in a family of rotationally symmetric maps between 2-spheres. We also find many examples of proper biharmonic maps defined locally on a 2-sphere. Our results seem to suggest that any biharmonic map S-2 -> (N-n, h) is a weakly conformal immersion.

Fictibacillus enclensis sp nov., isolated from marine sediment	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Fictibacillus sp.; Polyphasic taxonomy; Chorao Island	ET-AL. 1990; COMB. NOV; GEN. NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; BACILLUS-BARBARICUS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RENATURATION RATES; DNA HYBRIDIZATION; BASE COMPOSITION	A novel Gram-positive strain, designated NIO-1003(T), was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from the Chorao Island, Goa Provence, India. Strain NIO-1003(T) was found to be strictly aerobic, motile, endospore-forming rods. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain NIO-1003(T) belongs to the genus Fictibacillus and to be most closely related to Fictibacillus rigui KCTC 13278(T), Fictibacillus solisalsi KCTC 13181(T) and Fictibacillus barbaricus DSM 14730(T) with 98.2, 98.0 and 97.2 % similarity and 25, 28, 39 nucleotide differences respectively. Strain NIO-1003(T) was characterized by having cell-wall peptidoglycan based on meso-diaminopimelic acid and MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone. The polar lipid profile exhibited the major compounds diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. In addition, minor amounts of an aminophospholipid were detected. The major fatty acids were identified as ai-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0, ai-C-17:0 and C-16:0, supporting the grouping of strain NIO-1003(T) into the family Bacillaceae. The DNA G+C content of strain NIO-1003(T) was determined to be 42.6 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic properties, phylogeny and DNA-DNA hybridisation analysis, strain NIO-1003(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Fictibacillus for which the name Fictibacillus enclensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NIO-1003(T) (= NCIM 5458(T) = DSM 25142(T)).

Growth was found to occur from 15 to 40 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C), at pH 7.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and with 25-100 % seawater or 0.5-7.0 % NaCl in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+; no growth was found with NaCl alone. Colonies on seawater nutrient agar were observed to be punctiform, white, convex, circular, smooth, and translucent. Strain SSW084(T) did not grow on Zobell marine agar and tryptic soy agar even when seawater supplemented. The major respiratory quinone was found to be Q-10 and the G + C content was determined to be 61.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain SSW084(T) belongs to the genus Roseovarius and that its closest neighbours are Roseovarius tolerans EL-172(T), Roseovarius mucosus DFL-24(T) and Roseovarius lutimaris 112(T) with 95.7, 95.4 and 95.3 % sequence similarity respectively. The remaining species of Roseovarius showed < 95 % similarity. The polar lipids of strain SSW084(T) were determined to be phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unidentified lipid and one unidentified aminolipid. The major fatty acids identified were identified as C-18:1 omega 7c (52.5 %) and C-16:0 (13.8 %). On the basis of phenotypic, molecular and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain SSW084(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Roseovarius, for which Roseovarius azorensis sp. nov is proposed. The type strain is SSW084(T) (=KCTC 32421(T) = MTCC 11812(T)).

It is located in the south side of the Bozhushan dome, Wenshan-Funing fold cluster. Tungsten mineralization is associated with the Bozhushan granite which has been classified as S-type granite and was formed in the Yanshanian intracontinental collision regime. Orebodies are hosted in the outer contact zone between the Yanshanian granite and the Cambrian clastic-carbonate strata. Disseminations and stockworks are two common ore structures. Both the granite and wallrocks underwent intense hydrothermal alteration, ranging outwardly from phlogopition-epidotization to diposidization-epidotization, and to forsteritation zones with increasing distance from the intrusion. The ore-forming process can be divided into the early, middle and late stages, corresponding to skarn, quartz-sulfide and carbonate-quartz-fluorite, respectively. Primary fluid inclusions in the early stage minerals ( diopside and essonite ) are CH4-bearing NaCl-H2O inclusions and daughter mineral-bearing inclusions, in the middle stage minerals are CO2 -CH4 -N-2-bearing NaCl-H2O and daughter mineral-bearing inclusionin quartz, while in the late stage minerals are CO2-bearing NaCl-H2O inclusions. Halite-bearing inclusions can not be observed. The homogeneous temperatures of the fluid inclusions in the early stage are mainly 379 similar to 550 degrees C, with salinities ranging from 3. 2% similar to 9. 9% NaCleqv. In the middle stage, the fluid inclusions mainly yield homogeneous temperatures of 250 similar to 370 degrees C and salinities of 8. 9% similar to 10. 6% NaCleqv. The fluid inclusions in the late stage are homogenized at temperatures of 115 similar to 221 degrees C, yielding salinities of 1. 7% similar to 5. 7% NaCleqv. The estimated pressures range from 45 similar to 90MPa in the early stage to 10 similar to 30MPa in the middle stage, with the greatest formation depth of 3km. In the words, the ore-forming fluids evolved from high temperature, low NaCl H2O-CH4-NaCl system to middle temperature, low NaCl, H2O-CH4-CO2-NaCl system finally to low temperature, meteoric fluid containing CO2	[Zhang YaHui; Zhang ShiTao; Ma HongJie; Zhang Lei; Zhang DongZhe] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Land Resource Engn, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China; [Zhang YaHui] Yunnan Univ, Sch Resources Environm & Earth Sci, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Fan YuHua] Yunnan Prov Bur Geol Survey, Kunming 650216, Peoples R China	Zhang, YH (reprint author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Land Resource Engn, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China.	yahuizh@126.com; taogezhang@hotmail.com						28	0	1	0	6	SCIENCE PRESS	BEIJING	16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA	1000-0569	2095-8927		ACTA PETROL SIN	Acta Petrol.

F. graminearum produces ascospores (sexual spores) and conidia (asexual spores), which can serve as disease inocula of FHB. Meanwhile, Fusarium-infected grains are often contaminated with mycotoxins such as trichothecenes (TRIs), fumonisins, and zearalenones, among which TRIs are related to the pathogenicity of F. graminearum, and these toxins are hazardous to humans and livestock. In recent years, with the complete genome sequencing of F. graminearum, an increasing number of functional genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites, hyphal differentiation, sexual and asexual reproduction, virulence and pathogenicity have been identified from F. graminearum. In this review, the secondary metabolite synthesis, hyphal development and pathogenicity related genes in F. graminearum were thoroughly summarized, and the genes associated with secondary metabolites, sexual reproduction, energy metabolism, and pathogenicity were highlighted.

In this paper, the impacts of A. adenophora invasion on the soil physical and chemical properties of Eucalyptus plantation were investigated, based on the exploration of its causes, the assessment of its risk and the prediction of its succession. The results showed that the invasion had a different impact on eight different physical-chemical indexes of soil in Eucalyptus plantation, characterized with a certain complexity. Its impact on soil water was featured with seasonal difference, namely, during the rainy season, the soil water concentration decreased significantly, while, in the dry season, the soil water concentration increased significantly (excluding the severely invasive sample on shadowy slope). Meanwhile, its impact on soil organic matters (SOM), soil nitrogen (TN, AN), soil phosphorus (TP, AP) and soil potassium (TK, AK) was related to seasons, exposure and invasive degrees of A. adenophora, but there was no unified rule for them, which should be studied further. It is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable operation and scientific management of Eucalyptus plantation under the condition of A. adenophora invasion for sustainable agro-forest ecosystems.

The results suggest that the existence of 2-methyl-imidazole or 2-ethyl-imidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or methoxyphenacyl group were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. In particular, hybrid compound 29 was found to be the most potent compound against five strains human tumor cell lines and more active than cisplatin (DDP), while hybrid compound 26 was more selective toward colon carcinoma (SW480) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7) with IC50 value 44.0- and 36.8-fold more sensitive to DDP.

Phylogeography and genetic effects of habitat fragmentation on endangered Taxus yunnanensis in southwest China as revealed by microsatellite data	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Anthropogenic fragmentation; microsatellite; phylogeography; uplift of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	QINGHAI-TIBETAN PLATEAU; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DIFFERENTIATION; SOFTWARE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; YEW; DNA; L.; POLLINATION	It is not known how the profoundly complex topography and habitat heterogeneity generated by the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) during the late Tertiary affected population genetic structure of endangered Taxus yunnanensis. In addition, the effects of habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic disturbance on genetic diversity and population differentiation of this species have not been studied. T.yunnanensis is an ancient tree/shrub mainly distributed in southwest China. Recently, the species has suffered a sharp decline due to excessive logging for its famous anticancer metabolite taxol, resulting in smaller and more isolated populations. To understand the phylogeography and genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation of this endangered species, using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, we genotyped 288 individuals from 14 populations from a range-wide sampling in China. Our results suggest that two different population groups that were once isolated have persisted in situ during glacial periods in both areas, and have not merged since. Habitat fragmentation has led to significant genetic bottlenecks, high inbreeding and population divergence in this species. The two different population groups of T.yunnanensis could be attributed to restricted gene flow caused through isolation by geographical barriers and by habitat heterogeneity during uplift of the QTP, or the existence of two separate glacial refugia during the Pleistocene. In situ and ex situ conservation of the two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs), artificial gene flow between populations and a comprehensive understanding of the pollination system in this endangered species are suggested from this study.

Large variations in the number of M35 family and M36 family genes were found among different fungal genomes, indicating that these two gene families have been highly dynamic through fungal evolution. Moreover, we found obvious expansions of Meps in two families of Onygenales: Onygenaceae and Arthodermataceae, whereas species in family Ajellomycetace did not show expansion of these genes. The strikingly different gene duplication and loss patterns in Onygenales may be associated with the different pathogenicity of these species. Interestingly, likelihood ratio tests (LRT) of both M35 family and M36 family genes suggested that several branches leading to the duplicated genes in dermatophytic and Coccidioides fungi had signatures of positive selection, indicating that the duplicated Mep genes have likely diverged functionally to play important roles during the evolution of pathogenicity of dermatophytic and Coccidioides fungi. The potentially positively selected residues discovered by our analysis may have contributed to the development of new physiological functions of the duplicated Mep genes in dermatophytic fungi and Coccidioides species. Our study adds to the current knowledge of the evolution of Meps in fungi and also establishes a theoretical foundation for future experimental investigations.

The bioaccumulation characteristics and phytoremediation potential of naturally regenerated Nepalese alder were evaluated in a lead-zinc spoil heap located in Lancang county, Yunnan province, south-western China. Results showed that bioaccumulation factors (BFs) of A. nepalensis for Zn and Pb were always > 1 in slightly contaminated soils (extractable Zn, Pb of 4.217.9 and 3.4-13.1 mg kg(-1), respectively) and > 1 for Cd in contaminated soils (extractable Cd 0.3-6.8 mg kg(-1)). By contrast, translocation factors (TFs) for Zn were < 1 in all sampling plots, but > 1 for Pb in soil slightly contaminated by 13.1 mg kg-1 extractable Pb and > 1 for Cd in contaminated soils (extractable Cd 2.6-6.8 mg kg(-1)). Significant positive correlations were found between heavy metals (HMs) in roots and extractable HMs in soils (p< 0.01) and between HMs in shoots and extractable HMs in soils (p< 0.05) except for Cd. Based on the accumulation capacity revealed in this study, we suggest that A. nepalensis is a promising tree species for phytostabilization of zinc and lead in soils slightly contaminated with Zn and Pb and for phytoextraction of cadmium in Cd-polluted soil.

Results show that radiation loss at the corner of the polygon SPP resonator can be suppressed; the AZIM is also capable of adjusting the mode number and controlling the field distribution in an SPP resonator. Finally, the AZIM eliminates the transmission delay of surface waves and breaks the limitation of a mode number in direct proportion to the perimeter of the resonator. This may open up a new avenue for manipulating the mode number of SPP resonators at will.

Their behavior, characterization, and binding ability were investigated in both solution and the solid state by means of UV-vis, NMR, XRD, DSC and SEM. The results show that the water solubility and solution stability obviously increased in the inclusion complex with cyclodextrins. Meanwhile, the inclusion complexes still retained anticancer activity against A549 and MCF-7 cells, similar to free Epothilone A. This satisfactory water solubility, high solution stability, and high anticancer activity of the Epothilone A/CD complexes will be potentially useful as an anticancer therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic optical properties in graphene: Length versus velocity gauge	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								The dynamic optical properties of graphene are theoretically investigated in both length gauge and velocity gauge in the presence of ultrafast optical radiation field. The two gauges present different results of dynamic photo-induced carriers and optical conductance due to distinct dependencies on electric field and non-resonant optical absorption, while the two gauges give identical results in the steady state time. It shows that the choice of gauge affects evidently the dynamic optical properties of graphene. The velocity gauge represents an outcome of a real physical experiment. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

The crystalline structures, morphological evolution process and microwave absorption properties were systematically investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and measurement of electromagnetic parameters. The results show that the morphological structures and electromagnetic properties have close relationship with the reaction time. With the prolonging of the treatment time, the as-synthesized products turn from microspheres constituted of tiny dendrites to nanorods with diameters of 20-30 nm and lengths up to 1-2 mu m. The electromagnetic characterization shows that the dielectric constants and magnetic permeability values show decreasing trends with the increasing frequency, however, the dielectric and magnetic loss tangents all increase with frequency. The electromagnetic absorption properties of the products have close relationship with the morphologies and thicknesses of the samples. With a thickness of 3 mm, an absorbing peak value of 25 dB was achieved for the sample treated for 24 h. The microwave absorption properties of MnO2 can be attributed mainly to interfacial polarization, space charge polarization and relaxation phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From numerical simulation of the mean escape time (MET), the results indicate that: (i) the varying amplitude of extrinsic periodic information induces and enhances a maximum in curve of the MET versus the mean reversion of volatility or initial position; (ii) there is a critical value of amplitude or frequency of extrinsic periodic information in the behavior of MET versus the long-run variance or amplitude of volatility fluctuations, and when amplitude or frequency takes value below the critical value, the increase in amplitude or frequency enhances the stability of stock price, but restrains it when amplitude or frequency takes value above the critical value.

By manipulating the amplitude of the additional periodic signal, absolute negative mobility, negative nonlinear mobility and differential negative mobility are observed. The parameter regimes for the abnormal transport behaviors are identified. Coexisting attractors are responsible for these anomalous transport phenomena.

Here we analyzed the potential role of sumoylation in osmo-response in yeast. We find that osmotic stress induces rapid accumulation of sumoylated species in normal yeast cells. Interestingly, disruption of MAP kinase Hog1 leads to a much higher level of accumulation of sumoylated conjugates that are independent of new protein synthesis. We also find that the accumulation of sumoylated species is dependent on a SUMO ligase Siz1. Notably, overexpression of SIZ1 in HOG1-disruption mutants (hog1 Delta) but not in wild type cells leads to a markedly increased and prolonged accumulation of sumoylated species. Examination of osmo-tolerance of yeast mutants that display either an increase or a decrease in the global sumoylation level revealed an inverse relationship between accumulation of sumoylated conjugates and osmo-tolerance. Further investigation has shown that many of the sumoylated species induced by hyperosmotic stress are actually poly-sumoylated. Together, these findings indicate that abnormal accumulation of poly-sumoylated conjugates is harmful for osmo-tolerance in yeast, and suggest that Hog1 promotes adaptation to hyperosmotic stress partially via regulation of global sumoylation level.

The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the overall association between the -308 G/A polymorphism and acne vulgaris risk. Methods: We searched in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI for studies evaluating the association between the 308 G/A gene polymorphism and acne vulgaris risk. Data were extracted and statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 software. Results: A total of five publications involving 1553 subjects (728 acne vulgaris cases and 825 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Combined analysis revealed a significant association between this polymorphism and acne vulgaris risk under recessive model (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.37-5.44, p = 0.004 for AA vs. AG + GG). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that the acne vulgaris risk associated with the -308 G/A gene polymorphism was significantly elevated among Caucasians under recessive model (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.13-4.86, p = 0.023). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that the -308 G/A polymorphism in the TNF gene contributes to acne vulgaris risk, especially in Caucasian populations. Further studies among different ethnicity populations are needed to validate these findings.

Three EEDs formed in different acceleration scenarios are assumed: the power-law with exponential cut-off (PLC) EED (shock-acceleration scenario or the case of the EED approaching equilibrium in the stochastic-acceleration scenario), the log-parabolic (LP) EED (stochastic-acceleration scenario and the acceleration dominating), and the broken power-law (BPL) EED (no acceleration scenario). The corresponding fluxes of both synchrotron and SSC are then calculated. The model is applied to PKS 0447-439, and modeled SEDs are compared to the observed SED of this object by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The results show that the PLC model fails to fit the observed SED well, while the LP and BPL models give comparably good fits for the observed SED. The results indicate that it is possible that a stochastic acceleration process acts in the emitting region of PKS 0447-439 and the EED is far from equilibrium (acceleration dominating) or no acceleration process works (in the emitting region). The redshift of PKS 0447-439 is also estimated in our fitting: z = 0.16 +/- 0.05 for the LP case and z = 0.17 +/- 0.04 for BPL case.

The present study aimed to incorporate the relationships between species distribution (or vegetation spatial distribution pattern) and topography and human disturbance factors with remote sensing data, to improve the accuracy of mountain vegetation maps. Two different mountainous areas located in Lancang (Mekong) watershed served as study sites. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture classification was used as image classification protocol. In addition, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination was applied to address the relationships between topography and human disturbance factors with the spatial distribution of vegetation patterns. We used ordinary kriging at unobserved locations to predict the CCA scores. The CCA ordination results showed that the vegetation spatial distribution patterns are strongly affected by topography and human disturbance factors. The overall accuracy of vegetation classification was significantly improved by incorporating DEM or four CCA axes as additional channels in both the northern and southern study areas. However, there was no significant difference between using DEM or four CCA axes as extra channels in the northern steep mountainous areas because of a strong redundancy between CCA axes and DEM data. In the southern lower mountainous areas, the accuracy was significantly higher using four CCA axes as extra bands, compared to using DEM as an extra band. In the southern study area, the variance of vegetation data explained by human disturbance factors was larger than the variance explained by topographic attributes.

However, since 1905, several researchers have pointed out that this name is an illegitimate junior nomenclatural synonym. At least four generic names are in current use for fossil wood of this type: Agathoxylon Hartig, Araucarioxylon, Dadoxylon Endl. and Dammaroxylon J. Schultze-Motel. This problem of inconsistent nomenclatural application is compounded by the fact that woods of this type represent a wide range of plants including basal pteridosperms, cordaitaleans, glossopterids, primitive conifers, and araucarian conifers, with a fossil record that extends from the Devonian to Holocene. Conservation of Araucarioxylon has been repeatedly suggested but never officially proposed. Since general use is a strong argument for conservation, a poll was conducted amongst fossil wood anatomists in order to canvass current and preferred usage. It was found that the community is divided, with about one-fifth recommending retention of the well-known Araucarioxylon, whereas the majority of others advocated use of the legitimate Agathoxylon. The arguments of the various colleagues who answered the poll are synthesized and discussed. There is clearly little support for conservation of Araucarioxylon. A secondary aspect of the poll tackled the issue as to whether Araucaria-like fossil woods should be either gathered into a unique fossil-genus, or whether two fossil-genera should be recognized, based on the respective presence or absence of axial parenchyma. A majority of colleagues favoured having one fossil-genus only. Agathoxylon can be used legitimately and appears to be the most appropriate name for such woods. However, its original diagnosis must be expanded if those woods lacking axial parenchyma are to be included.

The simulation results show that the efficiency of the solar cell with band gap grading is 0.477% higher than that without band gap grading due to the higher open circuit voltage (V-oc) and better fill factor (FF). Subsequently, a-SiGe : H thin film solar cells with three different window layers such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si : H), hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC : H) and hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si : H) are simulated, respectively. The numeric calculation results indicate that the fermi level E F of the a-SiGe : H thin film solar cell crosses the valence band when nc-Si : H window layer is employed in the simulation. This will improve the conductivity and the open circuit voltage of the solar cell. In addition, the electric field at front contact interface is reduced due to the lower contact barrier height. This may be more beneficial to the carrier collection by front contact. On the other hand, thanks to the wider band-gap difference between the window layer and the intrinsic layer, a potential barrier is built at the valence-band p/i interface due to the band offset. This will hinder the hole migration and collection. Thus, an nc-Si : H buffer layer, which can relax the valence-band offset and be more beneficial to the carrier migration and collection, is introduced at p/i interface. Finally, the optimum conversion efficiency of the a-SiGe : H thin film solar cell with graded band gap is achieved to be 9.104%.

The hardness profiles along the intrinsic reaction coordinate present a minimum shift with respect to the transition states. The densities of HOMO and LUMO can explain why the first new bond is formed at the end of double bonds of two isoprenes. All adducts are stereoisomers with similar energies. The asynchronous degree of the endo addition reaction involved in cis-isoprene as dienophile is greater and its potential energy barrier, 10 kJ/mol, is lower than that of any other reaction pathways.

Three kinds of pore-formers(activated carbon, starch and graphite) with different ratios were mixed with the LSCM powders to prepare porous anode substrates. The porosity of the anode substrate was measured by the Archimedes method, and the maximum porosity was 45%. The morphology and the structure of the anode substrates were characterized by SEM, XRD and EDS. XRD analysis displays that the LSCM substrates are main perovskite phases after sintering. SEM analyses show that the pore distribution of the anode substrate prepared by adding 20 wt% activated carbon is more uniform than those of the substrates prepared by starch and graphite, and no cracks appear. The catalytic experiments results demonstrate that the porous anode substrate prepared by adding 20 wt% activated carbon as the pore-former has the best methane catalytic performance at high temperature, and the corresponding conversion efficiency is 71.88%.

J	Wu, H; Xu, D				Wu, Hao; Xu, Dan			Image compositing using dominant patch transformations	COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK			English	Article						Image compositing; Patch matching; Dominant patch transformations; Multiple matching sources		Patch-based synthesis can produce composites with smooth transition regions even though source images have inconsistent textures and structures, but it often suffers blur and small misaligned textures caused by inaccurate patch matching. We present a method to improve patch-based image compositing by using dominant geometric patch transformations (including patch offsets, rotations and scales). When searching for the nearest patches from matching sources, we observed that the patch transformations are sparsely distributed, and thus dominant transformations could be found from statistics of patch transformations to represent prominent patterns of patch matching. By combining dominant transformations with neighborhood searching, the accuracy of patching matching is improved. The computational cost also decreases as the patch search space is limited to a few dominant transformations and their neighborhoods. The experiments demonstrate that the improved patch matching alleviates blur and aligns small misaligned textures better in image compositing. In addition, the composite obtained by our method is consistent with the target image in color contrast. The running time of our method achieves up to 3 x speedup compared to the approach based on the randomized patch searching. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To test this hypothesis, the dynamics of colonization and diversity of foliar fungal endophytes of non-native Ageratina adenophora were investigated. Previous reports showed that the time since the initial introduction (1930s) of A. adenophora into China varied among populations. Endophytes were sampled in three provinces of Southwest China in 21 sites that varied from 20 to 70 years since the introduction of A. adenophora from its native Central America. Endophyte isolation frequencies varied from 1.87 % to 60.23 % overall in a total of 4,032 leaf fragments. Based on ITS sequence variations, 463 fungal endophytes were distinguished as 112 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the Sordariomycetes (77 OTUs, 373 isolates), Dothideomycetes (18 OTUs, 38 isolates), and Agaricomycetes (17 OTUs, 52 strains) classes. Colletotrichum (28.51 %), Nemania (14.90 %), Phomopsis (13.17 %), and Xylaria (4.97 %) were the most abundant genera. Both endophyte diversity and overall isolation frequency increased with time since introduction. The genetic differentiation of the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides indicated that the dispersal of endophytes was likely affected by a combination of geographic factors and the invasion history of the host A. adenophora.

Strong visible colorimetric changes in 1 were observed only in the presence of fluoride (yellow-to-red color change), acetate (yellow-to-orange color change) and hydroxyl (yellow-to-brown color change) anions in DMSO. In the UV-Vis spectroscopy titration of F-, two different processes were observed as the concentration of F- increased. In the lower concentration of F-, hydrogen-bond interactions were formed in the first process. The second process of the spectral changes, in the higher concentration of F-, was attributed to the deprotonation of the hydroxyl moiety in the binding group, which was associated with the enhancement in the push-pull effect of the internal charge-transfer transition. The commonly competing Cl-, Br-, I-, ClO4, PF6, HSO4 and H2PO4 ions induced none or relatively negligible optical perturbations in the UV-Vis spectral analyses. The present naked-eye detection system provides a simple and rapid method for the detection of fluoride, acetate and hydroxyl anions without interferences from other halide anions or common anions, including ClO4, PF6, HSO4 and H2PO4.

Solid extraction of Au(I) from alkaline cyanide solution was studied using this extractant-impregnated resin (Em), with addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB), directly into the aurous aqueous phase in advance. The mechanism of solid extraction was further investigated by means of FTIR, XPS and SEM. The column separation studies have shown that cationic surfactant CTMAB played a key role in the solid phase extraction, and the resin containing TRPO were effective for the extraction of gold when the molar ratio of CTMAB: Au( I) reached 1:1. FTIR spectroscopy of gold loaded EIR showed that the frequency of C equivalent to N stretching vibration was at 2 144 cm(-1), and the frequency of P=O stretching vibration shifted to lower frequency from 1 153 to 1 150 cm(-1). The XPS spectrum of N(1s), Au(4f(7/2)) and Au(4f(5/2)) suggested that the coordination environment of gold did not change before and after extraction, and gold was still as the form of Au (CN)(2)(-) anion exiting in the loaded resin; O(1s) spectrum showed that the chemically combined water significantly increased after solid extraction from 30.74% to 42.34%; Comparing to the P(2p) spectrum before and after extraction, the binding energy increased from 132.15 to 132.45 eV, indicating there maybe existing hydrogen-bond interaction between P=O and water molecule, such as P=O center dot center dot center dot H-O-H.

This is meant to avoid or minimize unfavourable impacts on natural resources through guiding tourists for proper use. In this paper, a GIS-based method, the least-cost path (LCP) modelling, is explored for planning tourist tracks in a World Heritage site in Northwest Yunnan (China), where tourism is increasing rapidly while appropriate infrastructure is almost absent. The modelling process contains three steps: 1) selection of evaluation criteria (physical, biological and landscape scenic) that are relevant to track decision; 2) translation of evluation criteria into spatially explicit cost surfaces with GIS, and 3) use of Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the least-cost tracks. Four tracks that link main entrances and scenic spots of the study area are proposed after optimizing all evaluation criteria. These tracks feature low-environmental impacts and high landscape qualities, which represent a reasonable solution to balance tourist use and nature conservation in the study area. In addtion, the study proves that the LCP modelling can not only offer a structured framwork for track planning but also allow for different stakeholders to participate in the planning process. It therefore enhances the effectivenss of tourism planning and managemnt in protected areas.

The results showed: (a) aqueous extracts from several crops straw (residue) brought about different impacts on the single index for germination and growth of A. adenophora, e.g., high concentration of aqueous extracts from Brassica oleracea waste leaves showed a strong inhibition against the germination rate (GR) and germination index (GI) of A. adenophora, while high concentration of aqueous extracts from Vicia cracca straw showed a strong inhibition against radicle length (RL) and hypocotyl length (HL) of A. adenophora; (b) high concentration of aqueous extracts from B. oleracea waste leaves and high, moderate and low concentration of aqueous extracts from Oryza sativa straw and Triticum aestivum straw showed rather strong synthetic effects (inhibition) on GR and GI of A. adenophora, which could be chosen for the control over the seeds germination of A. adenophora; (c) high and moderate concentrations of aqueous extracts from V. cracca straw, high concentration of aqueous extracts from B. campestris waste leaves, and moderate and low concentrations of aqueous extracts from O. sativa straw and T. aestivum straw showed rather strong synthetic effects (inhibition) on RL and HL of A. adenophora, which could be selected as ideal materials for the control over the seedlings growth of A. adenophora; and (d) high concentrations of aqueous extracts from V. cracca straw, B. oleracea waste leaves and B. campestris waste leaves, and high, moderate and low concentrations of aqueous extracts from O. sativa straw and T. aestivum straw showed rather strong synthetic effects (inhibition) on GR, GI, RL and HL of A. adenophora, which could be selected as ideal materials for the control over the seeds germination and seedlings growth of A. adenophora. Thus, this study would provide a theoretic guidance and technical support for the resources utilization of crops straw (residue) and the prevention and control over invasive weeds as well.

The effects of key fabrication parameters (HF concentration, etching time and current density) on the nanostructure of PS were carefully investigated by AFM, SEM and TEM characterization. According to the experimental results, a more full-fledged model was developed to explain the crack behaviors on PS surface. The photoluminescence (PL) of resulting PS was studied by a fluorescence spectrophotometer and the results show that PL peak positions shift to shorter wavelength with the increasing current density, anodisation time and dilution of electrolyte. The PL spectra blue shift of the sample with higher porosity is confirmed by HRTEM results that the higher porosity results in smaller Si nanocrystals. A linear model (lambda(PL/nm)=620.3-0.595P, R=0.905) was established to describe the correlation between PL peak positions and porosity of PS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The taxonomic positions of the two isolates were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Cells of the two strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped. They were able to grow at 50-70 degrees C, pH 6.0-8.0 and with a NaCl tolerance up to 0.5 % (w/v). Colonies are circular, convex, non-transparent and produce yellow pigment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences comparison clearly demonstrated that strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 represent members of the genus Thermus, and they also detected low-level similarities of 16S rRNA gene sequences (below 97%) compared with all other species in this genus. Their predominant menaquinone was MK-8. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 were 65.6 mol% and 67.2 mol%, respectively. Based on the results of physiological and biochemical tests and phylogenetic analyses, strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 could not be classified as representing any species of the genus Thermus with a validly published name. Thus the two strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Thermus, for which the name Thermus caliditerrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 77925(T) (=DSM 25901(T) =CCTCC 2012061(T)).

A great challenge for the natural product community is to discover novel natural products efficiently and cost effectively. Here we report the development of a practical method to survey biosynthetic potential in microorganisms, thereby identifying the most promising strains and prioritizing them for natural product discovery. Central to our approach is the innovative preparation, by a two-tiered PCR method, of a pool of pathway-specific probes, thereby allowing the survey of all variants of the biosynthetic machineries for the targeted class of natural products. The utility of the method was demonstrated by surveying 100 strains, randomly selected from our actinomycete collection, for their biosynthetic potential of four classes of natural products, aromatic polyketides, reduced polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and diterpenoids, identifying 16 talented strains. One of the talented strains, Streptomyces griseus CB00830, was finally chosen to showcase the discovery of the targeted classes of natural products, resulting in the isolation of three diterpenoids, six nonribosomal peptides and related metabolites, and three polyketides. Variations of this method should be applicable to the discovery of other classes of natural products.

Ag NPs-CGR-NF possessed predominant conductivity, catalysis and biocompatibility and provided a hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. Chitosan (CS) was used to immobilize AChE on the surface of Ag NPs-CGR-NF/GCE to keep the AChE activities. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 133 mu M, which was then oxidized to produce a detectable and fast response. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected chlorpyrifos and carbaryl at concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10(-13) to 1 x 10(-8) M and from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-8) M. The detection limits for chlorpyrifos and carbaryl were 5.3 x 10(-14) M and 5.45 x 10(-13) M, respectively. The developed biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. This study could provide a simple and effective immobilization platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The as-synthesized FL-functionalized MOFs not only maintain an excellent FL activity and sensing selectivity derived from BPEI-CQDs but also can strongly and selectively accumulate target analytes due to the adsorption property of MOFs. The selective accumulation effect of MOFs can greatly amplify the sensing signal and specificity of the nanosized FL probe. The obtained BPEI-CQDs/ZIF-8 composites have been used to develop an ultrasensitive and highly selective sensor for Cu2+ ion, with a wide response range (2-1000 nM) and a very low detection limit (80 pM), and have been successfully applied in the detection of Cu2+. ions in environmental water samples. It is envisioned that various MOFs incorporated with FL nanostructures with high FL quantum yields and excellent selectivity would be designed and synthesized in similar ways and could be applied in sensing target analytes.

Formally, we consider the model: a digraph D = (V, A; w), a structure S and a specific material of length L, where w: A -> R+, we are asked to construct a subdigraph D' from D, having the structure S, such that each arc in D' is constructed by a part of a piece or/and some whole pieces of such a specific material, the objective is to minimize the number of pieces of such a specific material to construct all arcs in D'.

Zhongmingella has a rhizomatous stem with heterogeneous pith and cortex comprising parenchyma and uniformly distributed secretory cells, and is dictyostelic. In order to evaluate the systematic and phylogenetic position of Zhongmingella within Guaireaceae, and Guaireaceae within Osmundales, we conducted a preliminary cladistic analysis of a broad range of Osmundales and related taxa based on 18 extinct and six extant genera and subgenera. Results do not support the traditionally defined family Thamnopteroideae (Bathypteris, Chasmatopteris, Iegosigopteris, Thamnopteris, Zalesskya) and demonstrate that Thamnopteroideae is not a subfamily of Osmundaceae as previously thought. Guaireaceae is monophyletic but in addition to its traditionally defined members (Guairea, Lunea, Donwellicaulis, Itopsidema, Shuichengella, Zhongmingella) includes the stratigraphically younger genus Osmundacaulis previously placed in Osmundaceae. Guaireaceae is sister to Osmundaceae, Millerocaulis, Ashicaulis, Palaeosmunda and Aurealcaulis in the strict consensus, but in the majority-rule consensus Palaeosmunda, Aurealcaulis, Ashicaulis and Millerocaulis form the Osmundaceae stem group, with (Aurealcaulis, (Ashicaulis + Palaeosmunda)) sister to the extant genera. Stratigraphical analysis of the selected most parsimonious tree demonstrates that Osmundales underwent primary radiation during the Pennsylvanian and Permian, terminating abruptly around the time of the end-Permian mass extinction. Radiation within Osmundaceae occurred in the Triassic-Cretaceous and stratigraphically overlaps staggered extinctions in Guaireaceae and Osmundaceae from the Late Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous alongside the earliest angiosperm radiation. Our results identify the Osmundaceae stem and sister groups for the first time, and represent an important step in unravelling the evolutionary history of Osmundales. However, reconstructed whole-plant species are imperative to improve understanding of the relationships within the clade in deep time.

ON SEDIMENT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN			English	Article						sediment microbial community; PLFAs; Ceratophyllum demersum L.; submerged macrophytes	SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION PATTERNS; FATTY-ACID PROFILES; SHALLOW LAKES; BACTERIAL; SOIL; BACTERIOPLANKTON; WATER; RETENTION; TAIHU; PHYTOPLANKTON	Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used to evaluate the effects of submerged macrophytes Ceratophyllum demersum L. on sediment microbial community structure in mesocosms. Different microfloras were observed in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere sediments with C. demersum revegetation and control. More anaerobic bacteria were found in the sediment with C. demersum, especially in the non-rhizosphere sediment (P < 0.05). The monounsaturated FAs representing Gram-negative (Gram) bacteria were relatively abundant in the presence of C. demersum, while the ratios of normal saturated to monounsaturated PLFAs in the sediments (rhizosphere & non-rhizosphere) were both significantly lower than those of control (P < 0.05). A shift in composition from Gram-positive bacteria (Gram) to more Gram(-) bacteria dominated bacterial community due to C. demersum revegetation was noted. Based on the ratio of the sum of iso and anteiso fatty acids of 15:0 to 16:0 ((i15:0+a15:0)/16:0) and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H-b'), the colonization of C. demersum was determined to cause low diversity of microbial community in rhizosphere, and high diversity in non-rhizosphere.

Gandhi; Anticancer; Angiogenesis; Apoptosis; ROS; Nrf2	CANCER-CELLS; MECHANISMS; PATHWAYS; DRUGS; BCL-2; ACID	Solena amplexicaulis (Lam.) Gandhi (SA) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of dysentery, multiple abscess, gastralgia, urethritis, and eczema in the minority area of China. This study was aimed to examine the cell proliferation inhibitory activity of the SA extract (SACE) and its mechanism of action in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) and evaluate its anti-angiogenesis activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC). SACE could inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. FCM analysis showed that SACE could induce G2/M phase arrest, cell apoptosis, the mitochondrial membrane potential loss (Delta Psi m) and increase the production of intracellular ROS of HepG2 cells. After treatment with SACE, topical morphological changes of apoptotic body formation, obvious increase of apoptosis-related protein expressions, such as Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, PARP-1, and decrease of Bcl-2, procaspase-9 protein expressions were observed at the same time. Moreover, SACE caused the significant inhibition of endothelial cell migration and tube formation in HUVEC cells. The results suggested that SACE could act as an angiogenesis inhibitor and induce cell apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, SACE could be a potent candidate for the prevention and treatment of liver cancer.

Evaluating the Susceptibility of Mitochondrial DNA Germline Mutations in Chinese Cancer Patients	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Cancer; germline mutation; mitochondrial DNA; mutation pattern	HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY; ESOPHAGEAL CANCER; GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS; CLINICAL EXPRESSION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; PANCREATIC-CANCER; SOMATIC MUTATIONS; TAIHANG MOUNTAIN; PROSTATE-CANCER; MTDNA PHYLOGENY	It has been suggested that impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a common character in cancer cells, urging attention to variation on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes 13 units of the OXPHOS. However, most of mtDNA somatic mutations in cancer were suggested to result from the relaxed functional constrains and thus the byproducts of tumorigenesis. MtDNA germline mutations present not only in the cancer tissue but also in the normal tissue. However, it remains unclear whether the cancerous mtDNA germline mutations suffered similar selective constraints as the somatic mutations did. To address this question, we collected 153 whole mitochondrial genomes (including 20 newly obtained genomes in this study) from the normal tissues of cancer patients and compared with a number of 561 whole mtDNA sequences from the general population in China. Different from the observations on cancerous mtDNA somatic mutations, our results revealed that the germline mutations showed no significant difference between the cancer patients and the general population in either the sub-haplogroup composition, mutation pattern or the potential pathogenicity of the private mutations. It then seems that regulation on cellular OXPHOS level, triggered by mtDNA variation to some extent, exerts little influence on the susceptibility of cancer, which echoes the opinion that aerobic glycolysis, not mitochondrial respiration, plays the key role in generating energy in cancer cells, thus suggesting the role of most mtDNA mutations in cancer likely being overestimated.

Complex Evolutionary Patterns Revealed by Mitochondrial Genomes of the Domestic Horse	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Horse; mitochondria; population history; recombination; selection	CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; AMINO-ACID SITES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; PATERNAL INHERITANCE; NONNEUTRAL EVOLUTION; POSITIVE SELECTION; SUBSTITUTION RATES; NATURAL-SELECTION; ACCELERATED EVOLUTION	The domestic horse is the most widely used and important stock and recreational animal, valued for its strength and endurance. The energy required by the domestic horse is mainly supplied by mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, selection may have played an essential role in the evolution of the horse mitochondria. Besides, demographic events also affect the DNA polymorphic pattern on mitochondria. To understand the evolutionary patterns of the mitochondria of the domestic horse, we used a deep sequencing approach to obtain the complete sequences of 15 mitochondrial genomes, and four mitochondrial gene sequences, ND6, ATP8, ATP6 and CYTB, collected from 509, 363, 363 and 409 domestic horses, respectively. Evidence of strong substitution rate heterogeneity was found at nonsynonymous sites across the genomes. Signatures of recent positive selection on mtDNA of domestic horse were detected. Specifically, five amino acids in the four mitochondrial genes were identified as the targets of positive selection. Coalescent-based simulations imply that recent population expansion is the most probable explanation for the matrilineal population history for domestic horse. Our findings reveal a complex pattern of non-neutral evolution of the mitochondrial genome in the domestic horses.

Allopolyploidization is Not So Simple: Evidence from the Origin of the Tribe Cyprinini (Teleostei: Cypriniformes)	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Allopolyploidization; the tribe Cyprinini; matrilineal; patrilineal	CARASSIUS-AURATUS-AURATUS; ANIMAL MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; RELATIVE-RATE TEST; COMMON CARP; CLAWED FROGS; HOX GENES; EVOLUTION; NUCLEAR; PHYLOGENY; SEQUENCES	The identification of allopolyploidization events benefits from molecular dating and divergence assessments of progenitor genomes. Information on gene duplications only, either orthologs or paralogs, provides incomplete information. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA yield insights into matrilineal history, which may differ from patrilineal evolution. Two important food and pet fishes, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and goldfish (Carassius sp.), appear to have experienced allotetraploidization sometime from 12 to 20 million years ago (Ma). However, much work is necessary to detail the initial polyploidization event. Herein, we use this group of fishes as a model system to investigate competing scenarios for allopolyploidization. We analyze both the nuclear genes encoding growth hormone (GH), recombination activating protein 1 (RAG1) and HOXA2B gene, and the maternal heredited 12 concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding gene in 19 species of cyprinids and use two species in Balitoridae as outgroup taxa. Our analyses clarify the phylogenetic position of the paternal and maternal ancestors for the common carp and goldfish. The estimation of matrilineal divergence (10.71-12.42 Ma) is significantly younger than the dates of the parental ancestor divergedthat obtained by nuclear genes (16.62-19.64 Ma). Analyses of both genomes date the allopolyploidization event of the common ancestor of Cy. carpio and Ca sp. to about 10.71-12.42 Ma, which is most likely represented by maternal divergent time. The divergence of the two copies of the nuclear genes which was more ancient than the maternal markers might have been included the divergence of the progenitors' genome divergence when the allopolyploidization event occurred. Thus, the scenarios of allopolyploidzation for this group of fish can be suggested as the following: the matrilineal common ancestor of species in tribe Cyprinini might have doubled its genome by mating with a paternal ancestor in the subfamily Cyprininae, which was a sister-group that diverged around 4.20-8.93 Ma. Our work provides new evidence for the divergence dates of allopolyploidization within the Cyprinini, and documents the necessity of considering both matrilineal and patrilineal histories when investigating allopolyploidization.

Difficulties have previously arisen in broadband multiscale calculation using CEM methods. To expand the range of problems that can be calculated, we use an integral equation, domain decomposition method (DDM) and argument principle to derive the Casimir force formula. The broadband integral equation DDM, which is the augmented equivalence principle algorithm (A-EPA), allows for an efficient broadband solution of large, complex objects. A-EPA subdivides a complex problem into separate smaller subproblems that are later recombined into a reduced matrix. This yields a reduced number of unknowns for complex structures making them feasible with modest computer resources. We demonstrate the advantages of the A-EPA by simulating large, finite, 3D, unaligned corrugated plates, which have previously only been modeled approximately as infinite plates using 2D techniques.

Reappraising the Relationship Between Mitochondrial DNA Variant m.16189T > C and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in East Asian Populations	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Haplogroup; mitochondrial DNA; type 2 diabetes mellitus; m.16189T>C	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; POLYCYTOSINE TRACT; REGION SEQUENCES; BETA-CELLS; D-LOOP; PREVALENCE; IDENTIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; HAPLOGROUPS; MUTATIONS	The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant 16189T>C in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains hotly debated in the past decade. If mutation 16189T>C indeed posed a risk to T2DM, as echoed by some recent studies, correlation between this mutation and disease should be observed when carrying out a systematical study using data and samples collected in a large geographic region in China. To test this hypothesis, we first performed a linear regression analysis between the prevalence of T2DM and the allele frequency of 16189C variant in 10 East Asian populations, and further genotyped this variant in two case-control cohorts from west Han Chinese (Kunming and Xining). Linear regression analysis showed that no significant correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.211, P = 0.181), and the genotyping results indicated that the m. 16189T>C frequency difference between case and control was not significant in either populations (P = 0.38 and 0.89 for Kunming and Xining, respectively). Matrilineal backgrounds constitution (in terms of haplogroups) analysis generated a similar haplogroup distribution in both populations (P>0.1). All results failed to substantiate that m. 16189T>C may play an active role in the development of T2DM in East Asian populations.

Objective: The current study investigated the relationships of these gene loci with clinical phenotypes, including onset age, atrophic scarring, hypertrophic scarring and family history. Furthermore, we investigated the correlations between these four clinical phenotypes. Methods:W We used the)(2 test to compare the allele frequency among the different clinical phenotypes. We calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient to measure the relationship between the different clinical phenotypes. Results: We identified significant associations between the 11p11.2 locus and disease family history (p < 0.05). We also determined that hypertrophic scarring was moderately correlated with atrophic scarring (r(s) = 0.315). Conclusions: This study suggests that the susceptibility gene locus 11p11.2 may contribute to the complex phenotypes of severe acne, particularly in cases of hereditary severe acne, whereas there are also correlations between the different phenotypes.

After the experimental parameters for the preparation of Pt(IV)-IIMs such as functional monomer, molar ratio of template, monomer and cross-linking agent together with extraction condition were optimized, an electrode with good regeneration, high stability and specific recognition to Pt(IV) was obtained by modifying GCE with Pt(IV)-IIMs prepared in acetonitrile using allylurea (NAU) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linking agent, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator under the molar ratio of template (H2PtCl6), NAU and EGDMA as 1 : 4 : 40. The resulting electrode named as Pt(IV)-IIMs/GCE exhibits high response sensitivity to Pt(IV) in phosphate buffer (pH 5.29). The calibration graph for the determination of Pt(IV) by Pt(IV)-IIMs/GCE is linear in the range of 2.0 x 10(-8) similar to 2.5 x 10(-4) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 4.0 x 10(-9) mol L-1. No metal ions tested at a concentration 25 times higher than that of Pt(IV) interfered in the determination. The electrode was successfully applied to determine platinum in catalyst and plant samples with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.0% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 97.8-103.6%.

The resulting amphiphilic PUs can self assemble in water to form uniform nanospheres or nanotubes. The effect of both the EDTA-diol content in the soft chain and the hard chain content of the prepared PUs on the morphology of the nanospheres or nanotubes is extensively investigated by means of fluorescence spectrometer and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the morphology of the PU nanoarchitectures can be facilely controlled by changing the EDTA-diol content in the soft chain or the hard-chain content of the PUs. The PU nanoarchitectures gradually change from nanospheres to concentric circle-like ultrafine nanotube aggregates with an inner diameter of 8-12 nm and then to separate ultrafine nanotubes with similar inner diameters when the EDTA-diol content in the soft chain increases from 5 to 50 wt%, attributed to the enhancement of the hydrophilicity of the PUs. The prepared PUs have large potential application in the fields of drug delivery and control release, nanoreactors, and nanocatalysts.

This vegetation has been studied in detail at the 12 hectares large Oval coal deposit in the southern part of the Radnice Basin. Documentation of the fossil record in six excavations and that previously collected in the former opencast mine allowed for a detailed reconstruction of the local peat-forming lepidodendrid-cordaitalean forest structured into well-developed stories. It consists of about 33 species, which colonized the occasionally flooded planar peat swamp precursor of the Lower Radnice Coal. The canopy story of this vegetation was dominated by Lepidodendron (Paralycopodites) simile, L lycopodioides, Lepidophloios acerosus and Cordaites borassifolius. They formed a relatively dense canopy, locally interrupted with significant gaps allowing development of a rich groundcover that together with liana-like plants represents the most diverse part of the forest. A less diverse understory composed of calamites, medullosan pteridosperms and Psaronius tree ferns displays a patchy distribution pattern presumably related to density of the canopy. The minimal area that sufficiently represents the pattern of this forest phytocoenosis is estimated to be about 200 m(2), although lower stories are well represented even within much smaller areas of about 60 m(2). Slight heterogeneity in the population density of dominant taxa (Cordaites vs. lepidodendrid lycopsids) was documented across the Oval coal deposit. The fossil record of the Balka tuff bed also indicates that the coal-forest colonizing the peat swamp prior the generation of forest killed by volcanic ash fall, was destroyed, presumably due to long-lasting flooding and thus suggests that catastrophic events were probably a relatively common part of the evolution of peat-forming Pennsylvanian successions.

In the combustion process, the urea (CO(NH2)(2)) has been employed as a fuel. The obtained products appear as porous sheets formed by the interconnected and loosely packed SnO2 nanoparticles. Pt nanoparticles are assembled together with SnO2 nanoparticles in several up to tens of nanometer clusters. The as-synthesized products were used as sensing materials in the sensors to detect the isopropanol (IPA) gas. Gas sensing tests exhibited that the Pt-functionalized SnO2 are highly promising for gas sensor applications, as the operating temperature was lower than current IPA sensors and the response to IPA was significantly enhanced. The 2 wt% Pt-SnO2 sheet based gas sensor displayed a response value of 190.50 for 100 ppm IPA at an optimized operating temperature of 220 degrees C, whereas the pristine SnO2 based gas sensor only showed a response of 21.53 under the same conditions. The roles of Pt nanoparticles on electronic sensitization of SnO2, catalytic oxidation (spillover effect), and the increased quantities of oxygen species on the surface of SnO2 are plausible reasons to explain the significant enhancement in response to a Pt-functionalized SnO2 sheet based gas sensor.

In this study, two three-stage hybrid wetland systems were configured to treat aquaculture effluent. The two systems added with or without artificial aeration were operated under a high HLR (8.0 m/day) with a short retention time (0.96 h). By the results, COD could be effectively removed by both the systems, and it had been significantly enhanced by continuous aeration (air:water ratio being 7.5:1). For nitrogen (N) compounds, NH4+-N concentration of outflow compared to the inflow was elevated in most cases under the non-aerated condition, but an opposite trend was observed for the aerated state, which indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO) required for nitrification in the natural bed was more insufficient at the high organic loading rate. TN mass removal was efficient without aeration, but it significantly declined after enhancement, possibly due to the resuspension of trapped organic N promoted by the strong airflow. The artificial aeration also significantly improved the treatment performance on phosphorus. By canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), the first-order removal rate constants of various pollutants were significantly correlated to the measured environment of the inflow.

The results indicated that a water depth of 50 cm, a coverage rate of 150% and a harvest regime of 4 days were preferable conditions, under which excellent records of high-protein duckweed (dry matter production of 6.65 g/m(2)/d with crude protein content of 36.16% and phosphorus content of 1.46%) were obtained at a temperature of 12-21 degrees C. At the same time, the system achieved a removal efficiency of 66.16, 23.1, 48.3 and 76.52% for NH4+-N, TN, TP and turbidity, respectively, with the considerable removal rate of 0.465 g/m(2)/d for TN and 0.134 g/m(2)/d for TP at a hydraulic retention time of 6 days. In additionally, it was found that a lower duckweed density could lead to higher dissolved oxygen in the water and then a higher removal percentage of NH4+-N by nitrobacteria. This study obtains the preferable operation conditions for wastewater treatment and high-protein biomass production in a duckweed-based pilot-scale system, supplying an important reference for further large-scale applications of duckweed.

It is observed that the time-delay in communication channel leads to the mismatch between the plant and the controller. Such a phenomenon can be accounted for by reconstructing switching signal for the overall closed-loop system. Therefore, we derive some sufficient stability conditions by using multiple Lyapunov functions approach and, moreover, present a robust controller design methodology. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It is noted that the most outstanding feature in this area is the strong positive magnetic anomaly in Sichuan Basin, a geologically stable block. Contrasting with this feature, a strong negative anomaly can be seen nearby in Longmen Mountain block, an active block. This contradiction implies a possible relationship between the magnetic field and the geological activity. Completely different feature in magnetic field distribution is seen in the central Yunnan block, another active region, where positive and negative anomalies distribute alternatively, showing a complex magnetic anomaly map. Some fault belts, such as the Longmen Mountain fault, Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault, and the Red River fault, are the transitional zones of strong and weak or negative and positive anomalies. The corresponding relationship between the magnetic anomaly and the geophysical fields was confirmed.

In the present study, the effect of alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL), a plant-derived phytoestrogen with low side-effect on uterine and breast, on memory has been evaluated in ovariectomized (OVX) mice when using 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) as an estrogen positive control. Our findings demonstrated that OVX resulted in impaired spatial learning and memory and reduced numbers of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, while 17 beta-E2 or alpha-ZAL treatment significantly improved memory performance and restored hippocampal neurogenesis. We also found the reduction of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB expression in OVX mice, which were ameliorated by 17 beta-E2 or alpha-ZAL supplementation. These results indicated that alpha-ZAL may improve memory impairments induced by OVX and modulate the expression of BDNF-TrkB benefit to neurogenesis which may be involved in the memory protection from alpha-ZAL, in a manner similar to that of 17 beta-E2. The present findings suggested that alpha-ZAL may be a plausible substitute of 17 beta-E2 in improving memory in postmenopausal women.

However, such viewpoint just focused on water consumption from vegetation transpiration and its ecoenvironment impacts, which had not considered other attributes of vegetation, namely, water saving and drought resistance, and hydrological regulation (water conservation) into consideration. Thus, in this paper, the synthesized attributes of regional vegetation water use had been mainly discussed. The results showed that the study on such aspects as the characters of water consumption from vegetation transpiration, the potential of water saving and drought resistance, and the effects of hydrological regulation in Southwest China lagged far behind, let alone the report on synthesized attributes of water utilization with the organic combination of the three aspects above or the paralleled analysis. Accordingly, in this paper, the study on the synthesized attributes of water use by regional vegetation in Southwest China was suggested, and the objectives of such a special study were clarified, targeting the following aspects: (i) characters of water consumption from transpiration of regional typical artificial vegetation; (ii) potential of water saving and drought resistance of regional typical artificial vegetation; (iii) effects of hydrological regulation of regional typical artificial vegetation; (iv) synthesized attributes of water use by regional typical artificial vegetation. It is expected to provide a new idea for the scientific assessment on the regional vegetation ecoenvironment effects and theoretical guidance for the regional vegetation reconstruction and ecological restoration.

EEG signals are generally unstable, complex and have low signal-noise ratio, which is difficult to be analyzed and processed. To solve this problem, this paper disassembles EEG signals with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, extracts the characteristic values of the major intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and then classifies them with fuzzy C-means (FCM) method. Also, comparison research is done between the proposed method and several current EEG classification methods. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy based on the EEG signals of the second BCI competition in 2003 is up to 78%, which is superior to those of the comparative EEG classification methods.

In this study, the transport with advection and this active dilution but no dispersion, is solved using the method of characteristics. The complete solution considering initial condition, boundary condition, and production is presented. Scale analysis reveals that the model is applicable when injection of pollutants at sinkholes persists long enough but unsuitable for analysis of dye tracing experiments. An approach combining the model with dye tracing experiment is used to quickly estimate the geometry and flow of a major conduit from Ames Sink to Wakulla Spring, Northwest Florida.

Detailed structural geological mapping of fissure orientations within selected caves and of the Major stone forest was accomplished and presented as rose diagrams. Regional geological structures were compared with statistical evaluation of structural geological elements obtained from field mapping. There is a good correlation between surface and underground fissure orientations and cave passage orientations with regionally important fault zones, including the Xiaojiang Fault (N-S direction) and Red River Fault (NW-SE direction). The most frequent cave passages orientation, in a nearly N-S direction, is associated with nearly E-W compression and nearly N-S extension from late Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene. A second tectonic stage from late-Pleistocene to the present, with the tectonic stress field mainly of NNW-SSE compression and NEE-SWW extension, is in accordance with the most frequent fissure orientations in Major stone forest with a direction of N20-30 degrees W (11.4%).

Phototactic behaviour of Pachyneuron aphidis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) - hyperparasitoid of Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphidiae)	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Pachyneuron aphidis; phototaxis; monochromatic light; spectral sensitivity; light intensity	COMPOUND EYE; SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY; GIFUENSIS HYMENOPTERA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; COLOR-VISION; COLEOPTERA; EVOLUTION; LIGHT; PARASITOIDS; HOMOPTERA	We investigated the spectral sensitivity and response to light intensity of Pachyneuron aphidis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which is a common hyperparasitoid of Aphidius gifuensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a key natural enemy of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae). To do so, we used 15 monochromatic lights (emitting various specific wavelengths from 340 to 649 nm) and white light. P. aphidis adults are diurnal insects that show a positive phototaxis to a broad spectrum of light. Significant differences were found between sexes in the phototactic responses of P. aphidis to different monochromatic lights. Female P. aphidis showed four peaks of sensitivity at 380, 450, 504 and 589 nm. Male P. aphidis show two peaks of sensitivity, one at 450 nm and second at 628 nm. P. aphidis adults showed an increased phototactic response at low intensities and a decreased phototactic response at high intensities for both UV light and blue light. This experiment will help provide a scientific basis for the development of colour traps for insect pest management.

Through genome sequencing and computer-assisted recognition of modular motifs of catalytic domains, one can now confidently identify most NRPS biosynthetic genes of a fungal strain. The biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for two of the most important classes of NRP fungal derived drugs, cyclosporine and the echinocandins, have been recently characterized by genomic sequencing and annotation. Complete biosynthetic gene clusters for the pneumocandins and echinocandins have been mapped at the genetic level and functionally characterized to some extent. Genomic sequencing of representative strains of most of the variants in the echinocandin family, including the wild-type of the three fungal strains employed for industrial-scale production of caspofungin, micafungin and anidulofungin, has enabled characterization of the basic architecture of the echinocandin NRPS pathways. A comparative analysis of how pathway genes cause variations in lipoinitiation, biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acids, amino acid substitutions, and hydroxylations and sulfonations of the core peptide and contribute to the molecular diversity of the family is presented. We also review new information on the natural functions of NRPs, the differences between fungal and bacterial NRPSs, and functional characterization of selected NRPS gene clusters. Continuing discovery of the new fungal nonribosomal peptides has contributed new structural diversity and potential insights into their biological functions among other natural peptides and peptaibiotics. We therefore provide an update on new peptides, depsipeptides and peptaibols discovered in the Fungi since 2009.

Through feedback linearization, the open-loop nonlinearity is eliminated by the feedback nonlinear term. Based on the finite spectrum assignment, the quarter-car suspension system with actuator delay is converted into an equivalent delay-free one. The nonlinear control includes a linear feedback term, a feedforward compensator, and a control memory term, which can be derived from a Riccati equation and a Sylvester equation, so that the effects produced by the road disturbances and the actuator delay are compensated, respectively. A predictor is designed to implement the predictive state in the designed control. Moreover, a reduced-order observer is constructed to solve its physical unrealisability problem. The stability proofs for the zero dynamics and the closed-loop system are provided. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness and the simplicity of the designed control.

The catalytic activity of the ZnO nanocrystals with different exposed surfaces, including ZnO hexagonal nanorods with exposed reactive {0001} facets, hexagonal ZnO nanopyramids with nonpolar {01 (1) over bar0} planes, and pencil-like morphology with exposed {10 (1) over bar1} polar planes, was tested towards the degradation of the azo dyes (Congo red (CR) and methyl orange (MO)). The aqueous azo dyes can be degraded efficiently under ambient conditions, requiring neither light illumination nor additional energy (agitation, ultrasonic, etc.). Systematic experiments suggested that the dye degradation proceeds through electron transfers from the anionic dye molecules to the catalyst and then to electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen. It strongly depends on the exposed polar surfaces of the ZnO nanocrystals, giving rise to the relatively higher catalytic activity and stability of the ZnO hexagonal nanopencils. The present ZnO nanorod arrays grown on the Zn substrate require no additional reagents or external energy input, which thus provides a potentially low-cost alternative for the remediation of azo-dye effluents.

The results show that the existence of benzotriazole or 1,2,3-triazole ring and substitution of the triazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl, 4-bromophenacyl or 4-methylbenzyl group could be crucial for promoting cytotoxic activity. Compounds 18, 19, 20 and 25 were found to have the most potent activities selectively against HL-60, SMMC-7721 and MCF-7 cell lines respectively. In particular, compound 20 was more selective towards HL-60 and A549 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.62 and 1.60 mu M.

To predict an ad's CTR, historical click information is frequently concerned. To accurately predict the CTR of the new ads is challenging and critical for real world applications, since we do not have plentiful historical data about these ads. Adopting Bayesian network (BN) as the effective framework for representing and inferring dependencies and uncertainties among variables, in this paper, we establish a BN-based model to predict the CTRs of new ads. First, we built a Bayesian network of the keywords that are used to describe the ads in a certain domain, called keyword BN and abbreviated as KBN. Second, we proposed an algorithm for approximate inferences of the KBN to find similar keywords with those that describe the new ads. Finally based on the similar keywords, we obtain the similar ads and then calculate the CTR of the new ad by using the CTRs of the ads that are similar with the new ad. Experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of our method.

(3+1)-dimensional Yu-Toda-Sasa-Fukuyama (YTSF) equation is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method. A new family of two-wave solution, rational breather wave solution, is obtained by extended homoclinic test method, and it is just a rogue wave solution. This result shows rogue wave can come from extreme behavior of breather solitary wave for (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave fields.

The main goal of this work was thus to describe the present water quality and metazooplankton dynamics and to evaluate the effects of damming on aquatic ecosystem in the super reservoir. The water quality including conductivity, turbidity, Chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and metazooplankton communities were surveyed along the 30 km away from the dam in the reservoir from 2011 to 2012. Throughout our study, most of the water quality parameters showed clear temporal changes. The total nitrogen and phosphorus showed mean values of 0.9 and 0.04 mg L-1 at different sites. The dominated species of zooplankton showed typical seasonal succession. The most important factor in the determination of zooplankton throughout the year is water temperature and Chlorophyll a. The spatial distribution of water quality parameters and zooplankton communities fluctuated considerably among different sites. However, it is difficult to explain these spatial changes which may relate to the unstable water conditions. Our results showed that the area along the 30 km away from the dam of Xiaowan Reservoir belonged to lake-type environment. More attention should be paid on the aquatic ecosystems of the reservoirs which belong to the gorge area with high mountains and steep valleys.

The self-consistent reaction field method was employed with the polarisable continuum model to simulate the implicit solvent effects. The specific water molecules explicitly added in the computational models were found to play the role of catalyst that assists the proton transfer from amino nitrogen to carbonyl oxygen. In the absence of specific water molecules, the activation energy was calculated to be 134.2 kJ mol(-1) at the MP2/6-31+G** level, while in the presence of one and two water molecules the barriers were lowered to be 62.7 and 52.9 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The nucleophilic attack precedes the proton transfer, and the proton donation from water to carbonyl oxygen is ahead of the proton abstraction from the amino group. The potential energy profiles show that a zwitterionic-like intermediate previously found in the reactions of formaldehyde with ammonia and methylamine does not exist on the PES of the present reaction, indicating the reaction occurs with a concerted mechanism of asynchronous character.

The results show that the OH- anion can abstract a proton from urea, forming the urea anion. The calculated energies indicate the hydrogen bonds formed between the reactants and solvent water molecules affect both the potential and thermodynamic energy barriers. The changing trend of the barriers appears to be 1W > 2W > 3W > 0W. A fast equilibrium can be established between the reactants and the products but the reverse reaction is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favourable, suggesting that the concentration of urea anion in alkaline solution would be low, in agreement with known weak acidity. The results of this study suggest that for reaction systems involving strongly polar reactants and solvent, the employment of only implicit solvent model is not enough, and explicit solvent molecules must be included.

This paper mainly analyses the trend of water level time series in the region during the past decades, and assesses the temporal and spatial variation of water level and indicators of hydrological alteration. The results show that there is a trend of increasing water level. Bigger slope and higher significant level can be observed in monthly minimum than in monthly maximum water level, in peri-urban than in urban areas. Meanwhile, it is observed that the mean monthly minimum and maximum water level increased in both urban and peri-urban regions, while decreased coefficients of variation (C-v) in urban and increased C-v in peri-urban regions were calculated. Most indicators of hydrologic alteration in urban stations are concentrated to the range of variability approach target, while most indicators are discrete in peri-urban stations. And the degree of hydrologic alteration is higher in peri-urban than in urban regions.

Much effort has been made to search for external mechanisms. Multiple strains of an infectious agent were usually observed and coinfections were frequent; further, empirical evidence indicates the simultaneous transmission of coinfections. To explore intrinsic mechanisms for epidemic cycling, in this study we consider a multistrain Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemic model by including coinfections and simultaneous transmission. We show that coinfections and their simultaneous transmission widen the parameter range for coexistence and coinfections become popular when strains enhance each other and the immunity wanes quickly. However, the total prevalence is nearly independent of these characteristics and approximated by that of one-strain model. With sufficient simultaneous transmission and antigenic diversity, cyclical epidemics can be generated even when strains interfere with each other by reducing infectivity. This indicates that strain interactions within coinfections and cross-immunity during subsequent infection provide a possible intrinsic mechanism for epidemic cycling.

Despite the intense interest, the underlying molecular mechanism in smoking-related diseases is incompletely understood. Here, we show that Lyn is involved in cytotoxicity of respiratory epithelial cells induced by cigarette smoke extracts (CSE), an in vitro culture model for evaluating tobacco toxicity. In addition, exposure to CSE promotes the activation of JAK2 and STAT1, which is responsible for CSE-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, a Lyn specific siRNA, Lyn dominant negative construct and pharmacological inhibitor all alleviated CSE-induced cytotoxicity in lung cells to different extents, respectively. Furthermore, Lyn also influences the phagocytosis of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages, extending its impact on innate immunity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Lyn may play a role in the regulation of cigarette smoking-induced lung cell death, and may be a potential novel therapeutic target for cigarette smoking related lung diseases.

In order to reduce energy consumption, some nodes in the network will work together as a coalition but will not work independently. In this paper, towards forming coalitions, an energy-efficient coalition game model is proposed based on the Markov process and from the theoretic point of view. First, we propose the performance measure of the Markov process states based on the concept of absorbing coefficient and bargaining set. Consequently, we give a simulation algorithm to calculate the absorbing coefficient and simulate the forming process of the coalitions. Moreover, to determine the strategies of coalitions to ensure the WSNs' reachability, we give the genetic-algorithm based method for calculating the approximate Nash equilibrium. Experimental results show that our model can guarantee longer lifetime and effective reachability for WSNs.

On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data, the isolate was considered to be a member of the genus Bacillus. The organism grew optimally at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0. It was moderately halophilic and its optimum growth occurred at 5-10% NaCl. The diamino acid found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid and the predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-15:0 and the polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 48.6 mol%. Strain HNA-14(T) exhibited a low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96% with its nearest neighbors [Bacillus clausii KSM-K16 (96.5%), Bacillus xiaoxiensis DSM 21943(T) (96.2%), Bacillus clausii DSM 8716(T) (96.1%), Bacillus patagoniensis PAT05(T) (96.1%), Bacillus lehensis MLB-2(T) (96.0%), Bacillus oshimensis K11(T) (95.9%) and Bacillus hunanensis DSM 23008(T) (95.8%)] and the phenotypic characteristics indicate that strain HNA-14(T) can be distinguished from them. Therefore, a novel species of the genus Bacillus, Bacillus shacheensis sp. nov. (type strain, HNA-14(T) = KCTC 33145 = DSM 26902) is proposed.

J	Li, J; Yue, K; Liu, WY; Liu, Q				Li, Jin; Yue, Kun; Liu, Weiyi; Liu, Qing			Game-Theoretic Based Distributed Scheduling Algorithms for Minimum Coverage Breach in Directional Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								A directional sensor network, where a lot of sensors are intensively and randomly deployed, is able to enhance coverage performances, since working directions can be partitioned into different K covers which are activated in a round-robin fashion. In this paper, we consider the problem of direction set K-Cover for minimum coverage breach in directional sensor networks. First, we formulate the problem as a game called direction scheduling game (DSG), which we prove as a potential game. Thus, the existence of pure Nash equilibria can be guaranteed, and the optimal coverage is a pure Nash equilibrium, since the potential function of DSGs is consistent with the coverage objective function of the underlying network. Second, we propose the synchronous and asynchronous game-theoretic based distributed scheduling algorithms, which we prove to converge to pure Nash equilibria. Third, we present the explicit bounds on the coverage performance of the proposed algorithms by theoretical analysis of the algorithms' coverage performance. Finally, we show experimental results and conclude that the Nash equilibria can provide a near-optimal and well-balanced solution.

Firstly, amorphous hollow (NiCox)O(OH) nanoboxes form uniformly, and subsequent calcination results in the formation of NiCo2O4 nanocubes that exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 1160 mA h g(-1) at constant current density of 200 mA g(-1) with capacity retention of over 91.1% after 200 cycles. The unique hollow structure can shorten the Li-ion diffusion path, which benefits the rate of performance. Furthermore, the hollow structure offers a sufficient void space to alleviate the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Additionally, the multi-element characteristics of active materials allow the volume change to take place in a stepwise manner. Therefore, hollow crossed NiCo2O4 nanocube electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. This method is simple and of low cost, which may open a new avenue for fast synthesis of hollow crossed structural nano-functional materials for energy storage, catalysts, sensors and other new applications.

In this study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HsfA1a. One transgenic line showed a 94-fold increase in the level of HsfA1a mRNA (OE line 1). Overexpressing HsfA1a in OE line 1 plants resulted in higher levels of the inducible expression of Hsp18.2 and Hsp70 genes in response to heat stress, low/high pH changes, and hydrogen peroxide. Analysis of in vivo HsfA1a-promoter binding suggested that the higher level of inducible Hsp expression was mediated by stress-induced activation of elevated levels of HsfA1a in the OE plants. The OE plants showed an increase in tolerance to low/high pH changes and hydrogen peroxide, in addition to heat shock. These results revealed that overexpressing HsfA1a had positive effects on tolerance to diverse stressors by promoting inducible Hsp expression following stress-induced HsfA1a activation. This study suggests a different mechanism for the activation of genetically engineered Hsfs from that suggested in previous reports, thus providing new insight into complex mechanisms used for achieving stress tolerance by genetic engineering.

In addition to the adiponectin gene, several other genes have been postulated to influence plasma adiponectin levels. In this study, we investigated two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4311394 and rs4783244, located intronically in the ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 15 (ARL15) and the T-cadherin (CDH13) genes, respectively. These SNPs were detected in a Han Chinese population using a TaqMan assay and evaluated for association with T2DM as well as with individual metabolic traits. Allele frequencies for rs4311394 were significantly different in T2DM and nondiabetes (NDM) groups (chi(2) = 4.49, P = 0.034). However, neither allele nor genotype frequencies for rs4783244 were associated with T2DM (chi(2) = 0.33, P = 0.56 and chi(2) = 2.35, P = 0.31 respectively). The SNPs did not exhibit significant association with individual metabolic traits in the T2DM and NDM groups. Our results indicated that the G allele of the rs4311394 might be a susceptibility factor for T2DM in the Han Chinese population (odds ratio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.41).

The results suggest that the existence of the 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a 2-naphthylmethyl or 4-methylbenzyl group were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. Compound 43 was found to be the most potent derivative and exhibited cytotoxic activities selectively against breast carcinoma (MCF-7), colon carcinoma (SW480), myeloid leukaemia (HL-60) and lung carcinoma (A549) with an IC50 value 65.0-fold, 48.5-fold, 21.2-fold and 19.9-fold more sensitive to DDP, respectively.

Of these properties we pay special attention to the global ones. We first provide a result on a certain relationship between two nonnegative piecewise linear numerical functions for which the kernel of one of them is contained in the kernel of the other. Using this result, we establish the bounded/global metric subregularity results for a piecewise linear multifunction with respect to a piecewise linear set. As applications, we study the weak sharp minimum property for a piecewise linear constrained multiobjective optimization problem.

A possible reason is that in a general Banach space (such as in the classical Banach spaces l(p) and L-p with 1 <= p < 2), the proximal normal cone of a "smooth" subset A at every point of A may consist of the zero element only. Nevertheless, on the other hand, we show in this paper that for a fairly big class of smooth Banach spaces (including the classical Banach spaces l(p) and L-p with 2 <= p < infinity), the consideration of proximal normal cones provides a lot of useful information, especially for leading to satisfactory treatment for constrained optimization problems. Some of our results are new even in the Hilbert space case.

Only 5 phr of SMPF is able to greatly improve the tensile strength of EPDM from 5 MPa to 28 MPa, which is 55% higher than that of EPDM filled with 30 phr of carbon black N330, and it still retains a high elongation of more than 600%. The scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction results reveal the reinforcement mechanism of EPDM. SMPF is uniformly dispersed in the EPDM matrix by a conventional Banbury mixer and is dynamically cross-linked to form a greatly expanded hard phase comprising the interpenetrating polymer networks of EPDM and SMPF during the mixing process, which leads to a high modulus. The high tensile strength is attributed to the strain-induced crystallization of EPDM at high strain according to the X-ray diffraction patterns of the stretched EPDM-SMPF composites. These results reveal the high efficient reinforcement of the thermoset resin in rubber, demonstrate a new mechanism of rubber reinforcement and suggest a new direction for rubber reinforcement.

Existing analytical studies of Chord protocol have shown some potential improvements in performance. In this paper a splay tree-based new Chord structure called SChord is proposed to improve the efficiency of locating resources. We consider a novel implementation of the Chord finger table (routing table) based on the splay tree. This approach extends the Chord finger table with additional routing entries. Adaptive routing algorithm is proposed for implementation, and it can be shown that hop count is significantly minimized without introducing any other protocol overheads. We analyze the hop count of the adaptive routing algorithm, as compared to Chord variants, and demonstrate sharp upper and lower bounds for both worst-case and average case settings. In addition, we theoretically analyze the hop reducing in SChord and derive the fact that SChord can significantly reduce the routing hops as compared to Chord. Several simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and support our analytical findings. The simulation results show the efficiency of SChord.

Platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) were also synthesized on carboxylic silica nanosheets (CSNSs). An acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor based on a Pt NP, CSNS, and Nafion nanocomposite-modified glass carbon electrode was successfully developed. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and catalyzed the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 125 mu M. Under optimal conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion and carbaryl in the range of 1.0 x 10(-12) M to 1 x 10(-8) M. The detection limits for methyl parathion and carbaryl were 5.52 x 10(-13) and 5.65 x 10(-13) M, respectively. The developed biosensor was inexpensive and exhibited good sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility, thus providing a promising tool for the analysis of enzyme inhibitors. A simple and effective immobilization platform was also provided for effectively immobilizing the enzyme on the electrode surface.

Based on the expression, we design a thermal cloak with a non conformal section profile. Results of full wave simulation show that the cloak possesses heat protection function, since it is capable of guiding heat fluxes to travel around its inner domain, leaving the inner region untouched; meanwhile, the heat fluxes return to their original pathways, resulting in a perfect thermal invisible effect. Arbitrary shaped cylindrical thermal cloak with conformal or non-conformal cross section can be designed based on the derived thermal conductivity expression, and all of them have perfect thermal protection and invisibility functions. It is indicated that the derived conductivity expression is applicable to designing cylindrical thermal cloaks with an arbitrary cross section. The generality of this method has been confirmed, and it may have potential applications in the designing of thermal protection devices for computer chips and satellite, etc.	[Mao Fu-Chun; Li Ting-Hua; Huang Ming; Yang Jing-Jing] Yunnan Univ, Wireless Innovat Lab, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Chen Jun-Chang] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Elect Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China	Huang, M (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Wireless Innovat Lab, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.	huangming@ynu.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61161007, 61261002]; Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province, China [2013FA006]; Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2011FB018]	Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61161007, 61261002), the Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province, China (Grant No. 2013FA006), and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province, China (Grant No. 2011FB018).		28	13	16	0	29	CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC	BEIJING	P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA	1000-3290			ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED	Acta Phys.

As a consequence, males should optimize the use of their sperm to maximize their reproductive outputs in their lifetime. However, experimental evidence on this prediction is largely lacking. Here, we examine how a male moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) responds to the presence of rivals or additional mates and how such response influences his lifetime reproductive fitness. We show that when rival males are present around a copulating pair, the male ejaculates more sperm to win a sperm competition battle but in such an environment he inseminates fewer females, sires fewer offspring and lives shorter. The opposite is the case when additional females are present during copulation. These findings reveal that elevated reproductive expenditure owing to sperm competition intensity is made at the expense of longevity and future reproduction.

One of its precursors, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate, can be synthesized from chorismate by the classical MK pathway. Interestingly, in some bacteria, chorismate can also be converted to 1,4-dihydroxy-6-naphthoate by four enzymes encoded by mqnABCD in an alternative futalosine pathway. In this study, six crucial enzymes belonging to these two independent nonhomologous pathways were identified in the predicted proteomes of prokaryotes representing a broad phylogenetic distribution. Although the classical MK pathway was found in 32.1% of the proteomes, more than twice the proportion containing the futalosine pathway, the latter was found in a broader taxonomic range of organisms (18 of 31 phyla). The prokaryotes equipped with the classical MK pathway were almost all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, but those with the futalosine pathway were not only aerobic or facultatively anaerobic but also anaerobic. Phylogenies of enzymes of the classical MK pathway indicated that its genes in archaea were probably acquired by an ancient horizontal gene transfer from bacterial donors. Therefore, the organization of the futalosine pathway likely predated that of the classical MK pathway in the evolutionary history of prokaryotes.

They develop from protodermal cells after unequal divisions followed by an equal division and differentiation. The concentration of the hormone auxin, a master plant developmental regulator, is tightly controlled in time and space, but its role, if any, in stomatal formation is obscure. Here dynamic changes of auxin activity during stomatal development are monitored using auxin input (DII-VENUS) and output (DR5:VENUS) markers by time-lapse imaging. A decrease in auxin levels in the smaller daughter cell after unequal division presages the acquisition of a guard mother cell fate whose equal division produces the two guard cells. Thus, stomatal patterning requires auxin pathway control of stem cell compartment size, as well as auxin depletion that triggers a developmental switch from unequal to equal division.

In this paper, we verify the SWGM with a square resonator based on two-dimensional LC network in radio frequency band. The equivalent node voltage distribution matrix of this resonator is derived. Results show that node voltage can be amplified when the square resonator is covered with a layer of double negative metamaterials. The performance of the metamaterial resonator as a dielectric sensor with excellent sensitivity has been demonstrated. This work may put a great step toward the realization of SWGM sensors using metamaterials. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to examine the morphology and microstructure of the composites. XRD analysis revealed that the two phases were composed of well crystallized ZnO and poorly crystallized Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O. Ni(OH)(2)/ZnO composites showed a red shift in band edge absorption peak in the UV-vis absorbance spectrum, which enhanced their photocatalytic activity. The composites were used for the photodecolourization of water solution of representative organic azo dyes (rhodamine B (RB), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO)) under visible light. All synthesized composites showed better photodegradation performance compared to either pure ZnO or Ni(OH)(2). It was noted that composites removal rate strongly depended on the Ni(OH)(2) content. When Ni(OH)(2) fraction was 10 wt% composites exhibited maximum photodegradation performance for all organic azo dyes. Finally, the possible formation mechanism of the Ni(OH)(2)/ZnO composites and their photocatalytic decomposition mechanism were also proposed and discussed.

A linear Ohmic current-voltage (IV) characteristic was observed in a single carrier electron-only device. This Ohmic characteristics is explained as due to pinning of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of C-60 at the Fermi level of the ITO. This proposed energy-level alignment at the interface has been confirmed by ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). Potential device application of ITO/C-60 as a cathode for electrons injection in organic light-emitting diode is demonstrated. (c) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All tights reserved.	[Liu, T.

Platinum are preconcentrated on multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the form of (L-2 center dot H3O+)(2)PtCl26-ion-pairs, where L = heptyl octyl sulfoxide and water was used as eluent. The effects of various parameters such as acidity, flow rate of sample, type of eluent, amount of adsorbent and interfering ions have been studied. The platinum in 100 mL solution can be concentrated to 2 mL, representing an enrichment factor of 50 was achieved. The detection limit and quantification limit of the method were found to be 0.06 and 0.2 mu g L-1, respectively. The analytical results for the certified reference sample (GBW07292) was in a good agreement with the certified value. The relative standard deviation for ten replicate measurements of 1 mu g L-1 platinum was 4.5 %. The proposed method was successfully applied to the extraction and determination of trace amount platinum in different samples.

The logistic regression model is employed to model the missing data mechanisms for missing covariates and responses. A hybrid sampling procedure combining the Gibber sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented to draw observations from the conditional distributions. Because missing data mechanism is not testable, we develop the logarithm of the pseudo-marginal likelihood, deviance information criterion, the Bayes factor, and the pseudo-Bayes factor to compare several competing missing data mechanism models in the current considered NRDMMs with nonignorable missing covaraites and responses.

For a given positive integer d, the subdivision-constrained routing requests problem (SCRR, for short) is to find a directed subgraph D'=(V',A') of D, satisfying the two constraints: (1) Each request (s (i) ,t (i) ;B (i) ) has a path P (i) from s (i) to t (i) in D' with length no more than B (i) ; (2) Insert some nodes uniformly on each arc eaA' to ensure that each new arc has length no more than d. The objective is to minimize the total number of the nodes inserted on the arcs in A'. We obtain the following three main results: (1) The SCRR problem is at least as hard as the set cover problem even if each request has the same source s, i.e., s (i) =s for each i=1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,k; (2) For each request (s,t;B), we design a dynamic programming algorithm to find a path from s to t with length no more than B such that the number of the nodes inserted on such a path is minimized, and as a corollary, we present a k-approximation algorithm to solve the SCRR problem for any k requests; (3) We finally present an optimal algorithm for the case where contains all possible requests (s (i) ,t (i) ) in VxV and B (i) is equal to the length of the shortest path in D from s (i) to t (i) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the dynamic programming algorithm within polynomial time in (2) is designed for a weighted optimization problem while previous optimal algorithms run in pseudo-polynomial time.

POSSIBLE ALGAL ORIGIN AND LIFE CYCLE OF EDIACARAN DOUSHANTUO MICROFOSSILS WITH DEXTRAL SPIRAL STRUCTURE	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY			English	Article							ANIMAL EMBRYOS; FOSSILS; EVOLUTION; MIDDLE; ULTRASTRUCTURE; PALEONTOLOGY; GERMINATION; GUIZHOU; CHINA	In Ediacaran shallow-water dolomites of the Doushantuo Formation (ca. 570 Ma) of southern China, scarce phosphatized microfossils consisting of clusters of coil-like spheroids called Spiralicellula bulbifera and co-occurring spherical forms with helically arranged holes named Helicoforamina wenganica are interpreted to belong to the same taxon because both have a similar relative abundance and both, uniquely in the assemblage, exhibit a consistent dextral spiral feature-the oldest known fossil examples of fixed asymmetry. Thus, we interpret them as different stages of sexual and asexual life cycles in which the spiral structure was maintained throughout most of the developmental phases. While they can be placed with the acritarchs, we suggest they are a chlorophycean green alga, and like many Ediacaran macrofossils, may represent an extinct clade. This is compatible with the shoal-water marine depositional environment in which they lived, as it would have favored photosynthetic organisms over others kinds of encysting non-metazoan protists. This setting militates against their interpretation as putative embryos which has been put forward for a variety of forms co-occurring in the microfossil assemblage. The multiple affinities of the strikingly diverse biota remain far from resolved, but algal origins warrant further consideration.

The reaction was readily performed by reacting inexpensive materials, 4-chloro-3-formylcoumarin and HKAs, in EtOH catalyzed by Et3N. This protocol has many advantages including convenient operation, short reaction times, green solvent, and simple purification by washing the crude products with 95% EtOH, defined as GAP (Group-Assistant-Purification) chemistry.

Bacillus enclensis sp nov., isolated from sediment sample	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bacillus sp; Marine sediment; Polyphasic	DNA-BASE COMPOSITION; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GENUS; IDENTIFICATION; STRAINS; ACID; SOIL	A novel bacterial strain, designated SGD-1123(T) was isolated from Chorao Island, in Goa Province, India. The strain was found to be able to grow at 15-42 A degrees C, pH 5-12 and 0-12 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole cell hydrolysates were found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, galactose and arabinose. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-15:0, MK-7 was identified as the predominant menaquinone and the predominant polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 44.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the isolate within the genus Bacillus and further revealed that strain SGD-1123(T) had highest sequence similarity with Bacillus aquimaris, and forms a separate clade with its closest relatives i.e. B. aquimaris, Bacillus vietnamensis and Bacillus marisflavi, with which it shares 94.5, 94.1 and 94.1 % similarity respectively. The phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses indicated that strain SGD-1123(T) represents a novel species within the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus enclensis is proposed. The type strain is SGD-1123(T) (NCIM 5450(T)=CCTCC AB 2011125(T)).

J	Cao, J; Yao, P; Wang, L; Liu, K				Cao, Jie; Yao, Ping; Wang, Lin; Liu, Kui			Summer Rainfall Variability in Low-Latitude Highlands of China and Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Climate variability	MONSOON; PACIFIC; IMPACTS; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; EVENTS	Based on reanalysis and observational datasets, this study proposes a reasonable mechanism for summer rainfall variations over the low-latitude highlands (LLH) of China, in which a subtropical Indian Ocean dipole (SIOD)-like pattern is the key external thermal forcing. In summers with a positive SIOD-like pattern, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies may lead to lower-tropospheric divergence over the tropical Indian Ocean and convergence over the subtropical southwestern Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. The convergence over the Arabian Sea can induce easterly anomalies of the divergent wind component off the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal (BOB), while the divergence over the tropical Indian Ocean can change the interhemispheric vertical circulation and produce a descending motion over the same area and cyclonic anomalies in the rotational wind component over the Indian peninsula. The combined effect of the divergent and rotational wind anomalies and enhanced interhemispheric vertical circulation facilitates easterly anomalies and weakens climatological water vapor flux to the northern BOB. Therefore, anomalous water vapor divergence and less precipitation are observed over the LLH. In summers with a negative SIOD-like pattern, the situation is approximately the same but with opposite polarity and a weaker role of the divergent wind component. Further analyses indicate that the summertime SIOD-like pattern can be traced to preceding seasons, especially in positive SIOD-like years. The SST-wind-evaporation feedback mechanism could account for maintenance of the SIOD-like pattern. These results provide efficient prediction potential for summer rainfall variations over the LLH.

Such data are also often subject to right censoring due to loss of follow-up or the end of study. In this paper, we consider a proportional hazards model with varying coefficients for right-censored and length-biased data, which is used to study the interact effect nonlinearly of covariates with an exposure variable. A local estimating equation method is proposed for the unknown coefficients and the intercept function in the model. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established by using the martingale theory and kernel smoothing techniques. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators have an excellent finite-sample performance. The Channing House data is analyzed to demonstrate the applications of the proposed method.

The molecular dynamics of dopamine diffusion within and permeation through, cell membranes are involved in smoothing dopamine molecular protective channels, associated with schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. In the present work, using a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphatedylcholine (POPC) phospholipid bilayer membrane to model the cell membrane, we obtained the free-energy changes (Delta G) for dopamine diffusion within and permeation through the cell membrane, using molecular dynamics simulations, and probed the molecular dynamics of dopamine diffusion and permeation. The obtained values of Delta G for dopamine diffusion within the cell membrane were 10-54 kJ.mol(-1) at 310 K, which implies that dopamine diffuses easily horizontally and vertically within the cell membrane to protect smoothing of the protective channel. However, it is not easy for dopamine to permeate through the cell membrane, because Delta G for this process was 117-125 kJ.mol(-1) (310 K). Superfluous dopamine passes through the dopamine molecular protective channel and enters the middle region of the phospholipid bilayer membrane, and then diffuses easily along the horizontal and vertical orientations within the cell membrane, even permeating through the cell membrane, preventing schizophrenia. It is therefore important for the normal function of a biological cell membrane to protect smoothing of dopamine molecular protective channels, preventing schizophrenia. These results are in agreement with other experimental observations.

Here, we carried out a series of experiments to determine the functions of MAG secretions on modulating female post-mating behavior in the moth Spodoptera litura. Results showed that females injected with MAG secretions called and mated significantly less than controls in the night after treatment, which were independent of mechanical stimulation during mating and the presence of sperm. However, a successful mating resulted in a longer loss in sexual receptivity (lasting to the second night after mating). This study also demonstrated that MAG secretions not only triggered oviposition but also promoted egg development, which also were not dependent on mechanical stimulation during mating and the presence of sperm. MAG secretions also showed negative effect on female longevity, which may be because MAG secretions stimulate females to allocate more resources to egg development and oviposition, leaving fewer resources for survival. Results of this study also suggest that oviposition behaviors incur energy costs. The hypothesis that virgin females may conduct oosorption to prolong longevity is not supported.

The simulation results indicate that: (i) multiplicative noise can produce the NES effect only for the larger lambda, while additive noise always induces the NES effect; (ii) for the NES phenomenon induced by additive noise, there is a characteristic value of tau, below which the increasing of tau enhances it and above which the effect of tau reverses; however, the increasing of tau can only enhance the NES effect induced by multiplicative noise; (iii) increasing lambda weakens the NES effect induced by additive noise and strengthens that induced by multiplicative noise; and (iv) the RA effect becomes more and more pronounced while the RA minimum of the mean first-passage time increases with the increase of lambda or tau.

SNPs in the promoter region of the CETP gene is likely important in regulation of the expression of the CETP gene. To explore the potential effects of the promoter polymorphisms in the CETP gene on longevity, we investigated the promoter polymorphisms in a sample of long-lived (a parts per thousand yen90 years old) Han Chinese collected from Southwestern China (N = 380). By resequencing 934 bp of the promoter region, genotypes of four SNPs (-573A/G, -629A/C, -971A/G, -1046T/C) were examined in this sample. However, no association could be confirmed between longevity and these SNPs or haplotypes inferred from them. A novel rare variant -573A/G was found and was found in heterozygote state only in five persons in the Longevity group. But it was not statistically significant (p = 0.075). We also examined this novel polymorphism -573A/G in another Han Chinese sample from Yunnan province, and it was not associated with longevity. The results from both samples suggest that there is likely no association of the CETP gene promoter polymorphisms with longevity, at least among Han Chinese.

Phase-averaged gamma-ray spectra from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; pulsars: general	LARGE-AREA TELESCOPE; RAPIDLY SPINNING PULSARS; RESOLVED X-RAY; CRAB PULSAR; LIGHT CURVES; SLOT GAPS; OUTER MAGNETOSPHERE; UNASSOCIATED SOURCES; ENERGETIC RADIATION; TIMING OBSERVATIONS	Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected pulsed gamma-ray emissions with high confidences from more than 40 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Here we study the phase-averaged gamma-ray properties of MSPs by using revised version of a self-consistent outer gap model. In this model, a strong multipole magnetic field near the stellar surface for an MSP is assumed and such a field will be close to the surface magnetic fields (similar to 10(11)-10(12) G) of young pulsars; the outer gap of an MSP is controlled by photon-photon pair production process, where the effects of magnetic inclination angle (alpha) and magnetic geometry have been taken into account. Therefore, the fractional size of the outer gap is a function of not only pulsar's period and magnetic field strength but also magnetic inclination angle and radial distance to the neutron star; the inner boundary of the outer gap can be estimated by the pair production process of the gamma-ray photons which are produced by the back-flowing particles through the null charge surface; inside the outer gap, a Gaussian distribution of the parallel electric field along the trans-field thickness is assumed, and the gamma-ray emission is represented by the emission from the average radial distance along the central field lines of the outer gap. Using this model, the phase-averaged gamma-ray spectra are calculated and compared with the observed spectra of 37 MSPs given by the second Fermi-LAT catalogue of gamma-ray pulsars; our results show that the Fermi-LAT results can be well explained by this model. The thermal X-ray emission properties from MSPs are also investigated.	[Jiang, Z. J.; Chen, S. B.; Li, X.; Zhang, L.] Yunnan Univ, Dept Phys, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Z.

However, in many practical cases, one may wish to reject some requests, which results in a penalty cost. We introduce the ring loading problem with penalty cost, which generalizes the well-known ring loading problem (Schrijver et al., 1999 [14]). We prove that this problem is NP-hard even if the demand can be split, and design a 1.58-approximation algorithm for the integer demand splittable case and a (1.58 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the demand unsplittable case, for any given number epsilon > 0.

A Further Study of Almost Periodic Time Scales with Some Notes and Applications	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article							DYNAMIC EQUATIONS; AUTOMORPHIC SOLUTIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DELAYS	We introduce three equivalent concepts of almost periodic time scales as a further study of the corresponding concept proposed in Li and Wang (2011) and several examples of almost periodic time scales which are not periodic are provided. Furthermore, the concepts of almost periodic functions are redefined under the sense of this new timescale concept. Finally, almost periodicity of Cauchy matrix for dynamic equations is proved under these new definitions. Based on these results, the existence of almost periodic solutions to a class of nonlinear dynamic equations is investigated by the almost periodicity of Cauchy matrix on almost periodic time scales. Besides, as an application, we apply our results to a class of high-order Hopfield neural networks.

J	Cao, JW; Xiong, LL				Cao, Jiuwen; Xiong, Lianglin			Protein Sequence Classification with Improved Extreme Learning Machine Algorithms	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							REGRESSION	Precisely classifying a protein sequence from a large biological protein sequences database plays an important role for developing competitive pharmacological products. Comparing the unseen sequence with all the identified protein sequences and returning the category index with the highest similarity scored protein, conventional methods are usually time-consuming. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to build an efficient protein sequence classification system. In this paper, we study the performance of protein sequence classification using SLFNs. The recent efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) and its invariants are utilized as the training algorithms. The optimal pruned ELM is first employed for protein sequence classification in this paper. To further enhance the performance, the ensemble based SLFNs structure is constructed where multiple SLFNs with the same number of hidden nodes and the same activation function are used as ensembles. For each ensemble, the same training algorithm is adopted. The final category index is derived using the majority voting method. Two approaches, namely, the basic ELM and the OP-ELM, are adopted for the ensemble based SLFNs. The performance is analyzed and compared with several existing methods using datasets obtained from the Protein Information Resource center. The experimental results show the priority of the proposed algorithms.

High-Throughput Flow Cytometry Screening Reveals a Role for Junctional Adhesion Molecule A as a Cancer Stem Cell Maintenance Factor	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA; JAM-A; GLIOBLASTOMA; BRAIN; INTEGRINS; MARKERS; TUMORS; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Stem cells reside in niches that regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The identity of a stem cell is linked with the ability to interact with its niche through adhesion mechanisms. To identify targets that disrupt cancer stem cell (CSC) adhesion, we performed a flow cytometry screen on patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) cells and identified junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) as a CSC adhesion mechanism essential for self-renewal and tumor growth. JAM-A was dispensable for normal neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) function, and JAM-A expression was reduced in normal brain versus GBM. Targeting JAM-A compromised the self-renewal of CSCs. JAM-A expression negatively correlated to GBM patient prognosis. Our results demonstrate that GBM-targeting strategies can be identified through screening adhesion receptors and JAM-A represents a mechanism for niche-driven CSC maintenance.

The synthetic parameters are regulated to control the shape of the as-prepared samples. The concentration of the cyanide ion decreased sharply from the initial 4.72 mM to 0.95 mM with the exposure time of 60 min. The intrinsic ring-shaped microstructure results in multiple reflections of light within the chamber, allowing more efficient use of the light source compared with a solid structure. The p-n junction effect can lead to enhanced charge separation and interfacial charge transfer efficiency due to the existence of an internal electric field. Therefore, it exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic detoxification of cyanide and degradation of dye under visible light.

Terahertz Optical Conductance of n-type Monolayer MoS2	INTEGRATED FERROELECTRICS			English	Article						Monolayer MoS2; optical conductance; terahertz absorption	LAYER; TRANSITION	We present a theoretical study on optoelectronic properties of n-type monolayer MoS2 under long-wavelength light radiation. The optical conductance for such material system is evaluated using the energy-balance equation derived from the Boltzmann equation in the presence of linearly polarized radiation field. For n-type monolayer MoS2, the optical absorption in terahertz bandwidth can be achieved via intra spin-conserved transitions and inter spin-flip transitions at K and K' valleys. More importantly, we find that there is a terahertz absorption peak in the radiation frequency range 2-10 THz. The intensity and width of this absorption peak depend sensitively on temperature and the position of the peak can be tuned via changing the electron density. This study shows that n-type monolayer MoS2 can be applied as frequency tunable THz optical and optoelectrical devices.	[Xiao, Y.

Although photosensitization of titania by organic dyes is one of the conventional ways for visible-light utilization of titania, previous studies have not yet addressed the use of natural food coloring agents as templates in the synthesis of mesostructured materials, let alone the simultaneous achievement of highly crystalline mesoscopic framework and visible-light photocatalytic activity. In this work, anthocyanin, a natural pigment from red radish was directly used as template in synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous titania. The synthesized mesoporous titania samples were characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, SEM, HRTEM, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis. The prepared mesoporous titania photocatalyst exhibited significant activity under visible-light irradiation for the degradation of dyes and phenols due to its red shift of band-gap-absorption onset and visible-light response as a result of the incorporation of surface carbon species.

This material shows good photochromism and fatigue resistance. Only the closed form of this diarylethene derivative can form coordination complexes with Cu2+ and Hg2+ and at the same time, the combination of the photochromic material and metal ions would lead to the cycle opening of the closed photochromic unit and color bleaching processes. This special property can be applied in the visual detection of these two heavy metal ions not only in solution but also in solid state. The fluorescence of the diarylethene is sensitive to light, copper and mercury ions. As a result, a single molecular logic circuit was constructed using the absorbance and fluorescence intensity at a specific wavelength as outputs and appropriate combinational stimuli of UV/Vis light, Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions as inputs. Moreover, its fluorescence is sensitive to historical input signals. Based on this, a key pad lock using three codes to open was fabricated.

For specific recognition, the as-prepared molecularly imprinted nanoparticles exhibit good selectivity for formaldehyde. The molecularly imprinted nanoparticles were mixed with Ag-LaFeO3 to form a compound. The compound with small dimensions and good dispersity possesses an extremely high surface-to-volume ratio. Therefore the compound exhibits even better formaldehyde-sensing properties. At 40 degrees C, the response to 0.5 ppm formaldehyde based on the compound is 24.5, and is lower than 3.0 to the other test gases. The response time and recovery time are 67 s and 104 s, respectively.

The intrinsic hollow nanostructure can shorten the lengths for both electronic and ionic transport, enlarge the surface area of electrodes, and improve accommodation of the volume change during Li insertion/extraction cycling. The hybrid multi-elements characteristics allow the volume change to take place in a stepwise manner during the electrochemical cycle. Therefore, the as-prepared CoFe2O4 electrode exhibits outstanding performance as anode materials for lithium ion batteries. The stable capacity arrives at 815 mA h g(-1) for 20 C. Subsequently, a specific capacity of ca. 1043 mA h g(-1) is recovered when the current rate reduces back to 1 C after 200 cycles. This general strategy may shed light on a new avenue for large-scale synthesis of hollow porous hybrid nanocubes via MOFs for energy storage, environmental remediation and other novel applications.

Here we perform the first genome-wide association study of severe acne in a Chinese Han population comprising 1,056 cases and 1,056 controls using the Illumina HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip. In an independent cohort of 1,860 cases and 3,660 controls of Chinese Han, we replicate 101 SNPs of which 3 showed consistent association. We identify two new susceptibility loci at 11p11.2 (DDB2, rs747650, P-combined 4.41 x 10(-9) and rs1060573, Pcombined 1.28 x 10(-8)) and 1q24.2 (SELL, rs7531806, P-combined 1.20 x 10(-8)) that are involved in androgen metabolism, inflammation processes and scar formation in severe acne. These results point to new genetic susceptibility factors and suggest several new biological pathways related to severe acne.

Adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics are investigated in detail. The unique nanofilm assembly structure with high BET surface area of 252.82 m(2) g(-1) can allow for higher exposure of adsorption sites to adsorbate molecules than a solid one, and thus results in the high removal efficiency of heavy metal ions. The final removal efficiency of Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II) and Cr(VI) from acid aqueous solutions can reach 100%, 99.6%, 99.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Moreover, the relatively large submicrometer particles are easy to recover after adsorption. Therefore, it may serve as an ideal candidate for heavy metal ion removal in water treatment.

If sulfur impurity incorporates into anatase and rutile lattice by the same doping mode, it exhibits similar doping effects (including lattice distortion, variation of band gap, localized defect states, and type and position of impurity energy levels). However, there are some subtle different doping effects between different crystal structures or different doping modes. According to the calculated results and basic relationship between electronic structure and photocatalytic performance, it is determined that sulfur interstitial doping in anatase TiO2 processes optimal modification effects due to its shallow impurity energy levels, located at the top of the valence and the bottom of the conduction band, which could not only improve the absorption of visible light, but also suppress the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.

Given the characteristics of complexity, nonlinearity, and fitfulness in the line icing process, a model based on a multivariable time series is presented here to predict the icing load of a transmission line. In this model, the time effects of micrometeorology parameters for the icing process have been analyzed. The phase-space reconstruction theory and machine learning method were then applied to establish the prediction model, which fully utilized the history of multivariable time series data in local monitoring systems to represent the mapping relationship between icing load and micrometeorology factors. Relevant to the characteristic of fitfulness in line icing, the simulations were carried out during the same icing process or different process to test the model's prediction precision and robustness. According to the simulation results for the Tao-Luo-Xiong Transmission Line, this model demonstrates a good accuracy of prediction in different process, if the prediction length is less than two hours, and would be helpful for power grid departments when deciding to take action in advance to address potential icing disasters.

The experimental results indicate that the sensor based on the sample Ag-LaFeO3 shows excellent gas-sensing properties to formaldehyde gas and the operating temperature is very low. At the optimal operating temperature of 90 degrees C, the response of the sensor based on Ag-LaFeO3 to 1 ppm formaldehyde is 25, while to other test gases, the response is all lower than 6. With increasing concentration of formaldehyde, the resistance of the sensor based on the sample Ag-LaFeO3 increases. The response and recovery times for the sample to formaldehyde gas are 65 s and 60 s, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, Y. M.; Lin, Y. T.; Zhang, J.; Zhu, Z.

A novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor based on ZnO NPs, CGR and Nafion (NF) hybrids modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) has been successfully developed. ZnO NPs-CGR was homogeneously dispersed in NF and dropped on the surface of GCE. ZnO NPs-CGR-NF possessed excellent conductivity, catalysis and biocompatibility which were attributed to the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs, CGR and NF. ZnO NPs-CGR-NF/GCE provided a hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 126 mu M, which was then oxidized to produce a detectable and fast response. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected chlorpyrifos and carbofuran ranging from 1.0 x 10(-13) to 1 x 10(-8) M and from 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-8) M. The detection limits for chlorpyrifos and carbofuran were 5 x 10(-14) M and 5.2 x 10(-13) M, respectively. The developed biosensor exhibited many advantages such as good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. This study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we provide some criterions for identifying the positive definiteness of an even-order real supersymmetric tensor. Moreover, an iterative algorithm for identifying the positive definiteness of an even-order real supersymmetric tensor is obtained. Numerical examples are given to verify the corresponding results.

The lithium diffusion coefficient of resulting Au@Li4Ti5O12 is 7.32 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1), and its stable reversible capacity is 169 mAh g(-1), with the retention of 91.1% after 100 cycles at 5 C. Moreover, it also exhibits excellent rate-capability performance. The superior cycling performance can be attributed to the unique nanorod characteristics, structural stability, and the improved ionic and electronic conduction in the electrode due to the uniform nano coating of Au.
