The research of protein functions is of great significance in decoding the secret of life. In recent years, researchers have introduced multi-label supervised topic model such as Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Labeled-LDA) into protein function prediction, which can obtain more accurate and explanatory prediction. However, the topic-label corresponding way of Labeled-LDA is associating each label (GO term) with a corresponding topic directly, which makes the latent topics to be completely degenerated, and ignores the differences between labels and latent topics.ResultTo achieve more accurate probabilistic modeling of function label, we propose a Partially Function-to-Topic Prediction (PFTP) model for introducing the local topics subset corresponding to each function label. Meanwhile, PFTP not only supports latent topics subset within a given function label but also a background topic corresponding to a fake' function label, which represents common semantic of protein function. Related definitions and the topic modeling process of PFTP are described in this paper. In a 5-fold cross validation experiment on yeast and human datasets, PFTP significantly outperforms five widely adopted methods for protein function prediction. Meanwhile, the impact of model parameters on prediction performance and the latent topics discovered by PFTP are also discussed in this paper.ConclusionAll of the experimental results provide evidence that PFTP is effective and have potential value for predicting protein function. Based on its ability of discovering more-refined latent sub-structure of function label, we can anticipate that PFTP is a potential method to reveal a deeper biological explanation for protein functions.

Current digital predistortion (DPD) techniques may not be effective in linearizing broadband RoF links. This work presents a simple envelope-assisted radio frequency (RF)/intermediate frequency (IF) DPD model for linearization of broadband/multiband RoF transmission. The model uses both RF/IF signals and baseband envelopes, resulting in the short-term and long-term memory effect mitigated efficiently even for high signal bandwidth. The model complexity is lower than the existing baseband DPDs and does not increase with the increase of the signal bands. The model is experimentally evaluated in three scenarios: two 20 MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signals spaced by 100 and 40 MHz, and three 20 MHz LTE signals spaced by 50 MHz. It is shown that the proposed DPD results in comparable performance as today's baseband models.

In recent years, the increasing number of new species described has raised some controversy about the validity of several species within this genus, notably the putative sympatric species pair S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis. To test the validity of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis, we analyzed the complete sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYTB) gene of 20 identified species and one out-group species. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using CYTB with maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Our phylogenetic results showed that all individuals of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis clustered in one clade with strong support. In addition, the genetic distance between the two species was 0.11%, within the range observed at the intraspecific level. The most recent common ancestor of S. qiubeiensis and S. jiuchengensis dated back to 0.13 million years ago, indicating little time for complete speciation to have occurred. These results clearly support the viewpoint that S. jiuchengensis is a synonym of S. qiubeiensis.

However, traditional mining frameworks often produce too many prevalent patterns of which only a small proportion may be truly interesting to end users. To satisfy user preferences, this work proposes an interactive probabilistic post-mining method to discover user-preferred co-location patterns from the early-round of mined results by iteratively involving user's feedback and probabilistically refining preferred patterns. We first introduce a framework of interactively post-mining preferred co-location patterns, which enables a user to effectively discover the co-location patterns tailored to his/her specific preference. A probabilistic model is further introduced to measure the user feedback-based subjective preferences on resultant co-location patterns. This measure is used to not only select sample co-location patterns in the iterative user feedback process but also rank the results. The experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, the traditional framework of mining prevalent co-location patterns produces numerous redundant co-location patterns, which makes it hard for users to understand or apply. In this paper we study the problem of reducing redundancy in a collection of prevalent co-location patterns. We first introduce the concept of semantic distance between two co-location patterns, and then define redundant co-locations by introducing the concept of delta-covered, where delta (0 <=delta <= 1) is a coverage measure. We develop two algorithms RRclosed and RRnull to perform the redundancy reduction for prevalent co-location patterns. Our performance studies on the synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the size of the original collection of closed co-location patterns by about 50%. Furthermore, the RRnull method runs much faster than the related closed co-location pattern mining algorithm.

Nowadays, many researches focus on identifying important nodes based on network structure, which is completely necessary. However, the role of a node in diffusion is simultaneously determined by network structure and diffusion characteristics. In this paper, we aim to find the contributive nodes that play important roles in influence spreading without network structure information. First, we formulize the concept of node contribution to influence diffusion to describe the importance of nodes in the spreading processes. Then, we propose an estimation framework and give the method to estimate node contribution based on diffusion samples. Accordingly, the Contribution Estimation algorithm is proposed upon the framework. Finally, we implement our algorithm and test the efficiency on two weighted social networks.

The presence of complex relations amongst individual series poses difficulties with respect to traditional modelling, computation and statistical theory. In this paper, we propose a method for clustering multivariate time series by using multi-relational community detection in complex networks. Firstly, a set of multivariate time series is transformed into a multi-relational network. Then, an algorithm for multi-relational community detection based on multiple nonnegative matrices factorization (MNMF) is proposed and is applied to identify time series clusters. The transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain benefits from the ability of networks to characterize both local and global relationship amongst nodes (representing data samples), while the use of MNMF can give full play to complex relations amongst individual series and preserve the multi-way nature of multivariate information. Preliminary experiment indicates promising results of our proposed approach.

In TSRS, a large number of co-location patterns are compressed into a small quantity of summarized co-location patterns and their instances are stored into the retrieval tree for fast querying. Furthermore, TSRS provides the service point recommendation according to summarized co-location patterns, and route planning is given to help the user get to service points conveniently.

However, the availability of the discovered co-location patterns is limited due to lack of specific target. Unlike existing works, we consider the dominant relation as a specific target in co-location pattern mining process. This demonstration presents DFCPM (Dominant Feature Co-location Pattern Miner), a system for users who not only take an interest in the prevalence of a feature set, but also concern which features play the dominant role in a pattern. Given a set of POIs (Point of Interest) data, we evaluate and identify the co-location patterns which are prevalent and contain dominant features. Also, DFCPM extracts the dominant features from each DFCP (Dominant Feature Co-location Pattern) to provide more information and help the decision making.

Traditional co-location pattern mining framework usually determines the proximity relationship of spatial instances by a user-specific distance threshold. However, in real life, the proximity relationship is a fuzzy concept and difficult to measure only by an absolute distance threshold. Furthermore, the spatial clique generating process consumes huge computational and spatial costs. In this paper, we propose a new framework for mining co-location patterns based on density peaks clustering and fuzzy theory. The experiments show that our method performs more efficient than the traditional Join-less method and the mining results on two real-world data sets indicate our method is significant and practical.

However, the presence of correlation (i.e. spatial correlation across several sites and time correlation within each site) poses difficulties to accurate forecasting. In this paper, a tensor-based method for geosensor data forecasting is proposed. Specifically, a tensor pattern is first introduced into modelling the geosensor data, which can take advantage of geosensor spatial-temporal information and preserve the multi-way nature of geosensor data, and then a tensor decomposition based algorithm is developed to forecast future values of time series. The proposed approach not only combines and utilizes the multi-mode correlations, but also well extracts the underlying factors in each mode of tensor and mines the multi-dimensional structures of geosensor data. Experimental evaluations on real world geosensor data validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Firstly, the primitive fusion image is obtained by NSST. Secondly, the structural similarity maps are drawn according to the structural similarity relationship between the source images and the primitive fusion image, and then utilizing the mathematical morphology operation to detect the focus and defocus region and the unknown region, which can build an accurate trimap, so the final fine decision map is obtained by using KNN matting. Finally reconstruct the image based on the color combination equation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme performs well and has superiorities over other existing typical and state of art ones in both subjective visual performance and objective criteria to a certain extent.

Firstly, the source images are decomposed into low frequency coefficients map and high frequency coefficients map through NSCT. Then the low frequency coefficients will be fused by Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML) and the fused high frequency coefficient are obtained using CBF, and the high frequency fusion rule is a weighted average method using the weights computed from the detail images that are extracted from the two high frequency coefficient maps. Finally, the inverse NSCT is utilized to get the fused image in which all the objects are clear. At the end of this paper, in order to compare with some traditional fusion methods, some experimental results are displayed to show the superiority of this method.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a face recognition algorithm based on the Gabor wavelet, principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). Specifically, bilinear interpolation is introduced to preprocess the original face database. Then, Gabor wavelets are used to extract the detailed features of the faces. The extracted Gabor features are dimensional reduced by two methods, respectively, which are: principal component analysis (PCA) plus linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and KPCA plus LDA. The two dimensional reduced features are then fused together with certain weights. All the experiments are based on the YALE face database and the ORL face database. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency of face recognition in the complex environment.

In this paper, we present a handwritten character recognition method of New Tai Lue by Support vector machine (SVM) based classifier on Gabor Features. First, some preprocessing approaches such as superfluous points removing, normalization, smoothing, resampling are applied to preprocess the handwritten character images of New Tai Lue. Second, a filter bank consisting of two-dimensional Gabor filters with various scales and orientations is created to extract features from these images. After that, the result images are processed by PCA to do dimension reduction. Finally, SVM is applied as the classifier to perform recognition task. Experimental results conducted on a database of 16200 characters show that the proposed method are effective.

Aiming at the existing problems that the selection of neighborhood radius parameter Eps depends on manual experiment, judgment intervention or calculation estimation, the accuracy of clustering results is sensitive to Eps value, using uniform global parameters in non-uniform density data sets makes the clustering effect unsatisfactory. An adaptive Eps parameter estimation method based on Gauss kernel density is proposed. The kernel probability density of the point is calculated by the Gauss kernel density estimation, and then the positive correlation between the estimated kernel probability density and Eps value is found. It adaptively matches the appropriate Eps value for the current point, rather than setting a globally unified Eps parameter. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the method has good clustering effect on non-uniform data sets, and the algorithm is also effective for uniform data sets.

However, the shape of pulse wave is affected because the propagation velocity (PV) and amplitude of the reflected wave changes with vascular wall elasticity. We assess the performance of the TT-based local PWV estimation for different PVs with four timing methods, i.e. the maximum value of the second derivative (M2D), the intersecting tangent (IT), the 20% threshold (TH20) and the maximum value of the first derivative (M1D) methods, for time fiduciary point detection. The wall distension waveforms propagating along a segment of CCA are modelled by a synthesization of the estimated incident and reflected waves for different PVs. The performance of the estimation based on the four methods is evaluated by measuring relative errors (REs). The results show that for the PVs below 6 m/s, the M2D, IT and TH20 methods exhibit good precision with REs less than 11%; for the PVs over 6 m/s, the M2D method is the most accurate than other three methods for the PWV estimation. The M2D method is the most suitable for the PWV estimation under a wide range of PV conditions. It may provide us with useful suggestions for improving the PWV estimation in clinical measurements.

Ultrasound RF echo signals carry the microstructure information of the tissues whose regular scatterer spacing (SS) can be analyzed and applied as a signature for the quantitative diagnosis of diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to improve the ISS estimation from the ultrasound RF echo signals. The signals are decomposed into a linear combination of the Gabor atoms, and then the atoms highly matched the regular component are selected based on the critical point in the curve of the first order difference (FOD) of the reconstructed signal to residue ratio (RSRR). Accordingly, the ISSs can be estimated with the adjacent location indexes of the selected Gabor atoms. Results of simulation experiments with the MP-based and WT-based methods are presented. The results demonstrate that the MP-based method can improve the ISS estimation, especially for those simulated signals with low regular components, and potentially provide more accurate information for the disease diagnosis.

With the purpose of evaluating the correctness and reliability about the estimation of blood flow velocity profile, the relevant simulation experiments are carried out in this paper based on a Field II ultrasound emulation model for common carotid artery without stenosis lesions. In simulation experiments, the RF signals are firstly generated with the fixed pulse-shooting interval (FPI) of 1/10000 s and VPIs predefined by parabolic velocity profile of blood flow (VPI_PV). Then the relevant PW Doppler signals are obtained for estimating the blood flow velocity profiles by employing the autocorrelation algorithm. It can be found from the results that the estimated blood flow velocity profiles from the PW Doppler signals of VPI_PV have enhancing validity compared with that received from the PW Doppler signals of FPI. The blood flow velocity profiles with enhanced validity would be used as basic contents for disease diagnosis.

Inspecting the road conditions is the basis of the maintenance, and efficient and accurate inspection is able to perform road repair timely as well as reduce the maintenance cost. Traditional road damage detection have to use high-performance sensors, which are very costly. With the development of the deep learning methods, it is possible to detect the roads efficiently directly with images. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient object detection model for road damage detection. We adopt the state-of-the-art deep objective detection model including Faster-RCNN and SSD for solving this problem.

Detecting the outliers is always an essential topic. Traditionally, the outlier detection can be completed by using statistical analysis software or just manual analysis. Low efficiency is one of the disadvantages of such an approach. In this research, an outlier detection algorithm is established through combining three different types of approaches with a creative computing method. The hybrid business outlier detection algorithm uses the statistical approach to pre-process the data, PCA algorithm to discover the main components and BP neural network to complete the outliers separating. Each part can reach an efficient working condition in an appropriate place in this algorithm. Meanwhile, BP neural network and PCA can improve the accuracy of the outlier detecting results.

However, channel estimation is a major issue for the deployment such system models. Thus, this work shows that by exploiting the sparse scattering nature of the mmWave channel, an efficent channel estimation algorithm can be achieved by utilizing state-of-the-art compressive sensing (CS) techniques. In general, previous CS-based channel estimation methods consider an on-grid sparse signal representation problem, however this is not truly realistic to the scenario of mmWave massive MIMO systems. To achieve a more realistic channel estimation algorithm for the mmWave MINI() system, this work considers an off-grid signal model approach, i.e., the directions of sparse channels are not confined on the angular grid for sparse signal formulation. A new adaptive channel estimation method is proposed by using Bayesian CS (BCS) to accurately and efficiently sense channels in terms of an off-grid signal model.

Most of them belong to the non structural cracks. The vertical cracks in the middle part of the 1# bent beam of the substructure were seriously damaged and the bearing capacity was low. The bridge was assessed as the IV bridge, and its cracks and other diseases were disposed after research. After the reinforcement is completed, the test shows that the bearing capacity of the bridge has been restored and improved, and the measures adopted are also effective, which can provide some reference for the reinforcement of the same type of bridge.

Such a decision depends on various factors of sites, including socioeconomic, geography, ecology, as well as specific requirements of businesses. The existing approaches for site selection (commonly used by economists) are manual, subjective and not scalable. This paper presents a data-driven situation-specific site selection approach (called D3SA for short) for users who are eager to create a business (hotel, hot-pot restaurant, etc.). Given a business and some related parameters, it recommends suggested sites that can satisfy users' requirements. Unlike existing works, we consider using prevalent co-location patterns discovered from spatial data sets to select the sites. Meanwhile, a novel co-location generation algorithm is proposed to discover co-location patterns efficiently. Furthermore, ontologies are used in order to classify the whole spatial data according to the semantic of businesses to assist to find the "best" co-location pattern. The experimental results evaluated based on both a real POI (Points of Interests) dataset in Beijing and extended synthetic data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of D3SA.

It is able to model the complex concepts of systems such as: choice, parallel, and synchronization. However it suffers from the lack of an unambiguous definition, so we may produces models with semantic errors. On the other hand, Petri nets are a formal tool with solid mathematical principles [4]. Moreover, it offers a number of analytical techniques. So Petri nets and BPMN have complementary abilities: BPMN can handle the modeling and Petri nets can handle the analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach for transforming BPMN models to Petri nets models, then assign coordinates of Petri nets elements and control the path of every arc. Finally, we get a valid and neat Petri net model which is both convenient and practical for human analysts and other Petri nets analysis techniques.<bold> </bold>	[Li, Lei] Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Dai, Fei] Yunnan Univ, Natl Pilot Sch Software, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China	Dai, F (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Natl Pilot Sch Software, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.							8	0	0	0	1	IOP PUBLISHING LTD	BRISTOL	DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND	1755-1307			IOP C SER EARTH ENV	IOP Conf.

However, the performance of querying and accessing medical images in anytime and anywhere using mobile device is still an issue. In this paper, we implement an medical image visualization system to efficiently query and access medical images by using smartphone, which has the following new features: 1) an on-demand data transmission method is implemented using DICOM web service, and only the required meta data and image region or series are transmitted to mobile device; 2) a high performance cache component is designed to cache the recently requested images, which takes up less storage and obtains higher performance; 3) a convenient way is introduced to quickly obtain a specific patient's studies by scanning a patient's barcode or quick response code. The performance and stability of our proposed method as well as the prototype system is evaluated with real DICOM data sets. The results show that our app obtains high performance and stability in both Wi-Fi and 4G mobile network, which is expected to be an effective tool for mobile telemedicine.

In this paper, a new method is proposed for prediction of membrane protein types. Firstly, two kinds of feature extraction methods, PseAAC and PsePSSM, are used to extract the information from the membrane protein samples. Secondly, feature selection based on random forest is used to eliminate redundant features and reduce the computational complexity.

The detection of such vertices is of great significance for the control of network public opinion, the analysis of the influence of social network, the detection of the weak points of the network security, the rapid spread of the information and so on. How to find more accurate structural holes has become a key problem in the research. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect the top-k structure holes based on the shortest path increment. It mainly through the analysis of SPIG (the shortest path increment), NCC (the number of sub connected components) and VAR (the variance of the vertices in a connected component) to determine the structure hole attribute values of the vertices. And then the vertices are sorted according to this value and obtained the top-k vertices. Our experiments on real networks and different scales LFR simulation complex networks clearly verify the effectiveness of our method, as well as the advantage of our method against the other similar methods.

These methods have always relied on the temporal consistency of successive video frames. If the video consistency is suddenly destroyed, such as an object being occluded, some frames are lost, or the camera is shaken, etc., the results of foreground extraction may be significantly degraded. In this paper, our extends One-Shot Video Object Segmentation by adding two branchs for Positioning foreground targets and propagating foreground semantic information. These two branches are parallel to the existing foreground segmentation branches, which facilitates efficient iterative and fine-tuning of the foreground segmentation branches. This foreground extraction method is different from the previous background subtraction and frame difference methods. Our method does not rely on the time information and only needs to give the manual annotation of one frame, which can extract all the specific foreground in the video sequence. Then, the coloring can get complete foreground information for the separated target. Experiments show that the foreground extraction algorithm applied in this paper has better robustness in dynamic background, camera shake, intermittent motion of objects, low contrast, and so on.

Aiming at the prediction of cell penetrating peptides, this paper fused two feature extraction methods dipeptide composition (DipC) and tripeptide composition (TipC) as a new feature expression on the premise of sequence segmentation. Then, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the three feature expressions, and support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify and predict. Besides, SVM is a kind of commonly used classification method in biological sequence-based classification and prediction. Taking into acount a fewer number of samples of cell penetrating peptides consideration, we introduced a novel classifier support sentor machine (STM) to compare with SVM. It's showed based on the results that the fusion of the TipC and DipC can get higher accurary than that of the single feature-based method and the accuracy of STM was higher than that of SVM in the identification of cell penetrating peptides under different feature expression, which brought a new idea for the prediction of cell penetrating peptides.

The subcellular localization plays a key role to elucidate these membrane proteins functions. This study introduced a novel model that not only learns the features from protein sequences, but also learns features from cross-species protein protein interaction network. The protein GO features were obtained by deep learning method. The major low dimensional structure was built by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Then the support vector machines (SVM) was applied to predict the membrane proteins subcellular location. The final evaluation results by k-fold cross-validation test showed that the accuracy of the proposed method has been improved a lot compared with the BLAST method. In this study, the overall accuracy could be over 95% in the situation that the training sets contains only 10% samples and the rest samples as testing sets, which means that the proposed method has robust performance for small sample train dataset.

However, few studies have focused on the problem of class imbalance in protein subnuclear localization. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the class imbalance problem based on the oversampling method. Firstly, the features of protein are captured by PSSM, and then the KPCA is used to extract the valuable information of protein in PSSM. Next, the proposed method named M-SMOTE is used to generate new samples of minority class and eliminate the imbalance in different class. Finally, the processed samples are input into the Random Forest classifier to predict the protein subnuclear localization. The experiments results obtained by jackknife test indicate that the M-SMOTE can effectively solve the class imbalance problem and improve the classification performance in protein subnuclear localization.

Feature extraction is the key step in the processes of protein sub-nuclear localization, it should include useful and sufficient protein information as possible. However, the single feature extraction method often can't extract sufficient information. Thus, we propose a novel method by combining PseAAC with PSSM to solve this problem. First, PseAAC and PSSM are used to extract the information, respectively. Secondly, the KPCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of PseAAC and PSSM. Thirdly, the useful information of PseAAC and PSSM will be integrated by proposed method. At last, the integrated feature vectors are classified by Random Forest. The classification performance will be evaluated with four evaluation indexes by jackknife test. According to the experiments results, the proposed feature fusion method is effective for protein sub-nuclear localization.

This paper will propose a new model to identify potentially fraudulent prescriptions and apply it to real prescription data to test its performance. Because of the low efficiency and high cost of prescription fraud through artificial experts, and because of the limitations of human knowledge, artificial detection is slow and insensitive to new fraud. We used the statistical characteristics of prescription data and other features related to the prescription to measure the risk level of the prescription, and found a prescription with high risk. The potential of this model can be used not only for off-line and online analysis and prediction of prescription fraud, but also for automatic updating of new fraud prescriptions. We test the model on real prescription data sets and compared to other approaches. The experimental results show that our model is promising for discovering the prescription fraud from the real health care data sets.

The sensor enabled communication technologies are connecting billions of things, by efficiently utilizing their locations in the real world. However, how to use a reasonable architecture to build IoT services via heterogeneous and distributed smart things and sensors is an important and challenging issue, especially in rural areas where power and network resources are relatively scarce. In this work, to catch the challenge, we propose an Integrated IoT service model for distributed sensors. By modeling sensors into information resources, a RESTful service model is applied to each sensor. By using IoT based service adapter, information resources are integrated into service center which is feasible be accessed by electrical power and wireless network. A case study of rural sewage disposal is conducted based on the proposed service model. Also, a developed prototype system of rural sewage disposal shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model.

In the present study, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm is proposed to estimate the HK parameters solely. For improving the accuracy and convergence of the MLE, the cloud adaptive particle swarm optimization (CAPSO) algorithm is proposed for the integral calculation of the probability density function (PDF) of the HK distribution. In the experiments, sets of samples satisfying the HK distribution are generated, and then the parameters are estimated by the proposed CAPSO-based MLE method. The statistics of estimation errors are calculated, and compared with the results based on the mean intensity and X-and U-statistics (XU) method, which is the latest one based on moment estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can solely estimate the HK parameters with a small error level, which means a further practical value in ultrasonic applications.

The nonlinearity of biological tissue is increased with an increase of the temperature in the ablation process. Based on this characteristic, the tissue ablated by microwave could be monitored using the quantitative parameters related to second-harmonic ultrasonic envelope (SHUE) signals. In the present study, the variations in the Nakagami parameters (NPs) of SHUE signals echoed from tissues with different nonlinear coefficients beta are investigated, and employed for noninvasive MWA monitoring. Ultrasonic radio frequency (RF) echo signals based on different beta values are simulated using the nonlinear RF ultrasound simulator CREANUIS to comparatively evaluate the variations of NPs from the fundamental and second-harmonic echo envelopes with different values of beta . The results show that the NPs of the fundamental envelope signals are aliasing. By contrast, the NPs of the second-harmonic envelopes are separated and increase with increasing beta . Moreover, the SHUE signals are obtained from water bath heating experiment. Afterwards, the spectral of second-harmonic RF signals and statistical histograms of the corresponding SHUE signals are computed. The results exhibit that the NPs of SHUE signals, which reflect the degree of nonlinearity of the heated liver tissues, increase with increasing water bath temperature. In conclusion, the SHUE-based NPs are sensitive to the tissue nonlinearity. By considering this characteristic, the ablated tissue can be monitored accurately and effectively with the NPs of SHUE signals.

The performance of these two methods is analyzed using an ultrasound simulation model of a female's carotid artery with FIELD II platform. The results based on 30 simulations show that the normalized root-mean-square-errors of estimated PWVs based on QA and ln(D)U methods are 0.30 +/- 0.08 and 0.45 +/- 0.13 , respectively. The QA method is found to correlate well with the ln(D)U method (R-2 =0.93, p<0.001). These results indicate that the two methods should be capable of distinguishing between changes to PWV caused by cardiovascular diseases. And the QA method offers higher precision to the ln(D)U method for estimating local PWV.

The a is used as the parameter of the benefit utility function to transform the income function between the average income and the cumulative income, and to change the magnitude of the trigonometric probability q to change the clustering coefficient of the network. Through the experiment, it is found that in the interval of profit and loss ratio, when the average income is used, the network clustering coefficient can obviously promote the cooperative behavior, and the cumulative income is not obvious. At the same time, the accumulated income utility function will increase the critical value of the disappearance of the stationary fraction of cooperators when the network clustering coefficient is determined. In view of this situation, the characteristics of Stag hunt game and scale free network are explained respectively.

Some of the primary motivations for the enterprise to adopt the container technology include its conveniency to encapsulate and deploy applications, lightweight operations, as well as efficiency and flexibility in resources sharing. However, there still lacks an in-depth and systematic comparison study on how big data applications, such as Spark jobs, perform between a container environment and a virtual machine environment. In this paper, by running various Spark applications with different configurations, we evaluate the two environments from many interesting aspects, such as how convenient the execution environment can be set up, what are makespans of different workloads running in each setup, how efficient the hardware resources, such as CPU and memory, are utilized, and how well each environment can scale. The results show that compared with virtual machines, containers provide a more easy-to-deploy and scalable environment for big data workloads. The research work in this paper can help practitioners and researchers to make more informed decisions on tuning their cloud environment and configuring the big data applications, so as to achieve better performance and higher resources utilization.

The SIGW filter includes three-layer substrates. The top layer substrate realizes a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) using periodic plated vias and metallic patches. It is applied for packaging substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter to avoid interference and losses induced by external radiation emission and internal radiation leakage. The middle layer substrate generates a gap layer. In the base/bottom layer, cascaded resonators of the SIW filters are formed by properly etching slots on the metal plane and placing plated vias in the middle of this layer. The higher-order modes of TE103 and TE104 are suppressed using slots designed in the base layer at the third-order cavity, which leads to wide stopband. Moreover, the effect of the SIGW-based PMC structure on bandwidth and transmission zeroes is studied.

Visual saliency detection method reflects the significant information in infrared image, and the feature has the consistent in the object information and background details with the infrared and visible light images. So, this paper proposed a novel framework of infrared and visible image fusion by using visual saliency and non-subsampled shearlet transformation. Comparing the proposed fusion method with some existing algorithms, the experimental results show that the proposed method can not only highlight the object information, but also can preserve the abundant background information effectively in the visible light image.

So far, many algorithms of mining spatial co-location pattern and their corresponding expansions have been proposed. However, dynamic co-location patterns have not received attention such as the real meaningful pattern {Ganoderma lucidum(new), maple tree(dead)} means that "Ganoderma lucidum" grows on the "maple tree" which was already dead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the concept of spatial dynamic co-location pattern that can reflect the dynamic relationships among spatial features and then propose an algorithm of mining these patterns from the dynamic dataset of spatial new/dead features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results demonstrate that spatial dynamic co-location patterns are valuable and our algorithm is effective.

The homogenization regulator based on the probability density function in this method can improve the ergodic properties of Chebyshev mapping. This paper lists two classical examples to test the optimization algorithm based on homogenization regulator, and compares it with the optimization results based on traditional Tent mapping and Logistic mapping. The test results show that the algorithm significantly reduces the solution step length on the basis of maintaining accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm is feasible and effective in solving optimization problems.

The problem has led to the use of domain-specific applications where relevant keywords in some areas have not been given appropriate weights. This paper proposes an improved method based on domain knowledge graph. This method will mainly consider the application of the legal field, and use the legal knowledge graph to make improvements to the TF-IDF algorithm, so as to achieve the reasonable weight assigned to the domain-related keywords in text feature extraction.

There are two challenges in the traditional supervised machine learning. One is that the test data distribution always differs largely from the training data distribution in the real world, while another is that there is usually very few labeled data to train a machine learning model. In such cases, transfer learning, which emphasizes the transfer of the previous knowledge from different but related domains and tasks, is recommended to deal with these problems. Traditional transfer learning methods care more about the data itself rather than the task. In fact, there is no one universal feature representation can perfectly benefit the model training work. But different feature representations can discover some independent latent knowledge from the original data. In this paper, we propose an instance-based transfer learning method, which is a weighted ensemble transfer learning framework with multiple feature representations. In our work, mutual information is applied as the smart weighting schema to measure the weight of each feature representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three facial expression recognition data sets: JAFFE, KDEF and FERG-DB. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than the traditional transfer learning method and the non-transfer learning method.

Standard support vector machine is based on supervised learning, and it is necessary to manually mark large amounts of data for obtaining sufficient training data, which is costly and inefficient. In this paper, we apply least squares support vector machine based on semi-supervised learning to the multi-tasks and propose a semi-supervised multi-tasking approach using least-squares support vector machine. Based on related tasks learning simultaneously, multi-task least-squares support vector machine is used to train both labeled and unlabeled samples, overcoming the limitation of slow training, and using the useful information among related tasks to improve the efficiency of all tasks. In the training process, the regional tagging and the tag reset methods are used to reduce the number of iterations to achieve convergence and increases the fault tolerance rate.

Network-based clustering technology, transforming data of time series into a network and then used community detection methods of network to cluster time series, is a new approach to cluster time series data. This approach takes the advantage that a network can describe the relationship between any pair or any group of data samples, but the effectiveness of clustering heavily dependent on the performance of algorithms of community detection. In this paper, we cluster time series by transforming them into network and detecting communities by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Experimental evaluations illustrate the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-arts such as Multilevel.

Recent year magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used imaging technique to assess brain tumors. However manual segmentation and artificial extracting features block MRI's practice when facing with the huge amount of data produced by MRI. An efficient and automatic image segmentation of brain tumor is still needed. In this paper, a novel automatic segmentation framework of brain tumors, which have 5 parts and resnet-50 use as a backbone, is proposed based on convolutional neural network. A dilated convolution refine (DCR) structure is introduced to extract the local features and global features. After investigating different parameters of our framework, it is proved that DCR is an efficient and robust method in Brain Tumor Segmentation. The experiments are evaluated by Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS 2015) dataset. The results show that our framework in complete tumor segmentation achieved excellent results with a DEC score of 0.87 and a PPV score of 0.92.

Multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-kNN) is a classification method which predicts the unclassified instances' labels by learning the classified instances. However, this method doesn't consider the interrelationships between attributes and labels. Considering the relationships between properties and labels can improve accuracy of classification methods, but the diversities of properties and labels will present the curse of dimensionality. This problem make such methods can not be expanded under the background of big data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes three methods, called multi-label k-nearest neighbor based on principal component analysis(PML-kNN), coupled similarity multi-label k-nearest neighbor based on principal component analysis(PCSML-kNN) and coupled similarity multi-label k-nearest neighbor classification based on feature selection (FCSML-kNN), which use feature extraction and feature selection to reduce the dimensions of labels' properties. We test the ML-kNN and the three methods we proposed with two real data, the experimental results show that reduce the dimensions of labels' properties can improve the efficiency of classification methods.

In this paper, we use general deep learning model to solve the multi-choice question answering task. Our approach is to build distributed word embedding of question and answers instead of manually extracting features or linguistic tools, meanwhile, for improving the accuracy, the external corpus is introduced. The framework uses a two layers LSTM with attention which get a significant result. By contrast, we introduce the simple long short-teen memory (QA-LSTM) model and QA-LSTM-CNN model and QA-LSTM with attention model as the reference. Experiment demonstrate superior performance of two layers LSTM with attention compared to other models in question answering task.

However, when pre-processing pollutes Chinese font images with noise, traditional font recognition algorithms tend not to be suitably discriminant In this paper, and based on linear discriminant analysis and Cauchy estimator theory, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm called linear discriminant analysis Cauchy estimator (LDACE) for single Chinese character font recognition. LDACE aims to: (1) consider both between-class and within-class geometry in the low-dimensional space, and (2) preserve recognition when input samples are polluted with noise. Experiments with the frequently used FUCCFR dataset demonstrate LDACE's effectiveness.

Compressive sensing provided a technical support for real-time feature extraction. However, all existing compressive tracking were based on compressed Haar-like feature, and how to compress many more excellent high-dimensional features is worth researching. In this paper, a novel compressed normalized block difference feature (CNBD) was proposed. For resisting noise effectively in a high dimensional normalized pixel difference feature (NPD), a normalized block difference feature extends two pixels in the original formula of NPD to two blocks. A CNBD feature can be obtained by compressing a normalized block difference feature based on compressive sensing theory, with the sparse random Gaussian matrix as the measurement matrix. The comparative experiments of 7 trackers on 20 challenging sequences showed that the tracker based on CNBD feature can perform better than other trackers, especially than FCT tracker based on compressed Haar-like feature, in terms of AUC, SR and Precision.

The present study focused on interspecific correlations of exotic and native species in 8-year-old artificial wetland forests. Four large plots (each 1500 m(2)) were established to record the species and abundance of all plants; 160 quadrats (1 x 1 m) were set to record the number, height and coverage of each plant species. In the large plots, 78 species (6 trees, 11 shrubs and 61 herbs) were recorded. The interspecific relationships of major species (frequency >3%) from quadrats were analysed using the Chi-Square test and Spearman rank correlation coefficient index. Of 253 species pairs, 49 and 45 were significant (P < 0.05), with positive and negative correlations respectively, showing intense interspecific competition. Ward's method of hierarchical clustering was used to divide the major species from quadrats into three and five ecological species groups at a rescaled distance cluster combine of 20 and 10 respectively. Dominant invasive species (Solidago canadensis, Ageratina adenophora and Bidens pilosa) formed monodominant patches; however, species of different sizes and ecological demands, whether exotic or native, could coexist. These findings imply that exotic species can coexist with native species and become a common species composition when they have existed for a sufficient period time in artificial wetland forests.
