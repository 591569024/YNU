Historically they have been used in many ways by humans, including as ornamental plants, domestic utensils, foods, and in handicrafts. In addition, they have found uses as medicinal herbs. Ferns produce a wide array of secondary metabolites endowed with different bioactivities that could potentially be useful in the treatment of many diseases. However, there is currently relatively little information in the literature on the phytochemicals present in ferns and their pharmacological applications, and the most recent review of the literature on the occurrence, chemotaxonomy and physiological activity of fern secondary metabolites was published over 20 years ago, by Soeder (Bot Rev 51:442-536, 1985). Here, we provide an updated review of this field, covering recent findings concerning the bioactive phytochemicals and pharmacology of fern species.

There are five types of scheduling architectures that are being used widely for scheduling resource in server clusters that includes statically partitioned schedulers, monolithic schedulers, two-level scheduling, shared-state scheduling and distributed schedulers. In this paper, several scheduling architectures will be discussed. This paper also illustrates key techniques of these scheduling architectures, including resource representation and sharing model, scheduling algorithms and some other techniques. Different scheduling techniques are being applied in different scheduling architectures. Based on this review paper, it can be concluded that there are a lot of works related to scheduling strategies in large-scale cluster are conducted. However, the relatively complicated application and scaling cluster size present new requirements to scheduling techniques. Then some scheduling techniques can still be improved.

This demonstration presents OICPM, an interactive system to discover interesting co-location patterns based on ontologies. With OICPM, the user can find his/her real interesting ones from a massive amount of co-location patterns efficiently within only a few rounds of selection, and the mined interesting co-location patterns are filtered in order for better decision.

Rather than enumerating existing poems, users are able to discover possible creative changes of existing poems, and then develop their own poems through our App. Creativity can re-shape the way that people look at things, which has already been studied in many disciplines. When collaborating with most widely used facility, computers, as a joining force of innovation, can be formed by researching creative computing. In order to explain how computers can enhance human creativity, a general framework of creative computing has been proposed. For the purpose of evaluating creative computing in practice, this paper proposes a creative approach to inspiring users and a supplemental poem modification case will be presented to show how knowledge combination can contribute and help the inspiration process in the form of software development. In order to achieve this purpose, the intrinsic motivation and external stimulation for creativity from psychology will be abstracted to a word linking algorithm in the proposed research and the semantic web techniques will be used to make software understand the context of input. Then a feedback loop will be constructed to make software adaption.

However, with the increase of the computing complexity of feature extractor, the trackers lost the real-time advantage of correlation filters. Moreover, correlation filters model drift can result in tracking failure. In order to solve these problems, a novel and simple correlation filters tracker based on two-level filtering edge feature (ECFT) was proposed. ECFT extracted a low-complexity edge feature based on two-level filtering for object representation. For reducing model drift as much as possible, an object model is updated adaptively by the maximum response value of correlation filters. The comparative experiments of 7 trackers on 20 challenging sequences showed that the ECFT tracker can perform better than other trackers in terms of AUC and Precision.

Second, to further boost the image aesthetic quality classification performance, we employ the image content to train aesthetic quality classification models. But the training samples become smaller and only using once fine-tune can not make full use of the small-scale dataset. Third, to solve the problem in second step, a way of using twice fine-tune continually based on the aesthetic quality label and content label respective, is proposed. At last, the categorization probability of the trained CNN models is used to evaluate the image aesthetic quality. We experiment on the small-scale dataset Photo Quality. The experiment results show that the classification accuracy rates of our approach are higher than the existing image aesthetic quality evaluation approaches.

It performs patch-shift based information statistics and incorporates the result into the data filling process. The central idea to ensure the confidence pixel value to fill is based on patch shift that captures the statistic information from the expanded filling patches' most similar patches. Our approach outperforms the original exemplar-based inpainting in a large number of examples on removing large occluding objects and thin scratches in real and synthetic images, at the cost of some additional computation. It inherits well-known advantages of the exemplar-based inpainting method, such as the capability of maintaining the integrity and consistency of image structure information, and the adaptability to many application scenarios. Experiments on synthetic and natural images show the advantages of our approach, especially, in the big target removing task our method yields generally better results.

Polling control mechanism has been abroadly implicated in the field of access network. This paper uses Markov Chain and probability generating function as analytical method and proposes a new HM_QoS model based on parallel scheduling two-level priority polling control mechanism. Priority control field HM_QoS was added to the original frame header and differentiates traffics. Combining with polling orders and access policies including Gated and Exhaustive access policies the priority-based scheme was realized. Then the system characteristics including mean queue length, cycle time and system throughput were analyzed and simulated. At the same time, Theoretical calculations and simulation values are identical and show that a new HM_QoS model differentiates priorities efficiently and compared with original MAC protocol (OP) it has a better performance.

Based on the IEEE802.11 standard, we present an efficient priority-based polling scheme for WLAN. It becomes increasingly important to support delay based quality of service in such WLANs. The new scheme differentiates priorities by various access policies which uses exhaustive service for the central station and gated service for ordinary stations. The mathematical model of the new system was set up by method of embedded Markov chain theory and generating function. Then the key system performance characteristics including mean queue length, query cycle and throughput are explicitly analyzed.

We formulate the virtual resource allocation problem in cloud computing as an integer program and design a truthful auction-based mechanism that solve it. Our proposed mechanism enables the cloud providers to effectively utilize their virtual resources and obtain higher profits. We design a heuristic allocation algorithm in which each user can submit multiple requirements. In addition, we design a payment algorithm which takes into account the interests of both the cloud providers and the users. We perform extensive simulation experiments using real workload traces in terms of social welfare, execution time, and resource utilization. We show that our proposed mechanism achieves promising results for virtual resource allocation.

In the real communication network, continuous transmission may lead some transmission lines of this original network to be damaged such that communication network cannot be used. The problem that we consider is how to add other transmission lines to construct a more survivable communication network to service well. In details, we consider the constrained arborescence augmentation problem (CAA, for short) as follows. For a given weighted digraph (or network) D = (V, A; w; T-r) where w : A -> R+ is a weighted function and T-r = (V, A(r)) is an arborescence rooted at r in D, we are asked to find an arc-subset A' from A - A(r) such that there exists still an arborescence in the new digraph D' = (V, A(r) boolean OR A' - {a}) for each arc a is an element of A(r), the objective is to, minimize the total weight w(A') = Sigma(e is an element of A') w(e). In this paper, we prove that the CAA problem still remains NP-hard, whose proof follows from a reduction from the 3-dimensional matching. In addition, we present an optimal O(m + n log n) combinatorial algorithm in time to solve this problem for special version where an arborescence in digraph D' = (V, A(r) boolean OR A' - {a}) still has its fixed root r, for each arc a is an element of A(r.)

Data mining technology can identify the potential structure and knowledge behind large-scale data, which plays an important role in reorganizing data and helping users find relevant information. we propose an Information-Theoretic Outlier Detection(ITOD) approach which uses global outlier (GO) and local outlier (LO) to measure the distance between prescriptions to cater for the difference between objects, and incorporate them.

In this method, we reference to the thought of Strong Community Structural to achieve link prediction. The approach think that connections among a small community which consists of a pair of predicted nodes and their common neighbors are more important than connections within small community, so we call this approach Small Community (SC) index. Then, in order to promote the efficiency of forecasting, we simplify SC. In this paper, we also consider the different attributes of links which contain directions and weights. Therefore, we change three classical indices (Common Neighbors (CN) index, Resource Allocation (RA) index, Local Path (LP) index) and two simplified SC indices, at the same time, these indices are used in multifarious networks. We evaluate these indices by experiments in appropriate networks.

Game theory-based IDs (GIDs) incorporate game theory into IDs such that decision makers can make more rational decisions. However, in a GID, the utility nodes values are represented by sharp values. This is inappropriate because it is not always available for a decision maker to get other decision makers' sharp-valued preference under uncertainty. In this paper, we extend GIDs to game influence diagrams with interval-valued utilities (IU-GIDs) in which utilities are expressed via interval values. This extension avoids difficulties attached to the specification of sharp-valued relative to value nodes, and provides more reasonable expression on other decision makers. We also propose a method for evaluating IU-GIDs by decomposing IU-GIDs into non-game IDs with interval-valued utilities(IU-IDs). The experiments evaluate proposed algorithm in terms of correctness, convergence and efficiency. The results show that our method can effectively solving IU-GIDs problem.

In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-resource fair allocation with bounded number of tasks. We propose the lexicographically max-min normalized share (LMMNS) fair allocation mechanism, which is a natural generalization of DRF, and design a non-trivial optimal algorithm to find a LMMNS fair allocation, whose running time is linear in the number of users. Then, we prove that LMMNS satisfies envy-freeness and group strategy-proofness, and analyze the approximation ratios of LMMNS with some assumptions, by exploiting the properties of the optimal solution.

Intelligence optimization algorithms are widely used to solve mapping problems. Bat Algorithm (BA), a novel metaheuristic algorithm mimicking hunting behaviors of bats, which has never been applied in NoCs, is used in low power mapping methods for 3D NoCs in this paper for the first time. The BA based mapping algorithm shows better performance than other mainstream mapping algorithms in terms of the optimization efficiency and power consumption. However, the concept of the basic BA has obvious disadvantages. To improve the basic BA, we propose a Group-Searching Bat Algorithm (GSBA) that can better utilize individual bats. This improved mapping algorithm performs much better than the traditional BA, especially when the scale of the application graph is large.

However, it ignores the existence of autocorrelation features that is not associated with surrounding features. For example, "cactus" and "jerusalem artichoke" are two common plants in the desert, and it is easy to get prevalent pattern {cactus, jerusalem artichoke} for the existing spatial co-location pattern mining frameworks, but biologists have determined that "jerusalem artichoke" is a spatial autocorrelation feature so that above pattern is meaningless. To avoid getting prevalent patterns that contain spatial autocorrelation features, we propose an algorithm to find and remove the spatial autocorrelation feature from spatial data sets, so that we can get really meaningful prevalent co-location patterns, and the experimental results over synthetic/real data sets show the effectiveness and feasibility of our method.

The samples were characterized by XRD and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The results show that the adsorption capacity of MIL-125 can reach around 123.5mg.g(-1) after the reaction time of 4h when the initial concentration of As(V) was 40mg.L-1 at pH values from 4 to 10, which is much higher than that of other metal organic frameworks (MOFs) materials reported so far. The adsorptive property of MIL-125 is hardly affected by temperature and it could be used in a wide pH range. These results indicate that MIL-125 is a promising adsorbent for efficient removal of arsenic from water.

Based on the analysis of the classical WPI evaluation model, the model is optimized by the principal component analysis method. Then, an optimized WPI evaluation model based on PCA is proposed, and the experimental results verify the validity of the proposed model. When the optimization model is applied to the water resources data of Beijing region, the efficiency of WPI evaluation is improved by about 4%. On the other hand, the optimization model is used to evaluate the WPI values of different urban and rural areas, and the results are satisfactory. On this basis, this paper designs the water environment prediction model and the Shan-gan-ning district was tested for the local future water resources situation and provides theoretical support.

Prior solutions, the greedy and its improvements are time-consuming. In this paper, we propose candidate shells influence maximization (CSIM) algorithm under heat diffusion model to select seeds in parallel. We employ CSIM algorithm (a modified algorithm of greedy) to coarsely estimate the influence spread to avoid massive estimation of heat diffusion process, thus can effectively improve the speed of selecting seeds. Moreover, we can select seeds from candidate shells in parallel. Specifically, First, we employ the k-shell decomposition method to divide a social network and generate the candidate shells. Further, we use the heat diffusion model to model the influence spread. Finally, we select seeds of candidate shells in parallel by using the CSIM algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

For now, the drainage devices are overrunning and aging without timely maintenance which makes the whole drainage system running in a high risk. So there's a great need to establish a reliable evaluation system of the quantitative analysis and evaluation for the pump stations' aging situation which will play a big role in decision support for the pumping station renovation and city flood control. The establishment of pump station aging evaluation system and calculation of index weight are key ways for the pump aging evaluation. This paper is designing the evaluation system of pump station focusing on the factual situation of Kunming with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) to determine the index weight and comparison the outcome of the two theories. Research show that, the accuracy of the weight is much better when using IAHP which can distinguish the weight with approximate importance.

Morphological filter is faster and simple, besides, the effectiveness of it is approved adequately. However, it will cause statistical bias phenomenon. This paper proposes the adaptive generalized morphological filter can improve the accuracy of filtering and reduce the bias caused by the inappropriate selection of the structural elements. By this method the characteristics of the ECG signal can be effectively maintained and distortion of signals is small. Various experimental results show that the method can effectively remove noise in ECG signals, and better filtering than wavelet method and traditional morphological method.

Most researches focus on the recognition based on one single modality sensor. In this paper, we present a novel approach for human action recognition, which is based on feature-level fusion of depth and inertial sensor. We extract Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients from acceleration signals and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from Motion Response Maps (MRM). After obtaining these two modality feature vectors, we adopt Discriminant Correlation Analysis (DCA) to learn a fused feature descriptor with better discriminating ability. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on the multimodal human action database CAS-YNU-MHAD. Experimental results demonstrate the fused feature descriptor exhibits a strong and stable performance in improving the recognition accuracy. Moreover, our approach has a low computational complexity and can be employed in real-time systems.

Recently, some of the works have explored neural networks to go for an in-depth understanding of textual item content, and further generate more accurate item latent models. These works achieve impressive effectiveness on performing recommendations. Nevertheless, there remains an open issue as how to effectively exploit description documents of both users and items in matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed content embedding regularized matrix factorization (CERMF) to address this issue. CERMF adopts convolution neural networks to simultaneously generate the independent embedding representations for the users and the items. Then, dual embeddings are used to regularize the generation of latent models for users and items. Experimental results are proved that exploiting content information of both users and items dramatically improves the accuracy of recommendations as compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation models.

It is increasingly critical to control the diffusion of malicious information in terms of source nodes with the popularity of online social networks. In this paper, we focus on multi-source location with incomplete information. First, to track the causes that make node activation, we propose the Bayes backtracking model (BBM), where the posterior probabilities of activation causes are formulated. Then, we employ random walk to represent the source backtracking process and present the corresponding backtracking algorithm for source location by taking the posterior probability in BBM as the transition probability in random walk.

Most approaches employ the RGBD camera and LIDAR for accurate localization, yet these devices are not cheap and portable for blind persons. Instead, WiFi signals are quite ubiquitous in most indoor areas, like shopping mall, hospital etc. Therefore, we propose a diversified shared latent variable model that exploits the availability of WiFi for localization. More specifically, the observation spaces in our model, WiFi strength measurements and their corresponding locations, share a single and reduced dimensionality latent space. By building and incorporating a kernel based diversity prior, the learned latent variables are inclined to extract more features of the WiFi signals, such as the coverage area, and thus further enhance the accuracy of localization. The experimental results illustrate our proposed model is accurate and efficient for indoor localization issue.

Most of them were selected and acclimatized by our ancestors who grew or transplanted wild good characteristic plants in their home gardens or near their dwelling places. The indigenous people around the world are still practicing introduction and domestication of wild plants including ornamentals. This paper deals with the ornamentals which are not common in horticulture or gardens but have been managed traditionally by the indigenous people in tropical and subtropical regions for generations. The methods of ethnobotany, botany, literature studies and horticulture were used in the surveys and analysis. Some sites had been investigated in southern China and mainland Southeast Asian countries. Indigenous peoples including Ahka, Bai, Chin, Dai, Hani, Hmong, Jinuo, Kachin, Karen, Lahu, Li, Lisu, Miao, Shan, Wa, Yi, and Zhuang were interviewed during the investigations. The results showed that there were rich species diversity of ornamentals maintained in the living environments of local communities. Many species are with great potentials to be developed as ornamentals. Orchidaceae, Zingiberaceae and Araceae are the most dominant families contributed to the floristic components of indigenous people's ornamentals in the tropics. Traditional ornamental species with cultural and religious values had been preserved in traditional societies. Based on our investigations and analysis, we proposed Camellia spp., Dendrobium spp., Rhododendron spp., Musella lasiocarpa, and Leucocasia gigantea to be the most potential candidates for gardens uses in the future. The origin of ornamentals, indigenous property right and sustainable uses of local ornamental genetic resources were also discussed.

First, we use traversal algorithm to search an optimal weight for the multi-resolution face feature, and extract the features of each face feature set via Gabor wavelets. Second, we utilize the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithms of KECA and KPCA (kernel principal component analysis) to process the data, respectively, and compare the results of these two. Third, K-nearest neighbor is used for final classification on the fusion of different weighted multi-resolution human face images. The experimental results of the ORL and YELA face database showed that our proposed method has a high recognition ability and stability compared with the common feature reduction algorithms.

There are risks in cloud banking as a commercial bank even though cloud bank deals with intangible property. Both Cloud Bank Resource Providers (CBRP) and Cloud Bank Resource Consumers (CBRC) are concerned about liquidity. CBRP desire liquidity because they want to supply according to demands and provide uninterrupted services even though some resource pools bridge the contract and plug off the computers from the main resource reservoir. CBRC also desire liquidity because they want to customise or upgrade their requirements according to their business needs. This paper tried to identify liquidity risk and offer a dynamic solution to the liquidity risk which will help to create liquidity and lower resource fragility.

Compared with traditional financial products, the online ones, originated from social networks with huge flow, present a wealth of information including both product and platform information, such as product recommendation, comments and purchase record. Consumers exchange useful information through social networks and changed their perceptions of financial products, thus affecting their choice and purchase. In this process, social capital plays an important role. Based on social capital theory, this paper explored the influence of social capital from different dimensions on users' perceived benefit and perceived risk, thus affecting their decision. This paper collected data from 263 sample members who purchased financial products on WeChat, and adopted structural equation model to verify relevant hypothesis. The results reveal that perceived risk and perceived benefit in social network environment both have significant impacts on consumers' purchase intention of financial products. The structural dimension of social capital has negative impacts on perceived benefit and slight impacts on perceived risk. The cognitive dimension of social capital has positive effects on perceived benefit and perceived risk. The relational dimension of social capital bears significant positive impacts on perceived benefit and significant negative impacts on perceived risk. The results of this paper provide favorable theoretical basis and practical value for the understanding of consumers' willingness to purchase financial products in social network environment.

In this paper, Ag-SmFeO3 methanol gas sensor with different ratio of monomer was prepared by molecular imprinting technique. Based on the observation of X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), the structure and morphology of the products were characterized. The methanol gas-sensing characteristics for the sample were examined between 175 degrees C and 295 degrees C. The experimental results indicate that the sensor based on the molecular imprinted Ag-SmFeO3 shows excellent gas-sensing properties to methanol gas. At the optimal operating temperature of 295 degrees C, the response of the sensor based on molecular imprinted Ag-SmFeO3 to 5 ppm methanol is 24.4, while to other test gases, the response is all lower than 6. With increasing concentration of methanol, the response of the sensor based on the sample Ag-SmFeO3 increases. The response and recovery times for the sample to methanol gas are 41 s and 53 s, respectively.

Today, a whole human genome can be sequenced under $1,000, providing opportunities for large-scale bioinformatic analysis on big datasets. However, most of existing bioinformatic analysis tools are programmed for single server based computing platform and not suitable to process such big datasets. As Hadoop MapReduce and Spark are gaining popularity as cluster computing based big data processing platform, more and more bioinformatic applications start to explore cluster computing platform for large scale data analysis. In this paper we present an in-depth experimental study on deploying Spark clusters for high performance bioinformatic short sequence reconstruction. Our experimental results enable us to answer a number of challenging and yet most frequently asked questions regarding efficient management of bioinformatic data analysis services on Spark systems. Example questions include how to best split big dataset into multiple partitions, and how to distribute data partitions and bioinformatic analysis tasks on a Spark cluster for carrying out a high performance distributed analysis job? What types of memory models are effective for bioinformatic data analysis services on a Spark cluster? Why do different bioinformatic data analysis operations exhibit different throughput performance on the same Spark cluster? We conjecture that this experimental study not only demonstrates the feasibility of high performance bioinformatic data analysis on Spark platform, but also will help bioinformatic application developers to make more informed decisions on both design and configuration of Spark Cluster, managing and tuning parameters of Spark runtime system for enhancing the performance of large scale big data analytics.

The proposed method consists of two main steps: a stroke emulating step to depict obvious outlines and a tone generation step for filling textures. In the stroke emulating process, a hierarchical edge detection method is designed to extract line segments with different resolutions, which simulates object contour drawn by artists using multiple strokes in different level of details. In the tone generation step, an extended ETF direction field is constructed firstly, then a parameterized swing bilateral LIC filter is applied to generate pencil texture in appropriate tone and direction. Finally, the pencil texture is transferred by simulating physical effect of pencil drawn on paper. Experiment results show the pencil drawings generated by the proposed method exhibit high similarity compare to the work drawn by artists.

For accurate predicting the sequence-structure mapping relationship between protein secondary structure and features, a novel deep learning prediction model is proposed by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN) with long short-term memory cells (Bi-directional LSTM RNN). In order to draw eight classes (Q8) protein secondary structure prediction results, we first utilize CNN to filter and sample amino acid sequences, and then use Bi-directional LSTM RNN to model context information interaction between amino acids in protein. Experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is about 1-3% higher than that of the existing prediction models, and the prediction accuracy of 69.4% is obtained.

In the practical cases we often need to transmit information blocks from scores of sources to a common destination through one or more relays, which encourages us to reclaim the scenarios in which up to one hundred sources transmit information blocks to the destination. Obviously, in these scenarios, sources need to be re-organized to improve the system performance. Our propositions are Multi Distributed LT codes (MDLT) and Backtracking Distributed LT codes (BDLT). We investigate the performances of these codes by density evolution, and present the simulating results, compared with those Conventional Distributed codes (CDLT).

In this paper, we develop a system for estimating camera pose for large and outdoor environments. A large set of images for outdoor environments are collected and 3D structure of the scenes are recovered using a structure from motion technique. To improve image indexing accuracy and efficiency, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to extract image features and a set of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) functions are used to classify CNN features. With these techniques, camera localization is achieved by first indexing the nearest images by CNN and LSH and then a set of 2D-3D correspondences are established from the indexed images and the recovered 3D structure. A perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm is then applied on the 2D-3D correspondences to estimate camera pose. A series of experiments are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness of proposed system. The nearest neighbors to query image can be accurately and efficiently extracted and the camera pose can be accurately estimated.

The extreme scale of Mapreduce applications require an efficiently profitable resource allocation algorithm that minimizes the energy consumption cost while maintaining the highest level of performance. In this paper, we propose a profit-maximum model that minimizes the cost of energy consumption and makespan. By adopting a minimum-weight b-matching rounding algorithm (MBRA) to find an integer solution, then assign map/reduce tasks to individual slots to build a complete resource allocation. Finally, we perform experiments on real workload to evaluate the profit-maximum model and analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm. The results show that MBRA is able to find a near-optimal integer solution that maximizes the profit per unit time in a lower runtime, and it is up to 30% similar to 70% in profit that is better than the current heuristic scheduling algorithm and the rounding algorithm.

The paper integrates domain-specific modelling and web service techniques with model-driven development, and proposes a unified approach named SODSMI (Service Oriented executable Domain-Specific Modelling and Implementation) to build the executable domain-specific model so as to achieve the target of modeldriven development and reuse. The approach is organised by domain space, which is employed as the elementary unit of the domain-specific modelling and implementation framework. It makes software reuse at the domain level, realises the reuse of domain knowledge, and openly extends the range and scale of domain-specific model and its implementation.

In order to improve the quality of products and to provide features that can satisfy consumers' needs, technicians must understand the expectations of consumers. This paper recommends the use of quality function deployment (QFD), a method that integrates consumers' dynamic requirements with product designs, which can be represented using a House of Quality (HoQ) matrix diagram. Here, the unmet and uncovered needs of consumers relating to the Smartwatch are analyzed extensively using a questionnairebased survey. The opinions of consumers and technicians are then examined, and a HoQ diagram is constructed to evaluate the relationship between the Smartwatch's design attributes and its technical attributes. Finally, the attributes that need to be improved are listed in a suggested order of priority.	[Lee, An Wun; Lin, Grace T.

Common frameworks for mining co-location patterns generate numerous redundant patterns. Thus, several methods were proposed to overcome this drawback. However, most of these methods did not guarantee that the extracted co-location patterns were interesting for being generally based on statistical information. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker choose interesting co-location patterns with an efficient interactive procedure. This paper proposed an interactive approach to discover interesting co-location patterns. First, ontologies were used to improve the integration of user knowledge. Second, an interactive process was designed to collaborate with the user to find interesting co-location patterns efficiently. Finally, a filter was designed to reduce the number of discovered co-location patterns in the result set further. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

The major challenge faced by such architecture is to find the right data on some node efficiently. In this paper, we present two alternatives for data indexing based on Chord, a Peer to Peer (P2P) overlay structure, which redefine the routing table structure that underlies the Chord and achieve small search paths. First, we present a regional search algorithm that routes data keys queries by region and super-node information. The search process can be easily implemented via O(log K) hops, while maintaining O(log K) routing information with K regions in the Chord ring at each node. We further propose a Two-hop search based on the regional search scheme which aims to reduce the average search paths to a constant with O(log K) routing states about super-nodes. Results from theoretical analysis and simulations show that our improved routing algorithms can achieve higher search efficiency and the improved membership maintenances can keep routing information sufficiently up-to-date to validate higher search successful rate.

Multicast key distribution scheme updates and distributes group keys safely when a member joins or leaves the group. However it has problems when arbitrary group members want to build a dynamic conference, because traditional distribution scheme uses group controller to manage the work. In fact, a n-member group will have 2(n)-n-1 possible conferences. Moreover, members may need to join and/or leave the group dynamically. If a group controller deals with all the members' requests, it will be the performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new stateful multicast key distribution protocol based on identity-based encryption. This protocol can distribute the group keys safely and allows the group members to build dynamic conferences by themselves. It greatly reduces the group controller's workload. In addition, compared with traditional rekeying messages contain identifier and group key's version, our protocol can reduce the size of rekeying messages by customizing the public key. We provide three algorithms (INIT, JOIN, LEAVE) for rekeying when a group membership changes and a revocation algorithm for building dynamic conferences without the group controller. We also give the security proof of our protocol in a symbolic security model and the implementation of the protocol.

For every edge e = uv is an element of E, if capacity c(uv) < H, we should increase the capacity of edge uv, and the increasing value is add(uv) = H - c(uv); if capacity c(uv) >= H, we needn't increase the capacity of edge uv, and the increasing value is add(uv) = 0. Find a spanning tree T of G, such that d(T) (s, v) <= alpha . d(G) (s, v) + beta (alpha, beta >= 0) for every v is an element of V, here, d(T) (s, v) is the distance from s to t in T, d(G) (s, v) is the distance from s to t in G, both a and beta are constants. The objective is to minimize the total expanding cost of all the edges in T, that is, min Sigma(e is an element of E(T))add(e) . b(e). We call it the restricted minimum single source shortest path tree expansion problem. The problem is NP-hard, and we design a heuristic algorithm for it. Suppose alpha = 1, beta = 0 in the constraint condition d(T) (s, v) <= alpha . d(G) (s, v) + beta (alpha, beta >= 0) for every vertex v is an element of V, we call the new problem the extended restricted minimum single source shortest path tree expansion problem and design a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for it. On the basis of the extended restricted minimum single source shortest path tree expansion problem, we study a more widespread problem with a different objective: find a single source shortest path tree T (we can use any v is an element of V as a root), such that the total expanding cost of all the edges in T is minimum, that is, min Sigma(e is an element of E(T))add(e) . b(e). We call it the general restricted minimum single source shortest path tree expansion problem, then design a polynomial-time algorithm for it.

Therefore how to use both of labeled and unlabeled data to improve the learning performance becomes critical issue for many real-world applications. Active Learning and Semi-supervised Learning are right solutions to such problem, and have been intensively studied from different perspectives. The former one advocates that learner is able to control the entire dataset and actively query the labels from the target dataset, the latter one tries to improve the learner's performance by using both of labeled and unlabeled instances at the same time. In this paper, we propose an Active Learning based SVM approach, KA-SVM. According to a cluster hypothesis, we use k-means to construct a pre-selection scheme, which obtains a subset of important instances as training set, then SVM can be optimally trained on such subset rather than entire one. Our approach has been generally evaluated on several benchmark datasets with comparison with other similar approaches, the experiment results demonstrate that our approach has the outstanding performance on both of classification accuracy and computation efficiency.

It has been reported that KISS metric learning has been followed by most of the previous supervised work because of its state of the art performance for person re-identification on VIPeR dataset. However, given only a small number of labeled image pairs available for training, the matching model certainly suffers from unstable learning process and poor matching result. To address this serious practical issue, we proposed a novel semi-supervised KISS metric learning (SS-KISS) approach which makes use of unlabeled data to improve the re-identification performance by 1) combining both global and local information to select the most confident image pairs from the unlabeled data; 2) using an ensemble approach, which explores advantages of supervised and unsupervised learning by reconciling two matching models on which labeled and unlabeled data to an optimal one via smart weighting schema. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three datasets: VIPeR, ETHZ, and i-LiDS, experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a sound performance in the case of small amount of labeled data.

However, the typical ontology may not be sufficient to represent uncertainty information. Fuzzy ontology is proposed to solve the uncertainty reasoning problems. But the construction of fuzzy ontology is still a tedious and painstaking task. The cognitive model of fuzzy ontology learning is an automatic model of fuzzy ontology construction that simulates the process of human being recognizing the world. Induction is an important step of the model. In this paper, we present a strategy for the fuzzy ontology induction in the cognitive model of ontology learning which includes some generalization principles and the corresponding induction operators. It generates induction hypothesis through a series of operations. As a result, induction hypothesis are generated from the present ontology and it can generalize the existing ontology.

The opinions of participants are also influenced by their social relationship. In this paper, we establish a game model of information disclosure by introducing a weighted social network into the utility function of participants. First, we prove that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium of the game by using potential game tool, and quantify the performance of a P2P lending platform. Second, each participant dynamically changes its opinion according to interactions with others since participants cannot reach a stable opinion in a single round. Thus, we use computational experiments to simulate the dynamic changes of participants' opinions in a P2P lending platform. Experimental results show that opinions of participants will converge to a concentrated numerical range although the initial opinion of each participant is stochastic. Furthermore, considering the inactivity and short-sightedness characters of participants, we conduct other experiments to illustrate the influence factors of opinions.

The water cycle and transportation in urban drainage system are completed by a series of different functions of the drainage pumping stations, which burden the task of pumping the domestic sewage, industrial waste water and rainwater to the downstream pipe, water treatment facilities or river water bodies. Nowadays, 'Status is unknown' like inadequate, inaccurate and non-systematic information on the design parameters, construction age and operating status of pumping station facilities is common for most pumping stations in our country. Kunming is located in the southwest of China border and in the subtropical monsoon zone, the climate is extremely affected by the tropical monsoon, which makes the rainfall obviously different in different seasons. Meanwhile, sitting beside Dianchi Lake, the city's unique geographical location determines the unique construction of drainage pumping stations. From the economic view, compared to Beijing, Shanghai and other developed areas in China, Yunnan Provence's industrial strength and information management are still at low level. Thus, this paper is the first time for Yunnan Provence to make a set of data standards for the drainage pumping station and will be a principle for the future innovation of relevant facilities. In this paper, all the data are from the existing data collected by Kunming Drainage Facilities Management Co., Ltd, and systematically summarized from the existing and operating drainage pumping stations in Kunming.

Most previous studies take the prevalence of co-locations as the interestingness measure. However, it is more meaningful to take the utility value of each instance into account in spatial co-location pattern mining in some cases. In this paper, we present a new interestingness measure for mining high utility co-location patterns from spatial data sets with instance-specific utilities. In the new interestingness measure, we take the intra-utility and inter-utility into consideration to capture the global influence of each feature in co-locations. We present a basic algorithm for mining high utility co-locations. In order to reduce high computational cost, some pruning strategies are given to improve the efficiency. The experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that the proposed method is effective and the pruning strategies are efficient.

According to the different ways of service agreement can be divided into: No-Persistent CSMA, 1-Persistent CSMA, P-Persistent CSMA. Although these protocols can improve the system throughput, but there are also some shortcomings, they are not fully utilized in the channel idle period, cannot provide the corresponding needs for various services. Therefore, from the point of view of improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of wireless communication network and utilization of channel resource. the Multichannel Dual Clock Probability Detection CSMA Random Multiple Access was proposed. In the protocol, the discrete continuous clock strategy was used to improve the QoS of each service in the wireless communication network. Based on the mathematical model, the throughput of the system and priority is obtained; Finally, the simulation shows that the new protocol can make use of the idle time of the channel, and achieve the system load balance by controlling the arrival rate of the priority, which ensures the QoS requirements of the high priority service.

In this paper, the contrast experiments based on sparse coding are carried out between high and low resolution paintings. Different features are extracted in frequency domain and Gabor domain from the basis function of sparse coding (SC). Then the normalized mutual information (NMI) is figured out to analyze the effect of different features for painting style. At last, the features with better performance are used to classify the paintings' style. The results of experiments show that, to a certain extent, the features extracted from low-resolution paintings still have the ability to characterize the painting style, among which the Gabor energy has the best effect in the painting style analysis.

However, up to now graphene has not been widely used in optoelectronic fields yet, which is mainly caused by its semimetal properties. Therefore, changing its properties from semimetal to semiconductor is becoming a focal point. Recently, aiming at tuning the energy band of graphene, we have carried out systematic studies on the preparations of graphene based materials and devices, the CVD growth techniques of monolayer and double layer graphenes have been developed, the large-area doped graphene films have been fabricated to tune the structure-related optical and electrical properties. A novel graphene oxide (GO) preparation method namely "Tang-Lau method" has been invented, the graphene quantum dots growths by microwave assisted hydrothermal method and "Soft-Template method" have been developed, the Cl, S and K doped graphene quantum dots preparations by hydrothermal methods have also been invented. Systematic investigations have been carried out for the effect of preparation parameters on the properties of graphene based materials, the effects of size, doping elements on the energy level of graphene based materials have been explored and discussed. Based on the semiconducting graphene based materials, some novel room temperature photodetectors covering detection wavebands from UV, Vis and NIR have been designed and fabricated.

This paper focuses on a problem of incremental mining high utility co-locations on spatial databases which are constantly changed with added and disappeared data. Incremental mining high utility co-locations is a complicated process when a spatial database is changed, because added and disappeared data will produce new spatial relationships and take away the existing spatial relationships. The changed relationships can affect the results of high utility co-location mining. So the efficient update of the high utility co-locations is a big challenge for us. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for incremental mining the high utility patterns and evaluates the method by experiments.

The XRD, TEM and XPS were employed to characterize the structure and morphology of the SnO2 nanorods. The influence of the calcination temperature on the gas sensing behaviour of the SnO2 nanorods with different diameter was investigated. The result showed that all the sensors had good response to alcohol. The response of the gracile nanorods prepared at a low calcined temperature demonstrated significantly better than the thick nanorods prepared at a high calcined temperature. The mechanism was attributed to the nonstoichiometric ratio of Sn/O and larger surface area of the gracile nanorods to enhance the oxygen surface adsorption.	[Gao, F.; Wan, W. J.; Zhao, Y.

From the amino acid sequence point of view, this paper fused two feature representations, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and dipeptide composition (DipC), to form a new feature expression. Then a dimensionality reduction algorithm of liner discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to this new fusion representation. Last, a two-layer stacking evaluation model was constructed, which contains four base classifiers of SVM, KNN, RF and NN in layer-1 and a meta-classifier (multiple logistic regression, MLR) in layer-2, to predict the types of membrane protein. The final experimental results show the prediction performance of the proposed ensemble classifier is better than all base classifiers. The overall accuracies for jackknife test and independent dataset test are as high as 85.47% and 90.70% respectively, which paves a new way for future prediction of membrane protein types.

The key of text representation is to extract and express the semantic and syntax feature of texts. The order-sensitive sequence models based on neural networks have achieved great progress in text representation. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Neural Networks, as an extension of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), not only can deal with variable-length texts, capture the long-term dependencies in texts, but also model the forward and backward sequence contexts. Moreover, typical neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), can extract more semantic and structural information from texts, because of their convolution and pooling operations. The paper proposes a hybrid model, which combines the BiLSTM with 2-dimensial convolution and 1-dimensial pooling operations. In other words, the model firstly captures the abstract representation vector of texts by the BiLSTM, and then extracts text semantic features by 2-dimensial convolutional and 1-dimensial pooling operations. Experiments on text classification tasks show that our method obtains preferable performances compared with the state-of-the-art models when applied on the MR1 sentence polarity dataset.

The separation based on High-pass filtering (S_HPF) is a commonly used method for extracting harmonic components from ultrasonic echo signals. However, the cutoff frequency, order and algorithm to realize a high-pass filter have a great influence on the separation accuracy of harmonic signals. In present study, a novel separation method (S_CEEMDAN) based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm is proposed for adaptively separating harmonic components from ultrasonic echo signals. First, we calculate the ensemble size of CEEMDAN adaptively based on the added noise level, and draw a sum of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from the ultrasonic echo signals by CEEMDAN. Then, the spectrum of each IMF is computed and evaluated, and the IMFs containing both fundamental and harmonic components are further decomposed by using the CEEMDAN algorithm. This separation process is end until all of IMFs have been divided into either fundamental or harmonic categories. Finally, the corresponding fundamental and harmonic echo signals are yielded by accumulating separately these two categories. In experiments, simulated ultrasonic echo signals with a center frequency of 3.5MHz are separated by the proposed S_CEEMDAN method, and the results are compared with those processed by S_HPF. The edge of the harmonic image by S_CEEMDAN marginally better defined than S_HPF. The indices for the harmonic signals separated by S_CEEMDAN and S_HPF, respectively, are as follows: the center frequencies of 6.66 MHz and 6.65 MHz, 3 dB bandwidths of 1.04 MHz and 1.05 MHz, 6 dB bandwidths of 1.59 MHz and 1.55 MHz, signal-tonoise ratios (SNRs) of 14.00 and 13.63, and image contrasts of 7.01 and 7.06. In conclusion, due to good adaptive characteristics, and lower reconstruction errors, the proposed S_CEEMD method is superior to S_HPF in the performance of spectral accuracy and harmonic imaging.

Since the SVM-RFE algorithm can select the optimal feature subset according to the correlation between each feature and protein subcellular localization, and it can reduce the computational complexity while keeping the result steady and having a high degree of generalization in the progress of using the RFE part of SVM-RFE method, therefore, this algorithm is applied to predict protein subcellular localization. First of all, we extract amino acid components, dipeptide component and entropy density from Position Specific Scoring Matrix to construct the feature expression model of protein sequence. Then we use the recursion feature elimination to conduct feature selection. Finally, the support vector machine classifier was used to conduct Jackknife verification on two data sets of Gram Positive and Negative. The experimental results show that the application of SVM-RFE algorithm to protein subcellular localization has a good predictive accuracy.

In the ultrasonic detection, the traditional focus mode has low frame rate in linear scan, poor detected accuracy outside the focus points, difficulty of quick estimation in two-dimensional area and some other limitations, is restrainedly used in clinic. Plane wave doesn't make beam forming in emission, so the frame rate can reach 20 kHz. It can obtain the two-dimensional velocity distribution covered by the transducer at one emission and reception. And the detected region that is penetrated by coherent plane wave compound with different inclination angle is helpful to improve the estimated accuracy of blood flow velocity distribution (BFVD). However, the key factors, inclination angle interval and compound times, are lack of systematic investigation in terms of the estimated accuracy of BFVD. In present study, an intensive research on this issue based on Field II platform is made. Plane wave imaging mode, coherent plane wave compound, autocorrelation estimation and other methods are used to deal with pulse-echo radio frequency signals to calculate the BFVD. In the simulation experiment, transducer emits plane waves of different inclination angle, then, the velocity is estimated respectively from the signals combined coherently by 3, 5, 7 and 9 times. The results show that the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) are 0.24, 0.30, 0.35 and 0.36 when the inclination angle is set to +/- 0.5 degrees, +/- 7 degrees, +/- 14 degrees and +/- 21 degrees at the compound times of 3. The accuracy of the estimated results has an opposite trend with the increase of inclination angle interval. It also shows that the NRMSE are 0.24, 0.23, 0.22 and 0.22 when using 3, 5, 7 and 9 times to compound at a fixed angle interval of +/- 0.5 degrees. The accuracy of the estimation results is related slightly to the number of compound.

However, the standard ultrasonography (SU), a common technique to measure the thicknesses of the membranes of CCA walls and related dynamic parameters, scans objects by focused beam transmissions line-by-line. The limited number of focus causes vessel wall imaging to be discontinuous and fuzzy in the regions outside the focus. Thus the measurement accuracy and reliability for diagnosis indices based on the images are degraded. In present study, we propose to use the coherent plane wave compounding ultrasonography (CPCU) for scanning the CCA wall with 3MS to improve the detection performance. A 3D scatterer model of CCA with 3MS is established to simulate SUand CPCU-based B-mode images by using ultrasound simulation platform. The thicknesses of intima, media and adventitia of the CCA wall are segmented from B-mode images by using the threshold method, respectively. Results based on 30 sets of simulations show that the measurement accuracies for the thicknesses of three membrane structure based on the CPCU and the SU are not significantly different, but the effective detection ratio of segmentation from images based on CPCU is 12% higher than that based on SU.

If value of it is set unreasonably, the dimension-reduced data are insufficient for discrimination. Based on this point, a new method is proposed to search the optimal window width parameter in gaussian kernel by introducing the idea of semi-supervised learning in this paper. We firstly employed the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to search the optimal interval of kernel parameter through a new discriminant criterion. Then the traversing method was applied to search the optimal parameter in the obtained interval. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, which is named as KPCA based on semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, numerical experiments were conducted on a public dataset to predict protein subnuclear location with the classifier of k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The final results by Jackknife test prove that our method is efficient and significative.

Several CP-ABE based cryptographic cloud storage systems have been proposed in recent years. However, access policy revocation is expensive in these systems, because data owner has to retrieve, re-encrypt and re-upload the data when access policy updates. To optimize the access policy revocation procedure, Cheng et al. proposed a revocation scheme for CP-ABE based cryptographic cloud storage. In their scheme, the original data is first divided into a number of slices, and then uploaded to the cloud storage. When a revocation occurs, the data owner needs only to retrieve, re-encrypt and re-upload one slice instead of the entire data. They claimed that their scheme is efficient and computationally secure. In this paper, we first point out Cheng et al.'s scheme only preserves all-or-nothing property for one time, then we show that it is susceptible to a fatal attack from the malicious revoked data user who stores the symmetric key or generates extra valid slices.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a face recognition algorithm based on the Gabor wavelet, principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). Specifically, bilinear interpolation is introduced to preprocess the original face database. Then, Gabor wavelets are used to extract the detailed features of the faces. The extracted Gabor features are dimensional reduced by two methods, respectively, they are: principal component analysis (PCA) plus linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and KPCA plus LDA. The two dimensional reduced features are then fused together with certain weights. All the experiments are based on the YALE face database and the ORL face database. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency of face recognition in the complex environment.

It is made up of a layer substrate. The six order SIW filter is a narrow bandpass microwave filter through electric coupling and magnetic coupling of SIW resonators or cavities. The cascaded resonators of the filter are formed by properly etching the slots on the top metal plane of a SIW cavity. The slots create the electric coupling. The magnetic coupling is formed by period metallic vias in the middle of a SIW cavity. Furthermore, the electric and magnetic couplings achieves two transmission zero points. The electric coupling have influence on the upper transmission zero point, and magnetic coupling have influence on the lower transmission zero point. It is demonstrated that the SIW filter has a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz at a center frequency of 15 GHz. The measured results have a good agreement with the simulated results.

The proposed Magneto-Electric antenna is composed of a planar electric dipole with a convexity-ship hole, a vertical-oriented quarter-wave shorted patch, Gamma-shaped strip feed line and a rectangular box-shaped reflector. The convexity-ship hole on the planar electric dipole can expand the impedance bandwidth. A high gain can be realized by using a rectangular box-shaped reflector. Simulated results show that this antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 60%(S-11 <= -10dB), ranging from 1.64 GHz to 3.04 GHz, and a high gain about 8.9 dB. Moreover, radiation patterns with low back radiation, fixing broadside direction mainbeam, symmetrical E- and H-plane patterns and large front-to-back ratio are obtained over the whole operating band by using a rectangular box-shaped reflector. The good performances make the antenna suitable for the wireless communication systems.

Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate on the problem of analyzing the operating performance of insurance companies, and it is crucial for modern financial industry development. Firstly, we design an index system for evaluating operating performance of insurance companies, which contains four components: 1) Profitability, 2) Solvency, 3) Capital adequacy and 4) Management ability. Secondly, we utilize the DEA model to solve this problem, and the DEA model is designed to calculate efficiency scores of Decision Making Units to obtain a weighted sum of either several inputs or several outputs without using the priori information. Because the performance of the DEA model greatly relies on input and output variables choosing, we propose a two stages DEA model to evaluate the operating performance of insurance companies. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to analyze the operating performance of insurance company with high accuracy.

Aiming at the defects of today's personalized information service as well as the growing requirement of personalized information, a personalized information push service model based on context awareness has been put forward in this paper. In this model, Internet of things and context awareness have been used to build a context information acquisition environment and to gather the context information of users. Furthermore, a user-personalized interest model has been constructed and combined with the spatio-temporal correlation to catch the relationship among the user groups, so that an information push mechanism based on spatio-temporal correlation can be achieved. Our method provides a more efficient and precise information push service.

It can separate overlapping texture and cartoon image layers by use two adapted dictionaries. MCA performs good in image inpainting, especially for the image scratch repairing, small area filling, and remove small object. In this paper, we proposed a color image inpainting algorithm based on MCA, and applied the proposed algorithm to repair the murals digital image in the Shibaoshan grotto of Jianchuan, Yunnan province. The central idea of the algorithm is converting the color image into the Lab color space, and inpainting the texture and piecewise smooth (cartoon) parts respectively. Meanwhile, our method increases the TV penalty term in the sparse representation of the cartoon parts to reduce the effects of the noise. Finally, the method combines three channels to realize the color image restoration. Experimential results show that the method has good performence on scratches and cracks in the inpainting of digital images of mural paintings.

Accurately grasp the dynamic change process of landscape pattern in the area, and analysis natural and human driving force in the landscape pattern evolution of history heritage corridor ancient tea horse road that play the role, for to formulate ecological protection planning of the historical and cultural heritage corridor have great significance. This paper selects these towns and villages which stand along the typically initial segment of the ancient tea horse road i.e. route of Simao to Ninger that as the research object. It uses 1999,2006 and 2013 Landsat TM and ETM remote sensing images as the basic data, and integrating use of RS, GIS and landscape ecology related theory methods, and analyses the characteristics of the landscape dynamic evolution and driving forces and driving mechanism for 14 years in this research area. The results show that has significant changes landscape pattern in study area from 1999 to 2013. The main conclusions are as follows. From the level of types, reduction amount of the forest area is the most, a reduction of 7%, the fragmentation degree increases. Urban construction land shows an overall growth trend, its area increases significantly, an increase of 22.3%, the degree of aggregation increases, the connectivity of urban construction land strengthens, and the patch shape tends to be simple. The area of grassland and water overall area trends to increase. The area of cultivated land trends to increase. From the level of landscapes, in this study area, landscape patch density continues to decrease, the total number of landscape patches continues to reduce, on the whole, the landscape patch distribution becomes more continuous, tends to fusion between patches. Landscape separation index trends to be rising, distribution of landscape types tends to be complex and discrete, individual patches are sporadic, scattered. The landscape of the Shannon diversity index and Shannon evenness index shows a certain rising trend, the diversity of landscape structure is increasing. The rising of Shannon evenness index shows that the control force of the original landscape that was in dominant position on the whole landscape is declining, and influence of different landscape types on the whole landscape pattern tends to equilibrium. This research focuses on the analysis on the driving factors and driving mechanism of the evolution of landscape pattern in the study area from natural factors and human factors. The result shows that topographic factors, demographic factors, economic factors, industrialization and urbanization factors, economic system and decision making factors affect the change of landscape pattern jointly. Meanwhile, at different spatial scales and time scales, the main driving forces which have influence on the landscape pattern are not the same.
