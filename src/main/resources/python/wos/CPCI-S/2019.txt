Recently, much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this article, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task and this new analysis techniques can guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5) in the case of a single task. Furthermore, the proposed analysis techniques are also extended to the case of multiple DAG tasks under GEDF and federated scheduling. Finally, through empirical evaluation, we justify the out-performance of our schedulability tests compared to the state-of-the-art in general.

We also investigate the Z-singular values of positive (non-negative) tensors and diagonal tensors, in which case the Z-singular values can be expressed explicitly. As an application, upper bounds for the Z-singular spectral radius of fourth-order tensors are discussed by using the inclusion theorems.

Existing approaches in this field only take into account the clique instances where feature instances form a clique. However, they may neglect some important spatial correlations among features in practice. In this paper, we introduce star participation instances to measure the prevalence of co-location patterns such that spatially correlated instances which cannot form cliques will also be properly considered. Then we propose a new concept called sub-prevalent co-location patterns (SPCP) based on the star participation instances. Furthermore, two efficient algorithms -- the prefix-tree-based algorithm (PTBA) and the partition-based algorithm (PBA) -- are proposed to mine all the maximal sub-prevalent co-location patterns (MSPCP) in a spatial data set. PTBA uses a typical candidate generate-and-test way starting from candidates with the longest pattern-size, while PBA adopts a step-by-step manner starting from 3-size core patterns. We demonstrate the significance of our proposed new concepts as well as the efficiency of our algorithms through extensive experiments.

This paper proposes a pedestrian tracking algorithm based on improved incremental learning. According to the difference between the central position of the current observation model and that of the previous one, the reliability of the observation model can be judged, and then the forgetting factor can be adjusted, so that the observation model can adapt to the changes of pedestrian targets. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm can track the pedestrian target accurately and effectively in the occlusion scene.

We then feed the minus result of two processed results into a CNN architecture to predict whether the input image is original or tampered.

However, in the current wireless communication, the signal is subjected to various interferences in the process of propagation due to the openness of the channel. In the conventional communication system, the bandwidth of the transmission signal is designed as a narrow band to achieve the purpose of suppressing interference, and the spread spectrum technology will spread the spectrum of the baseband signal to a wide frequency band for transmission to solve the problem in the wireless communication system. It is one of the best ways to solve multiple access, anti-interference and confidentiality in wireless communication systems.

Co-location pattern mining is particularly valuable for discovering spatial dependencies. Lots of co-location pattern mining approaches have been proposed, but they often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result, the interesting pattern which involves spatial features with significantly different for the number of instances cannot be captured. In this paper, we are committed to address the problem of mining co-location patterns from the spatial database with rare features. Specifically, we first propose a new interest measure, namely the weighted participation index. This interest measure is related to the distribution of the number of instances for spatial features, and it has ability to capture the prevalent co-location patterns with or without rare features. Furthermore, we prove that the weighted participation index possesses the approximate monotonicity property, which can be utilized to improve the computational efficiency, and thereby an efficient algorithm is developed. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our approach is effective, efficient and scalable for mining co-location patterns embedded in the spatial database with rare features.

The proximity between instances is defined by a distance threshold given by the user in traditional spatial co-location pattern mining. However, the user doesn't know which distance threshold is appropriate in most cases, even for experts. Besides, different densities of instance distribution are not considered in a dataset when using a unified distance threshold to measure the proximity. Also, global topological relations of instances are ignored in mining. In this paper, we consider the global topological relations by constructing Delaunay triangulation of spatial instances and calculate a distance constraint for each instance based on the constructed Delaunay triangulation. We redefine the proximity of instances according to the distance constraint so that users don't have to worry about giving an appropriate distance threshold when mining prevalent co-location patterns. We propose a new algorithm PTB based on a proximity relationship tree P-tree which stores the proximity relationships between instances. The experimental evaluation of several real-world datasets shows that our algorithm can get better results. We also evaluate each parameter and the number of features and instances affecting the efficiency of the algorithm by using synthetic datasets.

Most existing algorithms of discovering spatial co-location patterns are based on the candidate-test model, which is computationally expensive. When the user adjusts the participation index (PI) threshold, these algorithms have to be re-executed from the size 2 co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial instance partition method for mining co-location patterns which called overlap maximal clique partitioning algorithm (OMCP). The OMCP co-location mining algorithm divides instances of an input spatial dataset into a set of overlap maximal cliques. Table instances of all colocation patterns are collected by the overlap maximal cliques. Prevalent co-location patterns are directly calculated without generating the candidate patterns. The OMCP algorithm only needs to execute once to get the PI of all patterns, without re-executing when the PI threshold is adjusted. Our algorithm is performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the OMCP algorithm improvements in efficiency of co-location pattern mining.

There are many literatures studied the approach of discovering co-location patterns. However, a lot of proposed approaches need some thresholds given by the user, and it is difficult to give the proper thresholds. Moreover, most proposed approaches treat the spatial object as a point during the mining process, but spatial objects are dynamic or appear in the form of a cluster normally, which means that their locations are polygons rather than points. This paper provides a novel framework to mine co-location patterns from spatial regional objects. At first, we redefine the interest measure of significant co-locations. In our framework, the user does not need to specify any threshold, and the redefined interest measure is monotonically non-increasing which can be used for improving the mining efficiency. Then, an algorithm based on the grid partition is proposed to reduce time complexity further. Finally, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach by extensive experiments.

Measuring influence can benefit to identify the influential users, and also benefit to provide important insights into the design of social platforms and applications. However, most existing work on social influence analysis has focused on homogeneous information networks. Fewstudies systematically investigate how to mine the strength of influence between nodes in heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we present a meta path-based information entropy for modeling social influence in heterogeneous information networks (MPIE). Through setting meta paths, MPIE not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information, but also obtains potential link information to measure the influence of nodes. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Current spatial co-location mining methods ignore the people who are related to the co-location patterns' instances, which results that the mining results are hard to explain and understand by the users. In this paper, we combine the theories of co-location mining and social networks analysis to mine a kind of special co-location patterns: Co-visiting patterns, which consider spatial information and social information at the same time. A co-visiting pattern is also a spatial feature set, whose instances are always visited by the similar users and located in a nearby region. We propose some new measures, including the user similarity, the weight of neighborhood relationship of two visited spatial instances, and the prevalent degree of a co-visiting pattern. In addition, we also explore the properties of the co-visiting patterns in this paper, and present an efficient algorithm. Finally, experiments and a detailed analysis are given at the end of this paper.

The key idea is to learn spatio-temporal features by fusing convolutional networks spatially and temporally. However, there are some problems within such architecture. First, it relies on optical flow to model temporal information, which are often expensive to compute and store. Second, it has limited ability to capture details and local context information for video data. Third, it lacks explicit semantic guidance that greatly decrease the classification performance. In this paper, we proposed a new two-stream based deep framework for video classification to discover spatial and temporal information only from RGB frames, moreover, the multi-scale pyramid attention (MPA) layer and the semantic adversarial learning (SAL) module is introduced and integrated in our framework. The MPA enables the network capturing global and local feature to generate a comprehensive representation for video, and the SAL can make this representation gradually approximate to the real video semantics in an adversarial manner. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate our proposed methods achieves state-of-the-art results on standard video datasets.

In this paper, a novel meta-path based approach MPSMDA is proposed to predict the association of miRNA-disease. MPSMDA uses experimentally validated data to build a miRNA-disease heterogeneous information network (MDHIN). Thus, miRNA-disease association prediction is transformed into a link prediction problem on a MDHIN. Meta-path based similarity is used to measure the miRNA-disease associations. Since different meta-paths between a miRNA and a disease express different latent semantic association, MPSMDA make full use of all possible meta-paths to predict the associations of miRNAs with diseases.

Multi-core processors enable intra-task parallelism, and there has been much progress on exploiting that, while there has been only a little progress on energy-efficient multi-core real-time scheduling as yet. In this work, we study energy-efficient real-time scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider a clustered multi-core platform where processors within the same cluster run at the same speed at any given time. A new concept named speed-profile is proposed to model per-task and per-cluster energy-consumption variations during run-time to minimize the expected long-term energy consumption. To our knowledge, no existing work considers energy-aware real-time scheduling of DAG tasks with constrained deadlines, nor on a clustered multi-core platform. The proposed energy-aware real-time scheduler is implemented upon an ODROID XU-3 board to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. To complement our system experiments in large-scale, we have also conducted simulations that demonstrate a CPU energy saving of up to 57% through our proposed approach compared to existing methods.

The study found that existing methods can be divided into exponential changes, land use changes and monitoring simulations. However, the research results of existing methods are homogenized. In this study, the gap index model was established and Kunming and Yuxi were taken as examples to systematically introduce the gap index to calculate urban expansion. The study found that the global gap index can better describe the urban expansion characteristics and can explain the heterogeneity between urban land use by scale shifting; The local clearance index can not only describe the urban expansion characteristics, but also analyze the urban expansion direction and expansion trend in detail to describe the spatial pattern change of urban expansion. The application of the gap index in urban expansion has a very good reference for future urban expansion research.

It is even hard for experts, let alone computer-aided diagnosis systems. Recently, some deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based methods have been introduced to tackle this problem, achieving much impressive performance. However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision. In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task. We implement extensive experiments on the public benchmark MICCAI gland 2015 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our method achieve a better segmentation result in terms of visual perception and two quantitative metrics, compared with other methods.

The traditional manual document classification method is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and the classification effect cannot be fully guaranteed. With the popularity of computers and the development of machine learning, the convolutional neural network model is becoming more and more mature, and the CNN model is suitable for the problems encountered in the current official document classification. This paper proposed a model based on convolutional neural network to solve the problem of official document classification. To train and test the model, we manually classify the dataset into ten categories according to the classification of college archives entities. And it was trained on a dataset with size of 6765. And on the testing dataset with size of 676, it reached an accuracy of 90%. And for comparison, we also trained a LSTM model and a GRU model (they are both popular in the natural language processing field), and results showed that the automatic official document classification method based on convolutional neural network can improve the efficiency of traditional official document classification. Also, it provides a new way of thinking for the solution of the official document classification problem.

Its difficulty lies in the non-uniqueness of the inverse process. The regularization method is a classical algorithm for blind deblurring of images, it can iteratively solve blur kernel and clear image by constructing regularization terms. However, improper values of regularization parameter and blur kernel size can easily lead to poor inverse results. In this paper, by calculating differential autocorrelation of the image to obtain the blur scale as the blur kernel size. Then, we proposed a L-like curve method to calculate the regularization parameter. Finally, these calculation results were used to deblur the image with the regularization model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve blind deblurring of images, and the inverse effect of a single blurred car image is obvious. It can meet the requirements of accurately identifying the license plate information of blurred car image.

Recently much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this paper, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task, which not only outperform the state-of-the-art in general evidenced by empirical evaluation, but also guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5). The proposed analysis techniques are also extended to and evaluated with the case of multiple DAG tasks using the federated scheduling approach.

The generalized probability density evolution equation for compound stochastic process is solved by the finite difference method. Then, for the first passage criterion, the dynamic reliability is analysed by establishing the one-dimensional integral in safe domain and the absorbing boundary condition. A new optimization method is coming up combining improved genetic algorithm and PDEM. Taking the parameters optimization of a three-story floor-shear frame structure with TMD under random seismic loads as an example, the correctness of the proposed method is verified by comparing interlayer displacement response and dynamic reliability.

Recently, many researchers focused on mining disease diagnosis to innovate the hidden patterns and their relevant features. Mining bio-medical data is one of the predominant research areas where clustering techniques are emphasized in heart disease diagnosis. But few people deal with large heart disease datasets and then classify disease data sets according to heart disease feature. We propose a method of anomaly threshold based on multiple classifiers can be well suited to datasets containing abnormal data, and use XGBoost algorithm as a sub-classifier to process massive ECG data. This research focuses on the heart disease classification problem. The data set is divided into two categories, and then it was classified into more specific categories, experimental results show that this method can improve classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on massive instances of different heart disease obtained from the hospital actual cases and two data sets of UCI. In fact, we compared SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, Logistic, RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, and found that tree-based model classifier is the best fit to predict arrhythmia. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance to the processing and forecasting system of large medical data sets, and promote the development of wisdom medical care.

Our algorithm hybridizes deep-learning algorithms such as word2vec and recurrent neural network (RNN) with classical techniques to improve the performance of text analysis. Given the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the software requirement descriptions on websites, the instance-transfer learning method is utilized to construct a robust classifier and predict domain feature knowledge based on domain knowledge similar to the target domain. The bagging clustering algorithm is utilized with multiple clustering algorithms to help select transfer instances. [Author to confirm changes.] The RNN-based algorithm is utilized as a useful alternative to predict missing features by studying the requirement descriptions of a related software system, while word2vec is utilized to extract sensible feature keywords for the specific software domain. [Author to confirm changes.] Our RNN model for every subclass is based on the clustering result, and we construct subclass classifiers to recommend requirement keywords. Requirement features recommended by our algorithm potentially increase opportunities for requirement classification, promote software requirement quality, and deliver more reliable software products. We explain the details of implementation and perform experimental work on real requirement descriptions to establish its worth.

However, a large number of small fragments are formed on tips of graphite fibers after a discharge treatment with 10 kV DC high voltage on graphite fibers. These fragments observed by SEM and HRFEM are spheres, flakes and needle-like nanostructures with the size around 50 nm. In this case, each of these spheres and flakes can be an emission center in field emissions and some detectable emission currents can be obtained with a low applied voltage. Experimental results show that a single graphite fiber of 20 mu m diameter can generate near 0.2 mA emission current with 4 kV applied voltage and the stability have been measured to be less than 10 %. It is expected that graphite fibers as a novel cold cathode material will provide a wide range of applications such as in flat panel displays, high-power and high-brightness vacuum electronic devices, and vacuum microelectronic devices.

Recently, much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this article, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task and this new analysis techniques can guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5) in the case of a single task. Furthermore, the proposed analysis techniques are also extended to the case of multiple DAG tasks under GEDF and federated scheduling. Finally, through empirical evaluation, we justify the out-performance of our schedulability tests compared to the state-of-the-art in general.

Existing approaches in this field only take into account the clique instances where feature instances form a clique. However, they may neglect some important spatial correlations among features in practice. In this paper, we introduce star participation instances to measure the prevalence of co-location patterns such that spatially correlated instances which cannot form cliques will also be properly considered. Then we propose a new concept called sub-prevalent co-location patterns (SPCP) based on the star participation instances. Furthermore, two efficient algorithms -- the prefix-tree-based algorithm (PTBA) and the partition-based algorithm (PBA) -- are proposed to mine all the maximal sub-prevalent co-location patterns (MSPCP) in a spatial data set. PTBA uses a typical candidate generate-and-test way starting from candidates with the longest pattern-size, while PBA adopts a step-by-step manner starting from 3-size core patterns. We demonstrate the significance of our proposed new concepts as well as the efficiency of our algorithms through extensive experiments.

S	Du, GC			IOP	Du, Guocai			Target Pedestrian Tracking Algorithm Based on Occlusion Scene	2019 THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, CONTROL AND ROBOTICS (EECR 2019)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Control and Robotics (EECR)	JAN 12-14, 2019	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Sichuan Inst Elect				The traditional incremental learning tracking algorithm tends to drift or lose track when the pedestrian is occluded and the background is similar to the pedestrian target. This paper proposes a pedestrian tracking algorithm based on improved incremental learning. According to the difference between the central position of the current observation model and that of the previous one, the reliability of the observation model can be judged, and then the forgetting factor can be adjusted, so that the observation model can adapt to the changes of pedestrian targets. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm can track the pedestrian target accurately and effectively in the occlusion scene.

The network uses an autoencoder which is pre-trained on the original images to reconstruct the input images. The reconstructed one and the input image are then processed by the SRM filter which can extract the noise distribution of images. We then feed the minus result of two processed results into a CNN architecture to predict whether the input image is original or tampered. The model was trained and evaluated in FaceForensics dataset and state-of-art face swap method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our network.

However, in the current wireless communication, the signal is subjected to various interferences in the process of propagation due to the openness of the channel. In the conventional communication system, the bandwidth of the transmission signal is designed as a narrow band to achieve the purpose of suppressing interference, and the spread spectrum technology will spread the spectrum of the baseband signal to a wide frequency band for transmission to solve the problem in the wireless communication system. It is one of the best ways to solve multiple access, anti-interference and confidentiality in wireless communication systems.

Co-location pattern mining is particularly valuable for discovering spatial dependencies. Lots of co-location pattern mining approaches have been proposed, but they often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result, the interesting pattern which involves spatial features with significantly different for the number of instances cannot be captured. In this paper, we are committed to address the problem of mining co-location patterns from the spatial database with rare features. Specifically, we first propose a new interest measure, namely the weighted participation index. This interest measure is related to the distribution of the number of instances for spatial features, and it has ability to capture the prevalent co-location patterns with or without rare features. Furthermore, we prove that the weighted participation index possesses the approximate monotonicity property, which can be utilized to improve the computational efficiency, and thereby an efficient algorithm is developed. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our approach is effective, efficient and scalable for mining co-location patterns embedded in the spatial database with rare features.

The proximity between instances is defined by a distance threshold given by the user in traditional spatial co-location pattern mining. However, the user doesn't know which distance threshold is appropriate in most cases, even for experts. Besides, different densities of instance distribution are not considered in a dataset when using a unified distance threshold to measure the proximity. Also, global topological relations of instances are ignored in mining. In this paper, we consider the global topological relations by constructing Delaunay triangulation of spatial instances and calculate a distance constraint for each instance based on the constructed Delaunay triangulation. We redefine the proximity of instances according to the distance constraint so that users don't have to worry about giving an appropriate distance threshold when mining prevalent co-location patterns. We propose a new algorithm PTB based on a proximity relationship tree P-tree which stores the proximity relationships between instances. The experimental evaluation of several real-world datasets shows that our algorithm can get better results. We also evaluate each parameter and the number of features and instances affecting the efficiency of the algorithm by using synthetic datasets.

Most existing algorithms of discovering spatial co-location patterns are based on the candidate-test model, which is computationally expensive. When the user adjusts the participation index (PI) threshold, these algorithms have to be re-executed from the size 2 co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial instance partition method for mining co-location patterns which called overlap maximal clique partitioning algorithm (OMCP). The OMCP co-location mining algorithm divides instances of an input spatial dataset into a set of overlap maximal cliques. Table instances of all colocation patterns are collected by the overlap maximal cliques. Prevalent co-location patterns are directly calculated without generating the candidate patterns. The OMCP algorithm only needs to execute once to get the PI of all patterns, without re-executing when the PI threshold is adjusted. Our algorithm is performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the OMCP algorithm improvements in efficiency of co-location pattern mining.

There are many literatures studied the approach of discovering co-location patterns. However, a lot of proposed approaches need some thresholds given by the user, and it is difficult to give the proper thresholds. Moreover, most proposed approaches treat the spatial object as a point during the mining process, but spatial objects are dynamic or appear in the form of a cluster normally, which means that their locations are polygons rather than points. This paper provides a novel framework to mine co-location patterns from spatial regional objects. At first, we redefine the interest measure of significant co-locations. In our framework, the user does not need to specify any threshold, and the redefined interest measure is monotonically non-increasing which can be used for improving the mining efficiency. Then, an algorithm based on the grid partition is proposed to reduce time complexity further. Finally, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach by extensive experiments.

The results, which are in vector form, can be widely applied to various location based services (LBS) without complicated artificial feature extraction. Further, it can also improve the performance of LBS. By a range of experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate our model's capability at characterizing POI.

Measuring influence can benefit to identify the influential users, and also benefit to provide important insights into the design of social platforms and applications. However, most existing work on social influence analysis has focused on homogeneous information networks. Fewstudies systematically investigate how to mine the strength of influence between nodes in heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we present a meta path-based information entropy for modeling social influence in heterogeneous information networks (MPIE). Through setting meta paths, MPIE not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information, but also obtains potential link information to measure the influence of nodes.

Current spatial co-location mining methods ignore the people who are related to the co-location patterns' instances, which results that the mining results are hard to explain and understand by the users. In this paper, we combine the theories of co-location mining and social networks analysis to mine a kind of special co-location patterns: Co-visiting patterns, which consider spatial information and social information at the same time. A co-visiting pattern is also a spatial feature set, whose instances are always visited by the similar users and located in a nearby region. We propose some new measures, including the user similarity, the weight of neighborhood relationship of two visited spatial instances, and the prevalent degree of a co-visiting pattern. In addition, we also explore the properties of the co-visiting patterns in this paper, and present an efficient algorithm.

The key idea is to learn spatio-temporal features by fusing convolutional networks spatially and temporally. However, there are some problems within such architecture. First, it relies on optical flow to model temporal information, which are often expensive to compute and store. Second, it has limited ability to capture details and local context information for video data. Third, it lacks explicit semantic guidance that greatly decrease the classification performance. In this paper, we proposed a new two-stream based deep framework for video classification to discover spatial and temporal information only from RGB frames, moreover, the multi-scale pyramid attention (MPA) layer and the semantic adversarial learning (SAL) module is introduced and integrated in our framework. The MPA enables the network capturing global and local feature to generate a comprehensive representation for video, and the SAL can make this representation gradually approximate to the real video semantics in an adversarial manner. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate our proposed methods achieves state-of-the-art results on standard video datasets.

To construct EABN efficiently, we employ self-organizing map for TWC dataset division to make the co-occurrence-based dependence of each pair of entities concern just a small set of documents. Using probabilistic inferences of EABN, we evaluate and rank EAs in all possible entity pairs, by which novel latent EAs could be found. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

In this paper, a novel meta-path based approach MPSMDA is proposed to predict the association of miRNA-disease. MPSMDA uses experimentally validated data to build a miRNA-disease heterogeneous information network (MDHIN). Thus, miRNA-disease association prediction is transformed into a link prediction problem on a MDHIN. Meta-path based similarity is used to measure the miRNA-disease associations. Since different meta-paths between a miRNA and a disease express different latent semantic association, MPSMDA make full use of all possible meta-paths to predict the associations of miRNAs with diseases. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets for performance comparison with existing approaches. Two case studies on lung neoplasms and breast neoplasms are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of MPSMDA.

Multi-core processors enable intra-task parallelism, and there has been much progress on exploiting that, while there has been only a little progress on energy-efficient multi-core real-time scheduling as yet. In this work, we study energy-efficient real-time scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider a clustered multi-core platform where processors within the same cluster run at the same speed at any given time. A new concept named speed-profile is proposed to model per-task and per-cluster energy-consumption variations during run-time to minimize the expected long-term energy consumption. To our knowledge, no existing work considers energy-aware real-time scheduling of DAG tasks with constrained deadlines, nor on a clustered multi-core platform. The proposed energy-aware real-time scheduler is implemented upon an ODROID XU-3 board to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. To complement our system experiments in large-scale, we have also conducted simulations that demonstrate a CPU energy saving of up to 57% through our proposed approach compared to existing methods.

The study found that existing methods can be divided into exponential changes, land use changes and monitoring simulations. However, the research results of existing methods are homogenized. In this study, the gap index model was established and Kunming and Yuxi were taken as examples to systematically introduce the gap index to calculate urban expansion. The study found that the global gap index can better describe the urban expansion characteristics and can explain the heterogeneity between urban land use by scale shifting; The local clearance index can not only describe the urban expansion characteristics, but also analyze the urban expansion direction and expansion trend in detail to describe the spatial pattern change of urban expansion. The application of the gap index in urban expansion has a very good reference for future urban expansion research.

It is even hard for experts, let alone computer-aided diagnosis systems. Recently, some deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based methods have been introduced to tackle this problem, achieving much impressive performance. However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision. In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task. We implement extensive experiments on the public benchmark MICCAI gland 2015 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our method achieve a better segmentation result in terms of visual perception and two quantitative metrics, compared with other methods.

With the popularity of computers and the development of machine learning, the convolutional neural network model is becoming more and more mature, and the CNN model is suitable for the problems encountered in the current official document classification. This paper proposed a model based on convolutional neural network to solve the problem of official document classification. To train and test the model, we manually classify the dataset into ten categories according to the classification of college archives entities. And it was trained on a dataset with size of 6765. And on the testing dataset with size of 676, it reached an accuracy of 90%. And for comparison, we also trained a LSTM model and a GRU model (they are both popular in the natural language processing field), and results showed that the automatic official document classification method based on convolutional neural network can improve the efficiency of traditional official document classification. Also, it provides a new way of thinking for the solution of the official document classification problem.

Its difficulty lies in the non-uniqueness of the inverse process. The regularization method is a classical algorithm for blind deblurring of images, it can iteratively solve blur kernel and clear image by constructing regularization terms. However, improper values of regularization parameter and blur kernel size can easily lead to poor inverse results. In this paper, by calculating differential autocorrelation of the image to obtain the blur scale as the blur kernel size. Then, we proposed a L-like curve method to calculate the regularization parameter. Finally, these calculation results were used to deblur the image with the regularization model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve blind deblurring of images, and the inverse effect of a single blurred car image is obvious. It can meet the requirements of accurately identifying the license plate information of blurred car image.

Recently much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this paper, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task, which not only outperform the state-of-the-art in general evidenced by empirical evaluation, but also guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5). The proposed analysis techniques are also extended to and evaluated with the case of multiple DAG tasks using the federated scheduling approach.

The generalized probability density evolution equation for compound stochastic process is solved by the finite difference method. Then, for the first passage criterion, the dynamic reliability is analysed by establishing the one-dimensional integral in safe domain and the absorbing boundary condition. A new optimization method is coming up combining improved genetic algorithm and PDEM. Taking the parameters optimization of a three-story floor-shear frame structure with TMD under random seismic loads as an example, the correctness of the proposed method is verified by comparing interlayer displacement response and dynamic reliability.

Recently, many researchers focused on mining disease diagnosis to innovate the hidden patterns and their relevant features. Mining bio-medical data is one of the predominant research areas where clustering techniques are emphasized in heart disease diagnosis. But few people deal with large heart disease datasets and then classify disease data sets according to heart disease feature. We propose a method of anomaly threshold based on multiple classifiers can be well suited to datasets containing abnormal data, and use XGBoost algorithm as a sub-classifier to process massive ECG data. This research focuses on the heart disease classification problem. The data set is divided into two categories, and then it was classified into more specific categories, experimental results show that this method can improve classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on massive instances of different heart disease obtained from the hospital actual cases and two data sets of UCI. In fact, we compared SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, Logistic, RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, and found that tree-based model classifier is the best fit to predict arrhythmia. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance to the processing and forecasting system of large medical data sets, and promote the development of wisdom medical care.

Our algorithm hybridizes deep-learning algorithms such as word2vec and recurrent neural network (RNN) with classical techniques to improve the performance of text analysis. Given the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the software requirement descriptions on websites, the instance-transfer learning method is utilized to construct a robust classifier and predict domain feature knowledge based on domain knowledge similar to the target domain. The bagging clustering algorithm is utilized with multiple clustering algorithms to help select transfer instances. [Author to confirm changes.] The RNN-based algorithm is utilized as a useful alternative to predict missing features by studying the requirement descriptions of a related software system, while word2vec is utilized to extract sensible feature keywords for the specific software domain. [Author to confirm changes.] Our RNN model for every subclass is based on the clustering result, and we construct subclass classifiers to recommend requirement keywords. Requirement features recommended by our algorithm potentially increase opportunities for requirement classification, promote software requirement quality, and deliver more reliable software products. We explain the details of implementation and perform experimental work on real requirement descriptions to establish its worth.

However, a large number of small fragments are formed on tips of graphite fibers after a discharge treatment with 10 kV DC high voltage on graphite fibers. These fragments observed by SEM and HRFEM are spheres, flakes and needle-like nanostructures with the size around 50 nm. In this case, each of these spheres and flakes can be an emission center in field emissions and some detectable emission currents can be obtained with a low applied voltage. Experimental results show that a single graphite fiber of 20 mu m diameter can generate near 0.2 mA emission current with 4 kV applied voltage and the stability have been measured to be less than 10 %. It is expected that graphite fibers as a novel cold cathode material will provide a wide range of applications such as in flat panel displays, high-power and high-brightness vacuum electronic devices, and vacuum microelectronic devices.
