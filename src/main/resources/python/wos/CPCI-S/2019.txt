Knowing membrane protein types provides clues for understanding the structure and function of proteins. Though various computational methods for predicting membrane protein types have been developed, the results still do not meet the expectations of researchers. Results: We propose two deep learning models to process sequence information and evolutionary information, respectively. Both models obtained better results than traditional machine learning models. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the sequence information model, we also provide a new vector representation method to replace the one-hot encoding, whose overall success rate improved by 3.81% and 6.55% on two datasets. Finally, a more effective model is obtained by fusing the above two models, whose overall success rate reached 95.68% and 92.98% on two datasets. Conclusion: The final experimental results show that our method is more effective than existing methods for predicting membrane protein types, which can help laboratory researchers to identify the type of novel membrane proteins.

However, when traditional feature expression methods are adopted, the features usually contain considerable redundant information, which leads to a very low recognition rate of protein structural classes. Results: We constructed a prediction model based on wavelet denoising using different feature expression methods. A new fusion idea, first fuse and then denoise, is proposed in this article. Two types of pseudo amino acid compositions are utilized to distill feature vectors. Then, a two-dimensional (2-D) wavelet denoising algorithm is used to remove the redundant information from two extracted feature vectors. The two feature vectors based on parallel 2-D wavelet denoising are fused, which is known as PWD-FU-PseAAC. The related source codes are available at https://github.com/Xiaoheng-Wang12/Wang-xiaoheng/tree/master. Conclusions: Experimental verification of three low-similarity datasets suggests that the proposed model achieves notably good results as regarding the prediction of protein structural classes.

The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The structure and catalytic performance of two composites were comparatively investigated, and the reduced graphene oxide mass ratios in K-3[PW12O40]/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as KPW-RGO) and (NH4)(3)[PW12O40]/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as NH4PW-RGO) were optimized and their roles in them were explored. The results indicate that the Keggin structures of KPW and NH4PW are still kept after being anchored on the RGO surface, but their morphologies change a lot in composites. The photocatalytic activities of KPW-3RGO (0.01989 min(-1)) are 5.42 times than that of KPW (0.00367 min(-1)), and NH4PW-1RGO (0.0184 min(-1)) is 2.26 times than that of NH4PW (0.00814 min(-1)). The enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to photo-induced interfacial charge transfer on the heterojunction between RGO and NH4PW or KPW and strong adsorption ability of RGO towards MO. Moreover, NH4PW-1RGO and KPW-3RGO had much better photocatalytic activity, good recyclable ability, and stability compared to HPW-RGO, which cannot be recycled.

Recently, much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this article, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task and this new analysis techniques can guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5) in the case of a single task. Furthermore, the proposed analysis techniques are also extended to the case of multiple DAG tasks under GEDF and federated scheduling. Finally, through empirical evaluation, we justify the out-performance of our schedulability tests compared to the state-of-the-art in general.

We also investigate the Z-singular values of positive (non-negative) tensors and diagonal tensors, in which case the Z-singular values can be expressed explicitly. As an application, upper bounds for the Z-singular spectral radius of fourth-order tensors are discussed by using the inclusion theorems. Finally, numerical examples are reported to verify the obtained results.

Existing approaches in this field only take into account the clique instances where feature instances form a clique. However, they may neglect some important spatial correlations among features in practice. In this paper, we introduce star participation instances to measure the prevalence of co-location patterns such that spatially correlated instances which cannot form cliques will also be properly considered. Then we propose a new concept called sub-prevalent co-location patterns (SPCP) based on the star participation instances. Furthermore, two efficient algorithms -- the prefix-tree-based algorithm (PTBA) and the partition-based algorithm (PBA) -- are proposed to mine all the maximal sub-prevalent co-location patterns (MSPCP) in a spatial data set. PTBA uses a typical candidate generate-and-test way starting from candidates with the longest pattern-size, while PBA adopts a step-by-step manner starting from 3-size core patterns. We demonstrate the significance of our proposed new concepts as well as the efficiency of our algorithms through extensive experiments.

Openstack-reporter adopting microservices architecture consists of three constituent components where each component is responsible for a single aspect. The connection among these components is implemented with the help of kubernetes DNS-based service discovery and Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms. The management of these three components is performed by kubernetes which is devoted to automate rollouts, rollbacks. We have released the openstack-reporter, docker images and kubernetes configurations which can be accessed publicly. One can easily build the openstack monitoring system just by deploying the openstack-reporter in our kubernetes cluster. To validate the performance of the proposed monitoring system, an openstack platform and openstack-reporter have been built in our datacenter and the management center respectively, and the results are displayed.

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received wide attention because of its interpretability. However, existing multi-view clustering methods based on NMF are vulnerable to outliers and noise. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel model, named graph regularized multiple nonnegative matrix factorization with L-2,L-1 norm (GRMNMF) method, for exploring multi-view data. GRMNMF utilizes L-2,L-1 norm to calculate the error between the original data and the reconstructed data and simultaneously utilizes the geometrical structure of data space. A series of experiments were conducted in seven real data sets. The experimental results manifest the superiority of GRMNMF.

The distance between instances in space is commonly used to evaluate the proximity of them. If the distance between two instances is smaller than a distance threshold specified by users, they have a neighbor relationship. However, the neighbor relationships of instances determined in this way are ambiguous and it is difficult for users to set a suitable distance threshold. In addition, the neighbor relationships ignore the distribution of instances themselves, it is hard to deal with heterogeneous distribution density datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the constrained Delaunay triangulation to determine neighborhoods of instances without distance thresholds for mining co-location patterns. First, applying the Delaunay triangulation to coarsely materialize the neighbor relationships of instances into an undirected connected graph. Then, we impose two strategies to constrain the Delaunay triangulation to prune undue edges. Finally, we develop a mining algorithm which can avoid the time-consuming generate-test candidate model which is widely used in previous algorithms. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to prove that our proposed method improves the accuracy and efficiency of mining results.

It has gradually become an important problem to mine prevalent co-location patterns from massive spatial data. Spatial co-location pattern mining is a very important research branch in the field of spatial data mining. A spatial co-location pattern is a set of spatial features which instances have frequently neighbor relationships each other in space. The traditional co-location mining method usually gives a single neighbor threshold to measure the neighbor relationship between instances, and the spatial distribution of instances of different spatial feature is not to be consistent. To solve the above problem, as explained by Tobler's first law, with the distance increases, the contribution of instances to the importance of patterns decreases, so the distance weight of instances is proposed. The influential threshold is defined from the distribution of feature instances. A spatial co-location pattern mining algorithm based on kernel density estimation model with influential threshold is proposed. Experiments are carried out in synthetic and real data sets. The results show that the algorithm improves effectiveness and efficiency compared with the traditional methods.

Due to the spatial database is constantly changing as time goes on, the incremental mining of prevalent co-location pattern algorithms have been proposed in the literature. And focusing on the ignorance of the proximity level between instances, the co-location pattern mining based on fuzzy neighborhood relationship (FNR) has also been studied. However, the problem of incremental mining of prevalent co-location patterns based on fuzzy neighborhood relationship on the dynamic databases has not been addressed. In this paper, based on FNR, by capturing the changed (added and decreased) fuzzy neighborhood relationships, we define the incremental fuzzy participation index for measuring the prevalence of the changed co-location in the updated data sets, and design the algorithm of incremental mining of prevalent co-location patterns based on FNR (the IMPCP-FNR algorithm). Extensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate that, by compared to the naive method that re-discovers the prevalent co-locations on the whole updated data sets, our purposed algorithm is more efficient.

The existing colocation pattern mining approaches ignore the proximity level between the instances by a user-specified distance threshold, and return a prevalent colocation pattern set under the single distance threshold. And in many cases, people may want to know the distance range in which a colocation pattern is prevalent instead of a single distance threshold. In this paper, fuzzy neighbor relationship (FNR) is introduced to measure the proximity level between instances by fuzzy set theory. We propose the algorithm for prevalent colocation pattern mining at a single membership threshold (PCP-SMT), and develop the basic algorithm for prevalent colocation pattern mining with the maximum membership threshold (PCP-MMT). Furthermore, an improved strategy is adopted for the PCP-MMT algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the optimization technique are evaluated with an extensive set of experiments.

To date, as the development of wearable sensing technologies, it is possible to utilize wearable devices and machine learning algorithms to efficiently and accurately monitor PA types, intensity and its associated human pattern for many health applications. But there is a trade-off between less-attachment of wearable devices and achievement of high accuracy in existing PA recognition studies. This paper attempts to investigate possible utilisation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) achieving high recognition accuracy of PA using less-attachments of wearable devices. Following a four-steps designed experimental protocol, we collect the real activities dataset with only belt and wristband devices from 10 healthy subjects at home and gym environment. The parameters of typical PA recognition with ANN including time window sizes, features and activation functions are evaluated under 24 different subjects of activities. The experimental results indicate that ANN dealing with belt and wristband data can achieve satisfactory PA recognition results in dynamic and sedentary activities but suffers from transitional activities in both environments.

This new problem has many important applications in our reality life, and it is defined as follows. In the MCEWSC problem Q, the objective is to choose a minimum-cost subset of edges from a graph such that these edges form a required subgraph (e.g., a spanning tree). In the CRS-SPFL problem Q', these edges are further required to be constructed by some stock pieces of fixed length L, the new objective is to minimize the total cost to construct such a required subgraph G', where the total cost is sum of the cost to buy necessary these stock pieces and the cost to construct all edges in such a subgraph G'. We obtain the following three main results. (1) Whenever the MCEWSC problem Q can be approximated by an a-approximation algorithm (for the case alpha = 1, the MCEWSC problem Q is solved optimally by a polynomial-time exact algorithm), we can design a 2 alpha-approximation algorithm to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q'; (2) In addition, when the MCEWSC problem Q is to find a minimum spanning tree, we provide a 3 2 -approximation algorithm and an AFPTAS to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q', respectively; (3) Finally, when the MCEWSC problem Q is to find a single-source shortest paths tree, we present a 3 2-approximation algorithm and an AFPTAS to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q', respectively.

This study aimed to examine the equilibrium GC content of the human genome based on 2,504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project. By recreating the results of some previous research on genome analysis, we revealed the problems in the results of those studies and the causes of the problems. The present results indicate that the GC content of the human genome has not yet reached equilibrium, and it is evolving toward a higher GC content. Furthermore, by analyzing the quantitative changes in CpG dinucleotides before and after mutations, we found that the effect of methylation on the GC content of a genome is very limited, even leading to an increase in the GC content of the genome rather than only a decrease. These findings, therefore, contradict the traditional perception.

It plays a crucial role in image segmentation, pattern classification and other work. A new fractional order edge detection method is proposed in this paper. This operator combines CRONE operator and compound derivative operator, and a one-dimensional fractional-order integral filter in a complex derivative operator is converted into a two-dimensional fractional-order integral filter, and a two-dimensional differential mask is constructed by extending the horizontal and vertical components of the CRONE operator differential template. Then, the integral filter and the differential mask are simultaneously used for edge detection. The experimental results show that this operator can extract a target with clear edges and complete structures for all kinds of noise and non-noise pictures. Compared with CRONE operator and composite derivative operator, detection selectivity and noise immunity are improved, and edge enhancement and structure retention are realized.

The algorithm combines chaos encryption algorithm with wavelet transform. First, the digital image is decomposed by wavelet to generate approximate image, low-frequency horizontal component, low frequency vertical component and high-frequency component. The communication parties can encrypt only approximate graph in the network with poor transmission quality by using the random hybrid chaos time series proposed in this paper. In the good transmission quality network, each component can be encrypted and transmitted at the same time. Finally, the original image can be restored lossless by wavelet reconstruction. The experimental results show that the autocorrelation, cross-correlation, run-length and balance characteristics of the encryption sequences generated by this algorithm are excellent. On the premise of avoiding the complex operation of high-dimensional chaos mapping, the encryption intensity and cracking difficulty of the system are greatly improved, and the problem of image security requirements under different conditions is effectively solved.

The top performers in this field include deep or wide convolutional neural networks, or recurrent neural networks. However, the methods enforce a single model to process all kinds of textures and structures. A typical operation is that a certain layer restores the textures based on the ones recovered by the preceding layers, ignoring the characteristics of image textures. In this paper, we believe that the lower-frequency and higher-frequency information in images have different levels of complexity and should be restored by models of different representational capacity. Inspired by this, we propose a novel embedded block residual network (EBRN) which is an incremental recovering progress for texture super-resolution. Specifically, different modules in the model restores information of different frequencies. For lower-frequency information, we use shallower modules of the network to recover; for higher-frequency information, we use deeper modules to restore. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed EBRN model achieves superior performance and visual improvements against the state-of-the-arts.

Most existing studies of emotion analysis have focused only on image emotion classification, and few studies have paid attention to relevant regions evoking emotions. In this paper, we solve the issues of image emotion classification and emotional region localization based on weakly supervised deep learning in a unified framework. We train a fully convolutional network, followed by our proposed cross-spatial pooling strategy, to generate an emotional activation map (EAM), which represents the relevant region that could evoke emotion in an image and is only labelled with an image-level annotation.

Our goal is to train a lightweight and versatile student model, without human-labelled annotations, that amalgamates the knowledge and masters the expertise of two pre-trained teacher models working on heterogeneous problems, one on scene parsing and the other on depth estimation. To this end, we propose an innovative training strategy that learns the parameters of the student intertwined with the teachers, achieved by "projecting'' its amalgamated features onto each teacher's domain and computing the loss. We also introduce two options to generalize the proposed training strategy to handle three or more tasks simultaneously. The proposed scheme yields very encouraging results. As demonstrated on several benchmarks, the trained student model achieves results even superior to those of the teachers in their own expertise domains and on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised models relying on human-labelled annotations.

Microservices are usually distributed in a loosely coupled manner in the network. In order to coordinate tasks, microservices must coordinate their executions through message interactions with each other. Therefore, modeling and analyzing the interaction between microservices becomes a key issue. The choreography defines the interaction contract between services, and the realizability analysis is the key task to ensure the correct implementation of the microservices interaction contract. The choreography is realizable if interaction contract satisfies choreography specification. This paper use CSP# to analyze the realizability of microservice choreography under synchronous communication and bounded asynchronous communication, and a solution is proposed to repair the unrealizable microservice choreography and made it realizable.

In this paper we proposed a new model that combines the car-hailing service with the auction mechanism to solve above problems. Specifically, we proposed truthful reservation service allocation mechanism (TRSAM) which based on the min-cost path to implement reservation service of car-hailing. We have proved that the TRSAM mechanism are truthful, which protect the interests of vehicle resource provider and user. In the experiment, we compare the TRSAM and with NTR, Greedy-Profit algorithms. Experiment shows that the TRSAM have achieved good results in terms of total revenue, user service rate, vehicle utilization, and user waiting time.

Since this type of measurement mechanism is often associated with advanced laser/optical or photonic techniques, can this type of distribution model be modeled using discrete 0-1 sequences? In this paper, several sets of simulation modes are designed, and FFT transformation is used to extract relevant eigenvalues. Following the processing methods in the variant construction, special filters are constructed using the quantum random sequence provided by ANU (Australian national university), and conditional random sub-sequences are collected as input sequences. Multiple segments are separated from a random sequence, and relevant eigenvalues of FFT are selected to form a special set of eigenvalues. The shift operations are used to transform each sequence, showing obvious non-stationary random effects on various maps.

Quantum interactions are focus among Fock and Poissonian states. Using quantum statistics, model and simulation, this paper proposes two models: matrix and variant transformations: 1. MT Matrix Transformation - eigenvalue states; 2. VT Variant Transformation - invariant states to analyze three random sequences: 1) random; 2) conditional random in a constant; 3) periodic pattern. Four procedures are proposed. Fast Fourier Transformation FFT is applied as one of MT schemes and two invariant scheme of VT schemes are applied, three random sequences are in M segments and each segment has a length m to generate a measuring sequence. Shifting operations are applied on each random sequence to create m+1 spectrum distributions. For FFT, a pair of eigenvalues are selected as the output. Two types of 1D & 2D variant maps are generated to illustrate multiple parameter selections to generate a series of results. Since sequences 1) and 3) are related simple, more cases are focus on sequences 2). Better than FFT, VT distinguishes various Fock, Sub-Poissonian, Poissonian states in random analysis to distinguish three random sequences as three levels of statistical ensembles: Micro-canonical, Canonical, and Grand-Canonical ensembles. Applying two transformations, quantum statistics, model and simulation of modern quantum theory and applications can be explored.

However, a major drawback of the electrically tuning is that the metal electrodes used in this scheme may increase the complexity of device fabrication and decrease the effective area for wave-graphene interaction. Optically tuning is an alternative to resolve this problem. Here we present a theoretical study on the THz responses and plasmonic properties of graphene-based heterostructures (GBHSs) in the presence of visible irradiation. More concretely, by combining classical electromagnetic theory with the dynamic graphene conductivity under optical pumping, we establish analytical models to describe the THz basic/plasmonic responses of GBHSs including graphene/substrate, cavity with graphene, and graphene/dielectric/dimple-array systems. Meanwhile, the effects of the power of the modulation/pumping light on the plasmonic resonances are also illustrated. The results obtained here are expected to help us to explore the potential applications in new type of graphene-based plasmonic devices, such as all-optical modulators, sensors, and filters.

Traditional approaches in this field mostly rely on harnessing statistical methods into processing medical data like genes, MRI images, demographics, etc. Latest advances of machine learning techniques grant another chance of training disease progression models for AD. This trend leads on exploring and designing new machine learning techniques towards multi-modality medical and health dataset for predicting occurrences and modeling progression of AD. This paper aims at giving a systemic survey on summarizing and comparing several mainstream techniques for AD progression modeling, and discuss the potential and limitations of these techniques in practical applications. We summarize three key techniques for modeling AD progression: multi-task model, time series model and deep learning. In particular, we discuss the basic structural elements of most representative multi-task learning algorithms, and analyze a multi-task disease prediction model based on longitudinal time. Lastly, some potential future research direction is given.

We analyze the mechanism of translation and discover that the central area of the images is more likely to be selected as convolutional neural network's input. Inspired by the structure of human retina, we propose the hypothesis that the central area of the image contains more significant information than the marginal one. Comprehensive experiments are presented to prove that hypothesis and reach the conclusion that the receptive field is nonuniform. The central part of the image that is always selected by translation is called the focused area. Motivated by the demand to take use of different focused area and thus take use of different receptive fields, we propose a novel training mechanism that integrate different focused areas in one training process. Our method consists of several stages, each has its own focused area and learning rate, and achieves considerable result in the experiments. We call the integration of focused areas the ensemble of receptive fields.

Because a single distance threshold is chosen in the previous methods when generating the neighbourhood relationships, some interesting spatial co-location patterns can't be extracted. In addition, previous methods don't take the neighborhood degree into consideration and they depend upon the PI (participation index) to measure the prevalence of the co-locations, which these methods are very sensitive to PI and also lead to the absence of co-location patterns. In order to overcome these limitations of traditional co-location pattern mining, considering that the neighbor relationship is a fuzzy concept, this paper introduces the fuzzy theory into co-location pattern mining, a new fuzzy spatial neighborhood relationship measurement between instances and a reasonable feature proximity measurement between spatial features are proposed. Then, a novel algorithm based on fuzzy C-medoids clustering algorithm, FCB, is proposed, extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets prove the practicability and efficiency of the proposed mining algorithm, it also proves that the algorithm has low sensitivity to thresholds and has high robustness.

However, the traditional approaches only focus on the prevalence of patterns, and it cannot reflect the influence of patterns. In this paper, we are committed to address the problem of mining high influence co-location patterns. At first, we define the concepts of influence features and reference features. Based on these concepts, a series of definitions are introduced further to describe the influence co-location pattern. Secondly, a metric is designed to measure the influence degree of the influence co-location pattern, and a basic algorithm for mining high influence co-location patterns is presented. Then, according to the properties of the influence co-location pattern, the corresponding pruning strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets to test our approaches.

The proximity of instances is often defined by the distance between them, if the distance is smaller than a distance threshold specified by users, they have a neighbor relationship. However, in this definition, the proximity of instances deeply depends on the distance threshold, the heterogeneity of the distribution density of spatial datasets is neglected, and it is hard for users to give a suitable threshold value. In this paper, we propose a statistical method that eliminates the distance threshold parameters from users to determine the neighbor relationships of instances in space. First, the proximity of instances is roughly materialized by employing Delaunay triangulation. Then, according to the statistical information of the vertices and edges in the Delaunay triangulation, we design three strategies to constrain the Delaunay triangulation. The neighbor relationships of instances are extracted automatically and accurately from the constrained Delaunay triangulation without requiring users to specify distance thresholds. After that, we propose a k-order neighbor notion to get neighborhoods of instances for mining co-location patterns. Finally, we develop a constrained Delaunay triangulation-based k-order neighborhood co-location pattern mining algorithm called CDT-kN-CP. The results of testing our algorithm on both synthetic datasets and the real point-of-interest datasets of Beijing and Guangzhou, China indicate that our method improves both accuracy and scalability compared with previous methods.

Similarity measures between co-location patterns can be used to solve problems such as pattern compression, pattern summarization, pattern selection and pattern ordering. Although, many researchers have focused on this issue recently and provided a more concise set of co-location patterns based on these measures. Unfortunately, these measures suffer from various weaknesses, e.g., some measures can only calculate the similarity between super-pattern and sub-pattern while some others require additional domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a general similarity measure for any two co-location patterns. Firstly, we study the characteristics of the co-location pattern and present a novel representation model based on maximal cliques. Then, two materialization of the maximal clique and the pattern relationship, 0-1 vector and key-value vector, are proposed and discussed in the paper. Moreover, based on the materialization methods, the similarity measure, Vector-Degree, is clamed by applying the cosine similarity. Finally, similarity is used to group the patterns by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The experimental results on both synthetic and real world data sets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method.

This fosters the development of Wi-Fi signal-based services and applications, e.g., indoor intrusion detection, human gesture recognition, indoor localization. However, the indoor environments are often complex and variable, Wi-Fi signals from transmitters through multiple paths to reach receivers. There is a large number of Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) paths between the transmitter and the receiver, which causes seriously signal fading, deteriorating the quality of communication links, decreasing the accuracy of recognition application, and increasing the complexity of systems. In this study, an NLOS identification based on the wavelet packet transform (NIWPT) method is proposed. First, NIWPT collects raw channel state information (CSI) signals on the physical layer in current links. Then, NIWPT applies threelayer wavelet packet decomposition on the amplitude of CSI. A set of the wavelet packet coefficient, wavelet packet energy spectrum, information entropy, and logarithmic energy entropy as a feature vector is acquired. After that, the support vector machine is utilized to identify NLOS paths in the current links. Compared with other methods, NIWPT does not need to pre-process the raw CSI signals, it not only maximally reserves influence of the environment on the propagation signal, but also reflects the indoor environment more truly. The experimental results indicate that the recognition accuracy rate of the NIWPT method is 96.23% and 94.75% in the dynamic and static environments, respectively. It proves that the proposed method can effectively identify NLOS paths and has high identification accuracy and universality.

In recent years, the performances of the type ii superlattice infrared focal plane have been improved dramatically. High operating temperature can be achieved by using the monopolar barrier structure of InAs/GaSb type ii superlattice material system. In this paper, the nBn type (also known as Bariodes) mid-wavelength infrared detector based on InAs/GaSb type ii superlattice is studied. As the device has no depletion layer, the recombination and trap assisted tunneling effects are inhibited, and the dark currents are effectively reduced. Based on the equivalent material method, the relationship between the dark current and the doping concentration, thickness and composition of the barrier layer and absorption layer was analyzed in detail, and the optimal working condition was pointed out.

It has the advantages of low dark current and high sensitivity. As the existence of its barrier layer suppresses the majority carrier current with a low electric field, the electric field distribution inside the device is one of the important factors affecting its performance. In particular, the electric field distributions of the barrier layer show directly effects on the overall performance of the detector.

In order to solve those shortcomings, this paper introduces an homogenized homogenized Logistic chaos mapping into the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The modified time series has the characteristics of rapid divergence, strong ergodic, and high randomness. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization is optimized by the above modified sequence, and a homogeneous chaos Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is obtained. The particle position information and the initial velocity information are initialized by the linear transformation of the homogenized logistic sequence, so that the distribution of the particles is random and can traverse the value space of variables. At the same time, the chaos transformation of the optimal value in the particle population of each iteration makes the particle "mutate", thus ensuring the diversity of the particles in the iterative process.The experimental results show that the algorithm does not fall into the local extremum and has faster convergence.

On the whole, Tongji University's subject structure is dominated by engineering. The four clusters, Environmental Engineering, Materials, Biomedicine, Engineering Management, forms the backbone of the structure. After slicing the 18 years of data into 3 six-year stages, subject structures were constructed for each stage. From the evolution of the structure, we can see that the biomedicine is developed rapidly; inducing management and other social sciences and fundamental sciences are clustered differentially as well as integratedly into these four clusters. Environmental Engineering is relatively stable in three stages. Engineering Management is more inclined to combine with science and engineering after three stages of development. Materials presents a complex and unstable situation because the diversity that materials are drawn from and its relationships with the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry are different. The characteristics consist with the actual development of the university. The construction and analysis of subject structure can provide a powerful reference for discipline-related planning of universities.

The UWB ISGW bandpass filter structure consists of three layer dielectric substrates, the top substrate uses metallic via-holes and metallic patches to implement perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) structure, which is suitable for packaging substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filters to avoid external interference and loss caused by radiation and internal radiation leakage, the middle layer substrate provides a stable gap layer, and the base substrate is used to obtain a SIW filter by etching the slots in the metal plane and placing metallic via-holes in the middle of the layer, i.e. a self-packaged UWB ISGW filter. The proposed filter was fabricated and tested at a center frequency of 17.5 GHz as an example. The measurements show that the filter has a passband from 14.4 to 20.7 GHz, i.e. This filter has a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 36%, and an insertion loss of 0.91 dB. More importantly, thanks to ISGW, two transmission zeros are obtained at 12.9 and 22.1 GHz to improve high selectivity.

In object classification task, there are still some problems. For example, similar categories are difficult to be distinguished in images. In addition, with the increasing number of object categories, the background of scene has become another crucial issue in object classification. This paper focuses on image object recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues. Firstly, we propose a semantic refinement method that analyzes the relationship among similar categories in images from the perspective of semantic knowledge. The knowledge of the relationship between semantics comes from a wide range of open knowledge. Secondly, we utilize the knowledge graph method to create the image knowledge graph with multiple categories in images. Our method exploits the knowledge from the adjacency matrix computed on train data to merge relevant classes into graph. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale image datasets (ImageNet), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Further, our method participates in ILSVRC 2012 challenges, and obtain the new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet (82.43%).

This paper proposes a pedestrian tracking algorithm based on improved incremental learning. According to the difference between the central position of the current observation model and that of the previous one, the reliability of the observation model can be judged, and then the forgetting factor can be adjusted, so that the observation model can adapt to the changes of pedestrian targets. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm can track the pedestrian target accurately and effectively in the occlusion scene.

The network uses an autoencoder which is pre-trained on the original images to reconstruct the input images. The reconstructed one and the input image are then processed by the SRM filter which can extract the noise distribution of images. We then feed the minus result of two processed results into a CNN architecture to predict whether the input image is original or tampered. The model was trained and evaluated in FaceForensics dataset and state-of-art face swap method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our network.

However, in the current wireless communication, the signal is subjected to various interferences in the process of propagation due to the openness of the channel. In the conventional communication system, the bandwidth of the transmission signal is designed as a narrow band to achieve the purpose of suppressing interference, and the spread spectrum technology will spread the spectrum of the baseband signal to a wide frequency band for transmission to solve the problem in the wireless communication system. It is one of the best ways to solve multiple access, anti-interference and confidentiality in wireless communication systems.

Co-location pattern mining is particularly valuable for discovering spatial dependencies. Lots of co-location pattern mining approaches have been proposed, but they often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result, the interesting pattern which involves spatial features with significantly different for the number of instances cannot be captured. In this paper, we are committed to address the problem of mining co-location patterns from the spatial database with rare features. Specifically, we first propose a new interest measure, namely the weighted participation index. This interest measure is related to the distribution of the number of instances for spatial features, and it has ability to capture the prevalent co-location patterns with or without rare features. Furthermore, we prove that the weighted participation index possesses the approximate monotonicity property, which can be utilized to improve the computational efficiency, and thereby an efficient algorithm is developed. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our approach is effective, efficient and scalable for mining co-location patterns embedded in the spatial database with rare features.

The proximity between instances is defined by a distance threshold given by the user in traditional spatial co-location pattern mining. However, the user doesn't know which distance threshold is appropriate in most cases, even for experts. Besides, different densities of instance distribution are not considered in a dataset when using a unified distance threshold to measure the proximity. Also, global topological relations of instances are ignored in mining. In this paper, we consider the global topological relations by constructing Delaunay triangulation of spatial instances and calculate a distance constraint for each instance based on the constructed Delaunay triangulation. We redefine the proximity of instances according to the distance constraint so that users don't have to worry about giving an appropriate distance threshold when mining prevalent co-location patterns. We propose a new algorithm PTB based on a proximity relationship tree P-tree which stores the proximity relationships between instances. The experimental evaluation of several real-world datasets shows that our algorithm can get better results. We also evaluate each parameter and the number of features and instances affecting the efficiency of the algorithm by using synthetic datasets.

Most existing algorithms of discovering spatial co-location patterns are based on the candidate-test model, which is computationally expensive. When the user adjusts the participation index (PI) threshold, these algorithms have to be re-executed from the size 2 co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial instance partition method for mining co-location patterns which called overlap maximal clique partitioning algorithm (OMCP). The OMCP co-location mining algorithm divides instances of an input spatial dataset into a set of overlap maximal cliques. Table instances of all colocation patterns are collected by the overlap maximal cliques. Prevalent co-location patterns are directly calculated without generating the candidate patterns. The OMCP algorithm only needs to execute once to get the PI of all patterns, without re-executing when the PI threshold is adjusted. Our algorithm is performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the OMCP algorithm improvements in efficiency of co-location pattern mining.

There are many literatures studied the approach of discovering co-location patterns. However, a lot of proposed approaches need some thresholds given by the user, and it is difficult to give the proper thresholds. Moreover, most proposed approaches treat the spatial object as a point during the mining process, but spatial objects are dynamic or appear in the form of a cluster normally, which means that their locations are polygons rather than points. This paper provides a novel framework to mine co-location patterns from spatial regional objects. At first, we redefine the interest measure of significant co-locations. In our framework, the user does not need to specify any threshold, and the redefined interest measure is monotonically non-increasing which can be used for improving the mining efficiency. Then, an algorithm based on the grid partition is proposed to reduce time complexity further. Finally, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach by extensive experiments.

The results, which are in vector form, can be widely applied to various location based services (LBS) without complicated artificial feature extraction. Further, it can also improve the performance of LBS. By a range of experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate our model's capability at characterizing POI.

However, most existing work on social influence analysis has focused on homogeneous information networks. Fewstudies systematically investigate how to mine the strength of influence between nodes in heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we present a meta path-based information entropy for modeling social influence in heterogeneous information networks (MPIE). Through setting meta paths, MPIE not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information, but also obtains potential link information to measure the influence of nodes.

Current spatial co-location mining methods ignore the people who are related to the co-location patterns' instances, which results that the mining results are hard to explain and understand by the users. In this paper, we combine the theories of co-location mining and social networks analysis to mine a kind of special co-location patterns: Co-visiting patterns, which consider spatial information and social information at the same time. A co-visiting pattern is also a spatial feature set, whose instances are always visited by the similar users and located in a nearby region. We propose some new measures, including the user similarity, the weight of neighborhood relationship of two visited spatial instances, and the prevalent degree of a co-visiting pattern. In addition, we also explore the properties of the co-visiting patterns in this paper, and present an efficient algorithm. Finally, experiments and a detailed analysis are given at the end of this paper.

The key idea is to learn spatio-temporal features by fusing convolutional networks spatially and temporally. However, there are some problems within such architecture. First, it relies on optical flow to model temporal information, which are often expensive to compute and store. Second, it has limited ability to capture details and local context information for video data. Third, it lacks explicit semantic guidance that greatly decrease the classification performance. In this paper, we proposed a new two-stream based deep framework for video classification to discover spatial and temporal information only from RGB frames, moreover, the multi-scale pyramid attention (MPA) layer and the semantic adversarial learning (SAL) module is introduced and integrated in our framework.

To construct EABN efficiently, we employ self-organizing map for TWC dataset division to make the co-occurrence-based dependence of each pair of entities concern just a small set of documents. Using probabilistic inferences of EABN, we evaluate and rank EAs in all possible entity pairs, by which novel latent EAs could be found. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

In this paper, a novel meta-path based approach MPSMDA is proposed to predict the association of miRNA-disease. MPSMDA uses experimentally validated data to build a miRNA-disease heterogeneous information network (MDHIN). Thus, miRNA-disease association prediction is transformed into a link prediction problem on a MDHIN. Meta-path based similarity is used to measure the miRNA-disease associations. Since different meta-paths between a miRNA and a disease express different latent semantic association, MPSMDA make full use of all possible meta-paths to predict the associations of miRNAs with diseases. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets for performance comparison with existing approaches. Two case studies on lung neoplasms and breast neoplasms are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of MPSMDA.

Multi-core processors enable intra-task parallelism, and there has been much progress on exploiting that, while there has been only a little progress on energy-efficient multi-core real-time scheduling as yet. In this work, we study energy-efficient real-time scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider a clustered multi-core platform where processors within the same cluster run at the same speed at any given time. A new concept named speed-profile is proposed to model per-task and per-cluster energy-consumption variations during run-time to minimize the expected long-term energy consumption. To our knowledge, no existing work considers energy-aware real-time scheduling of DAG tasks with constrained deadlines, nor on a clustered multi-core platform. The proposed energy-aware real-time scheduler is implemented upon an ODROID XU-3 board to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. To complement our system experiments in large-scale, we have also conducted simulations that demonstrate a CPU energy saving of up to 57% through our proposed approach compared to existing methods.

The study found that existing methods can be divided into exponential changes, land use changes and monitoring simulations. However, the research results of existing methods are homogenized. In this study, the gap index model was established and Kunming and Yuxi were taken as examples to systematically introduce the gap index to calculate urban expansion. The study found that the global gap index can better describe the urban expansion characteristics and can explain the heterogeneity between urban land use by scale shifting; The local clearance index can not only describe the urban expansion characteristics, but also analyze the urban expansion direction and expansion trend in detail to describe the spatial pattern change of urban expansion. The application of the gap index in urban expansion has a very good reference for future urban expansion research.

It is even hard for experts, let alone computer-aided diagnosis systems. Recently, some deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based methods have been introduced to tackle this problem, achieving much impressive performance. However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision. In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task. We implement extensive experiments on the public benchmark MICCAI gland 2015 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our method achieve a better segmentation result in terms of visual perception and two quantitative metrics, compared with other methods.

The traditional manual document classification method is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and the classification effect cannot be fully guaranteed. With the popularity of computers and the development of machine learning, the convolutional neural network model is becoming more and more mature, and the CNN model is suitable for the problems encountered in the current official document classification. This paper proposed a model based on convolutional neural network to solve the problem of official document classification. To train and test the model, we manually classify the dataset into ten categories according to the classification of college archives entities. And it was trained on a dataset with size of 6765. And on the testing dataset with size of 676, it reached an accuracy of 90%. And for comparison, we also trained a LSTM model and a GRU model (they are both popular in the natural language processing field), and results showed that the automatic official document classification method based on convolutional neural network can improve the efficiency of traditional official document classification. Also, it provides a new way of thinking for the solution of the official document classification problem.

However, improper values of regularization parameter and blur kernel size can easily lead to poor inverse results. In this paper, by calculating differential autocorrelation of the image to obtain the blur scale as the blur kernel size. Then, we proposed a L-like curve method to calculate the regularization parameter. Finally, these calculation results were used to deblur the image with the regularization model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve blind deblurring of images, and the inverse effect of a single blurred car image is obvious. It can meet the requirements of accurately identifying the license plate information of blurred car image.

Recently much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this paper, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task, which not only outperform the state-of-the-art in general evidenced by empirical evaluation, but also guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5). The proposed analysis techniques are also extended to and evaluated with the case of multiple DAG tasks using the federated scheduling approach.

The generalized probability density evolution equation for compound stochastic process is solved by the finite difference method. Then, for the first passage criterion, the dynamic reliability is analysed by establishing the one-dimensional integral in safe domain and the absorbing boundary condition. A new optimization method is coming up combining improved genetic algorithm and PDEM. Taking the parameters optimization of a three-story floor-shear frame structure with TMD under random seismic loads as an example, the correctness of the proposed method is verified by comparing interlayer displacement response and dynamic reliability.

Recently, many researchers focused on mining disease diagnosis to innovate the hidden patterns and their relevant features. Mining bio-medical data is one of the predominant research areas where clustering techniques are emphasized in heart disease diagnosis. But few people deal with large heart disease datasets and then classify disease data sets according to heart disease feature. We propose a method of anomaly threshold based on multiple classifiers can be well suited to datasets containing abnormal data, and use XGBoost algorithm as a sub-classifier to process massive ECG data. This research focuses on the heart disease classification problem. The data set is divided into two categories, and then it was classified into more specific categories, experimental results show that this method can improve classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on massive instances of different heart disease obtained from the hospital actual cases and two data sets of UCI. In fact, we compared SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, Logistic, RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, and found that tree-based model classifier is the best fit to predict arrhythmia. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance to the processing and forecasting system of large medical data sets, and promote the development of wisdom medical care.

Our algorithm hybridizes deep-learning algorithms such as word2vec and recurrent neural network (RNN) with classical techniques to improve the performance of text analysis. Given the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the software requirement descriptions on websites, the instance-transfer learning method is utilized to construct a robust classifier and predict domain feature knowledge based on domain knowledge similar to the target domain. The bagging clustering algorithm is utilized with multiple clustering algorithms to help select transfer instances. [Author to confirm changes.] The RNN-based algorithm is utilized as a useful alternative to predict missing features by studying the requirement descriptions of a related software system, while word2vec is utilized to extract sensible feature keywords for the specific software domain. [Author to confirm changes.] Our RNN model for every subclass is based on the clustering result, and we construct subclass classifiers to recommend requirement keywords. Requirement features recommended by our algorithm potentially increase opportunities for requirement classification, promote software requirement quality, and deliver more reliable software products. We explain the details of implementation and perform experimental work on real requirement descriptions to establish its worth.

However, a large number of small fragments are formed on tips of graphite fibers after a discharge treatment with 10 kV DC high voltage on graphite fibers. These fragments observed by SEM and HRFEM are spheres, flakes and needle-like nanostructures with the size around 50 nm. In this case, each of these spheres and flakes can be an emission center in field emissions and some detectable emission currents can be obtained with a low applied voltage. Experimental results show that a single graphite fiber of 20 mu m diameter can generate near 0.2 mA emission current with 4 kV applied voltage and the stability have been measured to be less than 10 %. It is expected that graphite fibers as a novel cold cathode material will provide a wide range of applications such as in flat panel displays, high-power and high-brightness vacuum electronic devices, and vacuum microelectronic devices.
