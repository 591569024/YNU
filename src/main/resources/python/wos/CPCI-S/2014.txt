It has been widely applied in various fields, including High Performance Computing (HPC). However, virtualization brings some performance overhead. Meanwhile, there are some differences in virtualization technology of different Open Source Cloud platforms. In order to find out the most suitable Open Source Cloud for HPC, this paper compares and analyses the performance of Open Source Clouds platforms such as Nimbus, OpenNebula and OpenStack for HPC according to HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark suite. From our experiment, OpenStack shows the better performance for HPC. So, it is proposed for implementing HPC applications in Open Source Cloud platform.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Group recommendation is essentially useful for websites, especially for social tagging systems. In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN. Simulations and experiments in Qiandao Lake show UW-CSMA/CA and UW-AODV are great and efficient solutions to the MAC and Routing protocol problems in UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

The precondition of carrying on self-management scientifically and effectively is to know the theory of self-management well and precisely. Many scholars are paying attention to the study of self-management. However, the research on dimensional structure of employee's self-management is limited. And the definition of self-management is vague. Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis. It proves that employee's self-management consists of five dimensions, including self-knowledge, self-planning, self-control, self-learning and self-interpersonal management.

But it is extremely difficult to implement the high-dimensional matrix multiplication on hardware. This paper presented a novel hardware architecture for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. OMP algorithm was improved to reduce the number of multiplications. Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

Still none of them could keep the history information of optimization. Here, a classification algorithm based on the novel multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) is proposed. Leukemia gene expression profiles with different dimensionalities are used for validation. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm are used for comparison. The MOA shows stable and relatively accurate classification performance and could be used as an effective classification algorithm for gene expression profiles.

In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation. Compare the results of traditional M/M/1 model and Monte Carlo simulation; it was found that it was necessary to treat this kind of problem as an uncertain problem in order to improve the accuracy of decision making.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity. The study results have positive effect in promoting scientific planning and construction of urban drain pipelines.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

Integrating remote sensing with GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation approach for Karst rocky desertification assessment in Southwest of China	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol		PROVINCE; AREAS	The increasing exploitation of Karst resources is leading to severe environmental impacts, as Karst frequently occurs in the most fragile and vulnerable environments. This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model. Experimental results on large scale networks demonstrate that the time consuming is much less and the influence spread effect is better than the classical greedy algorithm.

Based on the CPFR model which is defined by VICS organization, this paper makes a specific classification for CPFR model through cooperation depth and the number of partners and supplies a broader CPFR model choice space for companies. However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model. Based on these, we supply basis for the companies' selection of different CPFR model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

To effectively defend against them, this paper proposed an epidemic SEIQV model with quarantine and vaccination strategies. Through analysis of this model, its stability condition is obtained: When the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, our model is stable at its worm-free equilibrium where worms finally get eliminated. Simulation results show that quarantine strategy is efficient, in terms of the number of infected hosts and reducing worm propagation speed.

We reinvestigate these issues and propose a modification strategy called Dynamic Vegas, which changes initial TCP Vegas' in slow start and congestion avoidance phase. It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas. Additionally, in Multi-link environment, it achieves strong competitiveness against TCP Reno and gains fairness in throughput of all senders in the end of transmission.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

The Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS nanocomposites offer an excellent electron conductivity, catalysis and hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. CS is used as a cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on the surface of Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS and as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The biosensor shows favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride. It exhibits good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. More importantly, this study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface.

Then the characteristics of main bridge structure were studied using Lanzcos modal analysis method, and the seismic responses of main bridge are studied by earthquake response spectrum analysis and time history analysis respectively. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the main bridge is 0.1943Hz, and the transverse vibration mode shapes are most remarkable in the former 10 ordered types of vibration of main bridge. The main bridge is in the conditions of elastic range and does not failure under El earthquake. Both response spectrum analysis and time history analysis show that the largest displacement along the main bridge appears at the top of pier and the largest transverse displacement appears in the central position of main span.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

As a result, the security issue of biometric system extremely critical to be solved. In this paper, we introduce a public watermarking algorithm which is based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). By using the proposed algorithm, the finger geometry is embedded into the region of interest (ROT) of palmprint image. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the palmprint image and the finger geometry. Experimental results performed on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the watermarking operation has little impact on the recognition performance.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image. In the match stage, histogram intersection distance is applied as the similarity measurement between sample and template. Experimental results conducted on a database of 165 persons (4 fingers per person) show that the proposed method is effective.

The sending and receiving mutual interference collision is eliminated by slot allocation with collision avoid method. Moreover, path wake up strategy in terms of the node's hop are introduced which can assign listen frame and wake up slot better. As a result, a TDMA-based energy efficient cross-layer MAC protocol for wireless mesh sensor networks are proposed, and then the performance of the protocol are analysis by simulation. The study results show that based on WMN and WSN, WSN and 'WMN can be constructed to achieve a full interconnection network named WMSN.TCP-MCA protocol can effectively reduce idle listen time of node which reduce overall energy consumption of the network.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer. Finally, the light absorption and reflection properties were also investigated. All results were conducive to the development of silicon-based optoelectronic devices.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

It can reduce the computational complexity. This paper adjusts the initial community partition based on the difference between indegree and outdegree of communities in order to facilitate the global optimization. So that the final result is closer to actual community structure and this algorithm improves the accuracy of community detection.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

In the past, we had to give up some badly influence bands. Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past. This new solar radio observation system can adjust the gain from -25dB to +35dB by remote software through RF(Radio Frequency) and MF (Medium frequency) attenuators. Based on advanced FPGA processor we can achieve high spectral resolution of about 30 KHz/channel and high time resolution of about 34ms.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model. Simulation results show that cooperative compressed sensing provides an efficient way to sense radio signal which is sparse at frequency domain.

However, current MapReduce model do not cope well with its scalability, which means that under certain hardware configuration, it can only support limited scale of cluster due to the overloading of center node. In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism. In this way, the system can theoretically achieve the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system. The scalability evaluation of the system has been experimented in the network scenarios using the prevailing word count problem.

The more uniform requirement impact on software project, the smaller the risk, otherwise the key requirement changes will have a significant impact on the project.

However, it is unclear whether phytoextraction is equally efficient in mountainous regions. We investigated the potential of P accumulation of major plant species in the Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China. Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis. It proves that employee's self-management consists of five dimensions, including self-knowledge, self-planning, self-control, self-learning and self-interpersonal management. It also verifies the practicability of the proposed framework.

But it is extremely difficult to implement the high-dimensional matrix multiplication on hardware. This paper presented a novel hardware architecture for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. OMP algorithm was improved to reduce the number of multiplications. Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II. Simulation results verify the correctness of the design.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

However, reserved jobs will make resource into fragments and decrease utilization. In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

With the deepening research, we find that portal can do more works than we thought, including simulating mirror, connecting cells and dividing cells more simply. In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The internal butterfly unit of the processor based on CORDIC algorithm, and uses an iterative computation process instead of two computation process which is the complex multiplication and the evaluation of trigonometric function. The butterfly unit has nothing to do with the external memory size, so it can handle large quantities of data. Based on this unit, the processor uses two logical processing core and pipeline system to improve the throughput and instantaneity. So the design has large scope of input and high-precision operation features.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation. Compare the results of traditional M/M/1 model and Monte Carlo simulation; it was found that it was necessary to treat this kind of problem as an uncertain problem in order to improve the accuracy of decision making.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy. Experiment result shows the pricing strategy could adjust computing resource prices automatically under the general market price rule conditions and maximize utility resource selection strategy could get the max utility for resource consumers.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity. The study results have positive effect in promoting scientific planning and construction of urban drain pipelines.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model.

Therefore, it is lack of universality and flexibility in choices. Based on the CPFR model which is defined by VICS organization, this paper makes a specific classification for CPFR model through cooperation depth and the number of partners and supplies a broader CPFR model choice space for companies. However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model. Based on these, we supply basis for the companies' selection of different CPFR model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

Model is expected to bring an essential leap of software development and drive the whole software development process. It means that model is not only an analysis and design specification, but also a software product which can be automatically transformed into the executable system. That requires the executability of model. This paper presents an executable domain-specific model named xDSM and discusses the keys to making xDSM executable. The keys are accuracy and integrality of the model and its behavior modeling. They all are built based on domain-specific meta-modeling.

To effectively defend against them, this paper proposed an epidemic SEIQV model with quarantine and vaccination strategies. Through analysis of this model, its stability condition is obtained: When the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, our model is stable at its worm-free equilibrium where worms finally get eliminated. Simulation results show that quarantine strategy is efficient, in terms of the number of infected hosts and reducing worm propagation speed.

We reinvestigate these issues and propose a modification strategy called Dynamic Vegas, which changes initial TCP Vegas' in slow start and congestion avoidance phase. It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas. Additionally, in Multi-link environment, it achieves strong competitiveness against TCP Reno and gains fairness in throughput of all senders in the end of transmission.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

The Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS nanocomposites offer an excellent electron conductivity, catalysis and hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. CS is used as a cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on the surface of Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS and as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The biosensor shows favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride. It exhibits good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. More importantly, this study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface.

Then the characteristics of main bridge structure were studied using Lanzcos modal analysis method, and the seismic responses of main bridge are studied by earthquake response spectrum analysis and time history analysis respectively. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the main bridge is 0.1943Hz, and the transverse vibration mode shapes are most remarkable in the former 10 ordered types of vibration of main bridge. The main bridge is in the conditions of elastic range and does not failure under El earthquake.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

As a result, the security issue of biometric system extremely critical to be solved. In this paper, we introduce a public watermarking algorithm which is based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). By using the proposed algorithm, the finger geometry is embedded into the region of interest (ROT) of palmprint image. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the palmprint image and the finger geometry. Experimental results performed on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the watermarking operation has little impact on the recognition performance.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image. In the match stage, histogram intersection distance is applied as the similarity measurement between sample and template. Experimental results conducted on a database of 165 persons (4 fingers per person) show that the proposed method is effective.

The sending and receiving mutual interference collision is eliminated by slot allocation with collision avoid method. Moreover, path wake up strategy in terms of the node's hop are introduced which can assign listen frame and wake up slot better. As a result, a TDMA-based energy efficient cross-layer MAC protocol for wireless mesh sensor networks are proposed, and then the performance of the protocol are analysis by simulation. The study results show that based on WMN and WSN, WSN and 'WMN can be constructed to achieve a full interconnection network named WMSN.TCP-MCA protocol can effectively reduce idle listen time of node which reduce overall energy consumption of the network.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer. Finally, the light absorption and reflection properties were also investigated. All results were conducive to the development of silicon-based optoelectronic devices.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold. On one hand, the weights are assigned to the edges of folksonomy graph to indicate their importance. On the other hand, resource clustering is applied to solve the awareness differences of users. Experimental results on a Lastfm dataset show that the new model can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with original RWR-based recommending model.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has been applied and the enhanced similarity of communities will be recalculated because of change of communities along with the agglomerative process.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

In the past, we had to give up some badly influence bands. Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past.

Solar radio bursts frequently occurred also with strong emission in L band, which are potential interferences for the navigation service. During the most intense solar radio bursts, the obviously decreasing performances of navigation systems were found. In this work, we get the threshold values for the three communication frequency points by theoretical arithmetic. At the same time, we will set up the real-time solar radio flux monitor system for test and verify the real threshold value in natural space based on 10m solar radio telescope.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model. Simulation results show that cooperative compressed sensing provides an efficient way to sense radio signal which is sparse at frequency domain.

However, current MapReduce model do not cope well with its scalability, which means that under certain hardware configuration, it can only support limited scale of cluster due to the overloading of center node. In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism. In this way, the system can theoretically achieve the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system. The scalability evaluation of the system has been experimented in the network scenarios using the prevailing word count problem.

This paper proposes a quantitative risk measurement model that could be used to measure risk posed by requirement changes. The more uniform requirement impact on software project, the smaller the risk, otherwise the key requirement changes will have a significant impact on the project. This paper discusses the rationality of the model and gives an instance of this model. The model requires data can be obtained from enterprise.

However, it is unclear whether phytoextraction is equally efficient in mountainous regions. We investigated the potential of P accumulation of major plant species in the Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China. Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

And the definition of self-management is vague. Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis.

Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II. Simulation results verify the correctness of the design.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

However, reserved jobs will make resource into fragments and decrease utilization. In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

Still none of them could keep the history information of optimization. Here, a classification algorithm based on the novel multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) is proposed. Leukemia gene expression profiles with different dimensionalities are used for validation. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm are used for comparison. The MOA shows stable and relatively accurate classification performance and could be used as an effective classification algorithm for gene expression profiles.

With the deepening research, we find that portal can do more works than we thought, including simulating mirror, connecting cells and dividing cells more simply. In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The internal butterfly unit of the processor based on CORDIC algorithm, and uses an iterative computation process instead of two computation process which is the complex multiplication and the evaluation of trigonometric function. The butterfly unit has nothing to do with the external memory size, so it can handle large quantities of data. Based on this unit, the processor uses two logical processing core and pipeline system to improve the throughput and instantaneity. So the design has large scope of input and high-precision operation features.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy. Experiment result shows the pricing strategy could adjust computing resource prices automatically under the general market price rule conditions and maximize utility resource selection strategy could get the max utility for resource consumers.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

Integrating remote sensing with GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation approach for Karst rocky desertification assessment in Southwest of China	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol		PROVINCE; AREAS	The increasing exploitation of Karst resources is leading to severe environmental impacts, as Karst frequently occurs in the most fragile and vulnerable environments. This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model. Experimental results on large scale networks demonstrate that the time consuming is much less and the influence spread effect is better than the classical greedy algorithm.

Therefore, it is lack of universality and flexibility in choices. Based on the CPFR model which is defined by VICS organization, this paper makes a specific classification for CPFR model through cooperation depth and the number of partners and supplies a broader CPFR model choice space for companies. However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model. Based on these, we supply basis for the companies' selection of different CPFR model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

Model is expected to bring an essential leap of software development and drive the whole software development process. It means that model is not only an analysis and design specification, but also a software product which can be automatically transformed into the executable system. That requires the executability of model. This paper presents an executable domain-specific model named xDSM and discusses the keys to making xDSM executable. The keys are accuracy and integrality of the model and its behavior modeling. They all are built based on domain-specific meta-modeling.

We reinvestigate these issues and propose a modification strategy called Dynamic Vegas, which changes initial TCP Vegas' in slow start and congestion avoidance phase. It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

The Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS nanocomposites offer an excellent electron conductivity, catalysis and hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. CS is used as a cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on the surface of Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS and as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The biosensor shows favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride. It exhibits good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. More importantly, this study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image. In the match stage, histogram intersection distance is applied as the similarity measurement between sample and template. Experimental results conducted on a database of 165 persons (4 fingers per person) show that the proposed method is effective.

The sending and receiving mutual interference collision is eliminated by slot allocation with collision avoid method. Moreover, path wake up strategy in terms of the node's hop are introduced which can assign listen frame and wake up slot better. As a result, a TDMA-based energy efficient cross-layer MAC protocol for wireless mesh sensor networks are proposed, and then the performance of the protocol are analysis by simulation. The study results show that based on WMN and WSN, WSN and 'WMN can be constructed to achieve a full interconnection network named WMSN.TCP-MCA protocol can effectively reduce idle listen time of node which reduce overall energy consumption of the network.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer. Finally, the light absorption and reflection properties were also investigated. All results were conducive to the development of silicon-based optoelectronic devices.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold. On one hand, the weights are assigned to the edges of folksonomy graph to indicate their importance. On the other hand, resource clustering is applied to solve the awareness differences of users. Experimental results on a Lastfm dataset show that the new model can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with original RWR-based recommending model.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

More and more museums and libraries have their collections to be digitalized, which makes the study of problems haunted the art historians based on these digital images available. In this paper, the research of visual arts based on the computer and information of paintings, which can be called scientific understanding of visual arts, has been brought out. Some features, including multi-scale amplitude, non-stationarity of artworks, anisotropy of artworks and correlation of coefficients of the Curvelet transform among scales are extracted based on the Curvelet transform to evaluate the styles of different artists and some other respects of artworks. The relations between the styles of visual arts and these features are also stated, and the similarities of these styles are also qualified by comparing these features. It is apparent that each feature reflects different characteristics of the painting technique.

Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has been applied and the enhanced similarity of communities will be recalculated because of change of communities along with the agglomerative process.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past. This new solar radio observation system can adjust the gain from -25dB to +35dB by remote software through RF(Radio Frequency) and MF (Medium frequency) attenuators. Based on advanced FPGA processor we can achieve high spectral resolution of about 30 KHz/channel and high time resolution of about 34ms.

Solar radio bursts frequently occurred also with strong emission in L band, which are potential interferences for the navigation service. During the most intense solar radio bursts, the obviously decreasing performances of navigation systems were found. In this work, we get the threshold values for the three communication frequency points by theoretical arithmetic.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model. Simulation results show that cooperative compressed sensing provides an efficient way to sense radio signal which is sparse at frequency domain.

However, current MapReduce model do not cope well with its scalability, which means that under certain hardware configuration, it can only support limited scale of cluster due to the overloading of center node. In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism. In this way, the system can theoretically achieve the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system. The scalability evaluation of the system has been experimented in the network scenarios using the prevailing word count problem.

The risk of requirement changes is considerable risk in software project management. Information entropy can effectively measure subsystem's degree of uniformity. This paper proposes a quantitative risk measurement model that could be used to measure risk posed by requirement changes. The more uniform requirement impact on software project, the smaller the risk, otherwise the key requirement changes will have a significant impact on the project. This paper discusses the rationality of the model and gives an instance of this model. The model requires data can be obtained from enterprise. Experiments show that the model is scientific and rational. It can serve as a reference for requirement management.

A Case Study of Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, PTS 1-6	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environmental Technology (REET 2013)	SEP 21-22, 2013	Jilin, PEOPLES R CHINA			Phytoremediation; P uptake potential; P-hyperaccumulators; Dominate species		Phosphorus leakage from phosphorus-enriched soils (PES) is a major cause of water degradation worldwide, and phytoextraction is known to be an effective method of remediation. However, it is unclear whether phytoextraction is equally efficient in mountainous regions. We investigated the potential of P accumulation of major plant species in the Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China. Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.
