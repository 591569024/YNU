However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

The precondition of carrying on self-management scientifically and effectively is to know the theory of self-management well and precisely. Many scholars are paying attention to the study of self-management. However, the research on dimensional structure of employee's self-management is limited. And the definition of self-management is vague. Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis. It proves that employee's self-management consists of five dimensions, including self-knowledge, self-planning, self-control, self-learning and self-interpersonal management. It also verifies the practicability of the proposed framework.

But it is extremely difficult to implement the high-dimensional matrix multiplication on hardware. This paper presented a novel hardware architecture for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. OMP algorithm was improved to reduce the number of multiplications. Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II. Simulation results verify the correctness of the design.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

However, reserved jobs will make resource into fragments and decrease utilization. In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

Large numbers of intelligence algorithms have been exploited based on this purpose. However, few of them display stable and accurate performance for both low and high gene dimensionalities. Still none of them could keep the history information of optimization. Here, a classification algorithm based on the novel multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) is proposed. Leukemia gene expression profiles with different dimensionalities are used for validation. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm are used for comparison. The MOA shows stable and relatively accurate classification performance and could be used as an effective classification algorithm for gene expression profiles.

With the deepening research, we find that portal can do more works than we thought, including simulating mirror, connecting cells and dividing cells more simply. In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation. Compare the results of traditional M/M/1 model and Monte Carlo simulation; it was found that it was necessary to treat this kind of problem as an uncertain problem in order to improve the accuracy of decision making.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy. Experiment result shows the pricing strategy could adjust computing resource prices automatically under the general market price rule conditions and maximize utility resource selection strategy could get the max utility for resource consumers.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity. The study results have positive effect in promoting scientific planning and construction of urban drain pipelines.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

Integrating remote sensing with GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation approach for Karst rocky desertification assessment in Southwest of China	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol		PROVINCE; AREAS	The increasing exploitation of Karst resources is leading to severe environmental impacts, as Karst frequently occurs in the most fragile and vulnerable environments. This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model. Experimental results on large scale networks demonstrate that the time consuming is much less and the influence spread effect is better than the classical greedy algorithm.

However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

Based on the principle of structure dynamics and the method of seismic response analysis, the finite element model of the main bridge in Mangjiedu Bridge under Midas-civil was built according to the structural features, site conditions and seismic fortification intensity of the bridge. Then the characteristics of main bridge structure were studied using Lanzcos modal analysis method, and the seismic responses of main bridge are studied by earthquake response spectrum analysis and time history analysis respectively. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the main bridge is 0.1943Hz, and the transverse vibration mode shapes are most remarkable in the former 10 ordered types of vibration of main bridge. The main bridge is in the conditions of elastic range and does not failure under El earthquake. Both response spectrum analysis and time history analysis show that the largest displacement along the main bridge appears at the top of pier and the largest transverse displacement appears in the central position of main span. It also shows that the maximum shear and maximum moment occur at the bottom of main pier.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

As a result, the security issue of biometric system extremely critical to be solved. In this paper, we introduce a public watermarking algorithm which is based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). By using the proposed algorithm, the finger geometry is embedded into the region of interest (ROT) of palmprint image. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the palmprint image and the finger geometry. Experimental results performed on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the watermarking operation has little impact on the recognition performance.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image. In the match stage, histogram intersection distance is applied as the similarity measurement between sample and template. Experimental results conducted on a database of 165 persons (4 fingers per person) show that the proposed method is effective.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

Since the face images are high dimensional, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimension reduction and feature extraction.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold. On one hand, the weights are assigned to the edges of folksonomy graph to indicate their importance. On the other hand, resource clustering is applied to solve the awareness differences of users. Experimental results on a Lastfm dataset show that the new model can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with original RWR-based recommending model.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

BasicRWR and ContextRWR are specifically designed to estimate the relevance between the target user and the items against the contextual graph. Also, we propose two post-processing strategies to filter recommendation results given contextual conditions. Being dependent on experimental results on two datasets, all proposed methods are effective to enhance the quality of context-aware recommendations.

More and more museums and libraries have their collections to be digitalized, which makes the study of problems haunted the art historians based on these digital images available. In this paper, the research of visual arts based on the computer and information of paintings, which can be called scientific understanding of visual arts, has been brought out. Some features, including multi-scale amplitude, non-stationarity of artworks, anisotropy of artworks and correlation of coefficients of the Curvelet transform among scales are extracted based on the Curvelet transform to evaluate the styles of different artists and some other respects of artworks. The relations between the styles of visual arts and these features are also stated, and the similarities of these styles are also qualified by comparing these features. It is apparent that each feature reflects different characteristics of the painting technique.

The enhanced similarity expands the concept of similarity from vertexes to communities in the social network. Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has been applied and the enhanced similarity of communities will be recalculated because of change of communities along with the agglomerative process. The experimental results show that our algorithm can well detect communities which well fitted the real communities in a social network.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model. Simulation results show that cooperative compressed sensing provides an efficient way to sense radio signal which is sparse at frequency domain.

However, current MapReduce model do not cope well with its scalability, which means that under certain hardware configuration, it can only support limited scale of cluster due to the overloading of center node. In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism.

The risk of requirement changes is considerable risk in software project management. Information entropy can effectively measure subsystem's degree of uniformity. This paper proposes a quantitative risk measurement model that could be used to measure risk posed by requirement changes. The more uniform requirement impact on software project, the smaller the risk, otherwise the key requirement changes will have a significant impact on the project. This paper discusses the rationality of the model and gives an instance of this model. The model requires data can be obtained from enterprise. Experiments show that the model is scientific and rational. It can serve as a reference for requirement management.

A Case Study of Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, PTS 1-6	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environmental Technology (REET 2013)	SEP 21-22, 2013	Jilin, PEOPLES R CHINA			Phytoremediation; P uptake potential; P-hyperaccumulators; Dominate species		Phosphorus leakage from phosphorus-enriched soils (PES) is a major cause of water degradation worldwide, and phytoextraction is known to be an effective method of remediation. However, it is unclear whether phytoextraction is equally efficient in mountainous regions. We investigated the potential of P accumulation of major plant species in the Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China. Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.

The main scientific objectives of HERD are indirect dark matter search, precise cosmic ray spectrum and composition measurements up to the knee energy, and high energy gamma-ray monitoring and survey. HERD is composed of a 3-D cubic calorimeter (CALO) surrounded by microstrip silicon trackers (STKs) from five sides except the bottom. CALO is made of about 10(4) cubes of LYSO crystals, corresponding to about 55 radiation lengths and 3 nuclear interaction lengths, respectively. The top STK microstrips of seven X-Y layers are sandwiched with tungsten converters to make precise directional measurements of incoming electrons and gamma-rays. In the baseline design, each of the four side SKTs is made of only three layers microstrips. All STKs will also be used for measuring the charge and incoming directions of cosmic rays, as well as identifying back scattered tracks. With this design, HERD can achieve the following performance: energy resolution of 1% for electrons and gamma-rays beyond 100 GeV, 20% for protons from 100 GeV to 1 PeV; electron/proton separation power better than 10(-5); effective geometrical factors of >3 m(2) sr for electron and diffuse gamma-rays, >2 m(2) sr for cosmic ray nuclei. R&D is under way for reading out the LYSO signals with optical fiber coupled to image intensified CCD and the prototype of one layer of CALO.	[Zhang, S. N.; Bao, T. W.; Bi, X. J.; Cao, Z.; Chai, J.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

The precondition of carrying on self-management scientifically and effectively is to know the theory of self-management well and precisely. Many scholars are paying attention to the study of self-management. However, the research on dimensional structure of employee's self-management is limited. And the definition of self-management is vague. Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis. It proves that employee's self-management consists of five dimensions, including self-knowledge, self-planning, self-control, self-learning and self-interpersonal management. It also verifies the practicability of the proposed framework.

But it is extremely difficult to implement the high-dimensional matrix multiplication on hardware. This paper presented a novel hardware architecture for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. OMP algorithm was improved to reduce the number of multiplications. Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

However, reserved jobs will make resource into fragments and decrease utilization. In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

With the deepening research, we find that portal can do more works than we thought, including simulating mirror, connecting cells and dividing cells more simply. In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The internal butterfly unit of the processor based on CORDIC algorithm, and uses an iterative computation process instead of two computation process which is the complex multiplication and the evaluation of trigonometric function. The butterfly unit has nothing to do with the external memory size, so it can handle large quantities of data. Based on this unit, the processor uses two logical processing core and pipeline system to improve the throughput and instantaneity. So the design has large scope of input and high-precision operation features.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation. Compare the results of traditional M/M/1 model and Monte Carlo simulation; it was found that it was necessary to treat this kind of problem as an uncertain problem in order to improve the accuracy of decision making.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy. Experiment result shows the pricing strategy could adjust computing resource prices automatically under the general market price rule conditions and maximize utility resource selection strategy could get the max utility for resource consumers.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity. The study results have positive effect in promoting scientific planning and construction of urban drain pipelines.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model. Experimental results on large scale networks demonstrate that the time consuming is much less and the influence spread effect is better than the classical greedy algorithm.

Based on the CPFR model which is defined by VICS organization, this paper makes a specific classification for CPFR model through cooperation depth and the number of partners and supplies a broader CPFR model choice space for companies. However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model. Based on these, we supply basis for the companies' selection of different CPFR model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

Through analysis of this model, its stability condition is obtained: When the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, our model is stable at its worm-free equilibrium where worms finally get eliminated. Simulation results show that quarantine strategy is efficient, in terms of the number of infected hosts and reducing worm propagation speed.

We reinvestigate these issues and propose a modification strategy called Dynamic Vegas, which changes initial TCP Vegas' in slow start and congestion avoidance phase. It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas. Additionally, in Multi-link environment, it achieves strong competitiveness against TCP Reno and gains fairness in throughput of all senders in the end of transmission.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

The Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS nanocomposites offer an excellent electron conductivity, catalysis and hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. CS is used as a cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on the surface of Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS and as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The biosensor shows favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride. It exhibits good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. More importantly, this study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface.

Based on the principle of structure dynamics and the method of seismic response analysis, the finite element model of the main bridge in Mangjiedu Bridge under Midas-civil was built according to the structural features, site conditions and seismic fortification intensity of the bridge. Then the characteristics of main bridge structure were studied using Lanzcos modal analysis method, and the seismic responses of main bridge are studied by earthquake response spectrum analysis and time history analysis respectively. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the main bridge is 0.1943Hz, and the transverse vibration mode shapes are most remarkable in the former 10 ordered types of vibration of main bridge. The main bridge is in the conditions of elastic range and does not failure under El earthquake. Both response spectrum analysis and time history analysis show that the largest displacement along the main bridge appears at the top of pier and the largest transverse displacement appears in the central position of main span. It also shows that the maximum shear and maximum moment occur at the bottom of main pier.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

In this paper, we introduce a public watermarking algorithm which is based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). By using the proposed algorithm, the finger geometry is embedded into the region of interest (ROT) of palmprint image. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the palmprint image and the finger geometry. Experimental results performed on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the watermarking operation has little impact on the recognition performance.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image.

The sending and receiving mutual interference collision is eliminated by slot allocation with collision avoid method. Moreover, path wake up strategy in terms of the node's hop are introduced which can assign listen frame and wake up slot better. As a result, a TDMA-based energy efficient cross-layer MAC protocol for wireless mesh sensor networks are proposed, and then the performance of the protocol are analysis by simulation. The study results show that based on WMN and WSN, WSN and 'WMN can be constructed to achieve a full interconnection network named WMSN.TCP-MCA protocol can effectively reduce idle listen time of node which reduce overall energy consumption of the network.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer. Finally, the light absorption and reflection properties were also investigated. All results were conducive to the development of silicon-based optoelectronic devices.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

The method not only helps to increase more samples, but strengthens the reliance of virtual samples on the samples in original database. Since the face images are high dimensional, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimension reduction and feature extraction. The experiments based on the ORL face database show that the recognition rates have been greatly improved and the recognition results are relatively stable with the increased sample method.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold. On one hand, the weights are assigned to the edges of folksonomy graph to indicate their importance. On the other hand, resource clustering is applied to solve the awareness differences of users. Experimental results on a Lastfm dataset show that the new model can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with original RWR-based recommending model.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

Recently, with the development of computer and image processing technology, the processing of digital visual artworks has become possible. More and more museums and libraries have their collections to be digitalized, which makes the study of problems haunted the art historians based on these digital images available. In this paper, the research of visual arts based on the computer and information of paintings, which can be called scientific understanding of visual arts, has been brought out. Some features, including multi-scale amplitude, non-stationarity of artworks, anisotropy of artworks and correlation of coefficients of the Curvelet transform among scales are extracted based on the Curvelet transform to evaluate the styles of different artists and some other respects of artworks. The relations between the styles of visual arts and these features are also stated, and the similarities of these styles are also qualified by comparing these features. It is apparent that each feature reflects different characteristics of the painting technique.

This paper explores an enhanced similarity which is based on interactive behavior of social members. The enhanced similarity expands the concept of similarity from vertexes to communities in the social network. Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has been applied and the enhanced similarity of communities will be recalculated because of change of communities along with the agglomerative process. The experimental results show that our algorithm can well detect communities which well fitted the real communities in a social network.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

In the past, we had to give up some badly influence bands. Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past. This new solar radio observation system can adjust the gain from -25dB to +35dB by remote software through RF(Radio Frequency) and MF (Medium frequency) attenuators. Based on advanced FPGA processor we can achieve high spectral resolution of about 30 KHz/channel and high time resolution of about 34ms.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model.

In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism. In this way, the system can theoretically achieve the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system. The scalability evaluation of the system has been experimented in the network scenarios using the prevailing word count problem.

Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.

The High cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) Facility onboard China's Future Space Station	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2014: ULTRAVIOLET TO GAMMA RAY	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Ultraviolet to Gamma Ray	JUN 22-26, 2014	Montreal, CANADA	SPIE		space experiment; calorimeter; microstrip silicon track; cosmic ray; dark matter; gamma-ray; electron	RAY PROTON; HELIUM SPECTRA; ENERGY-SPECTRUM; NUCLEI; RANGE; KNEE	The High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is one of several space astronomy payloads of the cosmic lighthouse program onboard China's Space Station, which is planned for operation starting around 2020 for about 10 years. The main scientific objectives of HERD are indirect dark matter search, precise cosmic ray spectrum and composition measurements up to the knee energy, and high energy gamma-ray monitoring and survey. HERD is composed of a 3-D cubic calorimeter (CALO) surrounded by microstrip silicon trackers (STKs) from five sides except the bottom. CALO is made of about 10(4) cubes of LYSO crystals, corresponding to about 55 radiation lengths and 3 nuclear interaction lengths, respectively. The top STK microstrips of seven X-Y layers are sandwiched with tungsten converters to make precise directional measurements of incoming electrons and gamma-rays. In the baseline design, each of the four side SKTs is made of only three layers microstrips. All STKs will also be used for measuring the charge and incoming directions of cosmic rays, as well as identifying back scattered tracks. With this design, HERD can achieve the following performance: energy resolution of 1% for electrons and gamma-rays beyond 100 GeV, 20% for protons from 100 GeV to 1 PeV; electron/proton separation power better than 10(-5); effective geometrical factors of >3 m(2) sr for electron and diffuse gamma-rays, >2 m(2) sr for cosmic ray nuclei. R&D is under way for reading out the LYSO signals with optical fiber coupled to image intensified CCD and the prototype of one layer of CALO.	[Zhang, S. N.; Bao, T. W.; Bi, X. J.; Cao, Z.; Chai, J.

However, the mixing vector of SCBSS, which is the base of the EMD method, has not yet been effectively constructed. The mixing vector reflects the weights of original signal sources that form the single channel blind signal source. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a mixing vector for a single channel blind signal source to approximate the actual mixing vector in terms of keeping the same ratios between signal weights. The constructed mixing vector can be used to improve signal separations. Our method incorporates the adaptive filter, least square method, EMD method and signal source samples to construct the mixing vector. Experimental tests using audio signal evaluations were conducted and the results indicated that our method can improve the similar values of sources energy ratio from 0.2644 to 0.8366. This kind of recognition is very important in weak signal detection.

A novel passive video inter-frame forgery detection method based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is presented in this work. It is based on the finding that inter-frame forgery will disturb the consistency of time-dimension factor. In this method, the video is factorized by using NTF first and then the time-dimension factor is extracted. By comparing the correlation between the elements of the factor, the video forgery can be detected. According to the experimental results, it shows that the proposed scheme is able to expose frame deletion and insertion forgery effectively.

The precondition of carrying on self-management scientifically and effectively is to know the theory of self-management well and precisely. Many scholars are paying attention to the study of self-management. However, the research on dimensional structure of employee's self-management is limited. And the definition of self-management is vague. Through literature review and qualitative analysis, the thesis concludes the dimensional structure of employee's self-management, and then the conclusion will be examined through confirmatory factor analysis. It proves that employee's self-management consists of five dimensions, including self-knowledge, self-planning, self-control, self-learning and self-interpersonal management. It also verifies the practicability of the proposed framework.

OMP algorithm was improved to reduce the number of multiplications. Alternative Cholesky Decomposition (ACD) which avoids square root calculations was used in the part of matrix decomposition to decrease computation delay. The parallel implementation and resource multiplexing were utilized to improve computing speed and resource utilization. This design was described by using RTL HDL, implemented with Altera's PFGA Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6. The timing simulation was carried under the Quartus II.

However, the face imaging process can easily be affected by external factors and encounter the noise signal, which disturbs the effect of face recognition based on combinational mirror-like odd and even image features. This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror- like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror- like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror- like odd features. However, due to mirror-like even symmetry images not focusing on expressing the image details, their proportion should not be too large.

The reason is there are some samples containing lots of redundant information which is not conducive to classification and must be excluded from the training samples. Recent documents proposed an idea of electing points (samples) based on pseudo-eigenvalue method, deciding which point should remain in the training set according to their representation of the population. But the specific process and corresponding parameters of selecting points need to be further studied and improved. This article first discusses the specific process of selecting points and the rule of selecting parameters, and then applies the pseudo-eigenvalue method to KPCA to form a new PKPCA method. The experimental results based on ORL and YALE facial databases show that the proposed PKPCA algorithm has high efficiency and reliability.

It has been found the diurnal and monthly of atmospheric electric evolution in fair weather showed variation in Jinghong. The daily variation curves show single oscillation with evening peak. The minima can also be seen in early morning. The analysis in this paper is to look into how the factors like atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity in the presence of the meteorological factors in four seasons govern the fair weather atmospheric electric field at the site of measurement. The results of meteorological effects show that there is a strong positive correlation between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and temperature, while a strong negative correlation is seen between the fair weather atmospheric electric field and the atmospheric pressure, also the relative humidity.

This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 20 min. The thunderstorm exhibited strong vertical development with cloud top reaching 15.9km. The CG parameters considered are the flash rate, the flash polarity, the multiplicity, and the peak current. The thunderstorm produced especially low positive CG proportions associated with negative CGs with high values of peak current and multiplicity. This second part is mostly centered on the detailed analysis of the CG lightning behavior, its relationship with radar-derived storm parameters, and CG lightning correlation with hazardous weather. The analysis of the storm cells life cycle has showed similar trends between the CG lighting flash rates and radar-derived parameters like the area of reflectivity above 30 dBZ at the -10 degrees C isotherm height. There is a distinct increase in CG flash rate during the rapid development stage of hailstorms. The CG lightning "jump" pattern seems more robust to forecast in a short-term basis the possible occurrence of severe weather.

However, reserved jobs will make resource into fragments and decrease utilization. In order to minimize the negative effects of advance reservations, the authors analyzed the generation of resource fragments during reservation and investigated their influence on advance reservation requests in a quantitative way. Based on the quantification, two new scheduling algorithms, Resource Fragment-aware Best Fit (FSB) and Resource Fragment-aware Worst Fit (FSW), were proposed and their performances were investigated via comprehensive simulations. In simulation, mean job size, deadline factor, system load and sever number were chosen as control factors, and the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in terms of job acceptance rate, resource utilization and slowdown. We also compared FSB and FSW with Best Fit, First Fit, Min_LIP and Min_TIP. The simulations show that FSW and FSB can provide higher job acceptance rate, especially under heavy system load.

The estimation is based on the simulation model of skull with the characteristic parameters obtained from clinical statistics by using Mimics and the integration method to calculate the surface area of the scalp flap where the bone flap was removed for the relief of intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury by considering the sunken degree of the brain and scalp flap. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the comparison of the results obtained from the clinical statistical and simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that the computed value of the scalp flap area obtained from the simulation is consistent quite well with the results of clinical statistics.

Still none of them could keep the history information of optimization. Here, a classification algorithm based on the novel multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) is proposed. Leukemia gene expression profiles with different dimensionalities are used for validation. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm are used for comparison. The MOA shows stable and relatively accurate classification performance and could be used as an effective classification algorithm for gene expression profiles.

With the deepening research, we find that portal can do more works than we thought, including simulating mirror, connecting cells and dividing cells more simply. In this paper, first, we give the basic conception of portal, analyze the status and development trend of it, and divide portal into two categories: conventional portal and arbitrary portal. Conventional portal is a planar portal, defined on cell boundaries and used to form a CPG graph connecting the cells of the subdivision. Arbitrary portal is non-planar portal, can be any arbitrary surface, so it may exist anywhere within a cell or outside the indoor scene and connect to any space with an adjacent cell. Then, we describe the detail development of each type, comparing their difference and the different methods about portal. Finally, we point out some key research issues that need to be studied in the future.

In this paper, we propose a method for saliency detection that outputs full resolution saliency maps of the input images. The key idea is to exploit a computational process of divisive normalization that simulates the similar feature suppression in human primary visual cortex, and thereby is capable of generating visual saliency. The method, which only employs low-level features of color and luminance, is simple and computationally efficient. We compare our method with five state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms by use of psychophysical patterns and natural images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms these five algorithms both on the psychophysical ground-truth evaluation and on the eye fixations prediction task.

The internal butterfly unit of the processor based on CORDIC algorithm, and uses an iterative computation process instead of two computation process which is the complex multiplication and the evaluation of trigonometric function. The butterfly unit has nothing to do with the external memory size, so it can handle large quantities of data. Based on this unit, the processor uses two logical processing core and pipeline system to improve the throughput and instantaneity. So the design has large scope of input and high-precision operation features. Finally, we make a timing simulation for the Altera's chip of EP2C20F484C6, which can run correctly under the 100MHz system clock.

The paper combined Monte Carlo simulation with traditional M/M/1 model. The paper set an example of traditional M/M/1 system and calculates its indicators of performance firstly. Secondly, define the parameters with combination of the observation data and Delphi results. Thirdly, do Monte Carlo simulation with computer and software. In the end, compare the results by two methods. The results showed that the performance could be acceptable and did not need to make any improvements in case of traditional calculation. But, lots of things had been changed when the parameters had become uncertain. All indicators showed a big risk after the Monte Carlo simulation.

Current market trading mechanism under the cloud computing environment is lacking in flexibility and most of companies adopt a fixed-rate pricing model, which is difficult to meet the different needs of users. Based on cloud bank model, this paper introduces economic theory to provide a theoretical basis for the development of resource prices and propose a dynamic pricing strategy and maximize utility resource selection strategy based on market supply and demand and credit for cloud bank. In the last part of this paper, we use simulation platform to do a simple experiment to test this dynamic pricing strategy. Experiment result shows the pricing strategy could adjust computing resource prices automatically under the general market price rule conditions and maximize utility resource selection strategy could get the max utility for resource consumers.

One specimen was served as the reference without any strengthening scheme; another one was first tested to the severely damaged level, and then retrofitted with BFRP in a mixed strengthening configuration on two sides. Both of these specimens were tested under in-plane constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. Test results are analyzed in terms of failure mode, maximum shear strength, ultimate drift, energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping coefficient, which indicated that the use of BFRP composite material can effectively improve both the strength and deformation capacity of the damaged masonry wall as well as changing failure mode and maintaining the wall's integrity.

However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason is lack of mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to a certain unbridled extent. This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity.

In this study, the experimental results from two half-scale RC-brick masonry walls with opening retrofitted with BFRP composite strips are presented. One wall was initially damaged in shear loading up to its maximum strength, and then repaired with BFRP sheets; another one was directly strengthened with BFRP sheets in the same strengthening configuration. All the walls were subjected to cyclic in-plane shear loading up to failure. Compared to the strengthened walls, the repaired masonry wall has almost the same failure mode and FRP strain rule, and slightly lower lateral strength and deformation capacity as well as energy dissipation capacity.

In this paper, we propose a fast frequency domain visual saliency method by use of the binary spectrum of Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The method achieves saliency detection by simply exploiting the WHT components of the scene under view. Unlike space domain-based approaches, our method performs the cortical center-surround suppression in frequency domain and thus has implicit biological plausibility. By virtue of simplicity and speed of the WHT, the proposed method is very simple and fast in computation, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, when evaluated by using the capability of eye fixation prediction.

It has been proved that CPM and PERT are most suitable methods to solve the problem of project management and scheduling in practice. A very important problem has been neglected for a long time. The problem is how big the differences between CPM and PERT. The papers made a classic case of textbooks as an example and calculate parameters of all works. After 5000 times' simulation, the results showed that scheduling with PERT was not as optimistic as CPM, the scheduling risk is so big that we must find out the largest risk points. Through the sensitivity analysis, the work which has large influence could be found and should be treat as key control points. It is proved that PERT with Monte Carlo simulation was better to solve the problem of project management and scheduling. And, it is meaningful to compare CPM and PERT in project management and scheduling.

Integrating remote sensing with GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation approach for Karst rocky desertification assessment in Southwest of China	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol		PROVINCE; AREAS	The increasing exploitation of Karst resources is leading to severe environmental impacts, as Karst frequently occurs in the most fragile and vulnerable environments. This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

The high complexity of the classical greedy algorithm cannot be well suited for the moderate or large scale networks. It is necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm, not sensitive to the scale of the social network. In this paper, we propose an approach for estimating the nodes' influence based on the network structure. By this way, we make the scope of influence reduced to the nodes with the maximal influence, while make the consuming time reduced consequently. Then, we design a more efficient greedy algorithm (called LNG algorithm) for the linear threshold model. Experimental results on large scale networks demonstrate that the time consuming is much less and the influence spread effect is better than the classical greedy algorithm.

Therefore, it is lack of universality and flexibility in choices. Based on the CPFR model which is defined by VICS organization, this paper makes a specific classification for CPFR model through cooperation depth and the number of partners and supplies a broader CPFR model choice space for companies. However, companies also face the problem of how to choose a suitable model after the classification of the model. Therefore, the other contribution of this paper is making a research of factors which influence companies' selection of CPFR model, mainly the two bases which influence the classification of the model. Based on these, we supply basis for the companies' selection of different CPFR model.

A job can be either rejected, in which case its penalty is paid, or scheduled on one of the machines, in which case its processing time contributes to the load of that machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound B. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time and a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nm O(1/e(2)) + mn(2)) for the general case. Moreover, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant. This result improves previous best running time from O(n(m+2) /epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)).

To effectively defend against them, this paper proposed an epidemic SEIQV model with quarantine and vaccination strategies. Through analysis of this model, its stability condition is obtained: When the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, our model is stable at its worm-free equilibrium where worms finally get eliminated. Simulation results show that quarantine strategy is efficient, in terms of the number of infected hosts and reducing worm propagation speed.

We reinvestigate these issues and propose a modification strategy called Dynamic Vegas, which changes initial TCP Vegas' in slow start and congestion avoidance phase. It dynamically chooses slow start algorithm and adjust decrease/increase rate in congestion avoidance phase according to specific network environment. Experiments show that within a single link network, it performs as well as TCP Vegas. Additionally, in Multi-link environment, it achieves strong competitiveness against TCP Reno and gains fairness in throughput of all senders in the end of transmission.

Various methods for reducing the data centers' energy consumption have been investigated, but without paying much attention to the quality-of-service (QoS) expectations. In this paper, we proposed a simple model of energy efficiency-QoS (E-Q) aimed at capturing some key aspects of energy minimization while meeting the specified constraints on performance and/or QoS. Then, based on the proposed E-Q model, we give an algorithm which can enable the physical nodes to satisfy the performance's need for any set of jobs with a minimum-energy schedule and in the cloud. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous work, which can achieve objective optimization both on energy consumption and QoS.

The proposed reconstruction consisted in reconstructing the 3D central curve of the spine based on the epipolar geometry and automatically aligning vertebrae under the constraint of this curve. The vertebral orientations were adjusted by matching the projections of the 3D pedicles with the 2D pedicles in biplanar radiographs. The user interaction time was within one minute for a thoracic spine. Sixteen pairs of radiographs of a thoracic spinal model were used to evaluate the precision and accuracy. The precision was within 3.1 mm for the location and 3.5 degrees for the orientation. The accuracy was within 3.5 mm for the location and 3.9 degrees for the orientation. These results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising tool to obtain the 3D spinal geometry with acceptable user interactions in scoliotic clinics.

The Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS nanocomposites offer an excellent electron conductivity, catalysis and hydrophilic surface for biomolecule adhesion. CS is used as a cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on the surface of Pt-PdNPs-SWCNTs-CS and as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The biosensor shows favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride. It exhibits good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors. More importantly, this study could provide a universal platform for meeting the demand of the effective immobilization enzyme on the electrode surface.

EPM is still abstract at higher abstract level and is general while software process is concrete, so EPM must be instantiated before its enactment. The method to transform any EPM to its execution model based on logic programming is proposed. Since activity contains the imports resource, roles resource, exports resource and tasks, the rules to transform the four parts of activity level of any EPM to its execution model based logic programming are respectively proposed by analyzing the execution semantics of the activities and the tasks in EPM. The converter program is realized and the correct results have presented to prove the correctness of the method.

As a result, the security issue of biometric system extremely critical to be solved. In this paper, we introduce a public watermarking algorithm which is based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). By using the proposed algorithm, the finger geometry is embedded into the region of interest (ROT) of palmprint image. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the palmprint image and the finger geometry. Experimental results performed on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the watermarking operation has little impact on the recognition performance.

City and urban areas contain plenty of services but some of them are difficult to extract and retrieval to people. Furthermore, with the development of the Semantic Web, more and more datasets are represented as RDF format and become part of the Linked Data, which provides a fundamentally new venue for personalized urban services retrieval in smart city applications. In this paper, we propose a personalized urban services retrieval framework which is performed by using ontology and comparing RDF-based user profiles with dataset in relation to civic services on web of data. To extract hidden information, the domain specific ontology is involved for linking entities on the web of data. The cases we envisage will show that the proposed framework can effectively return services resources with respect to the user's interests.

During this period, it has been proved that Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP identification method based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), whose idea is to divide the region of interest (ROT) of FKP into a set of sub-image blocks, which can be applied to extract the local features of the FKP. After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROT image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROT image. In the match stage, histogram intersection distance is applied as the similarity measurement between sample and template. Experimental results conducted on a database of 165 persons (4 fingers per person) show that the proposed method is effective.

The sending and receiving mutual interference collision is eliminated by slot allocation with collision avoid method. Moreover, path wake up strategy in terms of the node's hop are introduced which can assign listen frame and wake up slot better. As a result, a TDMA-based energy efficient cross-layer MAC protocol for wireless mesh sensor networks are proposed, and then the performance of the protocol are analysis by simulation. The study results show that based on WMN and WSN, WSN and 'WMN can be constructed to achieve a full interconnection network named WMSN.TCP-MCA protocol can effectively reduce idle listen time of node which reduce overall energy consumption of the network.

The influences of deposition temperature and thickness of Si spacer-layer on the microstructure of double-layer Ge/Si quantum dots were characterized by using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra technique. The results indicate that the density of the second layer islands firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the growth temperature of Si spacer-layers. hi addition, increasing the thickness of Si spacer-layer, the islands merger phenomenon disappears. When the deposition thickness is larger than 40 am, the islands on the upper-layer show the same features with the buried islands. The mechanism of three-factor-interactions of nano-islands is proposed to explain these phenomena, and our results can be used as a guidance to obtain optimum IBSD growth process for Ge/Si quantum-dot superlattices.

Firstly, the most stable configuration was selected from passivated configurations according to the lowest energy principle after calculating their total energies. Secondly the density of state and the band structure of the different passivated systems were calculated. It was found that different passivation clusters could affect the forbidden band, furthermore the passivated HS-cluster could notably decrease the width of forbidden band through electron transfer. Finally, the light absorption and reflection properties were also investigated. All results were conducive to the development of silicon-based optoelectronic devices.

These collectors have successfully extracted the copper minerals from the low-grade refractory ores, and one of the most important collectors is the alkylhydroxamate-based chelating reagent which shows the excellent flotation performance to the copper oxide minerals. Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency.

Combined use of many collectors is one of the best ways to solve the problem, because the synergistic effect induced by the multifunctional composite chemical reagents will exert positive effect to the flotation and increase the recovery. The synergy is related with the reagent types, characteristics, and component contents in the mixture, and it is critical to choose and design the combination of various reagents. The maximal effect from synergy can be obtained easily by confecting the blended reagents. So the use of mixed collectors on the flotation of minerals has both benefits of reducing the costs and increasing the flotation efficiency.

However, the present framework of RWR performs on un-weighted folksonomy graph, thus neglects some useful and implicit information inside the folksonomy, such as the preference of users to resources or tags, the awareness difference of users to resources of the same tag. Inspired by this, this paper presents a resources recommendation model which enhances the original RWR recommendation framework in the twofold. On one hand, the weights are assigned to the edges of folksonomy graph to indicate their importance. On the other hand, resource clustering is applied to solve the awareness differences of users. Experimental results on a Lastfm dataset show that the new model can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with original RWR-based recommending model.

The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time.

Firstly, candidate objects were found out in axial plane (A-plane) and coronal plane (C-plane) images with the preprocessing stage. Secondly, textural features of candidate objects were extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Finally, each feature extractor was evaluated using the criterion of distances between classes. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the mesh and fascia in automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide significant textural features in the C-plane to distinguish between the mesh and fascia.

Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has been applied and the enhanced similarity of communities will be recalculated because of change of communities along with the agglomerative process.

Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model.

However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure. However, after revisiting the construction, we demonstrate that cloud service provider can not perform data retrieval task in their construction, and their construction cannot achieve one-to-many encryption.

In the past, we had to give up some badly influence bands. Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past. This new solar radio observation system can adjust the gain from -25dB to +35dB by remote software through RF(Radio Frequency) and MF (Medium frequency) attenuators. Based on advanced FPGA processor we can achieve high spectral resolution of about 30 KHz/channel and high time resolution of about 34ms.

Solar radio bursts frequently occurred also with strong emission in L band, which are potential interferences for the navigation service. During the most intense solar radio bursts, the obviously decreasing performances of navigation systems were found. In this work, we get the threshold values for the three communication frequency points by theoretical arithmetic. At the same time, we will set up the real-time solar radio flux monitor system for test and verify the real threshold value in natural space based on 10m solar radio telescope. At last, we will try to build the pre-alarm system combining optical observation data.

However, the performances of traditional fixed stations and mobile stations which are based on energy detection and work individually are often compromised with multipath fading and shadowing in urban environment. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a cooperative compressed spectrum sensing model which consists of several sensing nodes and a fusion node is proposed in this paper. The maximum-minimum eigenvalue based detection method is applied to the sensing model. Simulation results show that cooperative compressed sensing provides an efficient way to sense radio signal which is sparse at frequency domain.

However, current MapReduce model do not cope well with its scalability, which means that under certain hardware configuration, it can only support limited scale of cluster due to the overloading of center node. In this paper, we present a prototype based on DHTs Peer-to-Peer MapReduce system, which removed the MapReduce task centralized scheduling's master node and bottom file system management's name node on the basis of remaining original MapReduce workflow unchanged. In the system, the distributed file system in bottom layer queries data through distributed hashing, while the MapReduce system in upper layer invoke and schedule the tasks by distributed notification mechanism. In this way, the system can theoretically achieve the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system. The scalability evaluation of the system has been experimented in the network scenarios using the prevailing word count problem.

The risk of requirement changes is considerable risk in software project management. Information entropy can effectively measure subsystem's degree of uniformity. This paper proposes a quantitative risk measurement model that could be used to measure risk posed by requirement changes. The more uniform requirement impact on software project, the smaller the risk, otherwise the key requirement changes will have a significant impact on the project. This paper discusses the rationality of the model and gives an instance of this model. The model requires data can be obtained from enterprise.

A Case Study of Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, PTS 1-6	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environmental Technology (REET 2013)	SEP 21-22, 2013	Jilin, PEOPLES R CHINA			Phytoremediation; P uptake potential; P-hyperaccumulators; Dominate species		Phosphorus leakage from phosphorus-enriched soils (PES) is a major cause of water degradation worldwide, and phytoextraction is known to be an effective method of remediation. However, it is unclear whether phytoextraction is equally efficient in mountainous regions. We investigated the potential of P accumulation of major plant species in the Lake Dianchi Watershed of Southwestern China. Most of the plants living in PES of this region have high P contents; some have been identified as P-hyperaccumulators, such as Polygonum pubescens, which has the highest leaf P content of 16.88 mg/g. Although the dominate species have relatively low P contents than the P-hyperaccumulators, they still have a higher P uptake potential due to their greater biomass, for example, the P uptake potentials of Alnus nepalensis, Coriaria nepalensis, and Erianthus rufipilus are 46.98, 16.91, and 22.78 kg/ha, respectively. While these plants can decrease the total P of rhizospheric soil and topsoil, the effects on the total P-pool was not significant. Our results suggest that just phytoextraction may be less efficient in remediating PES in mountainous regions, and it requires further studies about P cycling and native plants to design more effective measures for P immobilization.

The main scientific objectives of HERD are indirect dark matter search, precise cosmic ray spectrum and composition measurements up to the knee energy, and high energy gamma-ray monitoring and survey. HERD is composed of a 3-D cubic calorimeter (CALO) surrounded by microstrip silicon trackers (STKs) from five sides except the bottom. CALO is made of about 10(4) cubes of LYSO crystals, corresponding to about 55 radiation lengths and 3 nuclear interaction lengths, respectively. The top STK microstrips of seven X-Y layers are sandwiched with tungsten converters to make precise directional measurements of incoming electrons and gamma-rays. In the baseline design, each of the four side SKTs is made of only three layers microstrips. All STKs will also be used for measuring the charge and incoming directions of cosmic rays, as well as identifying back scattered tracks. With this design, HERD can achieve the following performance: energy resolution of 1% for electrons and gamma-rays beyond 100 GeV, 20% for protons from 100 GeV to 1 PeV; electron/proton separation power better than 10(-5); effective geometrical factors of >3 m(2) sr for electron and diffuse gamma-rays, >2 m(2) sr for cosmic ray nuclei. R&D is under way for reading out the LYSO signals with optical fiber coupled to image intensified CCD and the prototype of one layer of CALO.	[Zhang, S. N.; Bao, T. W.; Bi, X. J.; Cao, Z.; Chai, J.
