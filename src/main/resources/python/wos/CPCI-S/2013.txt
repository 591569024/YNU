It has been widely applied in various fields, including High Performance Computing (HPC). However, virtualization brings some performance overhead. Meanwhile, there are some differences in virtualization technology of different Open Source Cloud platforms. In order to find out the most suitable Open Source Cloud for HPC, this paper compares and analyses the performance of Open Source Clouds platforms such as Nimbus, OpenNebula and OpenStack for HPC according to HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark suite. From our experiment, OpenStack shows the better performance for HPC. So, it is proposed for implementing HPC applications in Open Source Cloud platform.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Group recommendation is essentially useful for websites, especially for social tagging systems. In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions.

In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

For obtaining stable payoff vectors in multi-choice game, we extend several key solutions about bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus in classical cooperative game to multi-choice games with coalition structure, considering that multi-choice game is commonly with coalition structure. The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game. Furthermore, we deduce many relationships, that the kernel is a subset of the bargaining set, that the nucleolus is a subset of the kernel, that the nucleolus is existent and unique, and that the kernel and the bargaining set are existent.

Therefore, the thermal stress and the temperature control have significant meaning in the mass concrete structures. Thermal cracks will break the structure globality and also decrease the durability of the structures during the construction time. In addition, the temperature variation will have a remarkable affection on the stresses variation of the structures during the service time [2].

Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

ZnO films with the grain size range from 0.4 to 2 mu m had been fabricated by varying the temperature, ion concentration and deposition potentials. Moreover, ZnO films with the impurity energy level of 2.28 +/- 0.20 eV origin from the oxygen vacancy, had been found in the PL emission. It is found that as the applied potential went more negative, the concentration of the oxygen vacancies increased, and the emission peak of the impurity level had higher intensity By changing the ion concentration and temperature of the electrolyte, the controllable microstructure and impurity levels of ZnO thin films had been achieved.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

These mass concrete structures craze not by external loads, the temperature variation caused by heat of hydration and the temperature stress caused by concrete shrinkage are the main causes for the leaks [1]. Therefore, the thermal stress and the temperature control have significant meaning in the mass concrete structures. Thermal cracks will break the structure globality and also decrease the durability of the structures during the construction time. In addition, the temperature variation will have a remarkable affection on the stresses variation of the structures during the service time [2].

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

Moreover, ZnO films with the impurity energy level of 2.28 +/- 0.20 eV origin from the oxygen vacancy, had been found in the PL emission.

The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

The availability of bandwidths is dynamic variable during multimedia streams transmission, especially the availability of video streams. So, it can dynamic adjust the compression levels to each stream and distribute the resources of bandwidths to adapt the variations in resource availability. Using this strategy of dynamic QoS management make it becomes feasible to provide the best possible QoS to each stream.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference.

Firstly, hernia lesions were obtained by detecting black targets in ultrasound images of the coronal plane. Secondly, the morphological method was used to remove false black targets. Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide more diagnostic information by measuring the volume of lesions.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating. The classification stability and accuracy by the proposed TLPSO algorithm increase significantly compared with the results obtained by using algorithms known as PSO and Kmeans.

In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

It is also an important way to make further treatment plan for the patient. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established.

Group recommendation is essentially useful for websites, especially for social tagging systems. In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions.

In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

The results showed that no pores were present on PS surface which was prepared under the higher concentration of HF (10%). However, the pores were gradually visible with the HF concentration reduction. The main pores diameter was about 100 nm, when the concentration is 5.71%. The data of surface roughness and the main height distribution of the "hill" both showed an increase with the reduction of concentration, from 6.39 nm increase to 16.9 nm and from 30 nm increase to 90 nm, respectively, which implied that the pores were better exposed under the lower HF concentration.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

The optimum preparation parameters are that the pH value is 2.5, Ni: Ti=0.01 (molar ratio) and sintering temperature is 500 degrees C.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

These mass concrete structures craze not by external loads, the temperature variation caused by heat of hydration and the temperature stress caused by concrete shrinkage are the main causes for the leaks [1]. Therefore, the thermal stress and the temperature control have significant meaning in the mass concrete structures. Thermal cracks will break the structure globality and also decrease the durability of the structures during the construction time. In addition, the temperature variation will have a remarkable affection on the stresses variation of the structures during the service time [2].

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

Moreover, ZnO films with the impurity energy level of 2.28 +/- 0.20 eV origin from the oxygen vacancy, had been found in the PL emission.

The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

The availability of bandwidths is dynamic variable during multimedia streams transmission, especially the availability of video streams. So, it can dynamic adjust the compression levels to each stream and distribute the resources of bandwidths to adapt the variations in resource availability. Using this strategy of dynamic QoS management make it becomes feasible to provide the best possible QoS to each stream.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference.

Firstly, hernia lesions were obtained by detecting black targets in ultrasound images of the coronal plane. Secondly, the morphological method was used to remove false black targets. Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide more diagnostic information by measuring the volume of lesions.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating. The classification stability and accuracy by the proposed TLPSO algorithm increase significantly compared with the results obtained by using algorithms known as PSO and Kmeans.

In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

It is also an important way to make further treatment plan for the patient. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established.

Group recommendation is essentially useful for websites, especially for social tagging systems. In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions.

In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

The results showed that no pores were present on PS surface which was prepared under the higher concentration of HF (10%). However, the pores were gradually visible with the HF concentration reduction. The main pores diameter was about 100 nm, when the concentration is 5.71%. The data of surface roughness and the main height distribution of the "hill" both showed an increase with the reduction of concentration, from 6.39 nm increase to 16.9 nm and from 30 nm increase to 90 nm, respectively, which implied that the pores were better exposed under the lower HF concentration.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

The optimum preparation parameters are that the pH value is 2.5, Ni: Ti=0.01 (molar ratio) and sintering temperature is 500 degrees C.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

These mass concrete structures craze not by external loads, the temperature variation caused by heat of hydration and the temperature stress caused by concrete shrinkage are the main causes for the leaks [1]. Therefore, the thermal stress and the temperature control have significant meaning in the mass concrete structures. Thermal cracks will break the structure globality and also decrease the durability of the structures during the construction time. In addition, the temperature variation will have a remarkable affection on the stresses variation of the structures during the service time [2].

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

Moreover, ZnO films with the impurity energy level of 2.28 +/- 0.20 eV origin from the oxygen vacancy, had been found in the PL emission.

The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

The availability of bandwidths is dynamic variable during multimedia streams transmission, especially the availability of video streams. So, it can dynamic adjust the compression levels to each stream and distribute the resources of bandwidths to adapt the variations in resource availability. Using this strategy of dynamic QoS management make it becomes feasible to provide the best possible QoS to each stream.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference.

Firstly, hernia lesions were obtained by detecting black targets in ultrasound images of the coronal plane. Secondly, the morphological method was used to remove false black targets. Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide more diagnostic information by measuring the volume of lesions.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating. The classification stability and accuracy by the proposed TLPSO algorithm increase significantly compared with the results obtained by using algorithms known as PSO and Kmeans.

In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation. The average copper recovery from the rougher tests is 38.4% with a concentrate grade of 3.19%. The additional cleaning flotation can increase the Cu grade in concentrate further.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm.

Because of the particular characters of UAWSN such as big transportation delay, limited node power supply, many of the mature WSN techniques can't be implanted to UAWSN directly. UW-CSMA/CA MAC protocol and UW-AODV Routing protocol are proposed in this paper to underlie the Data Link Layer and Network Layer of the network protocol stack of UAWSN.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

Mn and Ga impurities result in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom reduced and consequently might decrease the ionicity of sphalerite; while Fe, Cd, In, Ge and Tl impurities lead to the increase in the Mulliken charge of the Zn atom. The frontier orbital calculations show that Mn impurities might lead to the over-oxidization of sphalerite, which may cause the further oxidation of lead xanthate, and thus are unfavorable for the flotation of sphalerite.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage.

The round robin algorithm is extensively used as its fairness. However, the RR scheme seems difficult to guarantee QoS and satisfy the delay sensitive traffic. For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

By considering the mutual interactions among advertisers in sponsored search auctions, we propose a game-theory based method for advertisers cooperating with each other in a sponsored search auction. First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time. Then, we prove the coalitional game of advertisers has a non-empty core containing the Shapley value. Following, we use an approximate Shapley value to distribute the coalition's utility among advertisers in the coalition. Experiments results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

It is also an important way to make further treatment plan for the patient. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proven to be an ineffective solution for classification and clustering in bioinformatics as it could not give a stable prediction result. In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established.

Group recommendation is essentially useful for websites, especially for social tagging systems. In this paper, we initially experiment with various rank aggregation strategies for group recommendation in social tagging systems. Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems. And group recommendation can achieve better effect than individual recommendation based on our proposed model.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

Two keys about multi-feature fusion are how to select some valid features and how to fuse the features. In this paper, we propose an object representation fusing global and local features for object tracking. In our method, we select a common hue histogram as the global feature and use a valid SIFT feature as the local feature. In the tracking frame of particle filter, the tracking results show that our proposed object representation can better restrain the disturbing of complex environments with abrupt illumination and partial occlusion, than color-based global representation.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions.

In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

By using frame difference method to solve the effect of strong light, but frame difference method can not detect object when the object do not move, the method of background subtraction can detect it, building Gaussian background model in the HSV space can eliminate shadows. Empirical results show that the method of fusion frame difference and background subtraction in the HSV space can get overcome the effect of strong light and shadows. Fusion background subtraction and frame difference method based on establishing a Gaussian mixture model in HSV space can overcome the disadvantages of the frame difference method, at the same time it can also solve the false detection of object which result from the background subtraction method.

The extended bargaining set, kernel and nucleolus are generalizations to them in classical cooperative game.

The results showed that no pores were present on PS surface which was prepared under the higher concentration of HF (10%). However, the pores were gradually visible with the HF concentration reduction. The main pores diameter was about 100 nm, when the concentration is 5.71%. The data of surface roughness and the main height distribution of the "hill" both showed an increase with the reduction of concentration, from 6.39 nm increase to 16.9 nm and from 30 nm increase to 90 nm, respectively, which implied that the pores were better exposed under the lower HF concentration.

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

The optimum preparation parameters are that the pH value is 2.5, Ni: Ti=0.01 (molar ratio) and sintering temperature is 500 degrees C.

Quantum dot can be applied to solar cells in two structures of QDSC to improve the energy conversion efficiency. The two structures are p-i-n type QDSC and quantum dots sensitized solar cells. The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell. But before large-scale application their efficiency and stability should be improved.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result. Results show that it is feasible to describe the saturated seepage and saturated - unsaturated seepage by means of Darcy law and Richards Equation respectively and it is effective to simulate the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state by using the finite element software Midas GTS.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory. Thus, the categories of microblog users with overlapping and hierarchical properties in various abstraction hierarchies can be obtained flexibly. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference. Simulation results show that the proposed dual networks of WSN and PLC with RS-CRC encoding have lower error bit rate and time delay compared with single network and existing research papers conclusion. In power distribution network communication using the dual networks might solve the communication issue in power industrial environment.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

First, we propose a cooperation bid strategy for advertisers' coalition, which could make the utility of the coalition increased and be obtained in linear time.

Solving an ID means determining the optimal strategy for the decision maker and the value or certain equivalent of the decision situation when that optimal strategy is applied. Much research effort has been devoted to develop methods and algorithms for solving IDs, and a vast literature on this problem has been yielded. This paper attempts a brief exposition on the methods common used for solving IDs, for the purpose of providing a help for decision makers to select appropriate methods when they solve IDs.

At the first step, endplate inclination of each vertebra on both the coronal and sagittal radiographs was measured by a computerized system. The Cobb angles of the proximal thoracic, the main thoracic, and the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves were then automatically calculated in the standing and side-bending coronal planes and the standing sagittal plane. A computerized algorithm automatically classified the spinal type. The classification results of 37 scoliotic patients by five observers showed that with the computer aid, the average interobserver and intraobserver kappa values were improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and from 0.68 to 0.83, respectively. This computerized tool can assist in the Lenke classification of scoliosis.

In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile, Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

Forty-nine scoliotic patients with Lenke Type 1 curve were selected for analysis. For each patient, the 3D spine model was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs, and the geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed regarding the average torsion, the maximum torsion, and the Cobb angle, with the patients subdivided according to the torsion pattern. Results showed that a statistically significant difference was observed for the torsion parameters (i.e., the average torsion and the maximum torsion) between subgroups within the Lenke Type 1 curves while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the Cobb angle. The strengths of correlations between the torsion parameters and Cobb angle were stronger in the subgroup with torsion pattern of Type A. These results add the evidence that 3D geometric torsion reveals structural differences that are not apparent in the Cobb measurement.

In this algorithm, the design objective of the context quantizer is aimed to minimize the adaptive code length of the source sequence. In purpose of finding the optimal number of classes, the increment of the adaptive code length is suggested to be the similarity measure of two conditional probability distributions, by which the similarity matrix is constructed as the input of the affinity propagation algorithm. After the given number of iterations, the optimal quantizer with the optimal number of classes is achieved and the adaptive code length is minimized at the same time. The simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that are better than the results obtained by the minimum conditional entropy context quantization implemented by K-means with lower computational complexity.

In this study, a classifier based on the two layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) algorithm and uncertain training sample sets is established. Samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBLC) gene expression data are used for training and validating.

Specially, we consider trust-based user groups detected by community discovery based on trustable social relations. Also, we present hybrid similarity to estimate the relevance between users and resources. According to experiments on Delicious and Lastfm datasets, CombMAX, CombSUM and CombANZ are more suitable for aggregating individual preference into a group preference in social tagging systems.

In this algorithm, the optimal context quantizer is described by the chromosome which contains the optimal number of classes and the corresponding cluster centers. The adaptive code length is used to evaluate the fitness value to find the best chromosome. The rules for the selection, the crossover and the mutation operations are discussed. A K-means operator is incorporated in each iteration to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The optimized context quantizer can be obtained without the prior knowledge of the number of classes. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm produces results that approximate the best result obtained by the K-means-based context quantization with lower computational complexity.

A new algorithm which can automatically generate cartoon paintings is proposed. This method needs no user's participation and no drawing skills. Firstly, by using the bilateral filtering, the abstract visually appealing and restrain minor features can be highlighted. Second, the abstract image is quantified to imitate the coloring style of the cartoon. Third, FDOG filter is used to draw contour lines of the abstract image to further improve visualization. Last, the quantized image and the contour image are fused to produce an image with the cartoons. The result shows that cartoons generated by this algorithm have characters of art aesthetic and a better visualization.

This paper proposes an improved method based on LDA, which is named as KDA method in this paper because it gives different weights to different training samples according to K nearest neighbor idea in within-class scatter matrix calculation, and chooses K nearest classes among all to calculate the total center in between-class scatter matrix calculation. Considering the interference of outliers when sample size is small with high dimensional data, a new median discriminant algorithm (MDA) method is also proposed, which uses an improved median (not real median) to substitue the mean in center determination. Finally MDA and KDA are combined to form a MKDA method. The comparison among LDA, KDA, the new MDA and MKDA methods with ORL face database is given. Experimental results suggest MKDA performs best among the four and both KDA and MDA outperform LDA.

The proposed method has the ability to locate optimum through global-local search iterations which are carried out by a global exploration group and local exploitation groups which are not only multiple but also variant. In this paper, we study the unbiasedness property of MOA and prove that MOA provides an unbiased estimate of the optimal solution for identification problem on an AR model where the outputs are corrupted by noises. The comparison experiments on the identifications of AR model by (Finite Impulse Response) FIR filter shows that MOA is superior to recursive least squares (RLS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) in unbiasedness property.

Based on the precipitation and water discharge series data (1959-2008), and sediment load series data (1993-2008), the runoff and sediment discharge variation and its response to precipitation has been analyzed. The results shown that, during the study period of 1959-2008 at the Manan gauging station, annual runoff of Buyuan River has generally decreased, but not significant at the 95% confidence level. However, the decline trend of sediment load was obvious for gauged period from 1993 to 2008. The seasonal runoff distribution in the Buyuan River was uneven and demonstrated an observably "unimodal" distribution. Both water discharge and sediment load are largely derived from wet season (from Jun to Nov), especially in flood season from July to September. During the study period 1993-2008, both annual and monthly observed value of water discharge and sediment load had coincident changing processes. Double mass curves indicated decreasing precipitation was the main reason for runoff reduction in the Buyuan River Basin; declining rainfall and water discharge were two key factors for sediment load reduction. In 2002, however, sediment discharge undergone abrupt change due to huge peak discharge and two consecutive years strong precipitation in the Buyuan River Basin.

In order to better manage and control the software evolution process and make the best of existing software technology, the method to transform any EPM to its execution model based logic programming has been proposed. Completeness of conversion depends on completeness of the rules, that is, all the expressions of the original model are found the correspondence in the target model. Since transformation rules are proposed based on precondition or post-condition types of activities in anyone EPM, this need to prove that activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set. To this end, the precondition and post-condition of activities in EPM are classified based on analyzing all expressions in EPMs and the semantics of the activity execution. Type completeness set of activity's precondition and its post-condition is presented. Lastly we prove that the activity type set in anyone EPM is completeness set by mathematical induction.

In S-PCF, the center AP decides the sleeping time for every node so that it can synchronize the service with the nodes and maximize the sleeping time of each node to reduce the energy consumption coming from center AP's empty polling and the idle listening of the active nodes in PCF. The single direction transfer mode was introduced to simplify the data transmission for the data acquisition environment and the number of the data frame's subkinds was cut down so that the control can be lighten. Moreover, the transmission of the polling frame and data frame were also described in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that S-PCF can greatly save energy of idle nodes and extent the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes and the simulations also show that S-PCF can satisfy the system performance.

We developed an improved genetic approach for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), since it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem within reasonable computation time. A chromosome representation combines both routing and sequencing information is represented with genetic algorithms (GAs) commonly optimize the problem by minimizing an objective, makespan. Our algorithm selects the chromosome according to different objectives, and crossover each other to maintain the species diversity. New crossover and the mutation operators utilize the critical path with certain probability to modify assignment and sequence for preventing being trapped in a local optimum. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for the FJSP.

Long read latency of service experienced by the end-users, especially during the peak hours, continues to be the common problem to the popular web servers while retrieving popular objects. A replication and deletion algorithm is presented to solve object replication problem, which is a NP-hard problem and can be formulated as a 0-1 constraint optimization problem. The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server. During the adaptive time period due to different object update frequency, objects are dynamically duplicated and deleted in a distributed web server system with limited storage capacity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under present investigation Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce) has been tested for removal of two important heavy metals chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) from metal solution. This species was grown at four concentrations of Cr and Pb, i.e. 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/L, respectively in single metal solution. This aquatic macrophyte has successfully removed up to 80% of Cr and 93% of Pb after 10 days. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) value ranged between 299 and 1026 for Cr and between 1672 and 1852 for Pb, respectively. The amount of BCF in Pistia stratiotes showed that removal of Pb was higher than removal of Cr. The accumulation of heavy metals was more obvious in the roots as compared to leaves. These findings contribute to the application of aquatic macrophytes to lead and chromium removal from moderately contaminated waters.

A simple xanthate (PAX) is used as the sulphide collector and a chelating reagent of hydroxamate AM28 as the oxide collector. It is found and confirmed by mineralogical examination that AM28 successfully recovered all the discrete copper oxide minerals from the Yangla ore. The flotation tests show that the overall copper recovery is affected due to the minerals copper associated with goethite which is not amenable to flotation.

When the positive equilibrium is treated as a parameter, it can be attained more details for the model. The qualitative analysis of the model depending on all parameters indicates that the model exhibits complicated dynamical phenomena, such as subcritical, supercritical or high order Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that there exist different parameter values for which the model has one, two and three limit cycles, respectively. The model can have at most two limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation and we attain the complete results of Hopf bifurcation for the first time. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with other type functional response.

It is generally believed that queue service system based on periodic inquiry has many applications in communication system and computer network. As for queue service system based on periodic inquiry, the number of information group, service time for information group and shifting time at any time are variable. So, it is quite difficult to analyze related performance. In the study of asymmetric polling system Ref 1-6 give some precise resolution; however, as there exist some problems in analysis method, the obtained results are partial under certain qualifying conditions. On the basis of Ref. 7-9 the paper adopts the method of embedded Markov chains and probability generating function to resolve discrete-time and polling asymmetric double gated service system, deduce one-order and two-order characteristics of the system, calculates the average waiting delay of the system. The paper draws some useful conclusions by comparing simulation results on the basis of the running mechanism and theoretical calculations.

Under the protocol, all terminals use the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent to access the channel before sending information packets, and transmit packets immediately when the channel is idle, but when there are any collisions on the channel, the system will use isolated binary tree conflict-resolving technology to decompose the impacted packets. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the protocol and gets the computational formula of the throughput for the protocol by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method and compared with the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent. And finally, the paper gives the MATLAB simulation results. The results not only show that the correctness of the theoretical analysis and illustrates the validity of the protocol, but also gives some meaningful conclusions. Therefore, it is very necessary and important to integrate the binary tree conflict-resolving technology into the joint control protocol of p-detection and 1-persistent under high load, which can the successful probability and channel utilization.

Noticing that few researches focus on pre-processing of images, which will also improve the performance of feature extraction of PCA algorithm, we present an improved approach of PCA based face recognition algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In our method, FFT is presented as a method to combine amplitude spectrum of one image with phase spectrum of another image as a mixed image. PCA is applied to do feature extraction and a kernel SVM is harnessed as a classifier. To test and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are performed on Yale face database A. The experimental results show that our proposed method is encouraging.

First, the paper gives an outline of 1-persistent CSMA and the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm by building a mathematical model and using the average cycle method, and then respectively obtains the throughput and the number of time-slots of the protocol and the algorithm. The simulation results are given, and agree well with theoretical values. But, in a shared channel, each user independently sends information packets randomly, and it is prone to conflict and resulting in the failure. Especially to the 1-persistent CSMA control protocol, when the load is larger, it has a lower throughput and greatly increasing the probability of channel conflict. Therefore, bringing in the binary tree conflict-resolving algorithm is a good method to improve the throughput, especially the improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm. So at last, the paper introduces the random multiple access protocol combined improved binary tree conflict resolution algorithm and 1-persistent CSMA protocol, obtains the throughput and gives the simulations of the joint protocol. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that 1-persistent CSMA protocol with conflict-resolving has a better performance.

This paper analyzes the energy efficiency for UAWSN theoretically and then presents the simulation results for square and triangle topology structures with different network scale. All these researches show that the energy efficiency of UAWSN is greatly related to the topology structure. With the increase of the network scale (K) much energy is wasted on relays which results to the decrease of the energy efficiency. If the structure scale is fixed and unchanged the energy efficiency of square topology structure is higher than that of triangle.

A deep analysis of the relationship mechanism between institutionalized management and employee satisfaction will be of great value for hotel companies in seeking out effective measures to improve employee satisfaction. Starting from raising the level of institutionalized management of hotel enterprises, this paper constructs a theoretic model of the relationship among institutionalized management, management behavior, organizational culture and employee satisfaction. Based on the structural equation model, the empirical research indicates that institutionalized management in hotel companies has positive correlations with standardization of internal management behavior, construction of organizational culture and employee satisfaction. It also indicates that both standardization of management behavior and the construction of organizational culture have positive correlations with employee satisfaction. Consequently, hotel companies should strengthen institutionalized management so as to improve employee satisfaction and build competitive advantages.

These mass concrete structures craze not by external loads, the temperature variation caused by heat of hydration and the temperature stress caused by concrete shrinkage are the main causes for the leaks [1]. Therefore, the thermal stress and the temperature control have significant meaning in the mass concrete structures. Thermal cracks will break the structure globality and also decrease the durability of the structures during the construction time. In addition, the temperature variation will have a remarkable affection on the stresses variation of the structures during the service time [2].

Details are like this, in view of the fact that Ge contained in pulverized fuel ash is wrapped up by a lot of Silica, Cao, magnesium oxide and is difficult to react with hydrochloric acid, so, first, have the pulverized fuel ash grinded to 200 meshes; then, ammonium fluoride should be put into 85-90 degrees Cdilute sulphuric acid solution to produce hydrogen fluoride so as to destroy silicon dioxide and calcium oxide contained in the pulverized fuel ash. Meanwhile, dilute sulphuric acid solution dissolves magnesium oxide, by doing so, Ge will be released to react with sulfuric acid and produce Sulfuric acid Ge, and Ge will go into the solution; as for low state Ge (e.g,GeO,GeS) contained in the pulverized fuel ash which is difficult to be dissolved by sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate will be used as a kind of oxidant to change bivalence Ge into tetravalence Ge, then dissolve it into the solution, after the liquid-solid separation, sulfuric acid leaching solution rich in Ge will be obtained. Then, tannic acid will be used as precipitant to recover Ge from the leaching solution, and Ge concentrate will be produced through distillation and roasting. After this, put Ge concentrate on hydrochloric acid distillation to get germanium tetrachloride, After going through strenuous evaporation, distillation and hydrolysis, germanium dioxide with high purity will be yield. This paper has conducted conditional tests and discussion on the process parameters which will influence recovery Ge from pulverized fuel ash, including the dosage of Sulfuric acid, ammonium fluoride, sodium chlorate,tannic acid and extraction time to find out the prior controlling condition of Ge recovery, under this prior condition, Ge leaching rate is as high as 84%, and tannic sinking Ge rate is as high as 98%. The pulverized fuel ash, after recovering Ge, can be used to backfill the mine pit, besides, most of the lixivium after recovering Ge can be recycled, and the rest of it will be released after neutralized up to the standard by lime. This process enjoys the following quality: high Ge recovery rate, less time used during the process,less consumption of auxiliary material, easier to control the process, avoiding the potential pollution on the environment and lower cost involved in it, therefore, which is a kind of efficient and economic process of recovering Ge from pulverized fuel ash.

Photoluminescence (PL) and infrared absorption (IRA) techniques have been used to characterize these samples. The PL peak positions at 2.07 eV and 1.93 eV undergo redshifis with the increasing annealing temperature. The two IRA peaks at 1080 cm(-1) and 800 cm(-1) are ascribed to the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching and the Si-O bending vibration, respectively. The experimental results indicate that Si nanocrystals embedded in silicon oxide layer can be formed at the annealing temperature 800 degrees C or higher.

Moreover, ZnO films with the impurity energy level of 2.28 +/- 0.20 eV origin from the oxygen vacancy, had been found in the PL emission.

The energy conversion efficiency of p-i-n type QDSC may increase up to 45%. Both CdSe and CdS quantum dot can be used as the sensitizer of the QDSSC and each of them has its demerits and merits, but the conversion efficiency of QDSSC is low if they were used respectively. Thus, in order to overcome their demerits respectively, we could try to combine their merits. QDSC is the most promising technique to solve the problems of solar cell.

The hole mobility of NPB at different electric fields was obtained from the hole transit time (tau(dc)) which was extracted from the negative differential susceptance (Delta B) as a function of frequency. To eliminate the impact of the contact resistance on the mobility measurement, an equivalent circuit model has been introduced to calculate the capacitance and the conductance of the NPB layer. By fitting the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectroscopy using the equivalent circuit, the contact resistance can be extracted from the impedance measurements. It is found that the mobility at low electric field is lower than what was reported in literature after the consideration of the contact resistance. It is also found that the calculated hole mobility of the NPB layer follows the Poole-Frenkel's rule.

A tracked region can be described by the foreground hue histogram only calculating foreground object pixels, which can effectively restrain the disturbing of complex background environments. For measuring the object likelihood, we match the foreground hue histogram with that of the tracked object and refer the result of motion detection to encircle the tracked object region as much as possible. During the tracking, we update the hue histogram model for adapting the object appearance variation. The proposed algorithm is realized in the particle filter frame, and the experiments show that it is capable of robustly and accurately tracking a single non-rigid object for the situations of complex background scenes and strong appearance variations.

The model is then used to carry out the performance analysis of drainage consolidation of saturated soft soil. Using this model of FLAC3D numerical solution and analytic solution, the dissipation of pore water pressure and maximum amount of vertical settlement of soft soil are calculated. The coupling time in this calculation is 30s. Meanwhile, the results when coupling times are 5s, 10s, and 20s are also recorded. Through compare and contrast, we find that the degree of pore water pressure dissipation decreases as the radius of model increases and as the coupling time increases.

The results indicate that: (1) In accordance with Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (II), the content of Cd contained in the farmland soils has severely exceeded the standard in a large scale, followed by Pb and Zn. However, the content of As is maintained within the specified standard; (2)The SPI values of soils are in the following sequence: Cd>Zn>Pb > As. The pollution level caused by the heavy metal "Cd" to the farmland soils is extremely heavy in a wide range, and a majority of the farmlands are heavily polluted by Zn. The farmlands with moderate pollution by Pb are centered at Plot 2 in the deposit, and only a few farmland soils are moderately polluted by As at Plot 2 in the deposit;(3) Based on the NCPL the results indicate that the NCPI of the farmland soils has reached to the degree of heavy pollution; (4) It is indicated based on the RPI evaluation that the RPI values of As, Cd, Pb and Zn contained in the farmland soils have exceeded the standard in the following sequence: Pb>Zn>Cd>As, which illustrates that during the development of Jinding Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, the heavy metals imposing the most profound influence on the soil pollution are Pb and Zn. The heavy metal pollution in the farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River is not only caused by the development of Ending Lead-Zinc Deposit in Lanping County, but is also associated with its high soil background value;(5) There is a remarkable spatial variation of heavy metal pollution in farmland soils from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Bijiang River. Both the SPI and the NCPI values of heavy metals in the soils within the deposit at the upper reaches of the Bijiang River are the lowest; the pollution index of the soils closest to the deposit are the highest, and the pollution index of the soils with a certain distance from the deposit drops swiftly; the pollution index of Plot 4 rises to a certain degree at the middle reaches, and gradually ascends near the Yunlong County seat at Plot 5, however, with a comparatively small growth rates.

The results showed when microwave was introduced to enhance Fenton oxidation and coagulation process, the degradation efficiency of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater was significantly promoted, and treatment time and various dosages of flocculant, oxidant and catalyzer were also reduced obviously. The synergistic effect discussion of the combined system also indicated that microwave irradiation brought not only the thermal efficiency but also the non-thermal efficiency, which would accelerate to produce more hydroxyl radicals, and promote the molecular polarization of organic substances. The physical and chemical properties of refractory organic substances in dye wastewater could be changed, which would be helpful for the follow-up Fenton oxidation and coagulation process. These facts fully embodied that there existed synergetic effects in microwave irradiation-Fenton oxidation coupling coagulation process.

Then the three-dimensional seepage field of tailings dam under steady saturated state was simulated by finite element method (FEM). And the seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was simulated and predicted by numerical analysis method when the embankment is enduring the flood. Subsequently, the simulated seepage line of saturated - unsaturated seepage field in the tailings dam was verified by the survey result.

But this method can lead some problems for processing, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), data transmission and so on. Take advantage of ADCs' wide input bandwidth, we can also sample observation signals with wide bandwidth using comparatively low speed sampling rate. In this paper, we introduce the under-sampling technology, and then analyze some applications in radio astronomy. Finally, we introduce a new digital spectrometer based on this technology for solar radio observation whose core ADC is AD9430.

This paper extends the exploitation versus exploration construct to define a new typology of post-acceptance usage behaviors and defines ambidexterity as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage. This study examines the relation between exploitation and exploration in IS usage and how the two types of usages can jointly influence individual performance in the post-acceptance stage. Based on a sample of 215 employees, this study finds that exploitative usage and explorative usage have different effects on individual performance, and shows that the interaction between exploitative usage and explorative usage is positively related to individual performance.

For this reason, a priority based parallel round robin (PP-RR) algorithm is proposed, which is aim to provide differentiated service according to the communication traffic load. Furthermore, a mathematic analytic model is utilized for the performance evaluation of PP-RR algorithm. The closed form expression of mean waiting time is achieved.

The general idea of the proposed system is to extract fire-pixels by employing a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model based on chromatic measurement and dynamics analysis of flames. The judgment paradigm of fire-pixel is firstly realized by the color value checking and examining, after that, further analysis of the extracted fire-pixels is carried out by computing dynamics of growth and disorder of flames. By continually calculating on the growing ratio of flames for several iterations, a fire alarm is raised when the detection conditions are fulfilled. Finally, the proposed fire detection algorithm is successfully implemented on the embedded platform, and is fully optimized reaching real-time performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system is capable of detecting fire effectively and achieve automatic and robust security surveillance of fire accident with a low false-alarm rate in dynamic real-life environments.

Modeling and analyzing the relationships of behaviors among microblog users, and achieving the inherent categories or communities, are paid much attention in social network and big data paradigms. In this paper, we presented a graph-based model for describing the relationships of microblog users, in which the distributed storage and map/reduce programs were incorporated. Then, we proposed the map/reduce based algorithm for hierarchical categorization of microblog users based on the concepts of chordal subgraph and join tree in the graph theory.

Previous studies have not yet addressed the use of hypocrellins as non-surfactant template in the synthesis of photocatalyst CdS, let alone the achievement of higher efficient photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25. Herein Al doped CdS prepared by using hypocrellins as template (Al-CdS/Hys) can enhance the photocatalytic activity while Al doped CdS without template (Al-CdS) prepared by conventional solvothermal method reduced the photocatalytic activity. Al-CdS/Hys was synthesized and characterized by a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and TEM. Al-CdS/Hys is even more efficient than Degussa P25 for the degradation of organic dye, basic fuchsin under artificial solar irradiation. Moreover, doping Al increased the surface area of CdS to 169.1 m(2).g(-1). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some community detection algorithms based on the breadth first traversal usually use the largest node the largest as the initial node. And these algorithms determine a node belongs to which community according to the number of the edges from the node to the communities. And then in the high aggregated networks, the results of community detection are not appropriate. The algorithm in this paper extends the Hub algorithm. This algorithm puts forward the concept of the degree of triangular loop of nodes, and use it to find the center of community. In the process of community detecting, this algorithm defines the concept of the similarity coefficient. And based on the similarity coefficient, this algorithm determines which community the nodes belong to, as well as adjusts the results of community detecting. The experiment confirms that the algorithm in this paper can not only guarantee the feasibility but also improve the quality of community detecting.

The availability of bandwidths is dynamic variable during multimedia streams transmission, especially the availability of video streams. So, it can dynamic adjust the compression levels to each stream and distribute the resources of bandwidths to adapt the variations in resource availability. Using this strategy of dynamic QoS management make it becomes feasible to provide the best possible QoS to each stream.

However, the existing wireless sensor networks (WSN) or power line carrier communication (PLC) networks is not easy to resolve the issue due to the fading and interference properties of power distribution network environment. In this paper, we work out a model of WSN and PLC using RS-CRC (Reed-Solomon code and cyclic redundancy check code) encoding based on the idea of cooperative communication, in which the networks are independent in fading and interference.

Firstly, hernia lesions were obtained by detecting black targets in ultrasound images of the coronal plane. Secondly, the morphological method was used to remove false black targets. Thirdly, the volume of interest (VOI) was cropped from the original data set to define the lesions area. Finally, the volume of lesions was measured. Results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect abdominal incisional hernia lesions with automated 3D ultrasound images. It can also provide more diagnostic information by measuring the volume of lesions.

Firstly, the proper amplitude of added noise and number of ensemble average for noise cancellation are estimated, and then the mixed Doppler ultrasound signal is decomposed into IMFs by using EEMD method. Finally, the IMFs around the division between the blood flow and vessel wall signals are delicately separated using soft-threshold denoising method. Experiments on both computer simulated with WBSR of 20dB, 40dB and 70dB as well as real human carotid Doppler ultrasound signals are carried out to compare the proposed method with the high pass filter, the original empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the improved EMD delicate separation method. It is shown that method proposed in this paper provides the highest accuracy of extracting blood flow signals by elimination of the mode mixture, especially for those signals with larger wall-to-blood signal ratio.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.
