In this study, an inexpensive 3D electrode of Ni3S2@Ni foam was obtained through a hydrothermal condition using sodium sulfide as corrodent and Ni foam as both substrate and Ni source. The formation mechanism of this Ni3S2 layer was studied through a process analysis based on physical chemistry with assistant of the results from characterizations. The obtained Ni3S2@Ni foam was used as electrode to test its hydrazine electro-oxidation properties in terms of DHFCs and electrochemical sensor. It is found Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses the ability to electro-oxidize hydrazine and Ni3S2 layer leads to increased activity including lower onset potential and higher current. In the aspect of hydrazine electrochemical sensor, the fabricated Ni3S2 layer leads to increased sensitivity and dynamic response property. The results indicate that as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses a potential for practical application in hydrazine electro-oxidation, and Ni3S2 is a very promising substitute material for noble metals in hydrazine electro-oxidation. At the same time, with the characterization of the as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam electrode on structure, morphology and surface chemical states, the mechanism of the corrosion method as well as enhanced properties were investigated.

To address this problem, many representative works have been reported, including transductive SVM, universum SVM, co-training and graph-based methods. The prominent method is the patch alignment framework, which unifies the traditional spectral analysis methods. In this paper, we propose Hessian regression based on the patch alignment framework. In particular, we construct a Hessian using the patch alignment framework and apply it to regression problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on Hessian construction from the patch alignment viewpoint. Compared with the traditional Laplacian regularization, Hessian can better match the data and then leverage the performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct human face recognition experiments on a celebrity face dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution in human face classification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To infer the biogeographic history of the woodwardioid ferns, the phylogeny of Woodwardia was estimated using rbcL and rps4 sequences from divergent distribution regions including the Himalayas. Phylogenetic results support Woodwardia as a monophyletic group with Woodwardia areolatae and W virginica as basal, these two species from eastern North America diverged early, which are sister clades to the remaining species from America, Europe, and Asia. Based on analyses of the fossil records of these species for divergence times, Woodwardia species were estimated to have diverged initially in the Paleogene of North America. After its New World origin, a greater diversification and expansion of Woodwardia occurred in eastern Eurasia, with the European arrival of Woodwardia radicans during the Middle Miocene. Compared to earlier reports, a migration back into North America via the Bering land bridge is consistent with these data.

But most ontology construction methods are semiautomatic, and the construction process of ontology is still a tedious and painstaking task. The cognitive model of ontology learning is an automatic model of ontology construction that simulates the process of human being recognizing the world. Induction is an important step of the model. This paper presents a strategy for the ontology induction in the cognitive model of ontology learning, which includes some generalization principles and the corresponding induction operators. It generates induction hypothesis through a series of operations. As a result, induction hypothesis are generated from the present ontology and it can generalize the existing ontology.

Although there are many ontology learning methods to acquire ontology from structured or unstructured data, it is still difficult to exclude logic errors using reinforcement learning on ontology construction. Ontology extension is a key step when the new knowledge adds into the existing ontology in the process ontology learning. This proposal designs and validates the method of ontology extension based on the axiomatic cognitive model, which include the ontology extension postulates, axioms and operations of the learning model. Our approach aims at improving the efficiency and accuracy of the Ontology construction. It is proved that these operators subject to the established axiom system.

The results showed that the experts and farmers have broadly equal assessment on the importance of 12 different disaster preparedness behaviors. At the same time, the two models have a difference in some behaviors such as buying water, engaging in a variety of income-generating activities and purchasing water receivers. By identifying and comparing from the two models, the amounts of different types of disaster preparedness farmers were almost same. Moreover, the second types of two models were similar while the first and the third types were slightly different.

The basis to tackle this issue is user similarity measures. In this paper, we propose non-negative multiple matrix factorization with social similarity for recommender systems, considering the similarities between users, the relationships of users-resources and tags-resources. On this basis, we comparatively analyzed different performances of the recommendation with every similarity measure between users. In addition, our method can also recommend friends, resources, and tags to users. Experimental results on Lastfm and Delicious datasets show that the proposed method can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy compared with the art collaborative filtering methods.

This method can extract facial features under different resolutions and fuse facial features in various structures to enhance the information content of the features. Specifically, first, the image is decomposed into three kinds of resolutions with different scales to form the multi-resolution image sequences, with Gabor wavelets used to extract the facial features of each image. Second, PCA is applied to reduce the dimension of the obtained high dimensional features. Third, every two or three features of the multi-resolution images are fused in various structures after they are extracted in three different scales respectively. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method is utilized to train one of the most discriminative classifier after the features of dimensionality reduction are obtained. The experimental results based on the ORL facial database and YALE facial database showed that the proposed algorithm is highly effective and robust to treat the illumination and facial expression.

The traditional algorithms often use the reconstruction error operator based on principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate the weight for occluded face, which often need iterative computation and consequently high time complexity. Moreover there are many difficulties for noise problems and threshold selection in iteration. In order to overcome the shortcoming, this paper suggested a new research method of face recognition on the basis of error detection and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) algorithm under partial occlusion. First, face images were divided into several regions. Then, the weight of each area is calculated by a new logarithmic transformed Gaussian error operator instead of the traditional error operator. Finally, each region's features are extracted by KPCA, which is a nonlinear transformation and mapping method. All features are fused with their weights to realize the final classification and recognition. The experimental results with the AR facial database indicated that the new algorithm was of great robustness and validity.

With the rapid development of biological science and technology, a plenty of high dimensional biological data have generated, accompanied by certain noise. How to express high dimensional data in low dimension space and achieve better classification effect have become one of the significant tasks for researchers in the application of protein sub-cellular localization. Both the traditional dimension reduction algorithm of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the popular classifier of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) cannot meet the needs of the current application well if they are simply used without improvements. The aim of LDA is to seek out a projecting line at certain direction letting the projection of samples as far away as possible. However, noise jamming expands the within-class distance and makes the classes uneasily separated even by LDA. Besides, KNN has not taken samples' inequality into consideration primely. Therefore, this paper first uses the noise intensity as a kind of weight in LDA, then improves KNN algorithm by considering the inequality of samples from different classes with a within-class KNN method. Experimental results show that the proposed method by combining the above two improvements gets ideal feasibility and effectiveness in classification through the verification of Jackknife.

By using ISODC clustering search decision-making ability, the best threshold value is obtained. ISODC can solve the dilemma that PCNN needs to determine appropriate model parameters and circulation iterations. ISODC-PCNN makes use of the grey level of the image to cluster, and then uses the improved ISODATA to determine the initial number and the center of clustering which can be used as the optimal threshold value of PCNN. Therefore ISODC-PCNN can automatically segment an image with one time of iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the segmentation speed and achieves good segmentation results.

A pilot "machine-machine" system which consists of several sensor nodes and an application & service (A&S) center for monitoring and early warning to illegal broadcasting is implemented using Baidu map JavaScript API technology and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The sensor node is a RTL-SDR connected to an industrial computer. It mainly takes charge of illegal signal detection, early warning and monitoring data storing.

The main part of the device is a microstrip coupled complementary asymmetric double-split resonator (CADSR). In this device, an extremely sharp resonance have been obtained due to the excitation of "trapped modes". From the analysis, the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the frequency response and Q-Factor are thoroughly studied. Results show that there have an upward tendency of Q-Factor when increasing the degree of asymmetry, the distribution of the electric field and transmission response (S-21) have been also simulated in this work. Finally, the process and the performance is illustrated when CADSR is used as a sensor. We found that both dielectric constant and loss tangent of sample substance affect the resonance frequency. It is demonstrated that the reflection spectrum shift to lower frequency side when enhancing the permittivity of sample substance which is filled in groove. Furthermore, the CADSR will increase the contact area with field and sample, and the relation between resonant frequency and the sample permittivity exhibits a perfect linearity.

Most researches focus on the recognition based on one single modality sensor. In this paper, we present a novel approach for human action recognition, which is based on fusing triaxial acceleration signals and depth maps. We extract Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients from acceleration signals and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from Depth Motion Maps (DMM). After obtaining these two feature vectors, we concatenate them and adopt Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce the feature dimension. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed approach, we construct a multimodal dataset named SIAT Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Experimental results on our dataset SIAT ADL show that the proposed approach is more discriminative and robust than the single feature-based method.

But the character recognition study for the New Tai Lue has lagged behind. As a result, the digital processes of New Tai Lue have been in troubles. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a printed New Tai Lue character recognition method based on the Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network. Firstly, some image preprocessing including skew image correction, binarization are performed on the New Tai Lue images obtained by a scanner. Secondly, the character segmentation is carried out after the text line segmentation and the word segmentation processes. Thirdly, the feature vectors are built by using the local gray feature, the centroid coordinate and the original size of the image; Lastly, A BP neural network is trained with a training set contained 51740 samples. Then a test set contained 4917 samples is applied to test the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results show that 98.04% recognition rate has been obtained by the proposed method, which proved that this method is effective for the recognition of printed New Tai Lue characters.

An affine correction based algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can resist combined geometric attacks and keep a higher watermark embedding capacity. The SURF algorithm and the RANSAC algorithm are used to extract, match and select feature points from the attacked image and the original image. Then, the least square algorithm is used to estimate the affine matrix of the geometric attacks according to the relationship between the matched feature points. The attacks are corrected based on the estimated affine matrix. A fine correction step is included to improve the precision of the watermark detection. To resist the cropping attacks, the watermark information is encoded with LT-coding. The encoded watermark is embedded in the DWT-DCT composite domain of the image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has a high embedding capacity, but also is robust to many kinds of geometric attacks.

The batik cloth model consists of three layers: wax layer, warp layer and weft layer. Warp and weft layer interlace between the wax layers. Based on Fick's second law, the differential equation is used to describe diffusion process and is discretized. Equation is in consideration of diffusion, adsorption and supply, and uses parameters such as porosity, tortuosity and connection. The ellipse model is used for simulating rectangular weaves which will be blurred in HSV color space. Experiment shows that this framework can visualize batik cloth satisfactorily, and the method has less computation compared with Japanese tie dye simulation.

Represented by H.264, current video compression approaches can save the transmission bandwidth by reducing the intra-and inter-frame redundancy. However, the huge amount of video content redundancy (VCR) in the transmission is still existing. In this paper, we propose a novel Content-Slimming System (CSS) framework based on the convergence of Computing, Communication and Cache to avoid the transmission of VCRs. The main idea of CSS is to detect VCRs, generate VCR models and clip them from the original frames by Computing, then transmit the necessary video content and semantic difference description by Communication, finally reconstruct the full video based on the received video content, semantic difference description and VCR models stored by Cache. Moreover, we also investigate the Video Monitoring application based on the CSS framework (CSS-VM) in which the background of monitoring frames is modeled, detected and sheared to reduce the transmission bandwidth consumption. The simulation results show that the bandwidth consumption of CSS-VM can be reduced at least by half compared to H.264, while the video quality and visual experience of CSS-VM are even better.

In many cases, fuzzy boundary and unbalance are frequently appeared among biological data. The accuracy will be lower, if we make a prediction through traditional KNN and K-means clustering algorithm directly. Firstly, in order to make clear the unbalance, we propose the within-class thought to make sure that training samples in each class around the testing sample are selected and we introduce membership to tell which class the testing sample belongs to. Then, we bring in rough sets and membership to solve the fuzzy boundary. Particularly, we apply correlation coefficient in the rough sets to better reflect the relationship among data objects. The experimental results based on protein sub-cellular localization prediction show that the methods proposed newly better work than the traditional methods.

It is a challenging task since the feature spaces of 2D images and 3D poses are different. Therefore, a large number of labeled data is required for training, especially for popular frameworks such as deep learning. In this paper, we propose an HPR method with weak supervision. It is based on neural network and domain adaptation is introduced to enhance the trained model. To achieve domain adaptation, we propose low-rank alignment, which aligns the testing samples to the distribution of labeled samples. In this process, autoencoders are used to extract 2D image features and low- rank representation is used to describe this feature space. Therefore, the proposed method is named as Domain Adaptation with Low-Rank Alignment (DALA). In this way, we obtain a robust and non-linear mapping from 2D images to 3D poses. Experiments are conducted on two challenging benchmark datasets MSRA and ICVL. Both the results on a single dataset and across datasets show the outstanding performance of DALA.

The proposed Magneto-Electric antenna is composed of a fishtail-shaped electric dipole, a half-circular loop antenna that works as a magnetic dipole, a microstrip-to-coplanar stripline transition balun, a box-shaped reflector and the loading of T-shaped array of metamaterial elements on the dielectric substrate. A high gain can be realized by loading of T-shaped array of metamaterial elements and using a rectangular box-shaped reflector. Simulated results show that this antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 58.5%, ranging from 2.32 GHz to 4.24 GHz and a high gain about 8 dB. Moreover, radiation patterns with low back radiation, fixing broadside direction mainbeam, symmetrical E-and H-plane patterns and large front-to-back ratio are obtained over the whole operating band by using a rectangular box-shaped reflector. The good performances make the antenna suitable for the wireless communication systems.

One challenge in this field is that not so many lexical items as expected have been labeled with sentimental opinions, especially in Chinese. There are two ways of rating words: one is manual marking which costs lots of resources, energy and time; the other is machine marking which is efficient, convenient and time-saving. There are a few machine rating approaches such as linear regression, support vector regression and weighted graph method. This paper compares the three approaches of linear regression, vector regression and kernel models based on valence-arousal (VA) space in order to study an effective and accurate machine learning algorithm for increasing more Chinese affective words on the existing affective lexicon.

Interestingly, due to the particularity of the caSRR structure, it can be fabricated on a mental sheet without the substrate, which is named as Stereo-caSRR. A microwave sensor which consists of a rectangular waveguide loaded with the square stereo-caSRR is designed. Simulation results show that the square Stereo-caSRR possesses a much higher Q-factor compared with traditional planar caSRR since the influence of the lossy substance has been eliminated. The stereo-caSRR assisted microwave sensor has a good linearity since the electric field can be confined to the arm of the resonator which is quite sensitive to a small change dielectric environment.

In this research, the distribution of the electric field and transmission response (S-21) have been simulated. Besides, we also investigated the effect of the width between Dual-D on resonance characteristics. Furthermore, the process and the performance is illustrated when Dual-D CSR is used as a sensor. Simulation results show that the reflection spectrum moves to the lower frequency side with respect to a small change of sample permittivity, and the relation between resonant frequency and sample permittivity reveals a good linearity. Finally, theDual-D CSR can increase the interaction area between electric field and sample. This feature making the sensor very sensitivity to surrounding sample substances. In addition, the simplicity of such sensing structure enables its utilization in a wide frequency range by simply varying the geometric parameter of resonator. Such device have potential applications in dielectric sensing, especially for the detection of liquid.

Several common approaches, such as projection-based methods and stochastic methods, have been put forward to fulfill this task. However, most of existing methods cannot be directly applied to process the palm leaf manuscripts of Dai which the images have poor quality and include smudges, creases, stroke deformation and character touching. To solve this problem, an improved Viterbi algorithm based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed to find all possible segmentation paths firstly. And then, a path filtering method is used to detect the optimal paths for the segmented text blocks. The performance of the method is compared with relevant methods and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

An algorithm of Hybrid BBBC with the objective to minimize the makespan is presented to tackle the job-shop scheduling problem. The initial solutions to the typical NP-hard problem are generated according to different heuristic strategies in a combination way. Modified BB strategy is proposed by treating the obtained operations to generate the center of mass. And then all the operations are ordered by the positions of the operations obtained in BC phase. To enhance the exploitation ability, a local search strategy is proposed on basis of critical path to moving the operation sequence toward the promising solution. Finally, a set of benchmark instances is applied to test the performances of the HBBBC and to compare it with some existing methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed HBBBC algorithm is competitive and can be rapidly guided.

The FSN is a series of institutional arrangements to preserve financial stability. In the real FSN, it includes the central bank, deposit insurance institutions and their premium, commercial banks and their benefit rates, etc., and these parameters are interdependent and dynamic change. And thus, analysis and computing of the FSN is very challenging. Inspired by evolutionary game theory, in this paper, we first establish a network game model of the FSN to analyze the evolution of bank deposit insurance strategies, and further propose a method to measure the effectiveness of the FSN. Finally, we use computational experiments to simulate the operation of the FSN. In the experiments, an evolutionary computation method is employed to compute banks' decisions to reduce computing time. Experimental results show that our evolutionary approach is suitable for the FSN, and is able to provide suggestions of macro policy for regulators.

First, according to the characteristics of PCNN model, we encode DNA primary sequences using a simple coding method. Then we use PCNN model to extract the entropy sequence (ES) of the encoded DNA sequence; the ES expresses the features of the DNA sequences. At last, we calculate the similarity of the ES by Euclidean distance to get the similarity of DNA sequences. We take several sets of data to test our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective.

In order to avoid loss of Cherenkov signal resulting from the dead area between circular PMT tubes and invalid fringe of each PMT, the light concentrator used as front window of PMT is considered to improve detective efficiency. Basing on the edge-ray principle and features of WFCT, several light concentrators are designed and simulated with ZEMAX. The result shows that the hollow hexahedral compound parabolic concentrator (hex-CPC) has good performance in collecting light. Moreover, the samples of the hollow hexahedral CPC have been manufactured and tested.

Then proposed a new tasks scheduling model based on the original priority calculation method and the idea of redundant duplication of tasks. In the phase of tasks scheduling in the model, the execution results of all parent tasks of the subtask that being executing are considered. The costs of communication between task-sets has reduced by the method of redundant duplication of tasks, so that the execution time of some subtasks share be advanced, and the entire execution efficiency of task-sets can be increased.

The cases with six different wall oscillation frequencies and four different stenosis degrees are investigated. The results show that the motion of vessel wall has effect on CFM images, and the generated CFM images will reflect the motion of vessel wall. Thus, this simulation model can be used as a tool to assess the interaction between the vessel wall and blood flow motion, and to evaluate ultrasound signal processing and visualization techniques.

Firstly, a two-way relay communication system model consisting of the source and relay nodes using 2/4-QAM hierarchical modulation is constructed. Secondly, the Physical layer Network Coding (PNC) demodulation and mapping rules at the relay node is presented, the formula for calculating the end-to-end Bit Error Rate (BER) under the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is derived as well. Finally, the simulation results are presented which verify the theoretical analysis results.

Locally adaptive regression kernels (LARK), which is a method for rapid detection and localization of specific targets, is a kind of image analysis method without training, and can be used to search for specific target images quickly. It operates using a single example of an object as a query image to find similar matching in a target image. Firstly, features are preliminarily extracted from the query image using the local steering kernels as descriptors, and then salient features are further extracted using locality preserving projection (LPP). And then the comparison between the target image and the query image is done using the cosine similarity criterion to find all possible similar objects. Finally, the non-maxima suppression method is used to preserve the most similar objects, so as to achieve the detection and localization of the specific target. In this paper, we choose the different images with different angles and different scaling to carry out the experiments. The experimental results show that this algorithm is a good method for object detection and localization.

Then the classical Niblack's method is used to binarize image. But there are many noises on the result images obtained by the Niblack's method, so a morphology based method is applied to remove noise. Finally, a connected domain based method is described to delete superfluous lines. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, face recognition is still a difficult task since face images are easily confused by changes of the conditions, such as illumination, the different expression, or glasses. The goal of this paper is to address the problem when there are affected images in the dataset. Based on the Cauchy estimator theory and patch alignment framework (PAF), we proposed a dimensional reduction algorithm termed Cauchy estimator discriminant analysis (CEDA) for face recognition. CEDA not only preserves geometry structure of the input samples but also decrease the errors caused by confused samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on the UNHST dataset and demonstrated robustness and effectiveness of the proposed CEDA.

This novel microstrip line is no longer suffering from the issues of radiation losses, surface waves, or cavity resonances that exist in the standard microstrip line without or with a metallic shielding box. Instead of the packaging way based on the standard air gap waveguide technology, this novel packaged microstrip line has the following merits: greatly reduced weight and size, easy manufacturing, constant gap height and more flexibility in design. We present how to adopt a proper dielectric substrate for each layer of the packaged microstrip line considering both stopband and line losses, and how to design the line width for a given characteristic impedance. One prototype of this proposed novel packaged microstrip lines is fabricated and tested, showing a good agreement with the simulated results.

Two species, Coreana raphaelis and Artogeia melete, were excluded due to the extreme nucleotide composition bias. According to conserved (C) / variable (V) sites ratio test, we combined 8 mtDNA protein coding genes (PCGs) of 13 species into a single data set for use in determining phylogeny. The same gene regions of Pyrocoelia rufa and Drosophila yakuba were used as outgroup. Accorded with all previous morphological and molecular evidence, the monophyly of Lepidoptera was strongly recovered in our ML result based on these coding genes. Superfamilies and families are recovered, but not always strongly. Our data set of the concatenated 8 protein coding sequences led to a likelihood tree by following relationships: (Tortricidea + (Pyraloidea + (Noctuoidae + (Geometroidea + Bombycoidea)))). This result agreed with Minet (1991) based solely on morphological information and with Powell et al. (1998) based on larval feeding habits.

Particularly, affected by the natural environment, cable phase error is produced, thus the traditional measurement method that depends on different environmental experience value to correct phase error is complex and inaccurate. According to the principle of low frequency antenna array phase measurement, this paper suggests a better method, which uses AD8302 to transfer the two calibration source signal phase difference of the receiver and transfer feeder to the corresponding direct voltage, then realizes single channel AD sampling with 12 bits quantization accuracy, finally does the error analysis and correction to achieve phase error correction. Through testing the precision of phase error of the cable given by the system under measuring conditions of low frequency (2MHz), high frequency (300MHz), etc. we can prove the system has a very high reliability, thus could be widely used in related antenna array error correction and cable error measurement.

With the increasing number of registered users in this kind of sites, finding relevant and reliable sources of information becomes essential. For recommending sufficient information for a user, it is important to extract automatically user's interest with accuracy and to collect new information which interests and attracts the user. To address this problem, we propose a social matrix tri-factorization model with two auxiliary matrices to improve the accuracy of recommendation in microblog. We construct two matrices on the users and items respectively, to exploit the user's demographic information and item's genre information which play an important role in microblog recommendation system. Experimental results show that our method achieves a higher performance and provide more effective results than the state-of-art methods especially when recommending informations. We also show that out model captures user interests more precisely and gives better recommendation interpretability.

Many of the known peak-picking methods for AMDF/ACF based PDAs expect to search the sole peak located at pitch period. However, it is a fact that correct pitch information is also contained in the peaks located at positive integer multiple of pitch period, whose existence are strong evidence of the validity of detected pitch as well. The proposed peak-picking method uses clustering analysis searching these peaks as many as possible. A necessary condition and some constraints are used to select the optimal cluster produced by clustering analysis. The proposed method shows a very good adaptability and noise-robustness. 5 improved AMDFs are employed to evaluate performance of proposed peak-picking method. Gauss white noise is added into speech for anti-noise tests. Experiments indicate slight improvements in low-noise environments and clear improvements in high-noise environments compared with the reference PDAs.

However, modern signal processing system has to adopt means of integrated optics for coping with increasing challenges. However, integrated optical components composed of traditional dielectric have fundamental difficulties in the aspects of miniaturization and high density because of diffraction limit. In the paper, surface plasmon, surface plasmon polaritons and surface plasmon optical waveguide concepts are discussed. On the basis, the array of processing square lattice and square medium hole slot on metal surface is designed, and direction propagation of optical waves on the structure surface is controlled through changing width and depth of square lattice, distribution of dielectric permittivity epsilon and wave source width. Research in the paper lays foundation for realization of all-optical loop.

Meanwhile, because of the increasing size of data index and its dynamic characteristics, the previous ways, which rebuilding the index or fully backup the index before the data has changed, cannot satisfy the need of today's big data index. To solve these problems, we propose a double-layer index structure that overcomes the throughput limitation of single point server. Then, a clone based B+ tree structure is proposed to achieve high performance and adapt dynamic environment. The experimental results show that our clone-based solution has high efficiency.

Moreover along with the rapid development of modern information, communication business also will be increase. However, the access and adaptive of previous CSMA protocol are insufficient. According to these properties, this paper presents a kind of adaptive dual clock with monitoring function P-CSMA random multiple access protocol(ADNP-CSMA), and discusses two kinds of P-CSMA. ACK with monitoring function is introduced to maintain the stability of the whole system, and the introduction of dual clock mechanism reduces the channel of idle period. It calculate the system throughput expression through the method of average period, and the simulation results show that the system is constant in the case of high load throughput.

The proposed algorithm uses the Bayesian wavelet de-noised image as the male parent, and the Wiener filtering image as the female parent, the picked individual was prepared for the crossover and mutation operations. The optimal offspring will be choosing as the final solution algorithm and the decoding reduction as the de-noised image. The peak signal to noise ratio of the algorithm is much higher than that of the traditional algorithm, and the visual effect is better. The experimental results show that this method can not only eliminate the image noise effectively, but also can preserve the image edges and other details.

In this paper, we adopt a latent variable to describe user preference and Bayesian network (BN) with a latent variable as the framework for representing the relationships among the observed and the latent variables, and define user preference BN (abbreviated as UPBN). To construct UPBN effectively, we first give the property and initial structure constraint that enable conditional probability distributions (CPDs) related to the latent variable to fit the given data set by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, we give the EM-based algorithm for constraint-based maximum likelihood estimation of parameters to learn UPBN's CPDs from the incomplete data w.r.t. the latent variable. Following, we give the algorithm to learn the UPBN's graphical structure by applying the structural EM (SEM) algorithm and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Services ranking mechanism is an important service for e-commerce that facilitates consumers' decision-making process. Traditional services ranking methods ignore the fact that customers cannot rate services under the same criteria, which leads to the ratings are actually incomparable. In this paper, we propose to exploit the ordinal preferences rather than cardinal ratings to rank online services. Ordinal preferences are elicited from filled ratings so that the intensity of ratings is ignored. We construct a directed graph to depict the set of pairwise preferences between services. Then, the strongest paths of the directed graph are identified and the evaluation values of services are calculated based on the strongest paths. We prove our method satisfies some important conditions that a reasonable services ranking method should satisfy. Experiments using real data of movie ratings demonstrate that the proposed method is advantageous over previous methods, and so the proposed method can rank services effectively even the ratings are given by customers with inconsistent criteria. In addition, the experiments also verify that it is more difficult to manipulate the ranking result of our method than existing methods.

Different users cannot rate services under the same criteria due to the scale and dynamism of these systems. Thus, aggregating cardinal ratings into reputation will potentially lead to unreliable and misleading result, which makes reputation systems necessarily consider the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons. In this paper, we exploit the ordinal user preferences between services to compute reputation of services. A distance metric is defined to measure the discrepancy between two rating vectors and the reputation computation problem was formalized as an optimization problem. Then, genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem to find a reputation vector that minimizes the total number of disagreements with the rating matrix. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study and performance analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

The difference of Yunnan Out-of-Print woodcut printing from ordinary printing is that carving alternates with printing in cycles to produce multi-color printings, and all colors are printed just out of one block which is recarved for each color. This is a complex process and requires high technical skills. We propose an image stylization method for Yunnan out-of-print woodcut through virtual carving and printing. First, image segmentation is applied to isolate areas for carving. In each segmented region, scores collected from real woodcut are placed to simulate the carving process. We introduce an algorithm to automate the placement according to the image feature. In the printing process, we mainly focus on the simulation of the mixture of oil paint and the special effect of random color blending in Yunnan out-of-print woodcut.

Through its social service, the Witkey model meets the transactional demands of suppliers and demanders for knowledge, original ideas, and personalized items. However, Witkey generally serves the ordinary customer and is not strong in supporting specific user segments. Campus Witkey networks, on the other hand, are customized online platforms specifically designed for enrolled college students. It is a typical application of the O2O operational model. This thesis constitutes an exposition of the operational and technical model of campus Witkey networks from the theoretical and technological perspective of social commerce. It is also a theoretical extension of the social commerce theory and the strengthening of the important role of social networks in meeting individual needs of people. In this thesis, Spring MVC and Hibernate JavaEE are utilized to construct the platform.

A new method based on changes in ultrasonic properties of stem was used to monitor stem water content in this paper, because the propagation of ultrasonic pulse echo signal and its attenuation characteristics in the material are closely related to the structure of the material. Ultrasound propagation echo signal was measured with an ultrasonic emission analysis system in the plant stem. The study showed that the increase of stem water content in the Populus simonii stem could cause the average amplitude, the root mean square (RMS) and the peak of value of the ultrasonic echo signal decreased obviously. The analysis of ultrasonic properties provides a new method for the detection of stem water content of trees and may be used to monitor plant water balance.

This paper develops an interactive system for Mining and Visualizing Urban Co-locations (MVUC) from the Point Of Interest (POI) datasets of cities. According to user-specified thresholds, MVUC efficiently mines maximal patterns based on instance-trees. Then MVUC concisely demonstrates the table-instances of patterns on map based on the convex hull algorithm, intuitively illustrates areas in which the consequents' instances of rules possibly appear on map based on the intersection of areas, and visually figures patterns by graph. MVUC also allows users to compare co-locations in different regions. MVUC can help users with analyzing the functional regions of cities, selecting the locations for public services, and other urban computing.

Thus, the associated products can be promoted at the same time, which implies cooperative influence spread of products in viral marketing. In this paper, we focus on maximizing the cooperative influence spread of associated products in a social network. First, we make use of a similarity model, abbreviated as SM, to generate the probabilities of edges. Then, we obtain the cooperative influence spread graph based on single influence spread graphs of these two products and the associated rule. Further, we propose independent cascade model with accepted probability (ICMAP) to describe the cooperative influence spread in a social network, and give an improved greedy algorithm to maximize the cooperative influence spread approximately. Experimental results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

However, the main problem of PTS algorithm is how to reduce computing complexity when searching the optimum phase. In this case, this paper brought about the Adaptive Partial Transmission Sequence (APTS) algorithm to reduce computing complexity.

Most existing co-location pattern mining methods mainly focus on whether spatial feature instances are frequently located together. However, that the occurrence of neighbor relationships is in the whole space or local area is not considered. In this paper, a new measurement using an evenness coefficient of the feature distribution is introduced, and a novel algorithm for co-location pattern mining is proposed, which takes into account the prevalence of the spatial feature and the spatial distribution characteristics of feature instances. Furthermore, some key techniques are presented, including region partition and count of row instances in this algorithm. The experimental evaluation with both synthetic data sets and a real world data set shows that the algorithm can discover prevalent and evenly distributional co-location patterns, and the number of the result set is effectively reduced compare to the traditional mined results.

It is difficult to discover co-location patterns because of the huge amount of space data. A common framework for mining spatial co-location patterns employs a level-wised search method to discover co-location patterns, and generates numerous redundant patterns which need huge cost of space storage and time consumption. Longer size patterns may have more interesting information for users, which causes the requirement for mining longer size patterns preferentially. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to discover compact co-location patterns called top-k-size maximal co-location patterns by introducing a new data structure-MCP-tree, where k is a desired number of distinct sizes of mined co-location patterns. Our algorithm doesn't need to generate all candidate co-locations and it only checks partial candidates to mine top-k-size maximal co-location patterns, so it needs less space and costs less time. The experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient.

Spatial co-location mining has been a research hot in recent years. But the research on causal rule discovery hidden in spatial co-locations has not been reported. Maybe the features in a co-location accidentally share the similar environment, and maybe they are competitively living in the same environment, they themselves have no causal relationships. So mining causal rules in amount of prevalent co-locations is more interesting. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to mine causal rules from prevalent co-locations based on dynamic spatial databases. Because of large collections of prevalent co-locations and amount of rules in one co-location, the computational cost for the discovery is high, thus the pruning strategies are presented to solve the problem in an acceptable period of time. The extensive experiments evaluate the proposed algorithms with "real + synthetic" data sets and the results show that causal rules are just about 60% of co-location rules, and which are more powerful.(1)	[Lu, Junli; Wang, Lizhen; Fang, Yuan] Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kunming, Peoples R China	Wang, LZ (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kunming, Peoples R China.	ljl1982_3_6@126.com; lzhwang2005@126.com; fy1990825@163.com						15	1	1	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2326-2338		978-1-5090-0690-8	INT CONF COMP INFO			2016							103	108					6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BG1NS	WOS:000386924100036					2019-12-05

In the past researches, many spatial co-location pattern mining algorithms and the expansions about these algorithms have been proposed. However, some of these methods often produce a large number of patterns which are difficult to use. If we want to use the subset of the prevalent co-location pattern set to summarize the whole set and as the increase of the number of patterns in subset, the patterns in subset always are the best summary for the original prevalent set. This is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we consider the problem of ordering a prevalent co-location pattern set so that each prefix of the ordering gives as good a summary of the set as possible. And according to the features of spatial data, we define an estimation of participation index function and a prevalent co-location pattern loss function to formulate this problem and design a greedy algorithm which gives an approximation quality.

Most current resource allocation models did not take into account the indivisible demands, the heterogeneity servers, and the situations multi-server. Dominant resource fairness allocation in heterogeneous systems (DRFH) is a fair and efficient resource allocation mechanism. But solving the DRFH problem is NP-hard. There are significant gaps between solutions obtained by existing heuristic algorithms and optimal solutions. They cannot effectively use server resources, resulting in a waste of resources of servers. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete interior search algorithm (DISA) to solve indivisible demands in heterogeneous servers, with a specific repair operator and task-fit value. Experimental results demonstrate that DISA can well adapt to dynamic changes in user resource request type, obtain the near-optimal solutions, maximize the value of minimum global dominant share and resource utilization.

The terahertz sensing characters are confirmed by the detection of samples such as nitrogen, gasoline, liquid paraffin, oil, glycerol, oil paint and water. It is found that with the increase of the liquid relative dielectric permittivity, the resonant frequency always shifts to the decreasing direction.

To elucidate the physiological mechanism of resistance induced by MeJA, the contents of superoxide anion free radical and MDA, and different pigments (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid) were measured. Also, the activities of pathogen-resistance related Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) and anti-oxygen enzymes Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO), Peroxidase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) were analyzed. The results showed that MeJA can effectively inhibit the growth rate of seedlings, increase the contents of chlorophyll a and b, decrease the MDA level, and promote the activities of enzyme PAL and anti-oxygen enzymes POX, POD and CAT. Thus, MeJA can induce the system resistance of potato to common scab and could be used as anti-pathogenic agent for potato common scab control.

This study was conducted to determine whether the application of sodium turpentine fungicides (STF) is an economically optimal management strategy. In a pilot experiment, three concentration gradients of STF were used and the amount of solution was 1.05t/ha for each gradient sprayed on tea tree to control mosses and lichens in the field, the area was 360 m(2) and was divided 9 plots (40 m2 for each plot). Then the STF concentration that had moderate control effect was applied for expansion tests, 5.9ha tea plantations were sprayed STF, and the mosses and lichens were investigated of 600 m2 among them. The results showed that the effects of fungicide treatment on tea tree varieties with differing doses levels were investigated. When the STF concentrations were 1.143%, 0.857%, 0.714%, the controlling effects were 98.72%, 91.83% and 83.61% respectively. STF applied by spray method is a good measure in controlling mosses and lichens in tea plantations. Using the concentration of STF 0.857% to conduct field expanding test resulted in a 0.9ton/ha yield increment and kept a 2834.7 +/- 1183.0 yuan/ha growth in economic incomes. Moreover, tea leaves and buds were not affected at all and tea trees were able to maintain normal growth and development. The control of mosses and lichens of tee trees could ensure a significant increase in regional tea production.

However, the huge number of the co-location mining results limit the usability of co-location patterns. Furthermore, users hardly identify and understand the interesting knowledge directly from the single co-location pattern. In this paper, we studied the problem of extracting combined co-location patterns from a large collection of prevalent co-location patterns. We first gave the definitions of atomic co-location pattern, combined co-location pattern pair and cluster; secondly, we designed a series of interesting metrics to measure the interestingness of atomic co-location patterns, combined co-location pattern pairs and clusters; thirdly, an combined co-location mining algorithm and redundant elimination strategies were proposed. The experiments evaluated the method both on real data sets and syntheticdata sets. The results show that our method can effectively discover combined co-location patterns.

Discovering co-locations has many useful applications. For example, co-located plant species discovered from plant distribution datasets can contribute to the analysis of plant geography, phytosociology studies, and plant protection recommendations. This paper focuses on incremental mining of co-locations. Because of the speed of updated data and the difficulty of incremental mining of co-locations, incremental mining of co-locations should be given more attention. In this paper, a novel method of incremental mining is proposed, which begins with maximal prevalent co-locations in old database, to search the dividing line that partitions the prevalent and non-prevalent co-locations in updated database. For a co-location candidate, the new measure, updated participation ratio (index), is used to evaluate its prevalence in the updated database. This can be easily done by using the old co-location instances, querying the disappeared co-location instances, and generating the added co-location instances. Next, a pruning strategy can prune part of co-locations for improving the efficiency. At last, the experiments evaluate the efficiency of proposed methods.

To validate our methods, a large-scale QoS-specific dataset which consists of invocation records from 339 service users on 5,825 web services on a world-scale distributed network is used.

In the experiment of 3D ultrasound reconstruction for spine of people, the result using volume reconstruction was unsatisfactory because of the ultrasound images' characteristic. So, we brought forward a method which was based on contour line to reconstruct 3D surface of spine. In this paper, we collected spinal ultrasound images using 3D freehand ultrasound firstly; next, tracing spinal contour line of each ultrasound images manually; finally, we used these contour lines to reconstruct spinal surface. The result showed that spinal surface reconstruction based on 2D contour line was close to real spinal surface, it could give physicians a better help in diagnosis of the spine.

In spatial high utility co-location mining, we should consider the utility as a measure of interests, by considering the different value of individual instance that belongs to different feature. This paper presents a problem of updating high utility co-locations on evolving spatial databases which are updated with fresh data at some areas. Updating spatial patterns is a complicated process in that fresh data increase the new neighbor relationships. The increasing of neighbors can affect the result of high utility co-location mining. This paper proposes an algorithm for efficiently updating high utility co-locations and evaluates the algorithm by experiments.

Under the framework of a two-stage design, it has been shown that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analysis. Several robust tests have been proposed for joint analysis to handle the problem of unknown genetic mode of inheritance. However, existing joint analysis of combining test statistics from both stages might suffer from a loss of efficiency if the combined test statistics are not sufficient or the weight of the statistic for each stage is not appropriate. In this article, we propose a new strategy for joint analysis by combining the raw data rather than the test statistics across stages and construct a robust MAX3-based test for two-staged GWASs, which can make full use of the information of the data from both stages. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure is more powerful and computationally much faster than the existing joint analysis procedures. An application to a type 2 diabetes dataset is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

We have developed a radiative transfer framework - Pandora - that employs RADMC-3D (Dullemond 2012) for a self-consistent determination of the dust temperature. With this pipeline, we have set-up a single model that consistently reproduces the thermal dust and free free continuum emission of Sgr B2 spanning four orders of magnitude in spatial scales (0.02-45 pc) and two orders of magnitude in frequency (20-4000 GHz).

We have selected the nearby, filamentary, high-mass star forming complex NGC 6334 to study the gas velocity at different scales and probe the infall rates onto the protostellar cores embedded in the NGC 6334-I and I(N) clusters. This study makes use of single-dish and interferometric submillimeter observations, complemented with 3D numerical non-LTE radiative transfer modeling. We measure a mass accretion rate of 10(-5) M-circle dot yr(-1) throughout the filament increasing up to 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1) towards the densest regions where high-mass stars are forming. At smaller scales, our 3D model is consistent with accretion rates of 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1) towards the clusters, and 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1) onto the protostars.

A mass balance method was used to calculate P balance of both Yangzonghai lake watershed and the lake itself in one year. The imported P load was 725.1 t in 2010, while the exported P load was 317.3 t, which indicated that 56.2 % (407.8 t yr(-1)) of P was retained in the lake watershed. Such a high retention load implied that the lake, which was mesotrophic, was under great pressure of further eutrophication. Among all the input pathways, the largest P input contributor was fertilizer, contributing 679.0 t P and accounting for 93.6 % of input P, followed by atmospheric deposition (44.7 t P, 6.2 %).

The recommender system can be featured as an online web application which is capable of generating a personalized list of preference attractions for tourists. Traditional technologies of classical recommender system application domains, such as collaborative filtering, content - based filtering and content-based filtering are effectively adopted in the framework. In the framework they are constructed as Agents that can generate recommendations respectively.

In developing country, it is very important to provide an equitable system of public facilities for all residents regardless of their socioeconomic status. This paper presents a framework for measuring residential-level data of education facilities with the assistance of geographical information systems. The framework is applied to evaluate objective spatial equity regarding the accessibility and residential strata to education facilities in the city of Chongqing in China. Availability of residential-level data was found to be essential for identifying differential accessibility of social groups according to residential characteristics as well as evaluating the accessibility based on statistical data at the administrative district level. The final results could be an important guide for the placement and management of public services.

This is a difficult problem due to the complexity and subtlety of human facial expressions, but the technique is needed in important applications such as social interaction research. Deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks including face recognition and person re-identification. Here we present a deep learning method termed Deep Neural Networks with Relativity Learning (DNNRL), which directly learns a mapping from original images to a Euclidean space, where relative distances correspond to a measure of facial expression similarity. DNNRL updates the model parameters according to sample importance. This strategy results in an adjustable and robust model. Experiments on two representative facial expression datasets (FER-2013 and SFEW 2.0) are performed to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of DNNRL.

Index system for evaluating operating performance of insurance companies is made up of four parts: 1) Profitability, 2) Solvency, 3) Capital adequacy and 4) Management ability. Main idea of this paper is to introduce DEA model in the proposed problem, and the DEA model is designed to compute efficiency scores of Decision Making Units to make up a weighted sum of either several inputs or several outputs without requiring the priori information. As the performance of the DEA model highly depends on input and output variables selection, we proposed an improved two stages DEA model to evaluate operating performance of insurance companies.

For different frequencies, the proposed transmitter can simultaneously employ 1-bit Low-pass and Band-pass delta-sigma modulators structures, or employ hybrid structures. Carrier frequencies are equal to oversampling frequencies of modulators. Besides, signals on two carriers are not interfered with each other to ensure transmission dual-band signal. Performance analysis is simulated by using Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results achieve high signal-to-noise radio and show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

Besides the gray target image, the user doesn't need to provide a reference color image nor manual guidance. First we train the convolutional neural network using residual connections based on the VGG-16 model. For colorization, a grayscale image is forwarded through the network and using the highest layer infers some color information, then it up-scales the color guess and adds in information from the next highest layer. Experimental results and user study on a large set of images demonstrate that our colorization method is competitive with previous state-of-the-art methods.

Camera array based synthetic aperture photography has been regarded as a promising way to address the problem of occluded object imaging. However, the application of this technique is limited by the building cost and the immobility of the camera array system. In order to build a more practical synthetic aperture photography system, in this paper, a novel multiple moving camera based collaborative synthetic aperture photography is proposed. The main characteristics of our work include: (1) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first multiple moving camera based collaborative synthetic aperture photography system; (2) by building a sparse 3D map of the occluded scene using one camera, the information from the subsequent cameras can be incrementally utilized to estimate the warping induced by the focal plane; (3) the compatibility of different types of cameras, such as the hand-held action cameras or the quadrotor on-board cameras, shows the generality of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the see-through-occlusion performance of the proposed approach in different scenarios.

The innovation of software technology, the increase of software scale and the shortened developing period make the traditional manual testing meeting enormous challenges, while the development of automated testing technology has promoted the progress of the software testing industry. Because of the particularity of financial and banking services, the bank is under an obligation to ensure the quality and reliability of software. Therefore it's vital to test the software. In specific practice, although the powerful third-party testing tools can be used as a solution, it is hard to rely on certain tool to implement automated testing, hence a framework of automated test is required to be introduced for testing, which intends to handle high efficiency and high-quality testing for software automation. This paper proposes a kind of software automation testing framework based on QTP, mainly targeting on the core of the bank, credit, online banking to test the function of the three major operations. The framework is a secondary development based on QTP and mainly for regression testing of software, which integrates techniques including object recognition, data driven, and keyword-driven technology, checkpoint technology, to proceed business-level testing. The paper expatiated on four issues, which were the test system design, the test standardization, the testing framework design and the testing of the implementation. The practical application shows that the framework can improve the operational efficiency, reduce the test cost, and guarantee the smooth progress of the software automation testing.

Most background subtraction methods rely on color and texture feature. However, due to illuminations changes in different scenes and affections of noise pixels, those methods often resulted in high false positives in a complex environment. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive background subtraction model which uses a novel Local SVD Binary Pattern (named LSBP) feature instead of simply depending on color intensity. This feature can describe the potential structure of the local regions in a given image, thus, it can enhance the robustness to illumination variation, noise, and shadows. We use a sample consensus model which is well suited for our LSBP feature. Experimental results on CDnet 2012 dataset demonstrate that our background subtraction method using LSBP feature is more effective than many state-of-the-art methods.

As a crucial part of shared-state scheduling architecture, optimistic concurrency control (OCC) algorithm has been studied by database community for a long time. However, few studies aim at making it more suitable for shared-state scheduling environment. In this paper, we propose an extended fine-grained conflict detection method for shared-state scheduling architecture. This method extends the original validation criteria of fine-grained conflict detection method and make it can detect complicated concurrent conflicts under high concurrency of scheduling transactions. We report experiments done on a public simulator by using Google production traces of data-processing workloads. These experiments demonstrate that the extended fine-grained conflict detection method obviously reduces the number of harmful conflicts and it has not led to the efficiency decrease of schedulers.

Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods proposed in previous studies.

This paper presents a polling MAC protocol implementation as well as a performance analysis for an emergency communication networking scheme based on wireless radio stations. We consider the different conditions for the specific type of station and propose the related MAC protocol for data transmission.
