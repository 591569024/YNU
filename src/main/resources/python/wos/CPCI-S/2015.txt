It is therefore vitally important to better understand the behavior of Earth's climate system on regional scale and advance the knowledge of regional responses to global climate. With their ability to represent meso-scale forcings, such as coastline, complex topography, anthropogenic aerosols and land cover/use changes, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are developed and used worldwide to investigate the effects of the above-mentioned meso-scale forcings on the local circulations that regulate the regional distribution of climatic variables. Considering the complexity of Asian Monsoon system, which is not only a physical process but also modulated by the interaction among physical, biological, chemical and social processes, a modeling framework Regional Integrated Environmental Modeling System (RIEMS) was proposed, developed and well tested before it was widely used in regional climate studies in the East Asia monsoon region.

However, the microbial physiology and community structure can be influenced by environmental conditions. In this study, four pilot-scale integrated vertical-flow constructed wetlands (IVCWs) were employed to treat domestic and nitrified wastewaters. The microbial properties, along with their response to wastewater quality characteristics and seasonal variation, were determined. The results showed higher Shannon-Weiner diversity (H) and evenness (E) index of fatty acids (FAs), and relative abundances of signature FAs in down-flow cells and in the systems fed with domestic wastewater (DW). The relative abundances of fungi and gram-negative and aerobic bacteria were greater in up-flow cells. The dominant anaerobic bacteria found in most cells might be accounted for the prevailing anaerobic environment within the wetland beds, which could mean that the system fed with nitrified wastewater (NW) should perform better in nitrogen removal. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that pollutant concentrations, especially organic matter, influence the FA compositions greatly, and the most significant difference of microbial community structures was detected in down-flow cells fed with DW and up-flow ones with NW. The branched FAs, which could be used to represent anaerobic bacteria, were observed in down-flow cells treating DW and had a significant positive correlation with chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration, probably suggesting the important role of anaerobic bacteria in organic matter degradation in the IVCWs. Seasonal variation, however, did not greatly influence the microbial community structure in the IVCWs.

Due to lending activities, funds are transferred from one participant to another, and credit-debt relationships between them are formed. With repeated activities, flows of funds are shown in a financial network. We analyze the evolution of funds flows based on evolutionary game theory. Using Lyapunov stability method, we prove that funds flows converge to a relatively stable state, and prove a bound on the convergence time. Finally, we design an ant colony optimization algorithm for a financial network, and use experiments to simulate the evolving process of funds flows.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to classify charts by combining convolutional networks and deep belief networks. In the framework, we firstly extract deep hidden features of charts, which are taken from the fully-connected layer of deep convolutional networks. We then utilize deep belief networks to predict the labels of the charts based on their deep hidden features. The convolutional networks are initialized using a large number of natural images and fine-tuned using the chart images to prevent overfitting. Compared with previous methods using primitive feature extraction, the deep features give our framework better scalability and stability. We collect a 5-class chart dataset with more than 5000 images and show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods greatly.

Short texts usually encounter sparsity problems in representations for their limited texts length. We address this issue by clustering short texts to form a long text. Specifically, we first use k-means clustering algorithms to form k clusters, where each cluster contains texts having close semantic similarity with the same sentiment polarity. Then, these clusters are used to train classifier. In evaluation, the unlabeled text is merged to the most similar positive and negative clusters respectively, and its sentiment polarity is determined by the change of the two clusters' probabilistic estimates. Experiments on the Twitter dataset show that our approach can achieve a significantly better performance than the bag-of-words method.

A state-dependent two-level polling model was established to analyze the QoS performance of M2M under unsaturated condition and perfect channel in the IEEE 802.11. To improve the transmission effective of massive M2M service, machine without transmission requirement would be set in the idle state and only active machine could access in the network. Two level mixed service polling mechanism were used to provide priority differentiation service. Based on these results, we derive the explicit closed-form expressions for the mean waiting time. Numerical examples demonstrate that theoretical and simulation results are identical and the new system is efficiency both at key termination and normal terminations.

The cost profile and execution profile rather than the makespan are optimized altogether in distributed computing environment. The execution costs of the same task are heterogeneous and the cost of the task will decrease as its execution time is extended. A harmony search algorithm hybridized with chaos strategies is presented to solve the problem. Task model and the converting technique of the two-vector code make the harmony search (HS) algorithm adaptive to the task scheduling problem. Chaos strategies are designed to make sure the diversity of the solutions. The cost profile and execution profile of the task scheduling problem is evolved by harmony vector and search strategy. Self-adaptive cost scaling strategy is designed to effectively minimize the cost by extending the execution time according to obtained task slack and the overload of the processors. Empirical results on various benchmark instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

The purpose of this study is to use novel analytic tools to evaluate the software projects under incomplete and uncertain situations. The study covers identifying the key risk criteria of software projects about warehouse management systems (WMS), and assessing the criteria by the integrated hybrid methodologies. The software projects were then categorized by fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methodologies. Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) was used to create favorable weights for fuzzy linguistic variable of software projects overall risk. The fuzzy TOPSIS method is very suitable for solving group decision making problems under the fuzzy environment. It attempted to incorporate vital qualitative attributes in performance analysis of software projects and transformed the qualitative data into equivalent quantitative measures. Fifteen software projects were studied with respect to four main criteria that are the time, cost, quality and safety. The results showed that these novel methodologies are able to assess the overall risks of software projects. This approach will have potential applications in the future.

There are many species with a similar appearance, which makes it difficult and laborious to classify. Thus, we propose a novel Paphiopedilum Orchid Classifier (POC) based on Neural Network, utilizing the Color and Segmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) features. In the classification of 11 POF species, POC achieved 97.64% of 10-fold cross validation accuracy. Besides, we also propose a new POF dataset consisting of 100 samples for each species and illustrated the prediction performance of several renowned classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-nearest and Decision Tree. According to research result, we hope that POC can assists botanists to classify POF for further breed selection and adaptation.

Both the weight and the profit of an item are functions of the knapsack, and each knapsack has a positive real capacity. A restriction is setting that the number of the items which are admissible to each knapsack is no more than k, and these items are taken as input for each knapsack. We consider two following objectives: (1) maximizing the total profit of all the knapsacks (Max-Sum k-GMK); (2) maximizing the minimum profit of all the knapsacks (Max-Min k-GMK). We show that the two problems are NP-complete when k is greater than or equal t to 4. For the Max-Sum k-GMK problem, we can obtain a 1/2-approximation algorithm, and especially when k=2, we design an optimal algorithm.

Because cloud computing platforms offer high scalability and low maintenance cost. The reliability of cloud applications is still a challenging and critical research problem, although cloud infrastructures provide high reliability in terms of virtual machines. To solve the problem, an optimization framework for legacy applications migration is proposed. The framework consists of the component ranking algorithm, FTHCloud. The algorithm employs the application structure information, invocation frequency, failure impact, failure rate, response time and response data size of components. The top k components selected based on the ranking algorithm could be fault tolerant. In the paper, the formulated fault tolerance strategies including Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms can be automatically selected for these components. The experimental results show that the increase of reliability of several significant components according to these QoS values can improve the dependability of legacy applications in federate hybrid clouds.

Meanwhile, since applications are distributed in clouds, reliability and response time of applications could not be guaranteed. To solve the problem, an optimization framework, FLCloud, based on PageRank algorithm is proposed for application migration and remigration. In the algorithm, application structure information, failure rate and statistical response time are considered for the selection of top k components, namely, Web services of applications.

This paper presents a new problem of finding co-locations on spatial databases which are constantly changed with new data and disappeared data. Discovering co-locations is a complicated process when a large spatial database is changed because new and disappeared data will produce and take away spatial relationships with existing data as well as themselves. The changed relationships will alter the sets of prevalent co-locations with invalidating existing co-locations and producing new co-locations.

In the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational, i.e., actors are related through different relationship types, such as friendship, kinship and co-authorship. A multi-relational social network can be represented by multiple single-relational graphs, each reflecting one kind of relation. Acquiring information contained in a multi-relational social network, such as which actors interact frequently in which relationships, can help us to understand the network comprehensively and then offer better services. This paper develops a system (SQNR: A System for Querying Nodes and Relations) to query nodes that interact frequently in the specified relationships and to query relationships in which the specified community patterns (limitations of the community memberships of some actors, such as belong to the same community) can be satisfied. Twelve community patterns can be specified in this paper. The queried results provide new insights about relationships amongst actors.

The occlusion is generally endowed a little weight to weaken its influence on recognition performance. On the basis of this idea, many existing algorithms used the reconstruction error or projection error as the probability estimation for occlusion image. These methods require iterative computation, which may lead to the difficulty of threshold selection and high time complexity. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a novel method for occlusion face recognition by using an error detection method. First, a face image is divided into four regions and we extract feature and detect error for each region. Second, we use the logarithmic transform error operator to calculate the weight value of each region. The experiments based on the AR database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for occlusion face recognition achieves high efficiency and good robustness and outperforms the existing methods for certain occlusion recognition.

A polling control protocol for wireless sensor network, namely Limited-K service Polling Schedule with Sleeping (K-PSSS) was proposed for the data acquisition environment to reduce the energy consumption. The access control mechanism and the characters of service performance and energy efficiency were analyzed, and then the data transfer proceeding in serial mode and parallel mode of K-PSSS was also described respectively. The experimental results indicate that the system performance can be satisfied and the energy of idle nodes and AP will be greatly saved in K-PSSS mechanism which helps to extend the lifetime.

The first is windowed RDA (W-RDA) and windowed CSA(W-CSA) which decreases the sidelobe and increases the signal-to-noise ratio. The second is spatially variant apodization RDA and CSA (SVA-RDA and SVA-CSA) which weighs the amplitude of each point in frequency domain and then suppresses sidelobe effectively, and keeps good main lobe resolution at the same time. The third is a combination of the previous two as WSVA-RDA and WSVA-CSA which overcomes the deficiency of the previous two and has a better result. The paper puts forward two parameters named Peak-Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) and Peak-Image Ratio (PIR) to evaluate the sidelobe suppression effect.

Nowadays humanoid robots are being harnessed to new kinds of tasks unknown before, such as amusement, a function that was intended for pets, for example. One of the practical uses of robots-humanoids might be in guiding blind people, thereby substituting for guide dogs. The guided-humanoids would have algorithms that plan motion, GPS built-in sensors, and video cameras. The proposed system will be controlled by a smart-phone monitor and will be voice-controlled. On the other hand, the CBT - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new psychotherapy methodology, has become a more prevalent practice, justifying its computerization. These interdisciplinary considerations led to additional progress, resulting in trained robots, namely, robots that communicate according to the CBT methodology, by also using another conversation mode: gesturing. This methodology is based on computer-assisted (now extended to humanoid-assisted) cognitive behavioral therapy methodology (CBT). CBT was originally developed for psychological treatment and is often used to reveal and treat personality disorders. This methodology can also be used to evaluate the reliability of a witness. CBT methodology assumes that the cognitive thoughts of people are expressed by their language. In the literature, about ten categories of thoughts have been determined, and so-called distorted thoughts indicate a behavioral deviation. Based on the above assumption, it is possible to map thoughts, including distorted thoughts and analyze them methodically with the help of linguistic tools. Thus, these tools will be able to scan the mapping of an individual's thoughts and discover distorted thoughts as classified by the CBT method. We will use extreme situations as examples to illustrate distorted thoughts. The mentioned situations will refer to time description (always, never), location (everywhere, nowhere), quantity (everything, nothing, nobody), possibility (must, forced, incapable), among others. These types of expressions leave no doubt as to their meaning. The social-robot's role is to find some textual forms (distorted thoughts) and replace them by other textual forms (corrected, proposed texts). The theoretical background and its implementation will be demonstrated herein.

Then, scores collected from real woodcuts are placed automatically in segmenting regions.

Each individual mask can be extracted from this seam image quickly. To promote execution speed and reduce memory usage in building large area mosaics, the seam image and masks are compressed using run-length encoding, and all the following mask operations are built on run-length encoding scheme. We apply our fast blending system to large scale data sets and present detailed quantitative results compared with OpenCV and Enblend to demonstrate the speed and memory improvements.

To implement different scatterer distributions representing a variable density of random scatterers with or without coherent component, A set of 3D scatterer models are built based on a three-dimensional Hilbert curve following Gamma distributions with different values of shape and scale parameters. The RF data are simulated by using the Field II software. Then the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for statistical histograms of the energy of the RF data is performed to obtain the values of log-likelihood and model parameters. In order to evaluate the fitting performance and parameter meaning of the HK distribution, the mean and standard deviation of these estimated values are compared with those based on the optimal fitting model chosen from commonly used single-distributions (OSD), the K, Rayleigh and Rician distributions. The results show the parameters of Homodyned K-distribution obtained by the MLE could independently represent the clustered, random or uniform characteristics for scatterer distribution. However, the fitting accuracy could only catch up with that based on the OSD joint model under the condition that the tissue contains the scatterers from medium to high effective-density, as well as deterministic or non-deterministic components. The OSD model is still a better choice in the case of the fitting performance emphasized in practice, especially the tissue with a wider range of scatterer densities and deterministic components.

However, there have been far less systematic studies on the accurate performance of the regional PWV measurement along a segment of carotid artery and relevant influence factors. In this paper, an ultrasound simulation model for pulse wave propagation is proposed to investigate the accurate performance of PWV measurement and the influence factors such as beam density and frame rate of ultrasound scanning systemically. 30 sets of B-scan ultrasonic sequence images of carotid artery at different frame rates are simulated for obtaining the corresponding RF ultrasound signals, and then the delay time of pulse wave transit at different locations along the artery segment is calculated by two cross-correlation-based data processes. Finally, the average PWV is calculated from a linear fitting algorithm applied to time-distance relationship of pulse wave. The results show that the estimated PWV of carotid artery based on ultrasound RF signals suffers from errors ranged from 7 % to 11 %. The frame rates of ultrasound imaging decreased from 1127 Hz to 376 Hz do not significantly affect the accuracy of PWV measurements, but decreased to 226 Hz would result in much larger measurement errors.

Firstly, a geometric vessel-model with stenosis of bilateral symmetry axis is established to get the flow velocity distributions for different degrees of stenosis, and then the Doppler spectra from entire segment of the vessel covered by sound field are calculated. Finally, corresponding maximum frequency locations in the spectra are determined according to a comparison between the maximum values from blood flow velocity distributions and their calculated spectra. The theoretical analysis shows that the maximum frequencies, which correspond to the maximum velocities of blood flow for different degrees of stenosis, locate at different positions in the spectral falling-edge. For the normal vessel, the location is at the middle position of the falling-edge, and down shifts along the falling-edge with the increase of the stenosis degree approximately linearly. The proposed method could be helpful to extract the maximum velocities of blood flow in stenosed vessels.

However, the original MapReduce framework also needs some optimizations to improve its performance. In this paper, we propose a novel bloom filter based lightweight MapReduce index (BF-MapReduce). Instead of scanning the whole dataset, our approach uses an auxiliary index to quickly skip unnecessary data segments, which can efficiently degrade the processing cost at map phase. Moreover, in order to deal with multi-dimension dataset, a converting schema is proposed. It can map multi-dimension data into one-dimension index. The experimental results show that our approach is efficient and lightweight. It can reduce the task running time dramatically with a little storage and maintenance cost.

The recommender system is constructed as an online application which is capable of generating a personalized list of preference attractions for the tourist. Modern technologies of classical recommender system, such as collaborative filtering are considered to be effectively adopted in the tourism domain. On the basis of collaborative filtering principle, the recommendation process of tourist attractions divided into three steps, representation of user (tourist) information, generation of neighbor users (tourists) and the generation of attraction recommendations. In order to calculate the similarities between each user, the Cosine method is adopted during the process of the generation of neighbors. And then the recommendations of attractions are generated according to the visiting history of the user's neighbors. In order to demonstrate the calculation process of the system, a case is demonstrated in detail.

In order to assess the quality of reviews, we ought to know the factors that have influence on or are related to the quality of reviews. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of reviews on JD.com, one of the famous E-commerce sites in China. We observed the times when users buy goods are highly related to the time when they post reviews. Meanwhile, the level of users is an important factor affects the quality of reviews. On the other hand, users prefer to post short reviews containing the description of the quality and price of the product. Based on a lexical resource containing sentiment annotations, we found sentimental words expressing users' feelings and opinions is one of the key factors that can influence the quality of reviews. Finally, we evaluated the importance of more than 18 factors influencing the quality of reviews, and found these factors can be compressed into 5 principal factors.

Various favorable techniques have been proposed, but it is believed that the single representations, containing one-sided information of protein sequence, are insufficient for discrimination. To this end, we in this paper propose the fused representations by integrating two single representations, the amino acid composition (AAC) and the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Due to two forms of PSSM, PsePSSM and GreyPSSM, two integrated representations, called briefly AACPsePSSM and AACGreyPSSM, are given. To evaluate the proposed representations, a benchmark data set is employed and the classical K nearest neighbor (KNN) is adopted classifier.

However, these representations, containing only single characterize of protein, make the information for classification insufficient. Inspired by this fact, we propose two integrated representations by feature fusion method in the expectation of extracting richer information from the protein sequence. Concretely, we combine pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) with position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and then obtain two fused representations, called briefly PseAACGreyPSSM and PseAACPsePSSM. Both the proposed representations, thus, include the protein amphiphilic factors and the biological evolution information. We, with feature vectors of protein samples, adopt the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for predicting.

However, at present the research which is aimed to develop ethnic Non-Photorealistic Rendering pyrography technology is still very rare. Furthermore, there are problems with lacking corresponding simulation systems, relatively slow rendering speed, a serious loss of image detail and no extension to the video field. Thus, this paper will introduce a new rendering technology of pyrography simulation which is based on multiplication and an interactive pyrography simulation system which can process images and videos. Firstly, in order to get the foreground image, the algorithm will enhance, simulate and equalize the imputed static image. Secondly, by using the texture synthesis technique, the background of the pyrography can be obtained. Finally, to get the ethnic pyrography works, the multiplication will be used to map the foreground image to the background image. Additionally, the system can capture the video and this can be used for pyrography simulation. The final experimental results show that through the interactive operation, the system can make the simulation of static images and video achieve realistic pyrography art effect. The simulation results preserve more detailed information and can show the true color of the image. The operation is simple, but the rendering speed is relatively fast.

Many ornamentals in western countries originated from China. This paper presents the biodiversity of native Chinese ornamental plants at ecosystem, species and genetic levels, focusing on species and genetic resources with aesthetic potentials, based on literature studies and authors' participatory investigations. The latest statistics reported 31,362 vascular species (taxa) occurring in China, of which about 6000 species are with gardening values. The diversified ornamental plants become important components of different ecosystems. As the dominant species, some ornamental plants established the plant communities in forests and grasslands, which made the landscapes more colourful and beautiful. Famous representatives were introduced including Camellia, Rhododendron, Rosa, Lilium, Chrysanthemum, Cymbidium and others. Lots of species are with multiple uses in addition to aesthetic values, like medicinal, edible, agricultural or daily life uses. The relationship between biodiversity and cultural diversity of ornamental plants is discussed. Biodiversity of Paeonia, mei flower, Chrysanthemum, sweet osmanthus, Chinese roses and many flowers endowed special meanings to traditional Chinese culture, which enriched cultural diversity. On the other hand, the traditional Chinese culture affected the diversity of ornamental plants. Some potential ornamental plants but underutilized or neglected, including Musella lasiocarpa (Musaceae), Lycoris (Amaryllidaceae), and Leucocasia gigantea (Araceae), are presented. The strategies for conservation and development of Chinese ornamental plants are proposed.

Continuous dimensional representations, such as valence-arousal (VA) space, can represent the affective state more precisely than discrete effective representations. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of VA lexicons using linear regression techniques. One of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes the use of a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) model to predict the valence-arousal ratings of affective words. The locally weighted method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are "local" to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better performance for VA word prediction.	[Wang, Jin; Yu, Liang-Chih; Lai, K.

It was verified that Co and Si could form ohmic contact after Rapid Temperature Process (RTP). The Light-Induced Plating (LIP) was applied to electroplate Co on the substrate of polysilicon solar cells. Surface morphologies of the coating layers had been characterized by SEM. The uniform and dense Co and its silicide coating layers had been achieved. The analysis of X-ray diffractions showed that CoSi2 was obtained after RTP. As demonstration, we had fabricated a cell with Co silicide/Cu as the front side electrode without the antireflection layer.

However, labeled data are difficult to collected but unlabeled data are readily obtained. To solve the lack of labeled data, we utilize the method of transfer learning to build the learning model with the labeled and the unlabeled training examples. Based on the feature spaces of source and target domain, the common space are build. Then, those examples from source domain whose conditional probability is like to be similar to the target domain are selected into the common space. Therefore, the question classifier is trained by the labeled data in the source domain and the unlabeled data in the target domain. Meanwhile, the method of Map/Reduce based on the Hadoop platform is used to reduce the time complexity in kernel mapping. The subtasks are constructed for the mapping process and then the final result is obtained by assembling the subtasks. Experiments on question classification show that the proposed method could improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, the learning model based on the Hadoop Platform could ask each computing resources to reduce the running time.

For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy must be addressed properly. In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named key-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (KP-ABRSC) scheme, which is a combination of identity-based ring signature scheme and key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. In KP-ABRSC, each signcrypted message is labeled by the sender with a set of descriptive attributes and a list of identities of potential senders, while an access structure is embedded in each user's private key by a trusted authority. We give formal syntax and security definitions for KP-ABRSC scheme and construct a KP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. The proposed KP-ABRSC scheme is proven to be indistinguishable against adaptive chosen plaintext attacks under the DBDH assumption and existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the CDH assumption. Finally, we present a cloud-based healthcare framework by exploiting our proposed KP-ABRSC scheme and WBANs, which can ensure data authenticity, confidentiality and non-repudiation, but also can offer participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted medical data.

Due to the coupling between the 'comb' shape parasitic element and the multi-branch radiating element, three frequency bands which are suitable for WLAN/WiMAX are achieved. The simulated results show that by adding the parasitic element, the high frequency end cutoff frequency of the antenna is reduced from 6.89 GHz to 6.0 GHz and a notched band at 3.84-5.02GHz is produced. The overall dimension of the proposed antenna can reach 29x29x 1.6 mm3. The measured results show that the antenna's working frequency bands of S11 <=-10 dB are as follows: 2.29-2.90GHz, 3.30-3.93 GHz and 4.92-6.0 GHz, which well cover both the WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz) and WiMAX (2.3/2.5/3.5/5.8 GHz) frequency bands. By changing the sizes of the parasitic element and the co-ground structure respectively, the adjustment of the three working frequency bands can be realized. It proves that the proposed antenna has a good tunability.

Dual Schottky diode is used as predistorter. The PDC with high bandwidth and small dimension is achieved by removing quarter-wavelength transformers and power dividers. Measured S-parameters show that the PDC can work from 10 MHz to up to 40 GHz. The PDC is verified using two-tone and WiFi signals in an RoF system. The spur-free dynamic range with respect to third order intermodulation distortion is improved by more than 10 dB from 1 to 5 GHz and more than 5 dB from 1 to 30 GHz, and it is found that the RoF system is limited by fifth order nonlinearity. Error vector magnitude is improved by 1 dB for WiFi signals at 2.4 and 5 GHz by using the PDC.

Several solutions to offer efficient key revocation or ciphertext update for identity-based encryption systems have been proposed in the literature. However, how to achieve both key revocation and ciphertext update functionalities simultaneously in identity-based encryption systems is still an open problem. Recently, Liang et al. introduce the notion of cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption (CR-IB-PRE) scheme with the aim to achieve both ciphertext update and key revocation functionalities, and present a CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. In this paper, we first showed Liang et al.'s scheme has serious security pitfalls such as re-encryption key forgery and collusion attack, which lead to revoked users can decrypt any ciphertext regarding their identities at any time period. We then redefined the syntax and security model of CR-IB-PRE scheme and proposed an improved CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. The improved scheme not only achieves collusion resistance, but also takes lower decryption computation and achieves constant size re-encrypted ciphtertext. Finally, we proved the improved CR-IB-PRE scheme is adaptively secure in the standard model under DBDH assumption.

To accelerate execution speed in building high resolution mosaics, the compositing seam is found efficiently via seeded region growing using a photometric criterion. A contribution of this paper is to use seeded region growing on image differences to find possible seams over areas of low photometric difference. This can result in significant reduction of blending time. The proposed method presents several advantages. The using of seeded region growing over image pairs guarantees the approximate optimal solution for each intersection region. The independence of such regions makes the algorithm suitable for parallel implementation. The using of priority queue leads to reduced memory requirements and a compact storage of the input data. Finally, it allows the efficient creation of large mosaics, without user intervention. We also evaluate the proposed blending method with pixel based graph cut and watershed based graph cut to illustrate the performance of the approach on image sequences with qualitative and quantitative comparison.

In this paper, we proposed a new and more efficient polygon fill algorithm based on the scan line algorithm and Grid Fill Algorithm (GFA). First, we elaborated the GFA through solid fill. Second, we described the techniques for implementing anti-aliasing and self-intersection polygon fill with GFA. Then, we discussed the implementation of GFA based on the gradient fill. Generally, compared to other fill algorithms, GFA has better performance and achieves faster fill speed, which is specifically consistent with the inherent characteristics of mobile devices. Experimental results show that better fill effects can be achieved by using GFA.

A thoracic spine phantom set at a given pose was used in the experiment. The geometric torsion of the spine phantom calculated from the freehand ultrasound imaging system was 0.041 mm(-1) which was close to that calculated from the biplanar radiographs (0.025 mm(-1)).

However, moving cast shadows detection is one of the major concerns for accurate video segmentation. Since detected moving object areas are often contain shadow points, errors in measurements, localization, segmentation, classification and tracking may arise from this. A novel shadow elimination algorithm is proposed in this paper. A set of suspected moving object area are detected by the adaptive Gaussian approach. A model is established based on shadow optical properties analysis. And shadow regions are discriminated from the set of moving pixels by using the properties of brightness, chromaticity and texture in sequence.

In the design of FIR filter the traditional algorithm such as serial DA algorithm, parallel DA algorithm and combined series and parallel DA algorithm are all not so suitable, which has lots of shortcomings. In this design, we improve the DA algorithm and uses the 4-BAAT method which optimizes the structure of LUT(look-up table) to realize the FIR filter. The process of FIR simple tap coefficients is achieved by the operation of shifting and reversing of symbol bit, which can pick up the speed and save the logic resources.

Orthogo-nal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a core technology in the fourth-generation wireless communication field(4G). The basic principle of OFDM is to split a high-rate data stream into a number of lower. In OFDM system design, a number of parameters are up for consideration, such as the number of subcarriers, guard time, symbol duration, subcarrier spacing, modulation type persubcarrier, and the type of forward error correction coding. The choice of parameters is influenced by system requirements such as available bandwidth, required bit rate, tolerable delay spread, and Doppler values. This paper designs and implements an OFDM receiver system. The system includes interleaving and de-interleaving module, RS encoding and decoding module, QPSK modulation and demodulation module and some system composed of a number of auxiliary modules. This paper analyses and tests efficiency and other factors of the system, and demonstrating the use of FPGA technology enables to receive signal in the OFDM system so well. It has some advantages of occupying less hardware resources, fast running and having good stability.

However, anisotropic and inhomogeneous material properties seriously impede the practical fabrication of the device. In this paper, an equivalent realization method for the cylindrical concentrator is proposed based on the transmission line (TL) network. The effectiveness of the method is validated through the Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) circuit simulator, and the performance of presented TL concentrator is compared with the ideal concentrator. Besides, the broadband characteristics and the robustness of TL concentrator against the material loss of circuit elements are also discussed. This work expands the application of TL theory and provides a feasible solution to push the concentrator much closer to the application.	[Li, T. H.; Huang, M.; Yang, J. J.; Xu, X.

The cooperative theory and non-cooperative game theory have been used separately for detecting communities. In this paper, we develop a new approach that utilizes both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory to detect communities. The individuals in a social network are modelled as playing cooperative game for achieving and improving group's utilities, meanwhile individuals also play the non-cooperative game for improving individual's utilities. By combining the cooperative and non-cooperative game theories, utilities of groups and individuals can be taken into account simultaneously, thus the communities detected can be more rational and the computational cost will be decreased. The experimental results on synthetic and real networks show that our algorithm can fast detect overlapping communities.

Most existing community detection algorithms are designed for single-relational networks. However, in the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational. In this paper, we propose a coalition formation game theory-based approach to detect communities in multi-relational social networks. We define the multi-relational communities as the shared communities over multiple single-relational graphs, and model community detection as a coalition formation game process in which actors in a social network are modeled as rational players trying to improve group's utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions and coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation could improve the utilities of coalitions merged. We then use a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Experimental results and performance studies verify the effectiveness of our approach.

We then give the objective function of selecting the optimal seed set of competing products in a social network, and the objective function is monotone and submodular under the ELTM, thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation ration (where e is the base of natural logarithm).

For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy issues must be addressed properly. Recently, Hu et al. proposed a fuzzy attribute-based signcryption scheme with the aim to provide security and privacy mechanisms in WBANs. In this paper, we first show Hu et al.'s scheme cannot achieve the claimed security properties. In particular, an adversary is capable of generating private keys for any set of attributes. Then we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named ciphertext-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (CP-ABRSC) by integrating the notion of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with identity-based ring signature. We give formal syntax and security definitions for CP-ABRSC and present a provable secure CP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. Finally, we propose a novel access control framework for WBANs by exploiting CP-ABRSC scheme, which can not only provide semantic security, unforgeability and public authenticity, but also can provide participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted health data.

Many existing data cleaning methods can be used to detect errors in traditional databases, but they fall short of guiding us to find errors in probabilistic databases, especially for databases with complex correlations among data. In this paper, we propose a method for tracing errors in probabilistic databases by adopting Bayesian network (BN) as the framework of representing the correlations among data. We first develop the techniques to construct an augmented Bayesian network (ABN) for an anomalous query to represent correlations among input data, intermediate data and output data in the query execution. Inspired by the notion of blame in causal models, we then define a notion of blame for ranking candidate errors.

Firstly, dual-tree complex wavelet transform is processing for the source image. Secondly, the fusion rules based on Local region energy matching degree are adopted for the high frequency coefficient, and the fusion rules based on adaptive S-PCNN are used for the low-frequency coefficients.

Aiming at the spatial-temporal features of environmental vulnerability, the synthetic evaluation index system was set up, and the synthetic index of environmental vulnerability (EV) was computed for the Yunnan Plateau. The results showed that the EV was at medial level in most regions of the study area. The EV is heavier in the east than that in the west, and heavier in the north than that in the south, while it is relatively lower in the middle. From the year of 1990 to 2000, the environmental quality became worse. However, from the year of 2000 to 2010, the degradation trend of environment for the whole Yunnan Plateau had slowed down. The main driving forces of the EV changes were the rapid population growth and vegetation degradation during the years from 1990 to 2000, while the main driving forces of the EV changes were the governmental environment protection policies and the improvement of social economy and scientific technology during the years from 2001 to 2010.

This paper presents a new approach for copy-move forgery detection where fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is used. First, the 1-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of the forged image is to reduce its dimension. Next, the low frequency the sub-band is divided into overlapped blocks of equal size. The fractional Fourier transform of each block is calculated and the vector of the coefficients is constructed. All feature vectors are sorted using lexicographical order. Finally, the difference of adjacent feature vectors is evaluated and employed to locate the duplicated regions which have the same feature vectors. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detection of the copy-move forgery regions.

Generally, it may derive from the general decline of cortex inhibition, which destroys the balance between excitation and inhibition system in the brain. To date, the optimal fitting model of receptive field size curve is not clear during different age groups. To address this issue, firstly, we carried out extracellular single-unit studies of the receptive field properties of cells in the primary visual cortex(v1) in young and old rhesus monkeys. By IGOR, we obtain the original data of receptive field size curve. Secondly, we use the existing models of Gaussian, DOG (subtractive) and a normalization (divisive) model to fit the data. After that, we found clear indications: The fitting goodness of DOG has a high degree during different age groups and the DOG model has better adaptability and flexibility. In addition, we can draw a conclusion: In aging process, the turning curvature of receptive field size curve of V1 cells changes obviously, and the surround suppression of the receptive field decreases clearly.

Methods: Individual GA content was determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and the transcription levels of the GA biosynthetic genes were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The maximum content for total triterpenoids, GA-T, GA-S and GA-Me was 1210, 16.5, 14.3, 12.5 g/100 mg dry weight, respectively, at the immature stage. The maximum transcript levels for GA biosynthetic genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase and lanosterol synthase were up-regulated by 1.8-, 8.7-, 30.5- and 19.2-fold at the immature stage. Conclusion: The result showed that the content of total triterpenoids and individual GA at the immature stage was higher than that at the primordium and the mature stages. The higher GA content at the immature stage was partially related to increased transcription of these genes. This work will be help for better utilization of fruiting body of G. lucidum and further investigations on the GA biosynthesis regulation.

While in reality users are not all present in the system simultaneously. Dominant Resource Fairness(DRF) satisfies SI, PE AND EF, but violates SP. We have introduced Multi-level Queue Dominant Resource Fairness (MQDRF), a fair sharing model that generalizes max-min fairness to multiple resource types. MQDRF has lots of good properties, it satisfies DSI, PE, EF and SP. We construct MQDRF mechanisms that provably satisfy properties, and analyze the performance.

Thus, the Web service composition which consists of these services will be necessarily random of the QoS. The requirements of the QoS of Web service composition may not be certainly satisfied. We use a simulation approach named Importance Sampling to analyze the QoS probability of Web service composition in stochastic PERT network. In this paper, we propose a relatively simple distribution function and introduce a weighting function to ensure that the estimating of the target distribution function is an unbiased estimation. We conduct a comparison of Importance Sampling technique with Monte Carlo simulation about the rationality and the operation efficiency based on the actual QoS data of Web services by experiment. The experimental results prove that the Importance Sampling technique has better precision and higher efficiency than Monte Carlo simulation.

Despite these virtues, it suffers from several drawbacks, such as it is unable to determine a reasonable cluster number, sensitive to initial condition and not robust to outliers. In this paper, we present a new approach named density peak spectral clustering (DPSC) which combines spectral clustering with density peak clustering algorithm (DPCA) into a unified framework to solve these problems. Since multi-view data is common in clustering problem, to further bootstrap the clustering performance by using complementary information from different view, then we propose co-trained density peak spectral clustering (Co-DPSC), which is an extension of DPSC to multi-views based on the co-training idea. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on a toy and three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed DPSC and Co-DPSC algorithm.

Feature extraction plays an important role in the accurate classification or location of proteins. Since the contribution of each feature dimension is different, this paper enlarges the contribution of feature dimensions which have great effect on classification by weighting with its Fisher linear discriminant rate. Then k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to classify the testing sample. The result shows that, compared to direct use of KNN algorithm, KNN with LDA dimensional reduction improves the predicting accuracy rate, and the proposed KNN based on Fisher's linear discriminant rate weighting method with LDA dimensional reduction can further reduce the redundance impact and enhance the accuracy of protein localization.

In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words. Experiments on both English and Chinese affective lexicons show that the proposed method yielded a smaller error rate on VA prediction than the linear regression, kernel method, and pagerank algorithm used in previous studies.

It is therefore vitally important to better understand the behavior of Earth's climate system on regional scale and advance the knowledge of regional responses to global climate. With their ability to represent meso-scale forcings, such as coastline, complex topography, anthropogenic aerosols and land cover/use changes, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are developed and used worldwide to investigate the effects of the above-mentioned meso-scale forcings on the local circulations that regulate the regional distribution of climatic variables. Considering the complexity of Asian Monsoon system, which is not only a physical process but also modulated by the interaction among physical, biological, chemical and social processes, a modeling framework Regional Integrated Environmental Modeling System (RIEMS) was proposed, developed and well tested before it was widely used in regional climate studies in the East Asia monsoon region.

However, the microbial physiology and community structure can be influenced by environmental conditions. In this study, four pilot-scale integrated vertical-flow constructed wetlands (IVCWs) were employed to treat domestic and nitrified wastewaters. The microbial properties, along with their response to wastewater quality characteristics and seasonal variation, were determined. The results showed higher Shannon-Weiner diversity (H) and evenness (E) index of fatty acids (FAs), and relative abundances of signature FAs in down-flow cells and in the systems fed with domestic wastewater (DW). The relative abundances of fungi and gram-negative and aerobic bacteria were greater in up-flow cells. The dominant anaerobic bacteria found in most cells might be accounted for the prevailing anaerobic environment within the wetland beds, which could mean that the system fed with nitrified wastewater (NW) should perform better in nitrogen removal. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that pollutant concentrations, especially organic matter, influence the FA compositions greatly, and the most significant difference of microbial community structures was detected in down-flow cells fed with DW and up-flow ones with NW. The branched FAs, which could be used to represent anaerobic bacteria, were observed in down-flow cells treating DW and had a significant positive correlation with chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration, probably suggesting the important role of anaerobic bacteria in organic matter degradation in the IVCWs. Seasonal variation, however, did not greatly influence the microbial community structure in the IVCWs.

Due to lending activities, funds are transferred from one participant to another, and credit-debt relationships between them are formed. With repeated activities, flows of funds are shown in a financial network. We analyze the evolution of funds flows based on evolutionary game theory. Using Lyapunov stability method, we prove that funds flows converge to a relatively stable state, and prove a bound on the convergence time. Finally, we design an ant colony optimization algorithm for a financial network, and use experiments to simulate the evolving process of funds flows.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to classify charts by combining convolutional networks and deep belief networks. In the framework, we firstly extract deep hidden features of charts, which are taken from the fully-connected layer of deep convolutional networks. We then utilize deep belief networks to predict the labels of the charts based on their deep hidden features. The convolutional networks are initialized using a large number of natural images and fine-tuned using the chart images to prevent overfitting. Compared with previous methods using primitive feature extraction, the deep features give our framework better scalability and stability. We collect a 5-class chart dataset with more than 5000 images and show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods greatly.

Many methods, such as ISOMAP, LLE, Laplacian Eigenmap, have been proposed under manifold learning for dimensionality reduction. However, all these ideas have not taken the influence of different class into consideration, which limit the effectiveness of manifold learning. To take account for the influence for multiclass and improve the performance of dimensional reduction, we propose a new method, supervised Hessian LLE(SHLLE). To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on the artificial dataset and real dataset (COIL-20). Our result demonstrate that the proposed method outperform HLLE method.

Short texts usually encounter sparsity problems in representations for their limited texts length. We address this issue by clustering short texts to form a long text. Specifically, we first use k-means clustering algorithms to form k clusters, where each cluster contains texts having close semantic similarity with the same sentiment polarity. Then, these clusters are used to train classifier. In evaluation, the unlabeled text is merged to the most similar positive and negative clusters respectively, and its sentiment polarity is determined by the change of the two clusters' probabilistic estimates. Experiments on the Twitter dataset show that our approach can achieve a significantly better performance than the bag-of-words method.

A state-dependent two-level polling model was established to analyze the QoS performance of M2M under unsaturated condition and perfect channel in the IEEE 802.11. To improve the transmission effective of massive M2M service, machine without transmission requirement would be set in the idle state and only active machine could access in the network. Two level mixed service polling mechanism were used to provide priority differentiation service. Based on these results, we derive the explicit closed-form expressions for the mean waiting time. Numerical examples demonstrate that theoretical and simulation results are identical and the new system is efficiency both at key termination and normal terminations.

The cost profile and execution profile rather than the makespan are optimized altogether in distributed computing environment. The execution costs of the same task are heterogeneous and the cost of the task will decrease as its execution time is extended. A harmony search algorithm hybridized with chaos strategies is presented to solve the problem. Task model and the converting technique of the two-vector code make the harmony search (HS) algorithm adaptive to the task scheduling problem. Chaos strategies are designed to make sure the diversity of the solutions. The cost profile and execution profile of the task scheduling problem is evolved by harmony vector and search strategy. Self-adaptive cost scaling strategy is designed to effectively minimize the cost by extending the execution time according to obtained task slack and the overload of the processors. Empirical results on various benchmark instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

The study covers identifying the key risk criteria of software projects about warehouse management systems (WMS), and assessing the criteria by the integrated hybrid methodologies. The software projects were then categorized by fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methodologies. Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) was used to create favorable weights for fuzzy linguistic variable of software projects overall risk. The fuzzy TOPSIS method is very suitable for solving group decision making problems under the fuzzy environment. It attempted to incorporate vital qualitative attributes in performance analysis of software projects and transformed the qualitative data into equivalent quantitative measures. Fifteen software projects were studied with respect to four main criteria that are the time, cost, quality and safety. The results showed that these novel methodologies are able to assess the overall risks of software projects. This approach will have potential applications in the future.

Besides, we also propose a new POF dataset consisting of 100 samples for each species and illustrated the prediction performance of several renowned classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-nearest and Decision Tree. According to research result, we hope that POC can assists botanists to classify POF for further breed selection and adaptation.

Both the weight and the profit of an item are functions of the knapsack, and each knapsack has a positive real capacity. A restriction is setting that the number of the items which are admissible to each knapsack is no more than k, and these items are taken as input for each knapsack. We consider two following objectives: (1) maximizing the total profit of all the knapsacks (Max-Sum k-GMK); (2) maximizing the minimum profit of all the knapsacks (Max-Min k-GMK). We show that the two problems are NP-complete when k is greater than or equal t to 4. For the Max-Sum k-GMK problem, we can obtain a 1/2-approximation algorithm, and especially when k=2, we design an optimal algorithm. For the Max-Min k-GMK problem, we present a 1/(k-1)-approximation algorithm, and especially when k=2, this algorithm is an optimal algorithm.

Because cloud computing platforms offer high scalability and low maintenance cost. The reliability of cloud applications is still a challenging and critical research problem, although cloud infrastructures provide high reliability in terms of virtual machines. To solve the problem, an optimization framework for legacy applications migration is proposed. The framework consists of the component ranking algorithm, FTHCloud. The algorithm employs the application structure information, invocation frequency, failure impact, failure rate, response time and response data size of components. The top k components selected based on the ranking algorithm could be fault tolerant. In the paper, the formulated fault tolerance strategies including Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms can be automatically selected for these components. The experimental results show that the increase of reliability of several significant components according to these QoS values can improve the dependability of legacy applications in federate hybrid clouds.

Meanwhile, since applications are distributed in clouds, reliability and response time of applications could not be guaranteed. To solve the problem, an optimization framework, FLCloud, based on PageRank algorithm is proposed for application migration and remigration. In the algorithm, application structure information, failure rate and statistical response time are considered for the selection of top k components, namely, Web services of applications. Fault tolerance strategy and location modification for these components can improve the whole application reliability and reduce response time of these critical components to enhance user experiences.

In this paper, we incorporate utility into the spatial pattern mining through the concept of pattern utility, and a general framework for spatial high utility co-location patterns mining is defined. Furthermore, we define the concept of extended pattern utility ratio and present an Extended Pruning Algorithm (EPA) to prune down the number of candidates and can obtain the complete set of spatial high utility co-location patterns.

This paper presents a new problem of finding co-locations on spatial databases which are constantly changed with new data and disappeared data. Discovering co-locations is a complicated process when a large spatial database is changed because new and disappeared data will produce and take away spatial relationships with existing data as well as themselves. The changed relationships will alter the sets of prevalent co-locations with invalidating existing co-locations and producing new co-locations. So efficient incremental mining of co-locations is very indispensable and challenging. This paper presents an algorithm and pruning strategy for efficiently incremental mining on spatial datasets and executes extensive experimental evaluation on "real+synthetic" data sets.

In the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational, i.e., actors are related through different relationship types, such as friendship, kinship and co-authorship. A multi-relational social network can be represented by multiple single-relational graphs, each reflecting one kind of relation. Acquiring information contained in a multi-relational social network, such as which actors interact frequently in which relationships, can help us to understand the network comprehensively and then offer better services. This paper develops a system (SQNR: A System for Querying Nodes and Relations) to query nodes that interact frequently in the specified relationships and to query relationships in which the specified community patterns (limitations of the community memberships of some actors, such as belong to the same community) can be satisfied. Twelve community patterns can be specified in this paper. The queried results provide new insights about relationships amongst actors.

The occlusion is generally endowed a little weight to weaken its influence on recognition performance. On the basis of this idea, many existing algorithms used the reconstruction error or projection error as the probability estimation for occlusion image. These methods require iterative computation, which may lead to the difficulty of threshold selection and high time complexity. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a novel method for occlusion face recognition by using an error detection method. First, a face image is divided into four regions and we extract feature and detect error for each region. Second, we use the logarithmic transform error operator to calculate the weight value of each region. The experiments based on the AR database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for occlusion face recognition achieves high efficiency and good robustness and outperforms the existing methods for certain occlusion recognition.

The second is spatially variant apodization RDA and CSA (SVA-RDA and SVA-CSA) which weighs the amplitude of each point in frequency domain and then suppresses sidelobe effectively, and keeps good main lobe resolution at the same time. The third is a combination of the previous two as WSVA-RDA and WSVA-CSA which overcomes the deficiency of the previous two and has a better result.

Nowadays humanoid robots are being harnessed to new kinds of tasks unknown before, such as amusement, a function that was intended for pets, for example. One of the practical uses of robots-humanoids might be in guiding blind people, thereby substituting for guide dogs. The guided-humanoids would have algorithms that plan motion, GPS built-in sensors, and video cameras. The proposed system will be controlled by a smart-phone monitor and will be voice-controlled. On the other hand, the CBT - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new psychotherapy methodology, has become a more prevalent practice, justifying its computerization. These interdisciplinary considerations led to additional progress, resulting in trained robots, namely, robots that communicate according to the CBT methodology, by also using another conversation mode: gesturing. This methodology is based on computer-assisted (now extended to humanoid-assisted) cognitive behavioral therapy methodology (CBT). CBT was originally developed for psychological treatment and is often used to reveal and treat personality disorders. This methodology can also be used to evaluate the reliability of a witness. CBT methodology assumes that the cognitive thoughts of people are expressed by their language. In the literature, about ten categories of thoughts have been determined, and so-called distorted thoughts indicate a behavioral deviation. Based on the above assumption, it is possible to map thoughts, including distorted thoughts and analyze them methodically with the help of linguistic tools. Thus, these tools will be able to scan the mapping of an individual's thoughts and discover distorted thoughts as classified by the CBT method. We will use extreme situations as examples to illustrate distorted thoughts. The mentioned situations will refer to time description (always, never), location (everywhere, nowhere), quantity (everything, nothing, nobody), possibility (must, forced, incapable), among others. These types of expressions leave no doubt as to their meaning. The social-robot's role is to find some textual forms (distorted thoughts) and replace them by other textual forms (corrected, proposed texts).

Yunnan out-of-print woodcut is an extension of the traditional woodcut. In this paper, we introduce an automatic image-based approach with three steps. First, image is sliced out by color clustering. Then, scores collected from real woodcuts are placed automatically in segmenting regions. Finally, a virtual printing method combining all regions with their colors is proposed to synthesize multicolor woodcut. This method is simple and efficient, and the simulated result looks good.

We first compute a unique seam image using two-pass nearest distance transform, which is independent on the order of input images and has good scalability. Each individual mask can be extracted from this seam image quickly. To promote execution speed and reduce memory usage in building large area mosaics, the seam image and masks are compressed using run-length encoding, and all the following mask operations are built on run-length encoding scheme. We apply our fast blending system to large scale data sets and present detailed quantitative results compared with OpenCV and Enblend to demonstrate the speed and memory improvements.

Firstly, a general sensing network element ontology description framework has been built, then the primary classes and their hierarchy have been defined, and the concepts and their relationships are described.

To implement different scatterer distributions representing a variable density of random scatterers with or without coherent component, A set of 3D scatterer models are built based on a three-dimensional Hilbert curve following Gamma distributions with different values of shape and scale parameters. The RF data are simulated by using the Field II software. Then the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for statistical histograms of the energy of the RF data is performed to obtain the values of log-likelihood and model parameters. In order to evaluate the fitting performance and parameter meaning of the HK distribution, the mean and standard deviation of these estimated values are compared with those based on the optimal fitting model chosen from commonly used single-distributions (OSD), the K, Rayleigh and Rician distributions. The results show the parameters of Homodyned K-distribution obtained by the MLE could independently represent the clustered, random or uniform characteristics for scatterer distribution. However, the fitting accuracy could only catch up with that based on the OSD joint model under the condition that the tissue contains the scatterers from medium to high effective-density, as well as deterministic or non-deterministic components. The OSD model is still a better choice in the case of the fitting performance emphasized in practice, especially the tissue with a wider range of scatterer densities and deterministic components.

However, there have been far less systematic studies on the accurate performance of the regional PWV measurement along a segment of carotid artery and relevant influence factors. In this paper, an ultrasound simulation model for pulse wave propagation is proposed to investigate the accurate performance of PWV measurement and the influence factors such as beam density and frame rate of ultrasound scanning systemically. 30 sets of B-scan ultrasonic sequence images of carotid artery at different frame rates are simulated for obtaining the corresponding RF ultrasound signals, and then the delay time of pulse wave transit at different locations along the artery segment is calculated by two cross-correlation-based data processes. Finally, the average PWV is calculated from a linear fitting algorithm applied to time-distance relationship of pulse wave. The results show that the estimated PWV of carotid artery based on ultrasound RF signals suffers from errors ranged from 7 % to 11 %. The frame rates of ultrasound imaging decreased from 1127 Hz to 376 Hz do not significantly affect the accuracy of PWV measurements, but decreased to 226 Hz would result in much larger measurement errors. Moreover, the accuracy is higher by the linear fitting algorithm based on the pulse wave transiting time from beam positions apart far away.

Firstly, a geometric vessel-model with stenosis of bilateral symmetry axis is established to get the flow velocity distributions for different degrees of stenosis, and then the Doppler spectra from entire segment of the vessel covered by sound field are calculated. Finally, corresponding maximum frequency locations in the spectra are determined according to a comparison between the maximum values from blood flow velocity distributions and their calculated spectra. The theoretical analysis shows that the maximum frequencies, which correspond to the maximum velocities of blood flow for different degrees of stenosis, locate at different positions in the spectral falling-edge. For the normal vessel, the location is at the middle position of the falling-edge, and down shifts along the falling-edge with the increase of the stenosis degree approximately linearly. The proposed method could be helpful to extract the maximum velocities of blood flow in stenosed vessels.

Instead of scanning the whole dataset, our approach uses an auxiliary index to quickly skip unnecessary data segments, which can efficiently degrade the processing cost at map phase. Moreover, in order to deal with multi-dimension dataset, a converting schema is proposed. It can map multi-dimension data into one-dimension index. The experimental results show that our approach is efficient and lightweight. It can reduce the task running time dramatically with a little storage and maintenance cost.

In order to assess the quality of reviews, we ought to know the factors that have influence on or are related to the quality of reviews. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of reviews on JD.com, one of the famous E-commerce sites in China. We observed the times when users buy goods are highly related to the time when they post reviews. Meanwhile, the level of users is an important factor affects the quality of reviews. On the other hand, users prefer to post short reviews containing the description of the quality and price of the product. Based on a lexical resource containing sentiment annotations, we found sentimental words expressing users' feelings and opinions is one of the key factors that can influence the quality of reviews.

Various favorable techniques have been proposed, but it is believed that the single representations, containing one-sided information of protein sequence, are insufficient for discrimination. To this end, we in this paper propose the fused representations by integrating two single representations, the amino acid composition (AAC) and the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Due to two forms of PSSM, PsePSSM and GreyPSSM, two integrated representations, called briefly AACPsePSSM and AACGreyPSSM, are given. To evaluate the proposed representations, a benchmark data set is employed and the classical K nearest neighbor (KNN) is adopted classifier. And the experimental results show our proposed fusion representations outperform AAC and PSSM.

However, these representations, containing only single characterize of protein, make the information for classification insufficient. Inspired by this fact, we propose two integrated representations by feature fusion method in the expectation of extracting richer information from the protein sequence. Concretely, we combine pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) with position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and then obtain two fused representations, called briefly PseAACGreyPSSM and PseAACPsePSSM. Both the proposed representations, thus, include the protein amphiphilic factors and the biological evolution information. We, with feature vectors of protein samples, adopt the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for predicting. The final experimental results state that our proposed representations are superior to the single feature representations consistently.

However, at present the research which is aimed to develop ethnic Non-Photorealistic Rendering pyrography technology is still very rare. Furthermore, there are problems with lacking corresponding simulation systems, relatively slow rendering speed, a serious loss of image detail and no extension to the video field. Thus, this paper will introduce a new rendering technology of pyrography simulation which is based on multiplication and an interactive pyrography simulation system which can process images and videos. Firstly, in order to get the foreground image, the algorithm will enhance, simulate and equalize the imputed static image. Secondly, by using the texture synthesis technique, the background of the pyrography can be obtained. Finally, to get the ethnic pyrography works, the multiplication will be used to map the foreground image to the background image. Additionally, the system can capture the video and this can be used for pyrography simulation. The final experimental results show that through the interactive operation, the system can make the simulation of static images and video achieve realistic pyrography art effect. The simulation results preserve more detailed information and can show the true color of the image. The operation is simple, but the rendering speed is relatively fast.

The mathematical model was set up and analyzed exactly. Computer simulation shows the theoretical analyses and the experimental results are identical. Furthermore, it accurately demonstrates the performance of system is related to the arrival rate of high priority users.

Many ornamentals in western countries originated from China. This paper presents the biodiversity of native Chinese ornamental plants at ecosystem, species and genetic levels, focusing on species and genetic resources with aesthetic potentials, based on literature studies and authors' participatory investigations. The latest statistics reported 31,362 vascular species (taxa) occurring in China, of which about 6000 species are with gardening values. The diversified ornamental plants become important components of different ecosystems. As the dominant species, some ornamental plants established the plant communities in forests and grasslands, which made the landscapes more colourful and beautiful. Famous representatives were introduced including Camellia, Rhododendron, Rosa, Lilium, Chrysanthemum, Cymbidium and others. Lots of species are with multiple uses in addition to aesthetic values, like medicinal, edible, agricultural or daily life uses. The relationship between biodiversity and cultural diversity of ornamental plants is discussed. Biodiversity of Paeonia, mei flower, Chrysanthemum, sweet osmanthus, Chinese roses and many flowers endowed special meanings to traditional Chinese culture, which enriched cultural diversity. On the other hand, the traditional Chinese culture affected the diversity of ornamental plants. Some potential ornamental plants but underutilized or neglected, including Musella lasiocarpa (Musaceae), Lycoris (Amaryllidaceae), and Leucocasia gigantea (Araceae), are presented. The strategies for conservation and development of Chinese ornamental plants are proposed.

Continuous dimensional representations, such as valence-arousal (VA) space, can represent the affective state more precisely than discrete effective representations. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of VA lexicons using linear regression techniques. One of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes the use of a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) model to predict the valence-arousal ratings of affective words. The locally weighted method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are "local" to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better performance for VA word prediction.	[Wang, Jin; Yu, Liang-Chih; Lai, K.

However, labeled data are difficult to collected but unlabeled data are readily obtained. To solve the lack of labeled data, we utilize the method of transfer learning to build the learning model with the labeled and the unlabeled training examples. Based on the feature spaces of source and target domain, the common space are build. Then, those examples from source domain whose conditional probability is like to be similar to the target domain are selected into the common space. Therefore, the question classifier is trained by the labeled data in the source domain and the unlabeled data in the target domain. Meanwhile, the method of Map/Reduce based on the Hadoop platform is used to reduce the time complexity in kernel mapping. The subtasks are constructed for the mapping process and then the final result is obtained by assembling the subtasks. Experiments on question classification show that the proposed method could improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, the learning model based on the Hadoop Platform could ask each computing resources to reduce the running time.

For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy must be addressed properly. In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named key-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (KP-ABRSC) scheme, which is a combination of identity-based ring signature scheme and key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. In KP-ABRSC, each signcrypted message is labeled by the sender with a set of descriptive attributes and a list of identities of potential senders, while an access structure is embedded in each user's private key by a trusted authority. We give formal syntax and security definitions for KP-ABRSC scheme and construct a KP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. The proposed KP-ABRSC scheme is proven to be indistinguishable against adaptive chosen plaintext attacks under the DBDH assumption and existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the CDH assumption. Finally, we present a cloud-based healthcare framework by exploiting our proposed KP-ABRSC scheme and WBANs, which can ensure data authenticity, confidentiality and non-repudiation, but also can offer participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted medical data.

Due to the coupling between the 'comb' shape parasitic element and the multi-branch radiating element, three frequency bands which are suitable for WLAN/WiMAX are achieved. The simulated results show that by adding the parasitic element, the high frequency end cutoff frequency of the antenna is reduced from 6.89 GHz to 6.0 GHz and a notched band at 3.84-5.02GHz is produced. The overall dimension of the proposed antenna can reach 29x29x 1.6 mm3. The measured results show that the antenna's working frequency bands of S11 <=-10 dB are as follows: 2.29-2.90GHz, 3.30-3.93 GHz and 4.92-6.0 GHz, which well cover both the WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz) and WiMAX (2.3/2.5/3.5/5.8 GHz) frequency bands. By changing the sizes of the parasitic element and the co-ground structure respectively, the adjustment of the three working frequency bands can be realized.

By etching a mixed slots structure on the surface of the radiating patch, the area of it was greatly reduced and the impedance bandwidth was extended. The mixed slots include two semicircle and one rectangular slots. Similarly, through etching a pair of quarter-circle slots and two pairs of mutually perpendicular rectangular slots, it improved the impedance match and minimized the proposed monopole antenna. The antenna has a very compact size of 20x 15x 1.6mm(3). Simulated results show that the proposed antenna could operate from 3.1 to 11.1 GHz for S11 <= -10 dB with stable radiation patterns.

Dual Schottky diode is used as predistorter. The PDC with high bandwidth and small dimension is achieved by removing quarter-wavelength transformers and power dividers. Measured S-parameters show that the PDC can work from 10 MHz to up to 40 GHz. The PDC is verified using two-tone and WiFi signals in an RoF system. The spur-free dynamic range with respect to third order intermodulation distortion is improved by more than 10 dB from 1 to 5 GHz and more than 5 dB from 1 to 30 GHz, and it is found that the RoF system is limited by fifth order nonlinearity. Error vector magnitude is improved by 1 dB for WiFi signals at 2.4 and 5 GHz by using the PDC.

Several solutions to offer efficient key revocation or ciphertext update for identity-based encryption systems have been proposed in the literature. However, how to achieve both key revocation and ciphertext update functionalities simultaneously in identity-based encryption systems is still an open problem. Recently, Liang et al. introduce the notion of cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption (CR-IB-PRE) scheme with the aim to achieve both ciphertext update and key revocation functionalities, and present a CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. In this paper, we first showed Liang et al.'s scheme has serious security pitfalls such as re-encryption key forgery and collusion attack, which lead to revoked users can decrypt any ciphertext regarding their identities at any time period. We then redefined the syntax and security model of CR-IB-PRE scheme and proposed an improved CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. The improved scheme not only achieves collusion resistance, but also takes lower decryption computation and achieves constant size re-encrypted ciphtertext. Finally, we proved the improved CR-IB-PRE scheme is adaptively secure in the standard model under DBDH assumption.

To accelerate execution speed in building high resolution mosaics, the compositing seam is found efficiently via seeded region growing using a photometric criterion. A contribution of this paper is to use seeded region growing on image differences to find possible seams over areas of low photometric difference. This can result in significant reduction of blending time. The proposed method presents several advantages. The using of seeded region growing over image pairs guarantees the approximate optimal solution for each intersection region. The independence of such regions makes the algorithm suitable for parallel implementation. The using of priority queue leads to reduced memory requirements and a compact storage of the input data. Finally, it allows the efficient creation of large mosaics, without user intervention. We also evaluate the proposed blending method with pixel based graph cut and watershed based graph cut to illustrate the performance of the approach on image sequences with qualitative and quantitative comparison.

In this paper, we proposed a new and more efficient polygon fill algorithm based on the scan line algorithm and Grid Fill Algorithm (GFA). First, we elaborated the GFA through solid fill. Second, we described the techniques for implementing anti-aliasing and self-intersection polygon fill with GFA. Then, we discussed the implementation of GFA based on the gradient fill. Generally, compared to other fill algorithms, GFA has better performance and achieves faster fill speed, which is specifically consistent with the inherent characteristics of mobile devices. Experimental results show that better fill effects can be achieved by using GFA.

The 3D spine model was reconstructed by using a freehand 3D ultrasound imaging system. The geometric torsion was then calculated from the reconstructed spine model. A thoracic spine phantom set at a given pose was used in the experiment. The geometric torsion of the spine phantom calculated from the freehand ultrasound imaging system was 0.041 mm(-1) which was close to that calculated from the biplanar radiographs (0.025 mm(-1)). Therefore, ultrasound is a promising technique for the 3D assessment of scoliosis.

Since detected moving object areas are often contain shadow points, errors in measurements, localization, segmentation, classification and tracking may arise from this. A novel shadow elimination algorithm is proposed in this paper. A set of suspected moving object area are detected by the adaptive Gaussian approach. A model is established based on shadow optical properties analysis. And shadow regions are discriminated from the set of moving pixels by using the properties of brightness, chromaticity and texture in sequence.

The cooperative theory and non-cooperative game theory have been used separately for detecting communities. In this paper, we develop a new approach that utilizes both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory to detect communities. The individuals in a social network are modelled as playing cooperative game for achieving and improving group's utilities, meanwhile individuals also play the non-cooperative game for improving individual's utilities. By combining the cooperative and non-cooperative game theories, utilities of groups and individuals can be taken into account simultaneously, thus the communities detected can be more rational and the computational cost will be decreased. The experimental results on synthetic and real networks show that our algorithm can fast detect overlapping communities.

Most existing community detection algorithms are designed for single-relational networks. However, in the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational. In this paper, we propose a coalition formation game theory-based approach to detect communities in multi-relational social networks. We define the multi-relational communities as the shared communities over multiple single-relational graphs, and model community detection as a coalition formation game process in which actors in a social network are modeled as rational players trying to improve group's utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions and coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation could improve the utilities of coalitions merged. We then use a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Experimental results and performance studies verify the effectiveness of our approach.

We first extend the linear threshold model by incorporating the competitive influence spread, obtaining the extended linear threshold model (ELTM). We then give the objective function of selecting the optimal seed set of competing products in a social network, and the objective function is monotone and submodular under the ELTM, thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation ration (where e is the base of natural logarithm). Accordingly, preliminary experimental results verify the feasibility of our method.

For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy issues must be addressed properly. Recently, Hu et al. proposed a fuzzy attribute-based signcryption scheme with the aim to provide security and privacy mechanisms in WBANs. In this paper, we first show Hu et al.'s scheme cannot achieve the claimed security properties. In particular, an adversary is capable of generating private keys for any set of attributes. Then we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named ciphertext-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (CP-ABRSC) by integrating the notion of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with identity-based ring signature. We give formal syntax and security definitions for CP-ABRSC and present a provable secure CP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. Finally, we propose a novel access control framework for WBANs by exploiting CP-ABRSC scheme, which can not only provide semantic security, unforgeability and public authenticity, but also can provide participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted health data.

Many existing data cleaning methods can be used to detect errors in traditional databases, but they fall short of guiding us to find errors in probabilistic databases, especially for databases with complex correlations among data. In this paper, we propose a method for tracing errors in probabilistic databases by adopting Bayesian network (BN) as the framework of representing the correlations among data. We first develop the techniques to construct an augmented Bayesian network (ABN) for an anomalous query to represent correlations among input data, intermediate data and output data in the query execution. Inspired by the notion of blame in causal models, we then define a notion of blame for ranking candidate errors. Next, we provide an efficient method for computing the degree of blame for each candidate error based on the probabilistic inference upon the ABN. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Aiming at the spatial-temporal features of environmental vulnerability, the synthetic evaluation index system was set up, and the synthetic index of environmental vulnerability (EV) was computed for the Yunnan Plateau. The results showed that the EV was at medial level in most regions of the study area. The EV is heavier in the east than that in the west, and heavier in the north than that in the south, while it is relatively lower in the middle. From the year of 1990 to 2000, the environmental quality became worse. However, from the year of 2000 to 2010, the degradation trend of environment for the whole Yunnan Plateau had slowed down. The main driving forces of the EV changes were the rapid population growth and vegetation degradation during the years from 1990 to 2000, while the main driving forces of the EV changes were the governmental environment protection policies and the improvement of social economy and scientific technology during the years from 2001 to 2010.

This paper presents a new approach for copy-move forgery detection where fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is used. First, the 1-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of the forged image is to reduce its dimension. Next, the low frequency the sub-band is divided into overlapped blocks of equal size. The fractional Fourier transform of each block is calculated and the vector of the coefficients is constructed. All feature vectors are sorted using lexicographical order. Finally, the difference of adjacent feature vectors is evaluated and employed to locate the duplicated regions which have the same feature vectors.

Generally, it may derive from the general decline of cortex inhibition, which destroys the balance between excitation and inhibition system in the brain. To date, the optimal fitting model of receptive field size curve is not clear during different age groups. To address this issue, firstly, we carried out extracellular single-unit studies of the receptive field properties of cells in the primary visual cortex(v1) in young and old rhesus monkeys. By IGOR, we obtain the original data of receptive field size curve. Secondly, we use the existing models of Gaussian, DOG (subtractive) and a normalization (divisive) model to fit the data. After that, we found clear indications: The fitting goodness of DOG has a high degree during different age groups and the DOG model has better adaptability and flexibility. In addition, we can draw a conclusion: In aging process, the turning curvature of receptive field size curve of V1 cells changes obviously, and the surround suppression of the receptive field decreases clearly.

Methods: Individual GA content was determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and the transcription levels of the GA biosynthetic genes were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The maximum content for total triterpenoids, GA-T, GA-S and GA-Me was 1210, 16.5, 14.3, 12.5 g/100 mg dry weight, respectively, at the immature stage. The maximum transcript levels for GA biosynthetic genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase and lanosterol synthase were up-regulated by 1.8-, 8.7-, 30.5- and 19.2-fold at the immature stage. Conclusion: The result showed that the content of total triterpenoids and individual GA at the immature stage was higher than that at the primordium and the mature stages. The higher GA content at the immature stage was partially related to increased transcription of these genes. This work will be help for better utilization of fruiting body of G. lucidum and further investigations on the GA biosynthesis regulation.

Recently fair division theory has emerged as a promising approach for the allocation of multiple computational resources among users. While in reality users are not all present in the system simultaneously. Dominant Resource Fairness(DRF) satisfies SI, PE AND EF, but violates SP. We have introduced Multi-level Queue Dominant Resource Fairness (MQDRF), a fair sharing model that generalizes max-min fairness to multiple resource types. MQDRF has lots of good properties, it satisfies DSI, PE, EF and SP. We construct MQDRF mechanisms that provably satisfy properties, and analyze the performance.

Thus, the Web service composition which consists of these services will be necessarily random of the QoS. The requirements of the QoS of Web service composition may not be certainly satisfied. We use a simulation approach named Importance Sampling to analyze the QoS probability of Web service composition in stochastic PERT network. In this paper, we propose a relatively simple distribution function and introduce a weighting function to ensure that the estimating of the target distribution function is an unbiased estimation. We conduct a comparison of Importance Sampling technique with Monte Carlo simulation about the rationality and the operation efficiency based on the actual QoS data of Web services by experiment. The experimental results prove that the Importance Sampling technique has better precision and higher efficiency than Monte Carlo simulation.

Despite these virtues, it suffers from several drawbacks, such as it is unable to determine a reasonable cluster number, sensitive to initial condition and not robust to outliers. In this paper, we present a new approach named density peak spectral clustering (DPSC) which combines spectral clustering with density peak clustering algorithm (DPCA) into a unified framework to solve these problems. Since multi-view data is common in clustering problem, to further bootstrap the clustering performance by using complementary information from different view, then we propose co-trained density peak spectral clustering (Co-DPSC), which is an extension of DPSC to multi-views based on the co-training idea. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on a toy and three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed DPSC and Co-DPSC algorithm.

Feature extraction plays an important role in the accurate classification or location of proteins. Since the contribution of each feature dimension is different, this paper enlarges the contribution of feature dimensions which have great effect on classification by weighting with its Fisher linear discriminant rate. Then k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to classify the testing sample. The result shows that, compared to direct use of KNN algorithm, KNN with LDA dimensional reduction improves the predicting accuracy rate, and the proposed KNN based on Fisher's linear discriminant rate weighting method with LDA dimensional reduction can further reduce the redundance impact and enhance the accuracy of protein localization.

In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words. Experiments on both English and Chinese affective lexicons show that the proposed method yielded a smaller error rate on VA prediction than the linear regression, kernel method, and pagerank algorithm used in previous studies.
