The study aimed to estimate the external costs of silicon production to inform policy on the sustainable exploitation of solar energy. Specifically, the study estimated the cost of health damage and agricultural loss resulting from the pollution of silicon production. The data was collected from a silicon industrial zone in Southwest China. The cost of agricultural loss was estimated using a production function method, while the cost of health damage was estimated using dose-response functions, in which the air pollutant concentration was estimated based on a Gaussian dispersion model.

The light seed colour in rapeseed is associated with improved oil, protein and fibre contents. But there are not reliable and efficient methods to measure seed colour, especially the single seed colour. Two transformations of RGB (red, green, and blue) colour space were used for two seed colour recognition methods, i.e., HSV (hue, saturation, and value) and nine colour model (NCM). Using these two colour space transformations, the performance of the common method on rapeseed colour recognition was compared with the major colour method. The common method obtained the colour recognition accuracy of 83.96% in single seed recognition and 92.72% in sample recognition. The major colour method obtained the colour recognition accuracy of 98.91% in single seed recognition and 100% in sample recognition.

Colomb et al. Then the phase mask is obtained. It must be pointed out that for Fresnel digital holography, the recording distance must be determined accurately before compensating automatically the phase aberration. This is done by an automatic focusing procedure, which is based on image-gray-entropy-method. A special three-dimensional micro object is simulated, which is polluted by a random noise. The percentage error of the recording distance obtained by the focusing procedure is below 0.6 for SNR = 25. Then the accurate phase image is obtained by applying the automatic aberration compensation procedure. The simulation results show that for a hologram with high signal-noise-ratio, the above method is very effective; but for a very strong noisy hologram the procedure fails at all. Moreover, after applying a median filter to the primary reconstructed phase image, the aberration of the phase image obtained by further iteration decreases, at the same time the noise is strengthen. Therefore, the key of digital holography is the recording of high quality hologram.","16","Aberrations","Data processing - Focusing - Holograms - Iterative methods - Median filters - Optical transfer function - Signal to noise ratio - Wavefronts","Aberration compensation - Automatic focusing - Digital holographic systems - Digital holography - Microscope objective - Microscopic imaging - Phase compensation - Three-dimensional information","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 743 Holography - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Model predictive control was applied to optimizing variable speed limit in freeway work zone. The classic macroscopic traffic model METANET was a little modified for simulating the traffic in the work zone, considering the effect of speed limit. One new optimization model for solving the optimal variable speed was proposed, which is a real-time nonlinear controlling model. In the optimization model, the objective function considers efficiency and safety by minimizing the total time spent (TTS) and the speed variation. To solve this optimization model, discretization for time horizon was conducted firstly; on every control time step, SQP algorithm was applied to solve the nonlinear programming in the next; the optimization results were integer conversion for the real speed limit displayed. One example was conducted to prove the efficiency of the proposed model. And some valuable conclusion was obtained.","20","Model predictive control","Accident prevention - Efficiency - Integer programming - Nonlinear programming - Speed - Speed control","Discretizations - Macroscopic traffic modeling - Objective functions - Optimal variables - Optimization modeling - Speed variations - Variable speed limits - Work zones","731.3 Specific Variables Control - 913.1 Production Engineering - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The main idea is that the robustness property of SMC and good response characteristics of PID are combined with fuzzy tuning gain approach to achieve more acceptable performance. For this purpose, in the first stage, a PID sliding surface is considered such that the robot dynamic equations can be rewritten in terms of sliding surface and its derivative and the related control law of the SMC design will contain a PID part. The stability guarantee of this sliding mode PID-controller is proved by a lemma using direct Lyapunov method. Then, in the second stage, in order to decrease the reaching time to the sliding surface and deleting the oscillations of the response, a fuzzy tuning system is used for adjusting both controller gains including sliding controller gain parameter and PID coefficient. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a two-link robot manipulator including model uncertainty and external disturbances as a case study. The simulation results show the improvements of the results in the case of using the proposed method in comparison with the conventional SMC.","18","Controllers","Electric control equipment - Flexible manipulators - Fuzzy control - Industrial robots - Lyapunov methods - Machine design - Modular robots - Proportional control systems - Robot applications - Sliding mode control - Three term control systems - Uncertainty analysis","Acceptable performance - Direct Lyapunov methods - External disturbances - Lyapunov theories - Response characteristic - Robot manipulator - Robustness properties - Two-link robot manipulators","601 Mechanical Design - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 732.1 Control Equipment - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

But, in many applications, these assumptions may be questionable because the true distributions of heterogeneity parameters are usually unknown. To this end, this paper relaxes these assumptions imposed on heterogeneity parameters to develop a nonparametric approach to purchase model and lifetime model, in which unknown distributions of heterogeneity parameters are approximated by a truncated Dirichlet process prior. A nonparametric empirical Bayesian method is developed to obtain Bayesian estimations of unknown parameters in the proposed nonparametric models. The blocked Gibbs sampler is presented to draw observations required for Bayesian inference from the corresponding posterior distributions of the components of parameters.

The following of GP-ELM algorithm consists of two iterative processes. First, the significance of each hidden nodes is estimated and the insignificant nodes are removed. Secondly, the existing hidden nodes are updated by using ELM algorithm. These two processes continue until the stop condition is satisfied such that a reasonably compact network is achieved. Compared against other state-of- The-art algorithms, GP-ELM algorithm has mainly two improvements. First, a supervised training process is integrated into the pruning process such that significance of each hidden node can be estimated more precisely in the next iteration.

The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed in tests of slip detection during grasping. Moreover, the test results indicated that the hardness and mass of the object and disturbing force have very limited impact on the slipping patterns.

This work utilizes Gompertz diffusion model integrated with genetic algorithm to illustrate the extension of foreign direct investment (FDI) from Taiwan to various Chinese areas, including East China, South China, North China, Central China, Northwest China, Northeast China, Mid-west China and Southwest China. In this study, FDI from Taiwan to China is defined as the capital flows from Taiwan into China to buy lands, build factories and recruit employees in China minus the capital flows coming back to Taiwan from Chinese branches. This study aims to utilize Gompertz model to explain why the Taiwanese IC design companies choose different Chinese regions to engage in FDIs. Empirical results indicate that the potential FDI size is the greatest for Taiwan's IC design firm flowing into South China. This is possibly caused by that Taiwanese IC design firms invest into South China earlier than other Chinese areas. In addition, Taiwanese IC design firms tend to imitate other firms when purchasing lands, building factories, recruiting employees and implementing FDIs into China. Our results also demonstrate that the incentive of imitating other firms to choose FDI locations is the most pronounced for firms investing in North China. Because North China is the administration center in China and few factories set up over there, so the number of Taiwan IC design firms investing in North China is fairly small. To avoid risks, the successive IC design firms tend to implement FDIs in North China only when they observe the safety or the profitability of other firm's divisions in North China. Consequently, the imitation effect is the greatest for firms investing in North China. © 2015 IEEE.","14","Integrated circuits","Automation - Employment - Genetic algorithms - Industrial plants - Integrated circuit design - Investments - Technological forecasting - Timing circuits","Design companies - Design industry - Diffusion model - Forecast accuracy - Foreign direct investments - Gompertz model - Non-linear least squares - Product innovation","713.4 Pulse Circuits - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The CDIF uses Stirling's interpolation to generate a number of sigma points for approximating the distribution of Gaussian random variables and does not require the calculation of Jacobians. However, the general CDIF method has difficulties to handle maneuvering objects, due to the changing of system model. In the literature, the IMM method is a natural way to estimate the discontinuities of object motion, by running a bank of filters in parallel with multiple models. Here, our contribution is to use the CDIF in the IMM framework (IMM-CDIF), which has better capabilities to handle maneuvering object tracking problem.

The cell state diagnosis was implemented based on the frequency characteristics of cell resistance, which helps to select the decision strategy. The superheat soft measurement model was given by the analysis and calculation of electrolyte composition after the aluminum fluoride volatilization rate model was built, and it was on-line corrected by the actual measured value. The outputs of the controller were got by the equivalent differential diagram. At last, the decision content was corrected by the prediction of temperature.

The pixels polluted by noise are detected through analyzing and processing the PCNN firing matrix then the noisy pixels are filtered by median filter, which is proved to be effective in removing pepper and salt noise. The window size of the filter and the filtering time for noisy pixels are adaptively determined by calculating the noise intensity of the contaminated image.

This study presents an approach where the connectivity and oscillatory parameters of a CPG network are determined by an evolutionary algorithm with fitness evaluations in a realistic simulation with accurate physics. We apply this technique to a four-link planar walking mechanism to demonstrate its feasibility and performance. In addition, to test the adaptability of the presented method, feedback information is entrained with the best evolved CPG network to realize slope terrain adaptive walking and anti-disturbance capability.
