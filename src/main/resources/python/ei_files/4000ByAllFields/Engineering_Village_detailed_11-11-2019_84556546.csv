However, during construction, the excess pore-air pressure generally dissipates instantaneously while the excess pore-water pressure dissipates with time. This condition needs to be simulated in a constant water content (CW) triaxial test. The study on Yunnan red clay is carried out to investigate the soil-water characteristics and the shear strength characteristics under the constant water content condition. Osmotic technique is used to obtain the soil-water characteristic curve. A series of CW triaxial tests are conducted on statically compacted specimens. The experimental results show that the soil-water characteristic curve has a low air entry value of 7 kPa due to large pores in non-uniform pore size distribution, and a high residual value exceeding 10 MPa. In addition, the initial degree of saturation and net confining stress play an important role in affecting the shear characteristics under the constant water content condition. Finally, a new semi-empirical shear strength model in terms of degree of saturation is proposed and then applied to Yunnan red clay. Simulation result shows that the model is capable of capturing some key features of soils. The model can be used in whole engineering practice range, covering both unsaturated and saturated soils. © 2013 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","31","Shear strength","Pore size - Soil moisture - Supersaturation","Consolidated undrained - Engineering practices - Excess pore water pressure - Red clay - Shear strength parameters - Soil water characteristics - Soil-water characteristic curve - Strength characteristics","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 10-046-14-1, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Foundation item: Project(51068002) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Project(10-046-14-1) supported by Guangxi Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, China Received date: 2012−03−06; Accepted date: 2012−08−24 Corresponding author: MA Shao-kun, Professor, PhD; Tel: +86−13471031572; E-mail: mashaokun@sina.com",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is located at the southern tip of the Yidun island arc belt. It is an important copper-lead-zinc polymetallic metallogenic belt and Indosinian porphyry copper belt in the western region of China. Pulang porphyry copper deposit is a typical representative of the Indosinian porphyry copper deposits. Based on the previous studies, the big data analysis technique was used to make a contrastive study of the ore-forming related granite in Pulang porphyry copper deposit and the global adakite. As a result, 506 element combinations and 127765 overlap ratios were obtained. The result shows that the geochemical data of the Pulang porphyry are basically overlapped with the global adakite, and have similar characteristics with the global adakite. However, the Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn metallogenic elements are significantly higher than those of the global adakite, and although the ratios of REE and Ga to the major element are in the range of the global adakite, they show the phenomenon of an end member in the global adakite. In addition, the adakite associated with porphyry copper deposits are distributed partially in the global adakite, and some or most of the data are out of the distribution range of the global adakite, and with characteristics of low Sr/Cu, Ta/Cu, Al/Mo, Mn/Zn, Mn/Cu, Mn/Mo and Hf, K, Ti, P, Co, Th, Ca/Cu. The farther the data points deviate from the global adakite range, the stronger the alteration and mineralization are, and the closer the relationship with copper and molybdenum mineralization is. The geochemical data mining results can be used as a prospecting indicator, which can provide a new scientific basis for the geological prospecting of the deep and periphery of the Pulang copper deposit. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

It is the only large magmatic PGE deposit in the Sanjiang region. Previous studies show that whether there is a process of crustal contamination of Jinbaoshan intrusion is still an issue of debate, which constrain the understanding of sulfide saturation and ore genesis. It was suggested that most sulfides from the disseminated ores have S S values varying from 1‰ to 2‰ (mantle value), indicating there is no obvious crustal contamination. Combined with published data, this paper reports the S isotopes of the ores with an unusual sulfide assemblage (violarite-pyrite-chalcopyrite), and establishes the relationship among R factor (silicate magma/sulfide ratio), PGE contents and δ34S values by mass balance calculation. Generally, the PGE-rich ores have relatively high R factor (2000-10000) and PGE contents (Ir100: 2429 × 10-9 ∼ 10738 × 10-9), together with mantle-like δ34 S values (1‰∼2‰), in contrast, PGE-poor ores (IrlOO: 449 × 10-9-2017 × 10-9) have low R factors (500 ∼ 2000) and show crustal S isotopic features (δ34S: 4. 4‰-6. 7‰). Besides, compared with sulfide-rich Ni-Cu deposits, Jinbaoshan Pt-Pd deposit has low γOs (21. 9 ∼ 60.5), which is the result of the sulfide droplet mixed with large amounts of magma, consistent with high R factors. It is suggested that the -yOs values of ores cannot reflect crustal contamination degree of the intrusion directly. Thus, it needs to be particularly careful when we apply S-Os isotopes to study magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. Although the δ34S and γOs values of ores are good indicators to evaluate crustal contamination degree, they are also affected by the deposit type (PGE deposit or Ni-Cu deposit) and ore type (PGE-rich ore or PGE-poor ore). The ores have mantle-like S-Os isotopes cannot exclude that the magma did not experience massive crustal contamination. We also need to consider Sr-Nd isotopes and trace element data to study the degree of crustal contamination comprehensively. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

The pseudoleucite is characterized by a variable greyish, greyish-white, and greyish-green porphyritic texture. Phenocrysts are mainly pseudoleucite with small amounts of alkali feldspar and biotite. In an intense event, leucite phenocrysts altered to orthoclase, kaolinite, and quartz.

Orebodies at Relin are mainly hosted by monzogranite porphyry and hornfels with mineralization styles of dissemination and quartz-sulfide vein. LA–ICP–MS zircon U–Pb dating of four monzogranite porphyries yields206Pb/238U ages varying from 83.9 to 79.0 Ma, with four weighted mean206Pb/238U ages of 80.6 ± 0.3 Ma, 82.8 ± 0.3 Ma, 80.9 ± 0.5 Ma and 81.6 ± 0.5 Ma. Re–Os isotope analyses of molybdenite separates from quartz-vein and altered granite ores yield model ages ranging from 84.3 to 81.3 Ma. Geochemically, the ore-related monzogranite porphyries are metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, with an aluminum saturation index of 0.95–1.10. They are moderately rich in alkalis with K2O contents of 3.22–5.47 wt% and Na2O of 2.97–3.93 wt%, belonging to the high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonite series. Low MgO (0.68–1.85 wt%), Cr (8.14–16.67 ppm) and Ni (4.46–12.94 ppm), negative zircon ΕHf(t) values (−9.1 to −2.7) and whole-rock ΕNd(t) values (−7.7 to −5.8), and relatively high zircon δ18O values (5.8–7.3‰) and radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions suggest that the Relin monzogranite porphyries were most likely generated by partial melting of the ancient lower crust. The calculated Hf isotope crustal model ages of 1.5–1.2 Ga and Nd-isotope depleted mantle ages of 1.2–1.1 Ga indicate that the ancient lower crust might belong to the Mesoproterozoic era. In addition, the Relin intrusions display fractionated rare earth element patterns with high (La/Yb)Nand Sr/Y ratios, but low (Dy/Ho)Nratios, indicating a garnet-bearing amphibolite source. Breaking down of amphibole during partial melting of lower crust would generate hydrous and high fO2magmas, which are favorable magmas to form the porphyry Cu–Mo deposit. Positive δ34S values (3.6–4.7‰) of sulfides point to a magmatic source of sulfur and ore-forming fluids in the Relin deposit. These results collectively show that the Relin deposit is a Late Cretaceous porphyry Cu–Mo deposit. Intraplate extension along NNW-SSE-trending sinistral faults and shear zones triggered asthenospheric upwelling and underplating of mafic magma, thus induced the partial melting of ancient lower crust. This explanation might have revealed the mechanisms of ore-forming and magma-emplacement for the porphyry deposits occurred under intra-continental extensional settings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","103","Deposits","Gallium - Geochronology - Isotopes - Magnesia - Melting - Mineralogy - Molybdenum deposits - Ores - Quartz - Rare earths - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Sulfur compounds - Tectonics - Zircon","Isotopic composition - Late cretaceous - Magma emplacement - Northwest Yunnan - Ore-forming fluid - Porphyry deposits - S isotopes - Zircon dating","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: U.S. Geological Survey; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: 2015CB452606, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2015CB452605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province; Number: B07011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: 51200859682, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter; Number: 201606400011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Myelin Project; Number: 12120114013501, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; ","We would like to thank Jun Deng for providing valuable comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

Most previous researchers considered Daping to be a reworked type gold deposit, and the ore-forming fluid to have been a mixture of magmatic and meteoric water. Ore-forming materials were considered to be derived mainly from the diorite host rocks or metamorphic basement by water-rock interaction. Detailed observation and in-situ laser Raman analyses discovered a large amount of fine-grained, highly-crystallized graphite in the auriferous sulfide quartz veins with obvious O peaks and very weak D peaks in the laser Raman spectrum, which suggests that those graphite grains were formed under granulite facies conditions. Isotope analyses show that the (87Sr/86Sr)0and ΕNd(0)of the Daping scheelite, the earliest precipitated ore mineral in the paragenesis, vary between 0.7088 and 0.7112 and - 8.43 and - 6.20, respectively, and were projected in the lower crust field on a (87Sr/86Sr)0versus ΕNd(0)diagram. Noble gases isotopic compositions of fluid inclusions in Daping scheelites were performed by a high vacuum gas mass spectrum, and the results show that the3He/4He ratios are (0.988-1.424) × 10- 6with an average of 1.205 × 10- 6, corresponding to R/Ra values of 0.706-1.018, with an average of 0.898. The40Ar/36Ar ratios are between 1801.8 and 2663.8, much higher than that of the air (295.5);20Ne/22Ne and21Ne/22Ne are 9.600 to 11.56 and 0.028 to 0.0467, respectively, and the respective134Xe/132Xe and136Xe/132Xe are 0.394 to 0.692 and 0.301 to 0.462, demonstrating that ore-forming fluids and materials of the Daping mine derived mainly from the transitional zone between the lower crust and upper mantle. The δD compositions of fluid inclusions in Daping gold deposit are - 60.0‰ to - 85‰, with an average of - 74.5‰, whereas δ18OH2Oare 2.39‰ to 7.59‰, averaging 5.68‰, indicating that the ore-forming fluids consist predominantly of metamorphic fluid, with contributions from mantle-derived primary magmatic fluids. The δ13C compositions of CO2in fluid inclusions of Daping gold deposit lie between - 3‰ to - 6.5‰, suggesting that most of the CO2in the ore-forming fluids was mantle-derived, and part came from the lower crust in the Ailaoshan gold belt. In addition, primitive mantle normalized platinum group elements (PGE) patterns for the auriferous ores are similar to that of the Cenozoic lamprophyre dykes in the gold deposit, but quite different from that of the diorite host rocks, also implying that the ore-forming materials in the Daping deposit derived mainly from the lower crust or even the upper mantle. The new data imply that crust-mantle interaction may have played an important role in the mineralization of the Daping deposit. At around 33 Ma, the middle and lower crust in the Daping area suffered high-temperature and high-pressure metamorphism because of ductile deformation and upwelling upper mantle magmas. The ore-forming fluids enriched in CO2,3He,20Ne and130Xe, generated by granulite facies metamorphism and baking by upwelling upper mantle magmas, were transported to the middle to upper crust along the ductile shear zone along with highly crystallized graphite grains, and finally precipitated auriferous sulfide-quartz veins in brittle structures because of declining temperature, pressure, and subsequent boiling. Daping is a typical ductile shear zone controlled orogenic gold deposit. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At present, the research is more detailed on the evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas in borderland, and evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is one of the important bases for ensuring food security, maintaining border stability, and promoting sustainable economic and social development. With Yunnan Province as an example, on the basis that the special connotations of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas are explained, in combination with the Second National Land Survey, the index system is constructed from 3 perspectives, eco-friendliness, economic feasibility, and social acceptability, and variation coefficient method and comprehensive index method are used to calculate the level of sustainable utilization of arable land and for grading. Research method: Progress in research on evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land is learnt by literature review, and the research area is empirically analyzed by method of comparative analysis and qualitative-quantitative combined method. Conclusions: The arable land in the mountainous areas of Yunnan Province is generally in a state of sustainable utilization. Moderately sustainable and unsustainable cities and prefectures are almost equal, but there is no sustainable city or prefecture. In terms of spatial distribution, the level of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is lower especially in mountains and highlands of the northeast Yunnan, and high mountains, highlands and canyons of the northwest Yunnan. Most of those areas are subject to a level of unsustainable utilization. The level of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is higher in middle and eastern Yunnan. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","23","Sustainable development","Agriculture - Economic and social effects - Food supply - Grading - Land use - Landforms - Surveys","Comparative analysis - Comprehensive index method - Economic feasibilities - Social acceptability - Sustainable cities - Sustainable economics - Sustainable utilization - Variation coefficient","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 481.1 Geology - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 822.3 Food Products - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Previous studies were mainly focused on the petrogenesis of the porphyry, but the studies on the porphyry-skarn deposit have been rarely reported. In this paper, the petrology, EPMA and S-isotope experiments on Laochang porphyry-skarn Mo deposit were conducted to analyze the metallization process and materials sources. The metallization sequence of porphyry can be divided into diagenesis, potassic alteration and silicification stages. Sequence of skarn can identified as prograde, early-retrograde and late-retrograde stages. Porphyry and skarn are both altered in hydrothermal stage. Mineralogy and EPMA analysis show amphibole thermometer have crystallization temperature at 730 ∼ 790° with oxygen fugacity (fo2) at NNO + 1.6 ∼ 2.5, which proves diagenesis stage was hyperthermal and relatively reduced. Biotite thermometer in potassic alteration and silicification stage show porphyry cooling from 650° to 450°, oxygen fugacity rising from QMF + 1.9 to QMF + 2. 5. Gathering of molybdenite in porphyry and precipitation of sulfide in skarn have strong connection to decreasing temperature and increasing oxygen fugacity. Ore body δ34SVCDT(+ 3. 00%e ∼ + 11. 00%) are consistent with none-alternation porphyry, show inheritance directly from initial magma. Sulfides δ34SVCDT(- 1. 96%e to + 1. 99%e) are coincidence with δ34S in porphyry deposits of low oxygen fugacity. This research gives objective and reasonable explanation on metallization mechanism of Laochang Mo-deposit, and provide example for Cenozoic porphyry-skarn system in Sanjiang Tethys.","53","Metals","Deposits - Metallizing - Mica - Molybdenum - Molybdenum deposits - Oxygen - Petrology - Sedimentology - Structural geology - Sulfur compounds - Thermometers","Crystallization temperature - EPMA analysis - Laochang - Metallization process - Orogenic belts - Oxygen fugacity - Porphyry deposits - Western yunnan","481.1 Geology - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 482.2 Minerals - 539.3 Metal Plating - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 944.5 Temperature Measuring Instruments",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To identify the main environmental stressors threatening the subtropical large and shallow lakes, we conducted multi-proxy sediment analyses for Lake Qilu, including the application of physio-chemical (grain size, nutrients) and biological (pigments, diatoms) indicators. Combined with modern meteorological monitoring and lake survey data, we reconstructed a two-century history of hydrodynamic changes, cyanobacteria bloom and lake eutrophication, and identified the driving factors for the succession in diatom community structure. The composition of sediment grain sizes generally remained stable until 1958 with a relatively high content of fine clays before showing frequent fluctuations and a rapid increase of coarse particles after the 1960s. The construction of a catavothre draining project led to a stronger control of water level and hydrological fluctuation in Lake Qilu, resulting in a smaller magnitude of grain size fluctuation and a lower content of sandy components during the period of 1981-2000. More recently, both lake dredging and a continuous decrease of regional precipitation caused strong fluctuations of grain size components and a higher content of sandy sediments. The sediment pigment content, an indicator for lake production, increased slowly since the middle 19th century before showing an accelerating trend after the 1960s. During the period of 2000-2005, the dredging of the shallow lake basin significantly decreased the nutrient release from lake sediments, resulting in an abrupt drop of algal production. The spike of cyanobacterial pigments may suggest the existence of massive cyanobacterial blooming in Lake Qilu around the years of 1998, 2008 and 2012-2013. Multivariate analyses further showed that diatom community composition has significantly shifted several times with a sustained decreasing trend in the percentage of benthic diatoms. While nutrient enrichment played a major role in structuring diatom assemblages over time, the anthropogenic regulation of lake hydrology and habitat availability were also found to synergistically affect the community succession of diatoms. Our multi-proxy results revealed that a combination of increased nutrient control, reduced hydrological regulation and enhanced climate mitigation should be applied altogether for sustainable management and ecological restoration of subtropical large lakes in Southwest China. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","69","Lakes","Chemical analysis - Deterioration - Economics - Eutrophication - Grain size and shape - Indicators (chemical) - Multivariant analysis - Nutrients - Phytoplankton - Sediments - Sustainable development - Tropics - Water levels - Water quality","Algal pigments - Cyanobacterial pigments - Diatoms - Hydrological regulation - Lake sediments - Meteorological monitoring - Socio-economic development - Water quality deterioration","443 Meteorology - 445.2 Water Analysis - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 922 Statistical Methods - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Geochemical characteristics of the metaclastic sedimentary rock show that average contents of the major and trace elements are similar to the upper continental crust (UCC), and the ratios of SiO2/Al2O3and K2O/Na2O indicate that the metamorphic sedimentary rocks have similar maturity, but schist samples may suffer strong weathering. Rare earth element (REE) characteristics and metamorphic protolith restoration diagrams indicate that protolith of the schist of the Mengdong Group complex is clay and argillaceous and the protolith of gneiss is sandstone and greywacke. The chemical alteration index (CIA), composition variation index value(ICV) and plagioclase alteration index (PIA) suggest that the source area of the schist suffered a strong chemical weathering process and the source area of the gneiss suffered a relatively weak chemical weathering process. The ratios of Rb/Sr and Th/U indicate that the set of clastic rock has experienced complicated sedimentary evolution process. La/Th-Hf diagram and sandstone-mudstone suites discrimination plot show that the sediments of metaclastics were sourced mainly from quartzose sedimentary provenance with minor amount of felsic and intermediate igneous rocks. Diagrams of Th-Sc-Zr/10 and La-Th Sc indicate that metaclastics sedimentary rocks of Mengdong Group complex may deposit in the continental island arc environment. Based on the above analyses, the metamorphic sedimentary protolith of Mengdong Group complex is a set of argillaceous rocks and sandstone (greywacke), which experienced strong weathering and complicated sedimentary evolution process, and mainly deposited in the continental island arc environment. It can be concluded that the protolith of Mengdong Group complex may have had a source from Kunyang Group and has an affinity to the Yangtze block. © 2017, Science Press.

According to the mineral deposit model compiled by USGS, the mineral deposit type discovered in the area is determined as mesothermal gold deposit. Together with field observations the mineralization associated elements are determined, which include Au, As, Hg, Ag, Sb, Pb, and Cd. The singularity method and S-A methods provided in GeoDAS GIS were applied to delineate the weak anomalies and mixing anomalies related to gold mineral deposits. Principal component analysis method was utilized to analyze these elements to form two components (PC2 and PC3) which may reflect two different types of mineralization: PC2 dominated by Au, As, Hg, Co, Ni, Cu may be related to mesothermal deposits formed close to the contact of the ultramafic intrusions; whereas the PC3 dominated by Au, As, Hg, Ag, Pb may represent epithermal mineral deposits located in the sedimentary basin away from the ultramafic intrusions. The peaks of scores on these types of composite anomaly maps were delineated and used as training points for utilization of weights of evidence method and fuzzy weights of evidence method, respectively. 16 targeting areas were delineated using fuzzy weights of evidence method and were suggested for further exploration. The detailed comparison of fuzzy weights of evidence method with the ordinary weights of evidence method shows that the former can produce better results with less loss of useful information during construction of discrete evidential layers.","29","Gold deposits","China - Fuzzy rules - Geographic information systems - Mineral resources - Natural resources exploration - Principal component analysis","Anomaly decomposition - Fuzzy probability - GeoDAS GIS - Hydrothermal gold deposit - Mineral resource assessment - Singularity - Weights of evidence method","481.4 Geophysical Prospecting - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 723.3 Database Systems - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Applications (APP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that the annual mean values (mean±SE) of gross primary production (GPPC), net primary production (NPPC) and respiration (RC) of water column (0-3 m) at dock site were 5.40×103±0.64×103, 2.36×103±0.63×103 and 3.06×103±0.82×103 mg O2/(m2•d), respectively.

PPeu increased rapidly during spring and summer, and fluctuated during autumn and winter. No significant difference for PPeu was detected between spring-summer and autumn-winter. The spatial heterogeneity of PPeu was weak in general despite the significant difference in the north-south direction in July and August with plentiful rainfall which might be related to the rainfall and spatial heterogeneity of nutrients input from the basin. Furthermore, although the major influencing factors for PPeu and their relative importance were changed with season, the phytoplankton biomass was the most important factor impacting PPeu during the entire period, and the water temperature was also an important factor during spring and summer. © 2019 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","48","Phytoplankton","Bottles - Docks - Hydraulic structures - Lakes - Rain - Spatial distribution","Gross primary production - Net primary production - Phytoplankton biomass - Primary production - Production modeling - Spatial heterogeneity - Temporal spatial distribution - Water temperatures","407.1 Maritime Structures - 443.3 Precipitation - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 694.2 Packaging Materials - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The Beiya orefield is a composite mineral system with a distinct zoning surrounding the causative intrusions. For instance, the Wandongshan, the largest deposit in the Beiya orefield, exhibits a zoning with 1) porphyry Au–Fe (Cu) orebodies in the cupolas to the intrusions, 2) Au–Fe–Cu skarn orebodies along contact zones between the alkaline porphyritic intrusions and Triassic limestone country rocks, and 3) distal stratiform Pb–Zn–Ag–Au epithermal orebodies. Subsequent Au- and Cu-bearing quartz (ankerite) veins and barren calcite veins overprint the earlier magmatic-hydrothermal zoned ore system. The hypogene orebodies were weathered to form supergene Au ores at shallow levels, which were historically termed “laterite gold” deposits. The 2000 km NWN-striking Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan metallogenic province, located in the Three River Region of western Yunnan, western Sichuan, and eastern Tibet, hosts numerous world-class porphyry and skarn Cu–Mo–Au ores associated with alkaline porphyry emplacement. The Beiya polymetallic Au orefield, a representative example of these ore types, is located close to the Triassic Ailaoshan–Songma suture to the east and formed during Eocene–Oligocene intraplate extension. The distal stratiform Pb-Zn-Ag-Au orebodies are hosted by bedding or detachment faults. Based on exploration data and previous research, and combined with our detailed field investigation and further studies in the Beiya area, we propose a new and comprehensive porphyry–skarn–epithermal deposit model. The model explains the geological setting, ore characteristics, metallogenic zoning, and ore-forming processes of the deposits in the Beiya area. It provides useful insights for further mineral exploration in the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan province for porphyry and skarn Cu-Mo-Au ore systems associated with alkaline magmatism, and may also be applied to other metallogenic provinces within similar continental arc settings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","111","Ores","Calcite - Cobalt deposits - Copper alloys - Deposits - Economic geology - Faulting - Gold alloys - Gold deposits - Lead alloys - Lime - Metals - Mineral exploration - Molybdenum alloys - Silver alloys - Soils - Ternary alloys - Zinc alloys - Zoning","Beiya - Genetic models - Metallogeny - Porphyry - Skarn - Yunnan","481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 12120113093600, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: -, Acronym: UWO, Sponsor: Western University; ","We are grateful to the geologists of the Yunnan Gold & Mineral Group Co., Ltd for their assistance during field investigation.

By means of polarizing microscope, the microstructure of series of weak expansive soil samples is studied, and the classification according to the microstructure features of expansive soils in Yunnan Province is presented. The effects of microstructural feature on expansive soils are evaluated. Moreover, the internal factors for expansion and contraction and the relationship between microstructures and engineering properties of expansive soils were analyzed. The microscopic images show that the arrangement of soil particles can be divided into turbulent flow structures, laminar flow structure, granular structure and cement structure. The constituents of soil particles include matrix, aggregates and transitional links to objects. Due to the loose particles and the large porosity, the water can penetrate and drain out easily to create the necessary conditions for moisture migration of the aggregates, which explains the reason of swell-shrink of the expansive soils based on the microstructure.

Five sampling locations in the Hmzfj channel and four sampling locations in the Srbz channel were selected along outflows of each corresponding channel. The temperature and pH of the sampled waters were measured. The diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria community was studied through phylogenetic analyses of nifH genes. Temperatures of the nine sampling sites in the two hot spring channels in Tengchong range from 40.7 to 86.8 with a pH gradient of 6.5-8.7. Seven nifH gene clone libraries were constructed, and a total of 255 clones were randomly picked and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The obtained nifH gene clones were grouped into 25 OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) at the cutoff of 97% similarity. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria are mainly composed of Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria in the two studied geothermal channels. Diversity indices of nitrogen-fixing bacteria community show no distinct differences among the studied sites. The PCoA (principal coordinates analysis) and cluster analyses illustrate that temperature played an important role in shaping the community structures of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the studied samples.

However, the effects of plastic mulch on soil physical properties are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different plastic mulch patterns (narrow and wide plastic mulch) and rotations (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat and broccoli-zucchini-fallow) on soil physical properties and soil organic carbon content in a vegetable production system at a research station in the region. The experiment comprised four treatments and laid out in the field using randomized complete block design replicated nine times. The soil (0-20cm) under wide plastic mulch retained more water than the soil narrow plastic mulch under the vegetable growing season over 3 consecutive severe drought years. Significant decline (11%) of surface soil (0-5cm) organic carbon was observed in 2012 compared with in 2010, but soil organic carbon and physical properties did not differ significantly between the two different plastic mulch patterns. The higher macro-porosity, aggregate stability, Ksatand lower bulk density in the plastic mulched ridges imply that the conversion from narrow-plastic-mulch to wide-plastic-mulch increases mulched area thereby conserving larger area soil structure in the croplands. Although increased catch crop stubble retention in the furrows apparently improved surface soil macro-porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the autumn rotary cultivation in broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat rotation system has significantly decreased (5%) surface soil organic carbon. The results suggested that continued use of vegetable-cereal crop rotation system, even with stubble retention, may result in loss soil organic carbon. Further research that covers wetter years should be taken to assess effects of vegetable-cereal crop rotation pattern on soil physical properties in this region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","21","Soil conservation","Aggregates - Crops - Cultivation - Hydraulic conductivity - Organic carbon - Porosity - Rotation - Soils - Vegetables","Aggregate stability - Ksat - Plastic mulch - Saturated hydraulic conductivity - Soil organic carbon content - Soil physical property - Soil structure - Vegetable productions","406 Highway Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 632.1 Hydraulics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The hydrothermal alteration of the diagenesis period includes silicification, carbonatization and pyritization, occurred widely in the grey sandstone. There are two alteration subzones in this period: the main subzone and the transitional subzone. The main alteration subzone consists of carbonatization, sericitization, chloritization and the latter weak silicification at the purple-grey interface. Besides, there is also a horizontal metallic mineral zonation in this subzone, i.e., hematite→chalcocite→bornite→chalcopyrite→pyrite from purple stone to grey sandstone. Whereas the banded and veined silicification and carbonation formed in the hydrothermal alteration of tectonic-reworked period occur along the fractures and joint fissures. Taking the purple sandstone as the original rock and Ti as the referential object, samples selected in different subzone from the 1580 m level cross-section are used to calculate the mass balance of migrated components including main elements, trace elements and rare earth elements. The results show that the amount of migrated components in each subzone is consistent with the corresponding mineral assemblages. Moreover, it also reflects indirectly the physicochemical conditions of hydrothermal fluid in different alteration subzones. The condition of diagenesis-period fluid in the purple sandstone was oxidizing and alkaline, while the fluid condition in the grey sandstone should be reducing and acidic; consequently, the interface between purple bed and grey bed was the Eh and pH boundary. The hydrothermal fluid of tectonic-reworked period was strong reducing, weak-alkaline and high temperature. Combined the results of migrated component calculation with the physicochemical conditions of ore-forming fluid, it can be concluded that disseminated stratiform orebodies and veined rich orebodies were formed during the hydrothermal evolution of the two periods, respectively. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Around the Babu ophiolite is a widespread siliclastic rocks dominated sequence, with thin-bedded cherts observed in some locations. These clastic rocks have long been considered to be Triassic turbidity current deposits in spite of absence of reliable fossil and isotopic dating. West to Longlin village, there outcrop coarse sandstone and sandy conglomerate beds nearby the Babu mafic/lutramific rocks. These sandstones contain andesite and rhyolite fragments and display detrital zircon age spectra similar to those of the Late Permian sandstones in Song Hien tectonic zone and Permian sandstones in western Ailaoshan belt, but distinguished from those of the Permian-Triassic clastic rocks of Youjiang and Shiwandashan basins in southwestern South China. The youngest zircon group with ages of ~285 Ma, has geochemical affinities of magmatic zircons crystallized from arc/orogenic settings, corresponding to the occurrence of volcanic rock fragments, indicating a maximum depositional age, and showing an adjacent Early Permian volcanic source. The new findings of chert deposits within a clastic rock section to the east of Babu Village, and the comparison of detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra suggest that the analyzed clastic rocks should be Early Permian rather than Middle Triassic in age and their Permian volcanic source might be related to the subduction of Babu-Song Hien Paleo-Tethyan ocean. © 2017, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

In this paper, to decipher the ore-forming fluid source and ore-forming material, genetic mineralogy characterization of garnet, pyroxene, pyrite and chalcopyrite were carried out and elemental analyses of C, H, O, S and Pb were performed. The results show that the garnet belongs to grossular-andradite, and the andradite was formed prior to grossular; whereas the pyroxene is mainly consisted of sahlite and diopside, indicating that the early acid ore-forming stage had high temperature and high oxygen fugacity. In the Hongshan-Hongniu deposit, the pyrite is enriched in Fe and depleted in S, with Co/Ni>1, suggesting a magmatic hydrothermal source. The garnet yielded δ18O and δD values of 6‰-8.8‰ and -93.1‰-149‰, respectively, and the calcite from massive sulfide ranged in δ13CV-PDBand δ18OV-SMOWvalues of -2.7‰ -2.5‰ and 11.4‰-23.4‰, respectively, suggesting that the magmatic hydrothermal fluid was dominant whilst meteoric water was negligible during mineralization in the Hongshan-Hongniu deposit. δ34S content of the sulfides and quartz monzonite porphyry spanned small ranges from 3.8‰ to 5.6‰, and from 4.7‰ to 7.8‰, respectively, demonstrating that the ore-forming materials were originated from the quartz monzonite porphyry which had a single crustal source with material contribution from the mantle.

The Zhongdian area, an emerging industrial base of copper resources, is located in the northeast of Yunnan province of China. Nineteen porphyry deposits have been founded among the arc island belt and the new discovered Pulang porphyry copper deposit is regarded as exceedingly large scale deposit. Now this area has become a focus area by geologists and mining industries. To find more copper potential area, four scenes of Hyperion hyperspectral data have been acquired in 2003. FLAASH was used to remove atmospheric effects and calibrate the radiation data to reflectance data. Then the SAM classification technology successfully mapped the distribution of jarosite, pyrite, hematite, chlorite, lepidolite,calcite and nontronite based on reference mineral spectral from USGS mineral spectral library. Rock types were also mapped according to the field measurement spectral, and it depicts partial distribution of diorite-porphyry and Quartz-monzonite porphyry which is highly associated with copper deposits. The results show that mineral maps derived from hyperspectral analysis are extremely valuable for exploration, especially in remote sites such as Zhongdian area.","13","Economic geology","Calcite - Copper deposits - Deposits - Hazards - Hematite - Mica - Mineral exploration - Pyrites - Radiation effects - Spectrometers","Atmospheric effects - Classification technology - Diorite porphyries - Hyperspectral analysis - Hyperspectral Data - Partial distributions - Porphyry copper deposits - Spectral libraries","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To promote the development of the biofuel industry, the Chinese central government has set a target that biofuel will account for 15% of transport energy consumption by 2020. The macroeconomic impacts of this policy, however, are unknown. This paper estimates the economic and environmental impacts on Yunnan of meeting this target using a demand-driven input–output model for Jatropha curcas L. biodiesel. The study combines life-cycle analysis and input–output analysis to establish the industrial relationship of the biodiesel sector with other sectors. The results show that meeting the biofuel policy target in 2020 will generate 296,780 thousand job opportunities annually (man-year) and increase household income. Meeting this target will also lower carbon emission by 11.39 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, valued at 2.41 billion Yuan. However, meeting the target will decrease tax revenue by 1.8 billion Yuan and reduce the provincial gross domestic product by 754.95 million Yuan. Thus, the industrialization of J. curcas L. biodiesel can contribute to the development of a green economy and is a positive response to the policies of energy conservation and emission reduction. The promotion of biodiesel production, however, requires a trade-off between economic and environmental targets. © The Author(s) 2018.","42","Industrial economics","Biodiesel - Carbon - Economic and social effects - Emission control - Energy policy - Energy utilization - Global warming - Life cycle - Regional planning","Carbon emission reductions - Economic impacts - Jatropha biodiesels - Life cycle analysis - Output analysis","403.2 Regional Planning and Development - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 523 Liquid Fuels - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 525.6 Energy Policy - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: C176240202015, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 71463065, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71463065) and the project of Yunnan University on the study of energy transition and green economic development (C176240202015).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A superior strain was identified based on acid resistance and bile salt tolerance tests. The fermentation capability of the superior strain was studied in terms of acid production, post-acidification acetaldehyde production, protease activity, and β-galactosidase assay. All three strains were found to be acid tolerant; MDC3-1 showed the strongest acid resistance with a survival rate of 81%; WDC4-1 showed the weakest acid resistance, with survival rate of 52%. However, only SDC4-1 was tolerant to bile, and the survival rate was 81% after being in contact with 0.5% bile salt for 4 hours. Therefore, SDC4-1 was considered the superior strain. In the fermentation test that followed, SDC4-1 strain showed a perfect curd consistency and the fermented yoghourt was rich in flavors. Additionally, high viable count was noted during the storage period, reaching 9.79 lg CFU/g after a 15-day cold storage, which is far more than the national standard. SDC4-1 showed increased rate of acid production, where acidity reached 82.0°T after 13 hours. Meanwhile, SDC4-1 exhibited good post-acidification, good acetaldehyde-producing ability, strong proteolytic activity, and high β-galactosidase production (up to 7.7 μg/mol), while maintaining stable yoghurt quality during cold storage. Therefore, the selected strain, SDC4-1, showing good fermentability, can be considered for use in the preparation of fermented food. © 2015, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

Orebodies of the deposit occur in clastic-carbonate rocks of Tianpeng Formation and Longha Formation of the middle Cambrian System above the Bainiuchang concealed granite of the late Yanshan period. The concealed granite has the characteristics of tin-bearing granites. Abundance of the mineralization elements Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag and Sb is high in the granitic rocks. Sulphur isotope data of the metal sulphides indicate that most sulphur is derived from the magmas. The ores are similar in rare earth element(REE) patterns to the granitic rocks. The granitic magma activity results in ore-bearing structures. Rocks of the Middle Cambrian System above the concealed intrusion suffer from skarnization, hornfelsing, marbleization, siliconizing and carbonatization. The mineralization elements Sn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag and Sb successively appear from the top of the granite to surrounding rocks.

The dip term in the formula represents the fitting dip angle, which represents the overall offset of the surface and the locking-sliding boundary on the fault, and its value is often smaller than the near-surface measurement of dip angle. It was applied in the profile analysis of the main strike-slip fault deformation characteristics of the eastern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block before and after the Wenchuan earthquake by using the improved formula as the fitting formula of the fault profile analysis. The fitting results obtained are consistent with those obtained by other methods. The improved formula reflects the deformation of the fault more objectively than the original one.

The Tongchanggou deposit is a newly discovered porphyry-skarn type Mo-Cu deposit in the southern Yidun Terrane, with proven reserves of 142. 5 Mt. Skarn extensively exposed in the Tongchanggou district, with skarn-type ore being the most important ore type. Based on the mineral assemblages and paragenesis, Tongchanggou skarn can be divided into garnet skarn, diopside skarn and tremolite skarn. Detailed adit mapping and drill-hole logging suggest that the skarn mineralogy at Tongchanggou is controlled by the spatial distribution of granodiorite and marble: 1) it develops diopside skarn → tremolite skarn → garnet skarn upward or downward from the marble, 2) the grain size of garnet turns to be larger from top to bottom along the drill-hole, and 3) Mo-Cu mineralization is associated with retrograde altered minerals such as tremolite and epidote, thus orebody usually develop in the outer contact zone between granodiorite and marble. The dominant garnet at Tongchanggou occurs as euhedral grain or granular aggregates, and is dark and isotropical. The compositions of garnet are mainly grossularite (62. 2 ∼ 78. 3), followed by and radite (16.7 ∼ 34. 2), with minor spessartite, almandine and pyrope. The Fe2+/Fe3+ratios of garnet from Tongchanggou deposit are varying from 0. 00 to 0. 20, with an average value of 0. 06, indicating a relatively oxidative environment for the formation of garnet. The δ18OSMOWvalues of garnet are ranging between 5.1%‰ and 9. 5%‰, indicating that skarn might have directly inherited the oxygen isotope compositions of granodiorite. Additionally, sulfides are characterized by uniform S-Pb isotopes, with δ34S(CDT)valuesof 0. l%‰ ∼ 1. 4%‰,206Pb/204 Pb ratios of 18. 332 ∼ 18. 694,208Pb/204Pb ratios of 38. 454 ∼ 39. 088, and207Pb/204Pb ratios of 15. 588 ∼ 15. 663, indicating that the ore-forming fluids and materials of Tongchanggou deposit originated from crust-derived felsic magmas.","72","Ores","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Copper deposits - Deposits - Garnets - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Marble - Mineralogy - Molybdenum alloys - Proven reserves - Rock drills - Silicate minerals - Sulfur compounds - Tectonics","Granular aggregates - Mineral assemblage - Northwestern Yunnan - Ore-forming fluid - Oxidative environment - Oxygen isotope composition - Skarn - Stable isotopes","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In view that there has been so far no quantitative test method for thioarsenic species in China, a hydrogeochemical code, PHREEQC, with its wateq4f. dat database being updated by the latest thermodynamic data for thioarsenicals, was used for calculating the arsenic species distribution in various types of hot springs from the Rehai hydrothermal area located in the Tengchong geothermal belt, Yunnan Province. The results show that the major species of arsenic in the Rehai hot springs is thioarsenate, arsenate and arsenite comes second, and the thioarsenite concentrations are extremely low; the descending order of thioarsenate species in terms of their average percentages is: monothioarsenate, trithioarsenate, tetrathioarsenate, and dithioarsenate. pH, Eh and total sulfide concentration are the controlling factors for the arsenic speciation in hot springs. Under acidic condition, the main species of arsenic are thioarsenate and arsenite, whereas under neutral/weak alkaline conditions, thioarsenate is predominant with arsenate being the second most important species.

Energy-saving and emission-reduction policies have been proposed in the government's Five-Year Plans (FYPs) to achieve sustainable development. Yunnan (YN) province, which is in its economic infancy, is facing industrial structure adjustment and is a typical case of severe environmental degradation. In this study, a decoupling analysis was conducted to explore the performances of economic growth and environmental pressure during the period from 2006 to 2016. The author of this paper made an innovative use of the pollutant discharge fee (PDF) as the measure of environmental pressure and Gross domestic product (GDP) as the measure of economic growth. The trend analysis and decoupling analysis revealed that although YN has already transformed from a weak decoupling to a strong decoupling state in the long term, stable and strong decoupling cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there was consistency between the decoupling conditions and the FYP cycle, all of which indicated that there was a shift from the target emissions to non-target emissions during the 11th (2006–2010) and 12th (2011–2015) FYPs. Thus, a single index for evaluating pollutant emissions cannot be adopted effectively to achieve adequate pollutant emission reduction. In addition, three industrial structures were considered in the decoupling analysis, which indicated that the tertiary industry will be a new key area for emission reduction, and the emissions of secondary industries have also been reduced. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","45","Industrial economics","Emission control - Energy conservation - Sustainable development","Decoupling analysis - Emission reduction - Gross domestic products - Industrial structures - Pollutant discharges","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,"Number: 2016FD059, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: KKSY201508012, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: KKSY201408044, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 20172ZX160, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2015Z118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 71463034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71263030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51504217, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51464044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71463034 , Project No. 71263030 , Project No. 51464044 , Project No. 51504217 ), the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (Project No. 2015Z118 , Project No. 20172ZX160 ), the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (Project No. 2016FD059 ), and Kunming University of Science and Technology (Project No. KKSY201408044 , Project No. KKSY201508012 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the deposit, abundant Eocene lamprophyres have been infiltrated by ore fluids to produce carbonate veins with zones of disseminated fine-grained gold-bearing pyrite and arsenopyrite on both margins of the veins. Primary phlogopite, K-feldspar and magnetite have been altered to carbonate, sericite and fuchsite. Carbonate minerals and sericite in altered lamprophyre have higher Mg contents than in other host rocks, reflecting the primitive geochemistry of the lamprophyres. Since carbonatization is the primary alteration type in the lamprophyres, whose main primary components are low-Ca phlogopite and K-feldspar, the CaO content of the lamprophyres reflects their degree of alteration. As alteration increases, incompatible element ratios remain essentially constant whereas Sr is enriched with Ca. In addition, Au with Co, Ni, As, Ag, Sb, and Bi are enriched, reflecting the addition of these metal elements during alteration of the lamprophyres. Altered lamprophyres have slightly lower 143Nd/144Nd (t) (0.51240–0.51253) and substantially higher 87Sr/86Sr (t) (0.70716–0.71234) than unaltered or weakly-altered lamprophyres, indicative of crustal contamination. The auriferous ore-forming fluids are thus interpreted to have migrated upwards and interacted with the sedimentary host rocks before altering the lamprophyres. Lamprophyres commonly show a close spatial and commonly temporal association with orogenic gold deposits worldwide. At Zhenyuan, the lamprophyres shared a common deep source to the auriferous ore fluids but did not themselves contribute to this fluid or its gold content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","85","Gold deposits","Carbonation - Deposits - Feldspar - Geochemistry - Magnetite - Mica - Potassium compounds - Pyrites - Sedimentary rocks","Carbonatization - Crustal contamination - Gold-bearing pyrite - Incompatible element - Ore fluids - Orogenic gold deposits - Temporal association - Yunnan province","481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 802.2 Chemical Reactions",,"","This research was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (2016YFC0600307), the National Key Basic Research Development Program (973 Program; 2015CB452606) and the fundamental research funds of university teachers (No. 53200959708).

In order to evaluate the risk level for a certain unit efficiently, ten factors, representing physical changes in energy, mass quantity and trigging conditions of debris flows, are taken into account with two different models: a weight model and a square root model. The two models are used to examine physical risks of debris flow in the Dongchuan district of Yunnan Province, China. We found that the weight model is better than the square root model in terms of agreement between observation and modeling. Four socioeconomic indicators are introduced into investigating economical conditions. Physical risk and economic factors are considered as a whole for the comprehensive risk assessment. Modeling results concluded that the integrated risk of debris flow within the study area can be divided into four risk-scale levels: 'most severe risk areas', with a total area of about 133 km2, encompassing about 79% of the total debris flow gullies identified; 'severe risk areas', about 579 km2 encompassing 19.8% of the debris flow gullies; 'moderate risk areas', about 723 km2 encompassing 1.2% of the debris flow gullies; and 'no risk', about 118 km2, without debris flow gullies.

The ore bodies oeeur as statiform-like along the strata, and the ore-hearing wall-roeks are mainly skarns. 'Il>e geological, geophysical, geochemical prospecting and remote sensing interpretation evidences all showed that the concealed roek body existed in the deep. While the inferred hidden body and the accurate mineralization age hasn' t been found and obtained in the known deposit, thus the ore genesis still remains controversial. This research discovers that there is an obvious Symbiotic relationship between rhodonite and iron, lead-zinc, and copper ores. In addition, the amount and grain size of rhodonite gradually increase down the deep. All these phenomena ohserved in the deposit are of great significance for us to undeistand the origin of it. Major, trace, rare earth elements and H-0 isotope compositions of the rhodonite are studied in this paper, with the rults that the rhodonite mainly comprises SiO2of 47. 01%∼ 48. 66%, Mn() of 34. 42% - 40. 19%, CaO of 7. 52% ∼ 8. 51 %, FeC) of 2. 85% ∼ 8. 76%, MgO of 0. 22% ∼ 0. 28%, and lower TiO2, and Al2O3. The incompatible elements (such as Li, Be, Sc, Zr, Bb, Sr) are not depleted, or weakly depleted in the rhodonite; while some compatible elements including Cr, (x>, and Ni are obviously depleted; the BFEs' total contents of both rhodonite and sphalerite are lower δDV.SH0W and δ18sOH20values of the rhodonite range from -81. l%c to -73.3%c, 5.4%c to 6. respectively, which are all plotted within magmatic waters' area on the 5l)v.S|,o∗ diagram. Y/Ho value of ore minerals is relatively identical to the surrounding Yanshanian granites such as Zhibenshan and Caojian. All of tlie above-mentioned features demonstrate that the metallogenic fluids of Luziyuan deposit are characterized by the deep magmatic hydrothermal solutions.

In this paper, we carry out a systematic study of the petrography, whole rock geochemistry, zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotope for the Lianhuashan intrusion, which is located in the southeast of the Lanping Basin, the northern part of the Indo-China Block. Our results demonstrate that the Lianhuashan intrusion is mainly composed of quartz monzonite porphyries. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb dating shows that the Lianhuashan intrusion was emplaced at ∼ 34Ma. The rocks show shoshonitic affinity, with high total alkali (Na2O + K2O =9. 0% -9.2%), and potassium (K20/Na2O = 1. 0 ∼ 1. 2). They are also enriched in LILEs (Th and U) and LREEs ((La/Yb)N= 22 ∼ 24), but relatively depleted in HFSEs (Nb and Ta). Based on the above-mentioned data, it is suggested that the magmas for the Lianhuashan intrusion were derived from an enriched source region ever metasomatized by oceanic slab subduction. Zircon Em(t) values range from + 1. 4 to +4.6, mostly clustering between + 2. 8 and + 4. 0, corresponding to Hf crust model ages (tDM2) ranging from 1027Ma to 815Ma and mainly clustering between 934Ma and 860Ma.

An outcrop of Santaishan ophiolites tectonically located in the Gaoligong-Ruili fault zone and exposed as part of an accretionary complex, consist mainly of dunites and harzburgites that are dominated by Mg-peridotites (Fo=90-93), enstatite (En=89-92) and Cr-spinel (Cr#=54-78). Highly depleted modal, mineral and bulk rock compositions of the dunites and harzburgites indicate both rocks were residues from high degree partial melting (25%-35%) in the spinel stability field. These rocks, lacking typical MORB-type chondrite-normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns, display a pattern of slightly enriched LREE and weak depletion of HREE. These characteristics, combined with the rocks' mineral and whole-rock compositions, which lie between those of abyssal and forearc peridotites, imply that the selective enrichments of LREE and Pb were the result of melt-rock interactions. This study suggests a two-stage model for the genesis of peridotites, i.e., these rocks originated from a MORB upper mantle source and were subsequently trapped to form part of a mantle wedge above a subduction zone. Comparative observations on the ophiolitic massifs along the entire YZSZ (Yarlung Zongbo Suture Zone) further suggest that the tectonic setting of the Santaishan ophiolites is similar to YZSZ. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

It contains abundant Pt-Pd resources and is a large magmatic PGE deposit in the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP). The complex is mainly composed of wehrlites with ore body presented as stratoid or lentoid in wehrlites. Mantle is the most important source of forming the Ni and PGE deposits, thus the study of Ni, Cu and PGE geochemical behavior is important for understanding the genesis of magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. In this work we determined the PGE and Sr-Nd isotope contents in wehrlites from the Jinbaoshan intrusion. Combined with PGE studies on different series of rocks in the ELIP and research on the Dsul/sil for Ni, Cu and PGE by previous researchers, we suggest that the primitive magma is formed by moderate to high degrees of melting (25% -40%), resulting in 12.8 ppb Pd, 9.8 ppb Pt, 0.6 ppb Rh, and 0.7 ppb Ir, close to the contents of the ELIP picrite. The Jinbaoshan intrusion has experienced 10% -20% crustal contamination from the Yangtze upper crust during magma evolution. Based on the batch partial melting formula and Dmineral/melt parameters for the PGE, the PGE contents of Jinbaoshan mantle were calculated to be 5.3×10-9 Pd, 7.5×10-9 Pt, 0.75×10-9 Rh, and 1.5×10-9 Ir. Compared to primitive mantle, the mantle of the Jinbaoshan intrusion does not show obvious PGE enrichment. Therefore we may conclude that a large magmatic PGE deposit could be formed by moderate to high degrees of mantle melting accompanied by large scale mixing of magma and sulfides. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

The current study focuses on five major aspects that are closely related to the protection and management of plateau wetlands in Yunnan Province, China, including wetland monitoring and assessment, ecological restoration practice, the establishment of protection and management system, cross-sector communication and cooperation, and the development of public education programs. Also, based on lessons from successful experiences in wetland protection and management on a national and international scale, as well as an analysis of current situation and existing problems in current practice of protecting plateau wetland in Yunnan Province, we put together some suggestions to help protect and manage these precious wetlands in Yunnan from the perspective of sustainable development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","16","Wetlands","Air pollution - Biodiversity - Ecosystems - Sustainable development","Current practices - Ecological restoration - Ecosystem functions - Existing problems - International scale - Monitoring and assessment - Protection and management - Public education programs","451 Air Pollution - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems",,"Number: 111403, Acronym: SWFU, Sponsor: Southwest Forestry University; Number: 31460158, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31460158, 31760175), and the Scientific Research Foundation of Southwest Forestry University (111403).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Granitic magmatism within the Baoshan Block has been considered weakly active due mainly to very limited exposures during the Himalaya orogenic episode. The geochronological study on the buried Shuangmaidi granite has confirmed the existence of the Cenozoic granitoids in the Baoshan Block. The present study indicates that: (1) It is medium- to coarse-grained two mica phyric granite, characterized by high SiO2 (73.55%-77.16%) and low CaO (0.34%-1.38%) contents, with a total alkalis (K2O+Na2O) of 5.22%-8.03%, K2O/Na2O ratios of 0.24-1.79, and total rare earth elements (ΣREE) of the granite between 85 and 125 ppb. All samples are enriched in light REE and exhibit medium negative Eu anomalies; and they show pronounced negative anomalies in Ba, Sr, Ti, and Nb but significant positiv;;e anomalies in K, Rb, U, Th, and Pb on mantle-normalized trace element patterns, indicating typically peraluminous to strongly peraluminous S-type granite. (2) The zircon SHRIMP U-Pb ages of the granite are 36.27±0.48 Ma for the samples from ZK7-1 and 35.78±0.49 Ma for those from ZK0-1, respectively. The similar zircon ages from these two drill cores may suggest that the granite samples come from the same buried pluton. (3) 206Pb/204Pb values of the granite vary from 20.115 to 25. 359, 207Pb/204Pb from 15.776 to 16.160, and 208Pb/204Pb from 39.236 to 41.285, showing the characteristics of radioactive lead anomaly of the upper crust. The (87Sr/86Sr)i values calculated on the average age of the two-mica orthoclase granite (36 Ma) range from 0.72524 to 0.77503 and e{open}Nd(t) values vary from -10.9 to-11.7.These data, along with the depleted-mantle Nd modal ages of 1.73-1.80 Ga, imply that the granites might have formed from partial melting of the Precambrian crystal basements. (4) On the Hf-Rb-Ta diagram, almost all the samples fall within the field of post-collision tectonic setting. The CaO/Na2O and Al2O3/TiO2 ratios suggest that the granitic magma may have formed from partial melting of clay-rich crustal materials with a possible melting temperature of about 900°C and a possible crystallization temperature of 775-795°C. (5) During the post collision of the Himalaya orogen, with the southeastward extrusion of the Indochina continent resulting from the continuous northward indentation of the India continent into the Asia, the Gaoligong Fault, as the western boundary of the Indochina continent, moved in the dextral strike-slip on a large scale to trigger partial melting of the thickened crust, and the peraluminous granitic magma from which the Shuangmaidi two-mica orthoclase granite derived was formed. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","72","Granite","Barium - Core drilling - Europium - Gallium - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Hafnium - Lead - Melting - Mica - Neodymium - Rubidium - Shellfish - Silicon compounds - Sodium - Strontium - Structural geology - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Zircon","Baoshan Block - Cenozoic - Coarse-grained - Crustal materials - Crystallization temperature - Drill core - Granitic magmas - Granitoids - Himalayan post-collision orogenic setting - Himalayas - Magmatisms - Partial melting - Peraluminous - Petrogenesis - Post-collision - Precambrian - southwestern China - Tectonic settings - Trace element patterns - U-Pb ages - U-Pb geochronology - Upper crust - Western boundary - Western yunnan - Zircon age","549 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 531.1 Metallurgy - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 511.1 Oil Field Production Operations - 481.2 Geochemistry - 481.1 Geology - 461.9 Biology - 482.2 Minerals",,"Number: 2006BAB01A03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2006BAB01A01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 40972232, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40772197, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We sincerely thank Prof. Mo Xuanxue, Prof. Wu Cailai, and two anonymous reviewers who carefully read through this manuscript and made insightful suggestions.

Three granitic gneisses from south nabang, west and southeast of Tongbiguan have the weighted mean206Pb/238U ages of 55.0±0.5 Ma (10DX-66B), 50.4±1.3 Ma (10DX-56B) and 51.6±1.1 Ma (10DX-67), respectively. 10DX-66B sample gave positive ΕHf(t) values of 5.2±1.0 with tDM2modal ages of 0.63~1.04 Ga and 10DX-67 yielded negative ΕHf(t) values (-3.8±1.1) and high tDM2ages (1.12~1.55 Ga). Our data indicate that the granitic gneisses at the Nabang-Tongbiguan area were crystallized at 50~55 Ma rather than Precambrian. In combination with the available data, it is proposed that the Pan-African orogenic and Cretaceous magmatic events probably spread to the Naban area and the collision between Eurasia and India plates might have been initiated since 50~55 Ma.","49","Geochronology","Binary alloys - Hafnium - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Silicate minerals - Structural geology - Zircon","Eurasia - Granitic gneiss - Isotopic composition - Isotopic data - Nabang area - Weighted mean - Western yunnan - Zircon U-Pb geochronologies","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Development is now underway. Previous studies have reported that the Yangla copper deposit is a VMS-type deposit related to the Yangla volcanic rocks. Volcanic bulk-rock analyses shows high contents of Si (49.3%-58.7%), Na2O (Na2O=3.3%-4.9%), MgO (MgO=3.7%-8.6%), and CaO(CaO=6.8%-9.0%), low TiO2(TiO2=0.9%-2.1%) and K2O(K2O=0.2%-1.4%) contents. The geochemistry of the volcanic represent forearc basalts. Four molybdenites samples from the ore bodies in the deposit yield Re-Os model ages ranging from 229.7±3.3Ma to 233±3.4Ma. The REE distribution patterns and the primitive-mantle-normalized trace element patterns of the volcanic rocks are similar to the ores, indicating the Yangla copper deposit are closely associated with the Yangla volcanic rocks. The results contribute to our understanding of the genesis of the Yangla copper deposit and will guide further exploration in the region. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","31","Volcanic rocks","Binary alloys - Copper deposits - Deposits - Geochemistry - Magnesia - Osmium alloys - Rhenium alloys - Sodium compounds - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Volcanoes","Bulk rocks - Distribution patterns - Forearc - High-content - Ore bodies - Trace element patterns - Western yunnan","481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 2009CB421003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: B07011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The research was jointly supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2009CB421003 , 2009CB421005 ) and by the 111 project (Grant No. B07011 ).

At the depth of No.2 and No.4 ore bodies in the SW direction of the No.15 level in the Fengshan copper deposit there are prospecting potential. The orebodies on the longitudinal projection profile of orebodies for the Fengshan copper deposit have features of 'ladder, en echelon, parallel and equidistance'. There are 3 'ladder and blank' belts and 4 ore bodies belts appear alternatively and paralleled inclining. It could be speculated that the 4 blank areas among 'ladder and blank' are the favorable prospecting segments. From the scale of 1500 tectono-geochemical mapping in the south of No.24 exploration line on the No.15 level, anomalous areas of Cu and 'Cu-In-Bi-Hg-Sb' have been delineated. The SW part in the depth of No.IIand No. anomalous areas is the key prospecting targets. The result is consistent with the orientation prognosis of ore bodies. It would provide good indicative significance for the depth prognosis in the south of the Fengshan copper deposit. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Then, the noisy phase is multi-looked and smoothed by four phase filtering algorithms. The most appropriate filtering method is chosen by evaluating the filtered phase. Subsequently, the Goldstein's branch cut method guided by residues grouping is employed to derive the unwrapped phase. Ultimately, both the gradient-jump point number and its distribution are utilized to evaluate the unwrapped results and identify errors in unwrapped phase. © 2017 IEEE.","9",,,,,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Using the tectonic lithofacies mapping methods, the characteristics of alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro stock and its intrusive structure system for the ore-controlling patterns were studied in the Baixila area. It may be supposed that the IOCG-type orebody was located nearby the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions including the stock, apophyse and dykes, paleo-volcanic tectonics, cryptoexplosive breccias, and system of fault-fracture zone structure with multiperiod-superimposition. First, all of them are the ore-hosting structure patterns of the IOCG-type orebody. Secondly, the deep iron-copper orebody belongs to iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) type which may be related to the alkaline dyke (apophyse) in the Baixila ore district. Finally, the locations of structure-hydrothermal fluid coupling with extensive fluid-rock reaction, resulting ore-bearing altered tectonic lithofacies zone, might be the brittle-ductile shear zone of the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions, hydrothermal breccia, and fault-fracture zone. The ore-hosted structure patterns of the IOCG-type orebody consist of the expansion of the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions, bottoms of the strolling part of the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions, the attitudes transformation part of the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions, crypto-explosive breccias, and fault-fracture zone. Therefore, the signs of direct prediction for the IOCG deposits are the transient phase of the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions, the ore-bearing altered tectonic lithofacies zone and the lithofacies of ore-bearing crypto-explosive breccias enclosed the alkaline Ti-Fe-rich gabbro intrusions. It may be predicated that there is a large-size IOCG deposit at the depth of the Baixila area. There are two pinpoint targets in the Baixila area, one target is at the depth of Baixila ore district to Zhonglaolong ore district, and another is at the deep part of the north flanker of the Baixila to Yabaxia overturning anticline-fault zone. These gargets are higher in potential exploration for the large-size IOCG deposit in the future. ©, 2014, Science Press.

However, the soil environmental monitoring data of the province lacks a unified warehousing standard, and a spatial database of soil environmental quality has not been established to integrate and standardize the data. Based on the research and reference to the relevant standards of soil database construction method and management at home and abroad, GeoDatabase is used as the spatial data model, and the conceptual model, logical organization model and storage model of Yunnan Province soil environmental quality database are designed by using Oracle and ArcSDE technologies. In order to accurately reflect the spatial location of the soil sampling points and the characteristic properties of the samples, and to ensure the uniqueness and rationality of the primary key in the data table, this paper designs the coding of the soil environmental quality database. The construction of soil environmental quality database in Yunnan Province realized the seamless integration of spatial data and attribute data, and provided comprehensive and accurate basic data and scientific decision support for soil pollution prevention and soil ecological restoration in Yunnan Province. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","10","Environmental technology","Database systems - Decision support systems - Digital storage - Information management - Manufacture - Monitoring - Soil pollution - Soils","Characteristic properties - Design and implementations - Ecological restoration - Environmental Monitoring - Environmental monitoring system - Environmental quality - Scientific decisions - Seamless integration","454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.3 Database Systems",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
