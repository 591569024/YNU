First, the macroblock-based inter-view prediction is not employed for the non-anchor pictures of B-views, if the temporal correlation of the corresponding GOP unit is strong enough. Second, when the disparity estimation of a macroblock is performed, the search range is adjusted according to the mode size distribution of the neighboring view.

In this study, we examined this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of farrerol on the systolic blood pressure, heart rate and body weight in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and its normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) control strain of 12 weeks of age for a duration of 20 weeks. Aortic media thickness were examined as they are the cardiovascular parameters that are directly associated with increased blood pressure. Plasma biochemical indices were also performed to assess whether these parameters were affected.

Graphic Processing Unit technology was used to accelerate the computation of the tissue model. The results demonstrated that the decrease in L-type Ca2+current, ICaL, and rapidly activated K+current, IKr, could bring about the cessation of rhythmic firing. T-type Ca2+current, ICaT, and hyperpolarization- activated funny current, If, had effects on sinus rates, but their downregulations had little impact on automatic diastolic depolarization.

Here, we successfully generated 11 transgenic rhesus monkeys (8 first-generation and 3 second-generation) carrying human copies of MCPH1, an important gene for brain development and brain evolution. Brain-image and tissue-section analyses indicated an altered pattern of neural-cell differentiation, resulting in a delayed neuronal maturation and neural-fiber myelination of the transgenic monkeys, similar to the known evolutionary change of developmental delay (neoteny) in humans. Further brain-transcriptome and tissue-section analyses of major developmental stages showed a marked human-like expression delay of neuron differentiation and synaptic-signaling genes, providing a molecular explanation for the observed brain-developmental delay of the transgenic monkeys. More importantly, the transgenic monkeys exhibited better short-term memory and shorter reaction time compared with the wild-type controls in the delayed-matching-to-sample task. The presented data represent the first attempt to experimentally interrogate the genetic basis of human brain origin using a transgenic monkey model and it values the use of non-human primates in understanding unique human traits. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Because the invariant moments is not so sensitive to various transforms such as translation, rotation and scale changes, we can robustly track the moving object by observing particle filter values based on Baysian probability of pre-distribution and post-distribution.

The stability-equation method accompanied with parameter plane method provides a useful tool for the establishment of necessary conditions to sustain a limit cycle in the constructed limit cycle surface. The portrayed surface characterizes clear relationship among limit cycle amplitude, frequency, transport delay, and the controller coefficients to be designed. The asymptotic stability region, the unstable region, and the limit cycle region are identified in the parameter plane. The variation of the transport lag which could accelerate the generation of limit cycles is investigated. A feasible stable region is characterized in the parameter plane to allow flexible choice of controller gains. The quenching of limit cycle is achieved by selecting controller gains from the asymptotic stability region. It is seen that the friction-induced limit cycles can be effectively quenched via the tuning of the controller gains.","14","Controllers","Asymptotic stability - Control system analysis - Flight control systems - Friction - Nonlinear control systems - Quenching","Controller coefficient - Electro-hydraulics - Limit-cycle - Parameter plane - Stability equations - Transport delay - Transport lag - Unstable regions","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 731.1 Control Systems - 732.1 Control Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Thus demand and supply shocks identified can be featured as containing factors with transitory and permanent effects on economy, respectively. The identifying procedure is helpful for policy makers to judge whether the macroeconomic system is over-heating, as well as to take proper measures in order to regulate and control the demand shock.","30","White noise","Decomposition - Wavelet decomposition","Demand and supply - Gaussian white noise - Gross domestic productions - Hodrick-prescott filters - Macroeconomic fluctuations - Policy makers - Wavelet de-noising techniques - Wavelet denoising","802.2 Chemical Reactions - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By means of four servo motors being controlled respectively and encoders being used to detect positions of servo motors, the manipulator fulfills control movements of two mallets. Mallet-moving unit uses single linear motion guideway and slide seat dragging by synchronistic belt. Some performance parameters are analyzed and some factors effect on motion accuracy of the manipulator discussed. The mallet lies at an angle of 75 degrees with the linear guideway on the horizontal plane, and at an angle of 28 degrees with the linear guideway in the vertical plane. Control system and motion controller have also been introduced. It adopts host computer and slave computer control mode. Motion controller uses DSP as control chip and encoders for displacement detecting sensors. The results show that the xylophone-playing manipulator may preferably imitate two hands to play xylophone.

Design for a typical processes shows that the control structure can be tuned easily and achieve good tradeoff between performance and robustness. This method has a simplified structure and proposes a novel way for the optimization and the advance control of the process systems.","5","Structural design","Disturbance rejection - Global optimization - Model predictive control - Multivariable systems - Optimization - Shape optimization","Control principle - Decoupling - Decoupling internal model controls - Internal model control - Modified internal model controls - NLJ optimization algorithms - Optimization algorithms - Set-point tracking","408.1 Structural Design, General - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The reactive approach overcomes the disadvantages of the deliberative approach, but the design that could obtain a desired behavior is difficult. The work reported in this paper overcomes this difficulty by adapting a new navigation method, the limit-cycle navigation method. The defects of the potential field method are also presented. In the proposed method, with the information on the relative position of obstacles, target and robot, the obstacle that affects the robot's path is identified. Then, direction of turn, counter-clockwise or clockwise is decided using the radius of the virtual obstacle.

Results of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of NIO TC occurrence frequency show that the EOF1 mode, which accounts for 16% of total variance, consistently represents variations of TC occurrence frequency over the whole NIO basin. However, spatial distributions of EOF1 mode are not uniform, mainly indicating variations of westward-moving TCs in the Bay of Bengal. The prevailing TC activity variation mode oscillates significantly on a quasi-5 year interannual time scale. NIO TC activity is notably influenced by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode. When the Indian Ocean is in a positive (negative) phase of the IOD, NIO SST anomalies are warm in the west (east) and cold in the east (west), which can weaken (strengthen) convection over the Bay of Bengal and eastern Arabian Sea, and cause anticyclonic (cyclonic) atmospheric circulation anomalies at low levels. This results in less (more) TC genesis and reduced (increased) opportunities for TC occurrence in the NIO. In addition, positive (negative) IOD events may strengthen (weaken) westerly steering flow over the Bay of Bengal, which further leads to fewer (more) westward-moving TCs which appear in regions west of 90°E in that bay. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","47","Oceanography","Atmospheric temperature - Hurricanes - Orthogonal functions - Storms - Submarine geophysics - Surface properties - Surface waters - Tropics","Atmospheric circulation anomaly - Empirical orthogonal function analysis - Indian Ocean dipole - Interannual variation - National centers for environmental predictions - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - North indian oceans - Tropical cyclone","443 Meteorology - 444.1 Surface Water - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 2009CC002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: GYHY201106005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare; Number: 2012FD001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: U0933603, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Thanks go to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

Nevertheless, the conventional sonar imaging system can hardly emit and process UWB waveforms directly due to limited system bandwidth. To solve the problem, a 2-D imaging approach based on an UWB multiple-input multiple-output (UWB-MIMO) sonar is proposed. The UWB-MIMO sonar is composed of multi transmitting sensors and a receiving rectangular array. At the transmitting end, a group of OFDM-LFM pulses are emitted simultaneously via multi transmitting sensors. At the receiving end, via matched filtering, the echo components corresponding to each LFM pulse are picked out, and all of them are further synthesized into UWB signals.

Firstly, SIFT-based feature point extraction: exact sufficient SIFT feature points from the sensed image and the reference image. Secondly, SIFT feature point registration based on mixed features: the correspondence estimation between the feature point set Y and X, and then the correspondence was used to establish a spatial mapping function to continuously update the position of the transformed source point set. Thirdly, image registration: a mapping function was constructed based on the source point set and the transformed source point set to register the image.

However, to obtain a high cross-range resolution, the physical size and the sensor number of the array will become inevitably large. To avoid this, a highresolution 2-D imaging approach based on a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sonar is proposed in this paper. The MIMO sonar is composed of four uniform linear arrays (ULAs) located on four sides of a rectangle. And narrowband waveforms coded with orthogonal polyphase sequences are employed as transmitting waveforms. By matched filtering the outputs at each receiving sensor, the MIMO sonar is equivalent to a virtual rectangular array with a twice big aperture. With theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we show that the MIMO sonar can save a great number of sensors and double the cross-range resolution simultaneously, when compared to a conventional rectangular array with the same physical size. © 2013 IEEE.","13","Sonar","Codes (symbols) - Feedback control - MIMO systems - Signal processing - Telecommunication repeaters - Underwater acoustics - Underwater imaging","2-d imaging - Cross-range resolution - High resolution - Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) sonars - Narrowband waveforms - Polyphase sequences - Sonar imaging - Uniform linear arrays","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 731.1 Control Systems - 746 Imaging Techniques - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 752.1 Acoustic Devices",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the exponentially increasing computation burden of the BM estimator, due to multidimensional grid search and integrates, makes it very difficult to use the BM estimator in real-time systems. In this paper, a computation feasible ant colony optimization method (ACO) is applied to lighten the computation burden. In addition, in order to overcome the drawbacks of ACO, such as low convergence speed and being easily trapped in local optimum, chaos initialization and local search are integrated into the classic ACO method, to form a novel method named MACO. Based on MACO, a novel BM DOA estimator named BM-MACO with even lower computational complexity is proposed. It is shown via simulations that both methods could keep the good performance of the original BM DOA estimator and reduce the computation evidently. Due to the initialization via chaotic sequences and local search in the optimization procedure, BM-MACO method reduces the sensitivity of parameters, and thus outperforms the BM ACO for its higher precision and less computation. © 2013 IEEE.","10","Ant colony optimization","Artificial intelligence - Computational complexity - Direction of arrival - Interactive computer systems - Local search (optimization) - Probability density function - Real time systems - Signal processing","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) - Ant colony optimization methods - Bayesian maximum a posteriors - BM estimator - Multi-dimensional grids - Narrow band sources - Optimization procedures - Sensitivity of parameters","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Previous estimation methods are based on observed frequency or phase which describes the time varying Doppler shift. Because of the low-frequency and low-speed characteristics of underwater linespectrum noise source, the Doppler shift is very tiny and can hardly be detected accurately. It is difficult to estimate the parameters by the previous approaches. A method of underwater Doppler signal parameters estimation based on the unscented Kalman filter is presented in this paper. The signal and measurement systems are placed into state-space form, therefore allowing the unknown parameters of the signal model to be estimated. As a result, the accurate estimation of instantaneous frequency can be avoided. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","11","Underwater acoustics","Bandpass filters - Doppler effect - Frequency estimation - Kalman filters - State space methods","Accurate estimation - Doppler parameters - Instantaneous frequency - Low-speed characteristic - Parameters estimation - Time-varying Doppler shifts - Underwater signals - Unscented Kalman Filter","703.2 Electric Filters - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

But the shaping signal usually is provided by external observer, which requires lots of efforts, and weakens agent's autonomy. We propose an approach to make agent can autonomously shape itself by high density visited states. By gathering state trajectories that agent passed in training episodes, and eliminating the state loops in these state trajectories, then agent can find the high density visited states from these acyclic state trajectories. A high density visited state means agent has high frequency to pass it when agent wants to achieve the goal. So the high density visited state can be used to shape agent's exploration and make it reaching the goal faster. The experiment results on the Maze problem illustrated our approach being very effective. The major contribution is we make agent can autonomously shape itself by its experience. © 2011 IEEE.","10","Autonomous agents","Trajectories","External observer - High frequency HF - Maze problems - State trajectory","404.1 Military Engineering - 716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 717 Optical Communication - 718 Telephone Systems and Related Technologies; Line Communications - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
