But, its regional ore-forming ages are controversial due to multi-stage tectono-thermal events. In this paper, the scheelite Sm-Nd dating method was used to determine the ore-forming age of the feldspar quartz vein type ore bodies in the Nanyangtian ore field, and the muscovite and biotite Ar-Ar dating method were used to determine the crystallization ages of the regional granitic pegmatites and the metamorphic age of their wall rocks respectively. The dating results show that the feldspar quartz veins type ore bodies formed at 159±14 Ma, younger than the skarn type ore bodies, and the pegmatite crystallization ages and the wall rock's metamorphic ages are 144-141 Ma and 121-112 Ma respectively. So the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tectono-thermal event and tungsten mineralization occurred in Laojunshan area. The metallogenic regularity in the Laojunshan areas illustrates that the regional ore deposits or spots are constrained by the regional granite gneiss and granitic intrusion, and the ore-forming period is consistent with the three ore-forming peaks in the Nanling minerallenic belt. Furthermore, the mineralization features in Laojunshan area are similar with that in the eastern Nanling metallogenic belt, which may be due to the high denudation degree. It is concluded that the great denudation area in the western Nanling region has great potential to find tungsten deposit formed in Late Triassic and Indo-Chinese and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous.","","34","Ores","Binary alloys - Deposits - Economic geology - Feldspar - Granite - Metamorphic rocks - Mica - Mineralogy - Neodymium alloys - Ore deposits - Quartz - Samarium alloys - Tectonics - Tungstate minerals - Tungsten deposits - Tungsten mines - Wall rock","Crystallization age - Early Cretaceous - Granitic pegmatite - Laojunshan ore concentration area - Metallogenic belt - Ore fields - Tectono-thermal event - Tungsten concentrations","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results suggest that the Ph velocity in this region shows significant lateral variation; the Pn velocity varies from 7.7 to 8.3 km/s. The Pn-velocity variation correlates well with the tectonic activity and heat flow of the region. Low Pn velocity is observed in southwest Yunnan, Tengchong volcano area, and the Panxi tectonic area. These areas have very active seismicity and tectonic activity with high surface heat flow. On the other hand, high Pn velocity is observed in some stable regions, such as the central region of the Yangtze Platform; the most pronounced high velocity area is located in the Sichuan Basin, south of Chengdu. Pn anisotropy shows a complex pattern of regional deformation. The Pn fast direction shows a prominent clockwise rotation pattern from east of the Tibetan block to the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond block to southwest Yunnan, which may be related to southeastward escape of the Tibetan Plateau material due to the collision of the Indian Plate to the Eurasia Plate. Thus there appears to be strong correlation between the crustal deformation and the upper mantle structure in the region. The delay times of events and stations show that the crust thickness decreases from the Tibetan Plateau to eastern China, which is consistent with the results from deep seismic sounding.","","19","Anisotropy","Data acquisition - Earthquakes - Rotation - Seismology - Shear deformation - Tectonics","Earthquake bulletins - Pn velocity","931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.1 Mechanics - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 484 Seismology - 481.1 Geology - 421 Strength of Building Materials; Mechanical Properties","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Its tectonic activity and seismic hazard have attracted much attention. Based on broadband magnetotelluric array data covering the Nantinghe fault zone in Yunnan, this paper obtained the fine three-dimensional electrical structure of the Nantinghe fault zone using three-dimensional MT inversion interpretation. In the upper crust, the southwestern and middle segments of the Nantinghe fault zone show the feature of banded conductive structure along the strike direction, while the northeastern segment exhibits high resistive feature. The electrical resistive feature of the northeastern section may be a reflection of the electrical property of the Lincang-Menghai granite, indicating that the Nantinghe fault may not cut through the granite belt. In the mid-lower crust, there is a large-scale high conductivity layer in the southwestern segment of the Nantinghe fault zone, while the northeastern segment presents an overall resistive crust. Therefore, the northeastern segment of the Nantinghe fault has potential seismogenic background of a strong earthquake. In the southwestern Nantinghe fault zone, the deep part of the Gengma earthquake zone presents an X-shaped high-conductivity pattern. There is a significant resistive anomaly to the south of the above X-shaped high-conductivity structure. The 1988 Gengma MS7.2 earthquake and the 2015 Cangyuan MS5.5 earthquake both occurred at the electrical boundaries between the high resistivity body and the X-shaped high-conductivity structure. The branch of mid-lower crust channel flow, which flows from the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau into western Yunnan, may be blocked by the mid-lower crustal resistive body in the northeastern Nantinghe fault, and bifurcated into the Baoshan block and the eastern Langcanjiang fault. © 2018, Science Press.

The source regions for the regional Zn-Pb mineralization in the SYG are still controversial, mostly in regard to the Emeishan flood basalts, basement rocks and host rocks. The Maozu Zn-Pb deposit is geographically close to the SYG center, which could also indicate that it is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center than those deposits along the SYG margin. However, the origin of the ore-forming Zn in the Maozu deposit has not been constrained until now. In this study, the Zn and S isotopic compositions and Fe and Cd concentrations of the sphalerite from the Maozu deposit are investigated to evaluate the Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite precipitation, the source regions of the ore-forming zinc and sulfur, and the center of the regional Zn-bearing fluid system. It is suggested that the Zn isotopic fractionation between the sphalerite and original fluid during sphalerite precipitation could be limited due to the striking decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid. The Zn isotopic variation of the sphalerite from four mining levels in the Maozu deposit is really small (−0.06 to +0.23‰), which could be attributed to heterogeneous Zn isotopic compositions in original incoming fluid rather than Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite deposition. As such, in the Maozu deposit, the Zn isotopic compositions of original hydrothermal fluid could approximately be represented by the Zn isotopic signals documented in sphalerite (−0.06 to +0.23‰). We found that the Zn isotopic signatures of incoming fluid are largely overlapped with those of the basement rocks (+0.10 to +0.34‰), signifying that the ore-forming Zn could be predominantly sourced from the basement rocks. However, in the Maozu deposit, the ore-forming sulfur is most likely derived from the sulfur-bearing evaporates hosted in the country rocks via thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The contrasting sources of ore-forming zinc and sulfur suggest the mixing of Zn-bearing fluid from the basement rocks and sulfur-bearing fluid from the host rocks, which could be responsible for the sharp decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid in the Maozu deposit. Combined with the results of previous studies, the integrally lower Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite in the Maozu deposit compared to those deposits along the SYG margin may demonstrate that the Maozu deposit is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center.

Due to the high spatial heterogeneity of forest properties such as biomass, forest age, and height, and the distinct differences in drought stress in terms of frequency, intensity, and duration, current studies still contain many uncertainties. In this research, we used the forests in Yunnan Province in Southwest China as an example and aimed to reveal the potential impacts of forest properties (i.e., stock volume) on drought response characteristics. Specifically, we divided the forest into five groups of stock volume density values and then analyzed their drought response differences. To depict forest response to drought intensity, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was chosen as the explanatory variable, and the change in remote sensing-based enhanced vegetation index (deficit of MODIS-EVI, dEVI) was chosen as the response variable of drought stress. Given that the SPEI has different time scales, we first analyzed the statistical dependency of SPEIs with different time scales (1 to 36 months) to the response variable (i.e., dEVI). The optimal time scale of SPEI (SPEIopt) to interpret the maximum variation of dEVI (R-square) was then chosen to build the ultimate statistical models for the five groups of stock volume density. The main findings were as follows: (1) the impacts of drought showed hysteresis and cumulative effects, and the length of the hysteresis increased with stock volume densities; (2) forests with high stock volume densities required more soil water and were therefore more sensitive to the changes in water deficit; (3) compared with the optimal time scale of SPEI (SPEIopt), the SPEI with the commonly used time scale (e.g., 1, 6, and 12 months) could not well reflect the impacts of drought on forests and the simulation error of dEVI increased with stock volume densities; and (4) forests with higher stock volume densities were likely to experience a greater risk of degradation following higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5). As a result, both the time scale of the meteorological drought index and the spatial difference in forest stock volumes should be considered when evaluating forest drought responses at regional and global scales. © 2018 by the authors.","","84","Forestry","Climate change - Drought - Greenhouse gases - Hysteresis - Remote sensing - Soil moisture - Time measurement","Atmospheric concentration - Enhanced vegetation index - Forest - Global climate changes - Meteorological drought - SPEI - Statistical dependencies - Stock volume","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: 2012CB955401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: PSC-CUNY ENHC-48-33, Acronym: -, Sponsor: New York University Shanghai; Number: 2015KJJCB33, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University; Number: 41621061, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41621061 and 41571185), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (2015KJJCB33), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB955401).

Pore types were obtained from the shape and distribution of transverse relaxation time (T2) spectrum. Residual porosity and movable porosity could be well estimated based on T2spectrum area fraction. On the basis of Coates model, we proposed a regional Coates model to calculate the NMR permeability of shale. A method for determining T2cutoffof shale samples was also expounded. Moreover, the specific surface area distributions and pore size distributions could be obtained based on the mathematical equation of T2. Results show that T2spectrums of shale samples at water-saturated condition can be divided into unimodal and bimodal T2spectrums. Continuous bimodal T2spectrums reflect the samples with good connectivity between small pores and large pores, whereas discontinuous bimodal T2spectrums reflect that the connectivity between small pores and large pores is poor. Shale samples with higher bound water content have a greater T2cutoff. The NMR permeability is close to gas log permeability, which proves the applicability of regional Coates model. In eight shale samples, transition pores account for the largest proportion, followed by mesopores, indicating that transition pores and mesopores are the major sites for the accumulation of shale gas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","36","Nuclear magnetic resonance","Enamels - Field emission microscopes - Gas permeability - Nuclear magnetic logging - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Pore size - Scanning electron microscopy - Shale","Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) - Petro-physical characterizations - Petrophysical properties - Pore characteristics - T2 spectrums - Transverse relaxation time - Water saturated conditions","512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 813.2 Coating Materials - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,"Number: 2011ZX05018-001-002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011ZX05009-002-205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016ZX05046-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41072098, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41372139, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 41072098 and 41372139 ) and the Important National Science and Technology Specific Projects of China (Nos. 2016ZX05046-003 , 2011ZX05018-001-002 and 2011ZX05009-002-205 ).

Our findings add new insight into the impacts and environmental legacy of human exploitation of metal resources in Yunnan history. We observe an increase in copper at 1500 BC resulting from atmospheric emissions associated with metallurgy. These data clarify the chronological issues related to links between the onset of Yunnan metallurgy and the advent of bronze technology in adjacent Southeast Asia, subjects that have been debated for nearly half a century. We also observe an increase from 1100 to 1300 AD in a number of heavy metals including lead, silver, zinc, and cadmium from atmospheric emissions associated with silver smelting. Culminating during the rule of the Mongols, known as the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD), these metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from industrialized mining activity occurring within the catchment today. Notably, the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed in aquatic organisms. The persistence of this lead pollution over time created an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern day sediment quality. We demonstrate that historic metallurgical production in Yunnan can cause substantial impacts on the sediment quality of lake systems, similar to other paleolimnological findings around the globe. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","78","Copper smelting","Air pollution - Aquatic organisms - Atmospheric spectra - Catchments - Copper metallurgy - Heavy metals - Lakes - Lead smelting - Mineral resources - Sedimentology - Sediments - Silver - Zinc smelting","Atmospheric emission - Geochemical measurements - Harmful effects - Lake sediments - Metal concentrations - Metallurgical productions - Mining activities - Sediment quality","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451 Air Pollution - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 531.1 Metallurgy - 533.2 Metal Refining - 547.1 Precious Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Direct flotation tests had been conducted to extract the metallic values as much as possible by adding traditional depressants and collectors, such as carboxylmethyl cellulose, starch, sodium silicate, butyl xanthate, (BX), butyl ammonium dithophosphate (BA) and etc., the relatively satisfied recoveries of Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd in the concentrate from bench flotation tests were obtained, however, more than 30% of metallic values still lost in the slime.

All the tests results pointed to the presence of over-oxidation on the ultra-fine nickel sulfide surface and lead to the loss of Ni containing Pt and Pd in the slime tailing. Some methods which tried to slow the speed of oxidation on mineral surface during grinding and flotation were introduced in order to recover the values before over-oxidation of sulfides; however, the slime coating of serpentines also may play an important role in disturbing the floatability of ultra-fine sulfide. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","","13","Ore treatment","Flotation - Manufacture - Nickel - Nickel deposits - Oxidation - Platinum - Recovery - Serpentine - Silicon compounds - Sulfur compounds - Testing","Butyl xanthates - Flotation tests - Mineral surfaces - Pentlandite - Sodium silicate - Sulfide flotation - Ultra-fine - Ultra-fine nickels","804.1 Organic Compounds - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 548.1 Nickel - 547.1 Precious Metals - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 482.2 Minerals - 423.2 Non Mechanical Properties of Building Materials: Test Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Mineralization can cause element concentration enrichment or depletion in the country rocks. Local metal enriched rocks can become ore bodies that can be mined for profit at the certain economic and technological conditions. To understand the spatial distribution of element concentration enrichment or depletion caused by mineralization in a mineral district is essential for mineral exploration and mineral resource prediction. Grade-tonnage model and mineral deposit size distribution model are commonly used for characterizing mineral deposits. This paper proposes a multifractal model for characterizing hydrothermal mineralization and the consequences on spatial distribution of element concentrations in the country rocks as well as grade-tonnage fractal/multifractal distribution of ore deposits. This result has established the connection of singularity indexes in multifractal models and mineralization coefficient as well as correlation coefficient in statistical analysis applied to association of two quantities of minerals or element concentrations involved in the same mineralization system. This work has also lead to a singularity model to explain the common properties of mineralization and mineralization-associated geochemical anomaly diversity.

Comprehensive evaluation on the conditions of ecosystem is important to protect regional eco-environment. The paper mainly based on the data set of remote sensing and climate to calculate ecological capital of the ecosystem in Yunnan province. The results showed that: 1) annual average vegetation coverage in the province took on an increase trend from 2001 to 2004 and its value was 0.294, 0.305, 0.307, 0.314 respectively. The south and west are the regions with higher vegetation coverage and the middle part and the east are the middle value regions. The regions with lower vegetation coverage mainly located at the river-valley flatland where human's activities are relatively frequent; 2) ecological capital of the province from 2001 to 2004 was 1.64×10 3 billon RMB, 1.52×103 billon RMB, 1.4O×103 billon RMB, 1.60×103 billon RMB respectively and ecological capital per area was 4.29 ×104 RMB/ha., 3.97×104 RMB/ha., 3.65×104 RMB/ha.4.19×104 RMB/ha. Total and unit ecological capital showed a decreased trend that was contrary to annual vegetation coverage change trend. The spatial distribution of ecological capital per area took on a pattern that the west was higher than the east and the south was higher than the north; 3) ecological capital of forest, shrub and grassland which constituted the main body of ecological capital took a percentage of 80.09%, 80.52%, 81.44%, 80.48% respectively to the total in the province from 2001 to 2004. Other than ecological capital of grassland per area slightly increased, ecological capital of other ecosystems au took on a decreased trend.","","7","Ecosystems","Erosion - Remote sensing - Vegetation","Ecological capital - Spatial distribution","407 Maritime and Port Structures; Rivers and Other Waterways - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.9 Biology - 731.1 Control Systems","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The human impact on the oligotrophic Lugu Lake aquatic ecosystem was evaluated using the sediment records of metals, nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) and magnetic susceptibility over the past 200 years. Three periods were identified based on the trace metal and δ15N records. During the first stage (1816-1976 AD), the concentrations of metals, δ15N and magnetic susceptibility were low with small variations. The anthropogenic contributions to the inputs were also small, except for Ni, reflecting minor human activities in the watershed, and no significant change was observed in the sediment record of the diatom assemblage. During the second stage (1976-2001 AD), the concentrations of Zn and δ15N increased, as well as the anthropogenic contribution of Zn. However, no significant change was detected in the anthropogenic sources of the other metals. These results reflect the low-level use of chemical fertilizers. The major shift in the sediment diatom assemblage during this stage was mainly attributed to regional climate change. During the third stage (2001-2010 AD), the concentrations of the sedimentary metals (Ni, Cr, Mn, Cu, Hg and Al) increased rapidly, with the exception of As and Zn, and a similar increasing trend was observed in the changes by anthropogenic sources of Ni, Cr, Mn and Cu. RDA (Redundancy Analysis) and variance partitioning analysis showed that the human impact and climate proxies independently explained 31.59% and 4.26% of the change of diatom community, respectively, and the interaction between climate change and human impact accounted for 18.61% of the change of diatom community. Tourism-dominated human activities, which were reflected in the metals profiles, facilitated the dominance of eutrophic species and reduced that of oligotrophic species. The development of tourism was likely the main driving force for the succession of diatom assemblages in the third stage. In summary, the anthropogenic input of trace metals in Lugu Lake is still at a low level. However, the significant growth trend in metals over the past decade is significantly related to the change in the lake ecosystem. Therefore, the effects of human activities, especially tourism, on the watershed should be controlled for the protection of the oligotrophic Lugu Lake. © 2019 by the authors.","","45","Climate change","Aquatic ecosystems - Fertilizers - Lakes - Magnetic susceptibility - Metals - Sedimentology - Sediments - Trace elements - Watersheds","Anthropogenic activity - Anthropogenic contribution - Anthropogenic impacts - Anthropogenic sources - Chemical fertilizers - Geochemical elements - Regional climate changes - Sediment records","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,"Number: -, Acronym: CCNU, Sponsor: Central China Normal University; Number: 31670464, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41562021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank Guangjie Chen, Yuanyuan Liu, Huibin Lu (Yunnan Normal University), Enlou Zhang (Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, CAS) and Hongyu Niu (Central China Normal University) for their help with statistical analysis.This research was funded by the National Science and Technology Major Project forWater Pollution Control and Treatment (Nos. 2013ZX07105-005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31670464; 41562021).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to understand microbial Fe(III) reduction processes in hot springs, Fe(III)-reducing bacterial consortia were successfully retrieved from seven acidic hot springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China (a temperature range from 40.6 °C to 74.7 °C and a pH range from 2.64 to 4.72). These Fe(III)-reducing consortia were mainly composed of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB, including Desulfotomaculum, Thermodesulfobacterium and Desulfomicrobium) and organic matter fermenting bacteria (Thermoanaerobacterium and Thermoanaerobacter), with each consortia having specific composition depending on the physio-chemical conditions of the studied hot springs. The obtained consortia were capable of dissimilatory reduction of Fe(III) in nontronite NAu-2 (ferruginous smectite) with 20.8% to 29.8% reduction extent and initial reduction rate of 0.011–0.023 mM Fe(III)/g NAu-2/h. These extents and rates were comparable to those by mesophilic Fe-reducers in the presence of electron shuttles. Both high temperature and the possible presence of electron-shuttles in hot springs may have accounted for these observed high reduction extents and rates. Various secondary minerals formed during NAu-2 bioreduction, including Fe sulfides and oxides, silicates, and silica. In one spring, illitization and kaolinization of smectite were observed, suggesting that Fe-reducers play important roles in mineral transformation in geothermal environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","","82","Iron oxides","Bacteria - Gold compounds - Hot springs - Silica - Silicates - Sulfide minerals - Sulfur compounds","Bacterial consortium - Bio reductions - Illitization - Kaolinization - Mineral transformations - Smectites - Sulfate reducing bacteria - Thermoanaerobacterium",,,"Number: KLMM20170101, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society; Number: 2013DFA31980, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Dream Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: Wuhan, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2015FY110100, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: NCET-12-0954, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 41422208, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants ( 41422208 , 41521001 , 41572328 , 41602347 & 41630103 ), Special Foundation for Basic Research Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (MOST) (No. 2015FY110100 ), the Key Project of International Cooperation of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (MOST) (Nos. 2013DFA31980 ), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University ( NCET-12-0954 ), the cooperation foundation from Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, CAS ( KLMM20170101 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for National University ( China University of Geosciences, Wuhan ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective approach for accurate early warning and damage assessment of PSB outbreaks. Remote sensing is one of the most efficient methods for this purpose. Despite many studies existing on the mountain pine beetle (MPB), very little work has been undertaken on assessing PSB stress using remote sensing. The objective of this paper was to develop a spectral linear mixing model aided by radiative transfer (RT) and a new Yellow Index (YI) to simulate the reflectance of heterogeneous canopies containing damaged needles and quantitatively inverse their PSB stress. The YI, the fraction of dead needles, is a physically-explicit stress indicator that represents the plot shoots damage ratio (plot SDR). The major steps of this methods include: (1) LIBERTY2 was developed to simulate the reflectance of damaged needles using YI to linearly mix the green needle spectra with the dead needle spectra; (2) LIBERTY2 was coupled with the INFORM model to scale the needle spectra to the canopy scale; and (3) a look-up table (LUT) was created against Sentinel 2 (S2) imagery and inversed leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), green leaf area index (LAI) and plot SDR. The results show that (1) LIBERTY2 effectively simulated the reflectance spectral values on infested needles (mean relative error (MRE) = 1.4-18%), and the YI can indicate the degrees of needles damage; (2) the coupled LIBERTY2-INFORM model is suitable to estimate LAI (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.17 m m-2, NRMSE = 11.41% and the index of agreement (IOA) = 0.92) and LCC (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 56.24 mg m-2, NRMSE = 25.22% and IOA = 0.72), and is better than the original LIBERTY model (LAI: R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.43 m m-2, NRMSE = 28.85% and IOA = 0.68; LCC: R2 = 0.34, RMSE = 76.44 mg m-2, NRMSE = 34.23% and IOA = 0.57); and (3) the inversed YI is positively correlated with the measured plot SDR (R2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.15). We conclude that the LIBERTY2 model improved the reflectance simulation accuracy of both the needles and canopies, making it suitable for assessing PSB stress. The YI has the potential to assess PSB damage. © 2018 by the authors.","","86","Needles","Damage detection - Forestry - Inverse problems - Reflection - Remote sensing - Table lookup","Damage ratio - Green LAI - INFORM - LIBERTY - Pine shoots - Reflectance simulation","723.1 Computer Programming",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the system performance test of Yunnan asynchronous operation, 0.05 Hz ultra-low frequency oscillation occurred in the grid. We analyzed the damping characteristics of different types of units and figured out that the negative damping characteristic of the hydropower units are mainly responsible for the ultra-low frequency oscillation. There is a tendency for ultra-low frequency oscillation in a regional power grid with high ratio of hydropower penetration which transmits electricity using HVDC. The water hammer effect of hydraulic turbine influences the damping characteristic of the hydropower unit while the governor control gain influences the strength of the damping. By setting reasonable governor control gain and optimizing the dead-zone of HVDC frequency limit controller the ultra-low frequency oscillation of the Yunnan asynchronous system can be effectively curbed. Simulation results and system performance test verified the effectiveness of the method. © 2017 IEEE.","","10","Electric power transmission networks","Damping - Governors - HVDC power transmission - Hydraulic motors - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants","Asynchronous interconnections - Damping torques - Prime movers - Speed governors - Ultra low frequencies","602.1 Mechanical Drives - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 632.2 Hydraulic Equipment and Machinery - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Plants and their associated soil samples collected from several copper mines in the Province were analyzed for copper. It is found that both plant species can grow well on mining spoils rich in copper but with medium nutrient supply. P. microcephalum accumulated more copper in its organs than R. hastatus. The copper concentration in the roots of both species tended to increase with copper increase in the substrates. However, the tendency for the levels of copper in the leaves of both species to increase linearly with soil copper increase is not clear.

The results indicate that: (1) The magnetic susceptibility of upper and lower stream are different, while the pollution of heavy metal has the same characteristics, because the Bi River was influenced by the exploitation of mining activities of Lanping Lead-zinc in upper stream.

In S2S-E, the bedrocks in source area are primarily carbonate rocks and the number and scale of sedimentary bodies in sink area is small (300A;10 km2); in S2S-W, the bedrocks in source area consist of metamorphic rock sand a few granitic and carbonate rocks, and large scale (300B;40 km2) sedimentary bodies in sink area easily developed, feature in gextensive and concatenated distribution; in S2S-N(axial source), bedrocks are composed mainly of clastic rocks and the scale of sedimentary bodies in sink area are large. Studies of modern Source-to-Sink system in Lake basin suggest that there are many Source-to-Sink systems in the same basin (sag) and in which significant distinctions between the watershed area, sedimentary body area and sedimentation response exist because of controlling factors such as bedrock type, tectonic activity, paleomorphology, basin boundaries, and transport channel, among others, which implies that more attention should be paid to the distinguishing characteristics of Source-to-Sink systems in further study of ancient Source-to-Sink systems. © 2017, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

It is significant for understanding regional ecological environment and LUCC mechanism of large scale to develop the study of LUCC of regional level. Nujiang River is the upper reaches of a big river in the South Asia-Salween River. Nujiang River is a typical mountainous river which is 3200 kilometer long and its basin area is 32.5× 105 square kilometer. It locates in the core of 'Three Parallel Rivers' World Natural Heritage. It is one of international biodiversity conservation center of the world, the ecological fragile zone and key ecological construction area, as well as a remote undeveloped area with high diversity ethnic. With the rapidly development of society and economy, the land use and land cover changed in a great degree. The function of ecosystem has being degraded in some areas which will not only impact on the ecological construction of local area, but also on the ecological safety of lower reaches - Salween River. Therefore it is necessary to carry out the research of LUCC of Nujiang River. Based on the theory and methods of geo-information Tupu, the 'Spatial Pattern' and 'Change Process' of land use of middle reach in Nujiang River from 1974 to 2004 had been studied in quantification and integration, so as to provide a case study in local area and mesoscale in time. Supported by the remote sensing and GIS technology, LUCC Tupu of 1974-2004 had been built and the characteristics of LUCC have been analyzed quantificationally. The results showed that the built-up land (Included in this category are cities, towns, villages, strip developments along highways, transportation, power, and communications facilities, and areas such as those occupied by mills, shopping centers, industrial and commercial complexes, and institutions that may, in some instances, be isolated from urban areas), agriculture land, shrubbery land, meadow & grassland, difficultly/unused land increased from 1974 to 2004, the increased area of shrubbery land was the greatest, while the area of forest, artificial forest, waters, glacier and snow covered land decreased. The biggest decreased area was forest land. The biggest LUCC was the transformation from forest land to shrubbery land, the transformation from forest land to rangeland and agriculture land was the second. The main area of LUCC located at Nujiang River valley, between 2200-3700m of the east slope in the Gaoligong Mountain and 2800-3900m of the west slope of the Biluo Snow Mountain. From the valley to peak of mountain, the main land use type was transited from built-up land, agricultures land, artificial forest land to natural forest, shrubbery and grass land. The natural forest was the main land in the past 30 years. The main driving forces were the increase of population of local area, the governmental policies (Conversion of Farmland to Forests and Grass Land Projects, etc.) and urbanization. In order to accelerate the sustainable development of society economy and the ecological environment protection in this ecological fragile zone, strict management should be adopted to adjust the behaviors of human beings. Finally, VCM (variable clumping method) curve had been used to analyses the internal spatial distribution difference of land-use/land cover which shown that the landscape fragmentation was increased, the number of patches was added, the distance between patches was diminished during the past thirty years (1974-2004). © 2008 SPIE.","","17","Geographic information systems","Behavioral research - Biodiversity - Conservation - Ecosystems - Environmental protection - Forestry - Land use - Landforms - Remote sensing - Rivers - Snow - Strip mills - Sustainable development - Urban transportation","Biodiversity conservation - Ecological construction - Ecological environment protections - Ecological environments - Geo-informatics - Land use/land cover change - Landscape fragmentation - World natural heritages","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 443.3 Precipitation - 454 Environmental Engineering - 481.1 Geology - 535.1.2 Rolling Mill Practice - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Fuel mixtures included coal, woody biomass, and agricultural waste. Compared to previously published emission measurements of similar stoves, these measurements have higher CO and PM2.5 emission factors. Real-time data show two distinct burn phases: a devolatilization phase after fuel addition with high PM2.5 emissions and a solid-fuel combustion phase with low PM2.5 emissions. The average emission factors depend on the relative contributions of these phases, which are affected by the services provided by the stoves. Differences in stove and fuel characteristics that are not represented in emission inventories affect the variability of emission factors much more than do the type of solid fuel or stove. In developing inventories with highly variable sources such as residential solid-fuel combustion, we suggest that (1) all fuels should be accounted for, not just the primary fuel; (2) the household service provided should be emphasized rather than specific combinations of solid fuels and devices; and (3) the devolatilization phase should be explicitly measured and represented.

The high geo-accumulation indexes (Igeo) showed that cultivated soils near mine were practically polluted by Cd, Pb and Zn. The contents of Cd, Cr and Pb in crop/vegetables samples were significantly higher than the maximum permissible standard set by China. The potential health risk assessments among local residents were evaluated by the hazard index (HI), the total carcinogenic risk (TCR), the target hazard quotient (THQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR), respectively. The results showed that diet was the dominant exposure pathway. The results of HI for adult and child were 6.21 and 6.08, respectively. TCR values of Cr and Cd were more than 10−4. The THQ decreased in the following order: Cd > Pb > Cu > Zn > Cr. Among all kinds of crop/vegetables, leafy-vegetables were the major source of Cd and Pb exposure, root-vegetable were the important factors for Cu and Zn exposure, but tuber-vegetable were the factors for Cr exposure.

Over the traditional GM(0, N) model, three major improvements of the proposed model are: (i) the lower and upper bounds are firstly identified to give an interval estimation of the forecasting value; (ii) a novel whitenization method is then established to determine the definite forecasting value from the forecasting interval; and (iii) the model parameters are identified by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the least square method (LSM) for the limitation of LSM. Finally, a newly-reformed electricity market in Yunnan province of China is studied, and input variables are contrapuntally selected. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by observed data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the traditional GM(0, N) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the proposed model gives a better performance and its superiority is further ensured by the use of the modified Diebold-Mariano (MDM) test, suggesting that it is suitable for mid-term electricity MCP forecasting in a data-sparse electricity market. © 2016 by the authors.","","60","Power markets","Commerce - Costs - Electric industry - Forecasting - Least squares approximations - Linear regression - Neural networks - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - System theory","Artificial neural network models - Grey prediction model - Lower and upper bounds - Market Clearing Price - Market clearing prices - Mid-term - Multiple linear regression models - Sparse data","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through obtaining the hourly average of the frequency and power spectral density (PSD) of the lowest three SR modes, we analyzed diurnal variation of SR frequency and PSD both in BNS and BEW components around equinoxes and solstices. Diurnal variation of SR PSD is found to be related to the dominant intervals of Asian, African and American thunderstorm centers and the relative position of the observatory to three thunderstorm centers. Diurnal variation of SR frequency is more complicated. SR frequency and PSD at the lowest three modes around summer solstice and autumn equinox are more changeable than that in spring equinox and winter solstice. The daily median of SR peak frequency in 2011 shows that seasonal variation of peak frequency is blurry, while annual variation of daily median of PSD shows a clear seasonal variation which resembled half a period of sine curve and was symmetrically distributed before and after July. The seasonal variation of PSD is in accordance with that of lightning activities. Frequency of the first mode is about at 7.5 Hz both in BNS and BEW components. However, with the higher mode, SR frequency in BNS component is 0.5 Hz larger than that in BEW component. The cause of this frequency shift is not clear yet.","","16","Power spectral density","Observatories - Resonance - Spectral density - Thunderstorms","Background features - Diurnal variation - Frequency shift - Lightning activity - Power spectral densities (PSD) - Relative positions - Schumann resonances - Seasonal variation","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A New-PSS2B(New structure of PSS2B) is proposed to increase the gain of middle and low frequency band and reduce the restriction of high frequency band on the gain of medium and low frequency band. New-PSS2B user-defined model is built in PSASP UDM(User-Defined Model). It can be found that the New-PSS2B can effectively improve the medium and low frequency gain by analyzing the gain of PSS2B and New-PSS2B model. Finally, the New-PSS2B model is implemented to single-machine infinite system on PSASP. Simulative results verify that the New-PSS2B is superior to the existing PSS2B in terms of suppressing low-frequency oscillation at each frequency point in both medium and low frequency band.

The results show that the macro-epicenters of two earthquakes were both located near the area of Malipo Village, Mengnong Township, Yingjiang County, but their seismogenic faults are different from each other. The former was associated with the NE-trending left-lateral strike-slip Xima-Panlongshan fault, whereas the latter occurred along the SN-trending right-lateral strike-slip Sudian fault. Historical seismicities were dominated by the earthquakes with magnitude 5~6 in the Yingjiang region, which clustered along the SN-trending fault. Under the combination effect of Sagaing fault and inner arc belt in western Yunnan, the north of Tengchong block bounded by Dayingjiang fault is mainly dominated by nearly SN-trending right-lateral strike slip faults, whereas the south is dominated by NE-trending left-lateral strike slip faults.

Morphologies and size distributions of PM10samples were determined using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and image analysis (IA). According to the morphology, the particles were classified into soot (e. g., chain, fluffy and compact), spherical (e. g., fly ash and tar ball), mineral (e. g., regular and irregular), biological and ultrafine categories. The number-size distributions showed that indoor and outdoor PM10in Xuanwei City mainly ranged from of 0.1-0.4 μm. The volume-size distributions revealed that indoor and outdoor PM10in Xuanwei City display their major size ranges between 1-10 μm. Fine particles dominated by number, while coarse particles riched by volume in the PM10of Xuanwei City. The particle distributions by number-size and volume-size in Xuanwei City were similar to that in Xingfu Village. There was only one exception that the volume-size distribution of outdoor PM10in Xuanwei City had a certain difference from that in Xingfu Village.

Research on prehistoric agriculture has predominantly focused in the valleys of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Agricultural development during the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of southwest China, an important passageway for human migration into Southeast Asia, still remains unclear. In this paper, based on macrofossil and microfossil analysis and radiocarbon dating at the Shilinggang site, we investigate plant subsistence strategies in the Nujiang River valley during the Bronze Age period. Combined with previous archaeobotanical studies in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, we explore agricultural development processes in this area during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Our results indicate that rice and foxtail millet were cultivated in Shilinggang around 2500 cal a BP. Three phases of prehistoric agricultural development in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau can be identified: rice cultivation from 4800–3900 cal a BP, mixed rice and millet crop (foxtail millet and broomcorn millet) cultivation from 3900–3400 cal a BP, and mixed rice, millet crop and wheat cultivation from 3400–2300 cal a BP. The development of agriculture in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau during the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods was primarily promoted by prehistoric agriculture expansion across Eurasia, agricultural expansion which was also affected by the topographic and hydrological characteristics of the area. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","86","Cultivation","Bronze - Crops - Expansion - Landforms - Rivers","Bronze age - Guizhou - Macrofossil analysis - Neolithic - Phytolith analysis - Radiocarbon dating - River valley","481.1 Geology - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Ore-bearing rocks in the Pulang deposit include quartz diorite porphyrite, quartz monzonitic porphyry, and granodiorite porphyry. Field and microscopic observations show that the Pulang porphyries contain plenty of mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs). Compared to the host rock, the MME are obviously enriched in hornblende and biotite. Two types of melt inclusions can be identified in zircon from the Pulang porphyries in terms of color. The dark melt inclusions contain black and white phases that are difficult to homogenize, whereas the light tint ones are offwhite under heating. The dark phases in dark melt inclusions are Fe-rich melt (SiO280%). The light tint melt inclusions are the Si-rich melt (SiO2>69%, FeO2, 40.58% FeO) are also identified in zircon. These characteristics indicate that magma mixing might have occurred in the magmatic process of the Pulang porphyries. Mixing of mafic Fe-rich melt will surely conveys large amounts of sulfur and chalcophile elements into the felsic melt and increase the potential of the magmatic-hydrothermal ore system and contribute to the formation of the giant porphyry copper deposit. © 2018, Science Press.

The complex consists of porphyritic granite, syenite porphyry, granite porphyry, alkali-feldspar granite porphyry and lamprophyre, occurring as stock, dike, dyke or sill. To constrain its petrogenesis, we carried out geochronological and geochemical studies on the Jiudingshan complex. The results show the syenite granite was formed at 34.6±0.7 Ma, which is consistent with the Eocene diwa stage and Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatic activity (45-30 Ma) in West Yunnan. The syenite porphyry contains SiO2>56%, K2O=3.38%-8.92%, ALK= 8.15%-11.15%, and MgO400×10-6), and low Y (-6) and Yb (-6) contents, which is the similar to those of the 'C-Type' adakite. The Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes indicate that the magma was resulted from crust-mantle (EMII-type) interaction. All the evidence listed above suggests that the left-slip shear extrusion of the Jinshajiang-Red River fault, promoted high felsic magma emplacement, as a result of the collision-subduction between India palte and Asia plate. ©, 2015, Science Press.

The estimated reserve at the end of 2015 was 130 million metric tonnes (Mt) of ores, grading 2.42 g/t Au, 0.48 wt.% Cu, 25.5 wt.% Fe, 38.85 g/t Ag, 1.24 wt.% Pb, and 0.53 wt.% Zn. The deposit is located in the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan porphyry–skarn Cu–Mo–Au metallogenic belt in western Yunnan province, southwest China. Skarn alteration and mineralization are spatially and temporally associated with Eocene monzogranite porphyries, which were emplaced into Triassic carbonates. Field evidence and petrographic observations indicate there are four stages of hydrothermal activity, i.e. prograde (Stage I), iron oxide (Stage II), sulfide (Stage III) and carbonate stage (Stage IV). Stage I is characterized by the formation of garnet and pyroxene by high-temperature (398–560 °C) hypersaline (48.81–67.24 wt.% NaCl equiv.) hydrothermal fluids with H-O isotopic compositions that are similar to typical magmatic fluids. These fluids were most likely generated by the separation of brine from a silicate melt. In Stage II garnet and pyroxene was replaced by epidote, amphibole, chlorite, quartz and magnetite. Associated hydrothermal fluids are preserved in coexisting L-type and V-type fluid inclusions and are characterized by anomalously low δD values (approximately − 80‰), and lower δ18O than Stage I fluids. The decrease in ore fluid δ18OH2Ovalues with time coincided with marked decreases in fluid salinity and temperature. Based on the fluid inclusion and stable isotopic data, we suggest that the ore fluid evolved by boiling of the magmatic brine. Stage III is characterized by the development of pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. Fluids inclusions associated with Stage III display and continuous range of salinities, with the majority being low-salinity inclusions (1.28–3.54 wt.% NaCl equiv.). These fluids yield lower δ18OH2Ovalues (− 0.85 to 5.52‰) and moderate δD values (− 78.6 to − 88.6‰). Altogether, these data indicate that Stage III fluids originated from the mixing of residual Stage II fluids with meteoric water. The sulfur isotope (δ34S) values of Stage III sulfides cover a narrow range of − 4.2 to 1.2‰ (mean = − 1.1‰), and boiling also occurred at low temperatures (165–347 °C) during Stage III. In Stage IV, only L-type fluid inclusions are present, which yielded the lowest homogenization temperatures (157–272 °C) and the lowest salinities (1.06–12.20 wt.% NaCl equiv.). The H–O isotope data indicate that the ore-forming fluids were dominated by magmatic water in Stage I and Stage II, and that the magmatic water gradually mixed with circulating meteoric water during Stage III and Stage IV. This conclusion is further supported by the isotopic composition of lead of the ores, which is similar to that of the monzogranite porphyries, but differs significantly from Permian basalts and Triassic wall rocks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","83","Gold deposits","Copper compounds - Deposits - Economic geology - Garnets - Grading - Igneous rocks - Iron oxides - Isotopes - Magnetite - Mineralogy - Pyrites - Silicate minerals - Silver deposits - Sodium chloride - Structural geology - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","Fluid inclusion - Homogenization temperatures - Hydrothermal activity - Hydrothermal fluids - Isotopic composition - Pb isotopes - Sanjiang Tethyan metallogenic domain - Skarn","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 12120114013501, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 2015M581143, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 41602089, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to Jun Deng for valuable comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

Fresh-sweetness scent was more outstanding in the samples from Yunnan, as was green scent in the samples from Fujian. The results of chemical analysis indicated that the most significant differences were: the potassium content was significantly higher in Fujian samples, while the chlorine content was higher in Yunnan samples. The correlation analysis between aroma note and chemical components showed that the fresh-sweetness and green notes of Yunnan flue-cured tobacco significantly correlated to reducing sugar content, potassium content and potassium/ chlorine ratio, while the fresh-sweetness and green aroma notes of Fujian flue-cured tobacco did not significantly correlate to routine chemical components.

Mineralogy study results showed that silicates were the major minerals, accounting for 89%; iron oxides accounted for about 10%; nickel mainly distributed in the former minerals and iron mainly in the latter ones. Single factor experiments were conducted to determine the effect of various parameters including temperature, duration, and coal dosage on concentration of nickel and iron. However, the recovery of nickel and iron was only 14.2% and 32.5%, respectively, under the obtained optimum conditions. Based on thermomechanical analysis and process analysis of metalized reducing nickel oxide ores, improving concentration of nickel and iron using an accelerant was proposed. Experimental results showed that CaF2addition could distinctly improve concentration of nickel and iron. The fact was that nickel and iron grades in the concentrate increased from 2.6%, 62.6% to 6.9%, 71.4%, respectively; nickel and iron recoveries increased from 14.2%, 32.5% to 96.5%, 73.4%, respectively; and ferronickel alloy in the metalized product changed from granular distribution with particle size of 1 μm to zonal distribution with length of 20~150 μm.

The objective of this study was to reveal the environmental factors associated with high rice productivity in the subtropical environment of Yunnan, China. We conducted cross-locational field experiments using widely different rice varieties in Yunnan and in temperate environments of Kyoto, Japan in 2002 and 2003. The average daily radiation throughout the growing season was greater at Yunnan (17.1 MJ m-2 day-1 average over 2 years) relative to Kyoto (13.2 MJ m-2 day-1). The average daily temperature throughout the growing season was 24.7 °C at Yunnan, and 23.8 °C at Kyoto. The highest yield (16.5 tonnes ha-1) was achieved by the F1 variety Liangyoupeijiu at Yunnan in 2003, and average yield of all varieties was 33% and 39% higher at Yunnan relative to Kyoto in 2002 and 2003, respectively. There was a close correlation between grain yield and aboveground biomass at maturity, while there was little variation in the harvest index among environments. Large biomass accumulation was mainly caused by intense incident radiation at Yunnan, as there was little difference in crop radiation use efficiency (RUE) between locations. Large leaf area index (LAI) was also suggested to be an important factor. Average nitrogen (N) accumulation over 2 years was 49% higher at Yunnan than at Kyoto, and also contributed to the large biomass accumulation at Yunnan. The treatments of varied N application for Takanari revealed that the ratio of N accumulated at maturity to the amount of fertilized N was significantly higher at Yunnan than at Kyoto, even though there was no great difference in soil fertility. The Takanari plot with high N application showed a N saturation in plant growth at Kyoto, which might be related to low radiation and relatively high temperatures during the mid-growth stage. These results indicate that the high potential yield of irrigated rice in Yunnan is achieved mainly by intense incident solar radiation, which caused the large biomass and the N accumulation. The low nighttime temperature during the mid-growth stage was also suggested to be an important factor for large biomass accumulation and high grain yield at Yunnan. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, knowledge on carbon exchanges, their spatio-temporal patterns, and the extent of the key controls that affect carbon fluxes is lacking. In this study, we employed 29-site-years of eddy covariance data to observe the state, spatio-temporal variations and climate sensitivity of carbon fluxes (gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE)) in four representative forest ecosystems in Yunnan. We found that 1) all four forest ecosystems were carbon sinks (the average NEE was − 3.40 tC ha− 1yr− 1); 2) contrasting seasonality of the NEE among the ecosystems with a carbon sink mainly during the wet season in the Yuanjiang savanna ecosystem (YJ) but during the dry season in the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest ecosystem (XSBN), besides an equivalent NEE uptake was observed during the wet/dry season in the Ailaoshan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest ecosystem (ALS) and Lijiang subalpine coniferous forest ecosystem (LJ); 3) as the GPP increased, the net ecosystem production (NEP) first increased and then decreased when the GPP > 17.5 tC ha− 1yr− 1; 4) the precipitation determines the carbon sinks in the savanna ecosystem (e.g., YJ), while temperature did so in the tropical forest ecosystem (e.g., XSBN); 5) overall, under the circumstances of warming and decreased precipitation, the carbon sink might decrease in the YJ but maybe increase in the ALS and LJ, while future strength of the sink in the XSBN is somewhat uncertain. However, based on the redundancy analysis, the temperature and precipitation combined together explained 39.7%, 32.2%, 25.3%, and 29.6% of the variations in the NEE in the YJ, XSBN, ALS and LJ, respectively, which indicates that considerable changes in the NEE could not be explained by variations in the temperature and precipitation.

Combined with geo-chemical parameters of trace elements, the geochemistry and enrichment origin of Re in Ganhe coal are discussed. Compared with the Re average abundance of worldwide hard coals (1 ng/g), the Ganhe coal is remarkably rich in Re (229.14 ng/g). From the correlation analysis of Re concentrations and ash yields, as well as major elements contents, Re is mainly associated with organic matters, and in No. 4 coal is partly associated with clay. Indicated by Sr/Ba, U/Th, Ni/Co, and Vi/Ni+V, Ganhe coal was deposited under an anoxic reducing condition strong influenced by marine. When the Ganhe coal was invaded by possible submarine exhalation, Re was reduced by organic matter, and then the mobility of Re was decreased, and finally Re was absorbed or complicated by organic matter.

The factors that control their development and formative precipitates are poorly understood because these springs, irrespective of location, are mostly inactive. Spring towers found at Shiqiang (Yunnan Province, China), which are up to 4 m high and 3 m in diameter, are formed largely of calcite and aragonite crystal bushes, euhedral calcite crystals and coated grains with alternating Fe-poor and Fe-rich zones, calcite rafts, and cements formed of various combinations of calcite, aragonite, strontianite, Mg-Si reticulate, needle fiber calcite, calcified and non-calcified microbes, diatoms, and insects. Collectively, the limestones that form the towers can be divided into (1) Group A that are friable, porous and form the cores of the towers and have δ18OSMOWvalues of + 15.7 to + 19.7‰ (average 17.8‰) and δ13CPDBvalues of + 5.1 to + 6.9‰ (average 5.9‰), and (2) Group B that are hard and well lithified and found largely around the vents and the tower sides, and have δ18OSMOWvalues of + 13.0 to + 22.0‰ (average 17.6‰) and δ13CPDBvalues of + 1.4 to + 3.6‰ (average 2.6‰). The precipitates and the isotopic values indicate that these were thermogene springs. Growth of the Shiqiang spring towers involved (1) Phase IA when precipitation of calcite and aragonite bushes formed the core of the tower and Phase IB when calcite, commonly Fe-rich, was precipitated locally, (2) Phase II that involved the precipitation of white cements, formed of calcite, aragonite, strontianite, and Mg-Si reticulate coatings in cavities amid the Phase I precipitates, and (3) Phase III, which formed probably after spring activity ceased, when needle-fiber calcite was precipitated and the mounds were invaded by microbes (some now calcified), diatoms, and insects. At various times during this complex history, pore waters mediated dissolution of the calcite and aragonite and sometimes partial alteration of the aragonite. The diverse array of precipitates, depositional fabrics and diagenetic changes clearly indicate that the composition of the spring water changed frequently. Growth of the spring towers at Shiqiang continued until there was insufficient artesian pressure to lift the water above the top of the tower vent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","76","Towers","Bacteria - Calcite - Carbonate minerals - Cements - Dendrites (metallography) - Groundwater - Hot springs - Iron compounds - Isotopes - Lime - Magnesium compounds - Needles - Phytoplankton - Silicon compounds - Vents","Aragonite - Aragonite crystals - Artesian pressure - Calcite crystals - Growth and development - Hydrothermal areas - Isotopic values - Opal-A","402.4 Towers - 412.1 Cement - 444.2 Groundwater - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 531.2 Metallography - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: XDB06020000, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: SIDSSE1301, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: ZA635, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41272370, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was possible because of funding received from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (Grant ZA635 to Jones), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 41172309 and 41272370 to Peng), the Frontier Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIDSSE1301 to Peng), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB06020000 to Peng).

Tectonically it is located in the conjunction of the Cathaysia and Indochina blocks. The orebodies primarily hosted within the stratiform-like skarn and marble in the Paleoproterozoic Nanyangtian formation. Three ore-forming stages have been identified based on mineral assemblages and on the intercalated relationships between the veins. They include skarn-scheelite stage, quartz-scheelite vein stage and carbonate-scheelite vein stage. In this paper, we present 40Ar–39Ar laser incremental heating analyses of hydrothermal biotite intergrowth with scheelite from quartz-scheelite vein with two yielded well-defined 40Ar–39Ar plateau ages of 97.49 ± 0.97 Ma and 99.48 ± 0.97 Ma, and two isochronal ages of 97.01 ± 1.39 Ma and 99.58 ± 0.98 Ma, respectively, representing the age of second mineralization stage of the Nanyangtian tungsten deposit. The ages are well consistent with the emplacement age of the Laojunshan granite (96 Ma to 117 Ma). U–Pb geochronological data for magmatic zircons separated from porphyritic granite dyke in the mine pit indicate that the granite body was emplaced in the post-ore stage (89.88 ± 0.53 Ma). Integrated with previously high resolution diagenetic and metallogenic geochronological data, two significant magmatic-mineralization events are presented in SE Yunnan, China and North Vietnam. The first event took place from 97 Ma to 124 Ma, which is closely related to the tungsten mineralization. The second event occurred from 75 Ma to 95 Ma, which is closely related to the Sn–Cu–Ag–Zn mineralization. According to the exhibited data, we preliminarily conclude that the Late Cretaceous magmatic-mineralization activity in SE Yunnan and North Vietnam is the product of post-collision of the Cathaysia and Indochina blocks and should have formed under a same geodynamic setting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","76","Mineralogy","Biotite - Deposits - Geochronology - Granite - Mica - Ores - Quartz - Tungstate minerals - Tungsten deposits - Tungsten mines - Zircon","Geodynamic setting - Heating analysis - High resolution - Late cretaceous - Mineral assemblage - Nanyangtian - Paleoproterozoic - Post-collision","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines",,"Number: 41203039, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41663006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41203039, 41663006).

How to choose the R&D project is an important research topic, and at the same time, it is also a typical multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel MADM method for selecting the Yunnan Baiyao’s R&D project of toothpastes. Firstly, we use T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs) to express the evaluation information of the toothpastes from decision makers to overcome the shortcomings existing that the traditional information form may cause information distortion. Secondly, we extend the generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean (GMSM) operator to T-spherical fuzzy environment and propose the T-spherical fuzzy GMSM operator (T-SFGMSM) and the T-spherical fuzzy weighted GMSM operator (T-SFWGMSM), where these operators are suitable for the situation which the input information is interrelated. Further, we put forward a novel MADM approach for selecting toothpaste product based upon the T-SFWGMSM operator, which can not only handle a more extensive scope of fuzzy information, but also process the interrelationships between multiple attributes. Lastly, we solve a R&D project selection problem for Yunnan Baiyao Co., Ltd. by the proposed method and make a detailed comparative analysis with other MADM methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the novel approach. © 2019, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association.","","41","Fuzzy inference","Decision making - Fuzzy sets - Spheres","Comparative analysis - Fuzzy environments - Fuzzy information - Information distortion - Multi attribute decision making - Multiple attributes - Project selection problem - Research and development","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 912.2 Management",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province; Number: 71771140, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71771140, 71471172), the Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province (No. ts201511045).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In recent years, with the rapid economic development and continuing population growth, land-use types in Dianchi Lake basin has changed tremendously. The rapid expansion of the construction land in urban and rural areas, resulting in great loss of cultivated land and extensive land use, and the sustainable development of Kunming city has been seriously affected. In order to promote the rational land use of the Dianchi watershed under the China's current land system, through the analysis on the spatial spatial-temporal expansion features of construction land and on the driving forces of the expansion of construction land and intensive land use, we suggest, the government regulation and control mechanisms should be better understood and applied under the present system. First of all, we interpreted out 6 sets year land use type data from the corresponding remote sensing image in Dianchi watershed from 1990 to 2008. And then, in order to analyze spatial-temporal features of construction land in urban and rural Dianchi watershed, in this paper, we measured expansion rate, expansion directions, centrifugal expansion characteristics and fractal expansion characteristics, and the expansion elasticity was introduced to describe the relationship between the expansion rate of construction land and the growth rate of urban population. We argued that the expansion mode of construction land has changed from concentric circles sprawling surround the central city to the dispersed expansion surround Dianchi Lake. In the last part of this research, we analyzed the different impacts of the natural condition factors, economic development factors and the planning and policy factors on the increment of construction land and area per capita of construction land in urban and rural Dianchi watershed. Based on the analysis above, we proposed the recommendation that proper investment and fiscal policies and reasonable urban planning could be implemented to improve the intensive level of construction land. © Chinese Research Institute of Construction Management.","","20","Land use","Cultivation - Economic and social effects - Environmental protection - Expansion - Investments - Lakes - Planning - Population statistics - Project management - Remote sensing - Rural areas - Spatial variables measurement - Sustainable development - Urban growth - Watersheds","Construction land - Economic development - Government regulation - Influential factors - Land use type - Remote sensing images - Spatial-temporal features - Urban and rural areas","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 444.1 Surface Water - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 912.2 Management - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper aims to document the dynamic, traditional forest knowledge (TFK) of the Yi, including: forest categorization methods; routine forest utilization; land tenure and use-right arrangements; benefit-sharing mechanisms; customary regulations; and forest-related beliefs. Our analysis is based on rapid investigations conducted in two dozen Yi 'natural villages' and in-depth studies of three Yi natural villages in Nanhua County, Yunnan. The interrelationship between the forests and Yi livelihoods has developed through farming systems and daily livelihood practices. TFK has contributed to the protection of old-growth forests, which are essential to biodiversity conservation, as well as to human-nature harmonization and equitable resource access through benefit-sharing schemes. However, this knowledge appears to be vulnerable to government policy interventions, the expansion of increasingly globalized market economies, and declining interest in traditional wisdom, knowledge, and lifestyles among younger generations. Further, Yi people remain excluded from processes of policy formulation and implementation. This paper concludes that the inclusion of minority groups such as the Yi in policy formulation could substantially enhance sustainable forest management and social and economic development, while providing an avenue through which to recover and preserve rapidly-vanishing traditional knowledge and practices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","","25","Forestry","Biodiversity - Conservation - Economics - History - Knowledge management - Public policy - Rural areas","Community management - Conflict - Equity - Holly forests - Tenure reform","454 Environmental Engineering - 723.5 Computer Applications - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Mineralization can be considered as a type of singular process due to large amounts of material accumulation and element enrichment. A spatial singularity mapping technique is developed based on the local singularity involved in the context of multifractal theory. It assembles geochemical map at different scales and calculates an index indicating the scaling characteristics of enrichment and depletion of geochemical concentration at multiple scales. This index was used for quantifying spatial singularity of mineralization-associated geochemical anomalies. A case study for the Gejiu tin-polymetallic mineral district, Yunnan Province, China demonstrates that the concepts of singularity and the singularity mapping technique are applicable and useful for delineating anomalies caused by mineralization and for predicting the locations of undiscovered mineral deposits. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considered the northwestern part of Yunnan Province as research area, and took the elevation, slope, rainfall, landform, evapotranspiration and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) as influential factors. Followed by two accuracy indicators TPR and FPR, best models of Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) were established. Then a same test set were used to compare the effectiveness of them. The result shows that as a combined classifier, RF performed the best with TPR is 83.10% and FPR is 0.48%, SVM took second place with TPR is 74.99% and FPR is 1.98%, and LR is inclined to predict occurrence, causing its high FPR 22.71%. The LR, SVM and RF models built in this paper are quite effective and provide a theoretical base for prevention and reduction of debris flow. Additionally, 41 mud sensors data distributed in this region were collected, based on which the debris flow probability of these area were obtained by LR model to explore the effect of mud on debris flow. Experiments find that in some basins, mud has a positive impact on debris flow, and in the remain basins, mud may be slightly influenced by rainfall and thus cause a negative effect on debris flow. © 2018 IEEE.","","14","Support vector machines","Correlation methods - Debris - Decision trees - Forecasting - Rain - Regression analysis","Component - Logistic regressions - Mudflows - Pearson correlation - Random forests - Spatial-temporal data","443.3 Precipitation - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: 41471323, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.41471323, 41661086) and the 3rd term Geology Environment Information Construction ProjectofYunnanProvinceGeographicInformationCenter.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Known historical earthquakes to have struck the study area are the 1713 Xundian of M6.8, 1725 Wanshou mountain of M6.8, the 1733 Dongchuan of M7.8, and the strongest one, the 1833 Songming of M8.0. Although instrumental record did not report events of this magnitude class, the 18th century clustering as well as the 19th century large event prompted the investigation of stress transfer along this fault zone. Coulomb stress changes were calculated assuming that earthquakes can be modeled as static dislocations in an elastic half-space, and taking into account both the coseismic slip in strong (M ≥ 6.8) earthquakes and the slow tectonic stress buildup along the major fault segments. Geological and geodetic data are used to infer the geometry of these faults and long term slip rates on them, as well as for the fault segments that slipped. Evidence is presented that the strong historical events as well as the ones of smaller magnitude that occurred during the instrumental era, are located in areas where the static stress was enhanced.

The Ericaceae is a major component of alpine and subalpine vegetation globally. However, little is known about the spatial pattern of species richness and the factors that drive that richness in Ericaceae. We investigated variation in species richness of Ericaceae along an elevational gradient in Yunnan, China, and used a variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis ordination to examine how those changes might be influenced by the mid-domain effect, the species-area relationship, and climatic variables. Species richness varied significantly with elevation, peaking in the upper third of the elevational gradient. Of the factors examined, climate explained a larger proportion of the variance in species richness along the elevational gradient than either land area or geometric constraints. Species richness showed a unimodal relationship with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. The elevational pattern of species richness for Ericaceae was shaped by the combined effects of climate and competition. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change on species richness for Ericaceae. © 2018 by the authors.","","65","Conservation","Biodiversity - Climate change","Climate - Domain effects - Ericaceae - Species-area relationship - Variation partitioning","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering",,"Number: 31460217, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31670342, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank Ying-Feng Bi for calculating the land area at each elevational band.

The evaluation of cultivated-layer soil quality and the appropriate range of parameters for sloping farmland are the basis for the development of reasonable plough layer. Based on the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), taking the cultivated-layer soil quality of sloping farmland in Yunnan province as the research object, this paper constructed a soil quality index evaluation model (CLSQI) for sloping farmland, and used the minimum data set (MDS) method to screen the evaluation indicators to evaluate the soil quality of sloping farmland in Yunnan, proposed the range of soil parameters for rational tillage in sloping farmland. The results showed that the minimum data set (MDS) of soil quality evaluation of sloping farmland in Yunnan region consisted of five indicators: pH value, total nitrogen, total porosity, soil shear strength and slope. The comparative analysis of AL-CLSQI (the cultivated-layer soil quality index calculated by all indicators) and AL-CLSQI (the cultivated-layer soil quality index calculated by the minimum data set index) showed that the evaluation accuracy of cultivated-layer soil quality based on MDS index was higher. In the primary selection index system, the weights of soil bulk density, total porosity, capillary porosity, shear strength, and slope grade were larger, while in the MDS index system, the weight of the slope and total nitrogen content was larger. The cultivated-layer soil quality index (CLSQI) of sloping cultivated land was between 0.39 and 0.84, the mean value was 0.59±0.11, and the coefficient of variation was 0.19. The cultivated-layer soil quality of sloping farmland was generally 'medium', and it was generally low. The CLSQI of the sloping farmland in different sampling areas was significantly different (PShuangbai>Xuanwei>Ninger>Malong>Shilin. The 0~20 cm sampling depth sloping farmland CLSQI (mean value 0.59) was greater than >20 cm (mean value 0.56), and the CLSQI (mean value 0.61) of purple soil sloping farmland was larger than the red soil (mean value 0.54) (PCentral Yunnan>Southwest Yunnan. According to the corresponding relationship between the soil quality of the cultivated-layer and the crop productivity and membership function, the cultivated-layer was in a relatively reasonable state when the soil quality grade of the sloping farmland was at a 'higher' and above level (CLSQI≥0.6). The appropriate range of MDS indicators for cultivated-layer of sloping land in Yunnan were indicated as follows: the pH value of 5.58~7.82, the total nitrogen content of ≥1.37 g/kg, the total porosity content of ≥52.28%, the soil shear strength value of ≥5.19 kPa, and slope value of ≤11.79°. The suitable range of the above-mentioned cultivated-layer soil parameters can be used as the standard for the rational cultivated-layer diagnosis of sloping farmland in Yunnan. The research can provide theoretical basis and parameter support for the quality evaluation of ploughed plough layer and the construction of reasonable plough layer. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this study, a map of the current distribution of vegetation in Yunnan Province was compiled based on data from remote sensing imagery from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) from 2008 to 2011. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to predict the potential distribution of the main forest vegetation types in Yunnan Province and estimate the changes in carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in response to increasing temperature. The results show that the current total forest area in Yunnan Province is 1.86 × 107ha and that forest covers 48.63% of the area. As the temperature increases, the area of forest distribution first increases and then decreases, and it decreases by 11% when the temperature increases from 1.5 to 2 °C. The mean carbon density of the seven types of forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 84.69 Mg/ha. The total carbon storage of the current forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 871.14 TgC, and the CSP is 1100.61 TgC. The largest CSP (1114.82 TgC) occurs when the temperature increases by 0.5 °C. Incremental warming of 2 °C will sharply decrease the forest CSP, especially in those regions with mature coniferous forest vegetation. Semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests were highly sensitive to temperature changes, and the CSP of these forests will decrease with increasing temperature. Warm-hot coniferous forests have the greatest CSP in all simulation scenarios except the scenario of a 2 °C temperature increase. These results indicate that temperature increases can influence the CSP in Yunnan Province, and the largest impact emerged in the 2 °C increase scenario. © 2018 by the author.","","89","Forestry","Carbon capture - Climate change - Digital storage - Remote sensing - Satellite imagery - Temperature - Vegetation","Carbon sequestration potential - Carbon storage - CART models - Forest vegetation - Temperature increase","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 655.2 Satellites - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques",,"Number: 31770528, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1602234, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We gratefully acknowledge the students and staffof the Institute of Ecology and Geobotany of Yunnan University for assisting with the fieldwork and interpretation of vegetation.

Here, we describe the effects of different abundances of the invasive species Ageratina adenophora on the composition and structure of understory communities and on Pinus yunnanensis seedling growth under pine stands in mid-Yunnan, China. Our data show that the different abundances of A. adenophora altered species and functional diversity by changing the species composition and abundance in the understory community because of its higher specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf phosphorus concentration compared with native species. Meanwhile, the presence of A. adenophora led to changes in the patterns of species co-occurrence, with a shift from random to segregated patterns as the invasion intensity increased. Furthermore, the order of species loss under invasion was nonrandom. The LNC could be an indicative functional trait predicting the order of species loss, suggesting that species with a lower LNC were lost first with increasing invasion intensity. In addition, a high abundance of the invader A. adenophora suppressed the growth of the seedlings of native canopy trees. Our results indicate that the effect of the invasive herb A. adenophora on the understory community is associated with the nonrandom loss of species with different LNCs and that invasion also suppresses the growth of native canopy dominants. © 2018 The Japanese Forest Society.","","55","Forestry","Biodiversity - Plants (botany)","Ecosystem functions - Functional diversity - Functional traits - Invasion - Segregated patterns - Species composition - Understory communities - Understory plant communities","454 Environmental Engineering",,"Number: 2017HC015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FD040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31360152, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31360152), Open Foundation of Yunnan Engineering Laboratory for Agro-environment Pollution Control and Eco-remediation, and The Innovation Team for Farmland Non-pollution Production of Yunnan Province National Key Sciences and Technology Program for Water Solutions (2017HC015), and Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (2014FD040).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results demonstrate that the sedimentary bedding of shale only has a slight influence on matrix permeability, while the fractures can enhance shale permeability dramatically. Even at a maximum effective pressure of 48 MPa, the permeabilities of aligned fractures (without fracture offset) can increase by about one order of magnitude over the permeabilities of the shale matrix. A power–law relation appears to better describe the pressure–dependency of permeability for the tested shale samples than the exponential relationship. The smoother the fracture surface is, the higher the permeability of aligned fractures will be. The fracture offset can improve fracture permeability distinctly. However, the increasing degree of offset fracture permeability is not proportional to the extent of fracture offset. There is a lower pressure sensitivity for offset fracture than aligned fracture. Fracture aperture is the fundamental factor in controlling the fracture permeability, which shows a positive relationship with the cube of fracture aperture. The pressure–dependence of aligned fractures in shale obeys the Walsh permeability model, but the pressure–dependence of offset fractures in shale does not fit well with this model. By combining the experimental results with the geological characteristics of different types of natural fractures, we conclude that the denser vertical intra–formational tension fractures connect with the bed–parallel slip fractures are favorable for step–like migration and enrichment of shale gas in structural highs. The large–scaled high–angle shear fractures likely damage the preservation conditions of shale gas, which is harmful to shale gas enrichment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","70","Fracture","Gas permeability - Sedimentology - Shale gas - Surface roughness - Tensile strength","Controlling factors - Effective pressure - Fracture apertures - Fracture permeability - Geological characteristics - Matrix permeability - Permeability model - Preservation condition","481.1 Geology - 522 Gas Fuels - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 41672134, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFE0106300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41672134), the 13th Five&ndash;year Plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016ZX05034&ndash;002&ndash;003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (CUGCJ1712), and the Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Tectonics and Petroleum Resources (China University of Geosciences in Wuhan) (TPR&ndash;2017&ndash;19, TPR&ndash;2018&ndash;18).

We approach the ground-motion scaling problem by using recordings of 474 small earthquakes with local magnitudes between 3.0 and 5.5 in the 0.3-12 Hz frequency range. Although we had limited observations at hypocentral distances less than 50 km, we derived an absolute ground-motion scaling model for distances of 50 to 400 km. After defining a geometrical spreading function, we found that a Q(f) = 180f0:50, an average site κ = 0:025 s for the vertical component, and a Brune stress drop of Δσ = 3 MPa adequate to model our observations.

Here we present an 8600-year sediment record from Xingyun Lake in Yunnan, China, a transitional zone that receives inputs of precipitation from both the ISM and EASM. Analysis of stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) from authigenic calcite yields a semi-quantitative estimate of the timing and magnitude of lake level change that reflects changes in effective moisture from monsoon variability. Between 8600 and 6900 years BP, δ18O values are stable and low, indicating high lake levels and overflowing conditions resulting from a strong ISM. After 6900 years BP, δ18O values shift to higher values, which we suggest reflects a weakening of the ISM caused by declining summer insolation. The most substantial positive shift in isotopes occurs from 5000 to 4300 years BP and is coincident with aridity in India and the Tibetan Plateau. Other proxy records indicate increased ENSO variability and a southward shift in the ITCZ, which has an effect on the strength and onset of the ISM and may account for this change in hydrologic balance. After 4300 years BP, δ18O values continue to increase reflecting a gradual drying trend, but increases are smaller than prior periods, in part due to lake bathymetry that limits the potential for isotopic enrichment driven by evaporation. The relative influence of the ISM and EASM in the Yunnan Province of China during the Holocene remains a topic for future study, but our results suggest the predominance of the ISM and a possible connection to ENSO patterns on centennial to millennial timescales. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","","79","Atmospheric thermodynamics","Calcite - Isotopes - Lakes - Paleolimnology","China - East Asian summer monsoon - Holocenes - Indian summer monsoon - Precipitation patterns - Quantitative estimates - Stable isotopes - Stable oxygen isotopes","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 482.2 Minerals",,"Number: -, Acronym: GSA, Sponsor: Geological Society of America; Number: 41471013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by a Geological Society of America Graduate Student Grant awarded to Aubrey Hillman.

In the present study, we piloted an experimental cross-sectional monitoring and evaluation design with 30 households in rural Lijiang and Deqin counties in northwest Yunnan province, China. This approach offers the ability to examine the effectiveness of improved cook stove (ICS) programs with a much smaller sample size than the typical population based pre- and post-intervention study that requires a large sample representative of the population. Continuous PM2.5was measured with the UCB (currently known as UCB-PATS) and the TSI DustTrak and continuous CO was measured with the HOBO CO logger. Using the traditional method of cooking and heating, mean 24-h PM2.5and CO concentrations in the kitchen were measured in the range of 0.15-0.71 mg m-3for PM2.5and 3.0-11 ppm for CO. These concentrations were compared to using a combination of improved stoves in the kitchen where PM2.5and CO concentrations were measured in the range of 0.08-0.18 mg m-3for PM2.5and 0.7-5.5 ppm for CO. These concentrations yielded statistically significant reduction in IAP when replacing the traditional fireplace or traditional stove with an improved stove combination. Finally, we show a strong correlation between CO and PM2.5(R2= 0.72-0.76). The combination of this experimental design along with the monitoring and evaluation protocol presented here may provide a robust framework to rapidly assess the effectiveness of ICS interventions in progress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","25","Indoor air pollution","Cobalt - Developing countries - Fuels - Heating - Stoves","Biomass-burning - China - Cook stove - Monitoring and evaluations - Pollutant emission - Post interventions - Strong correlation - Traditional biomass","451 Air Pollution - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,"Number: -, Acronym: NCC, Sponsor: Nature Conservancy of Canada; Number: -, Acronym: UC, Sponsor: University of California; ","We appreciate the assistance of the field workers and staff from Yunnan Institute of Environmental Science (YIES) in Kunming, China for collecting the field data; the staff at the Nature Conservancy in China for logistical support, Professor Kirk R.

In the context of global warming, the LSWT of global lakes generally reveals an upward trend. With a continuous intensification of human activities and a rapid expansion of the impervious surface, urbanization has exerted an increasing impact on the environment, so the impact of human activities on LSWT cannot be ignored. Because of the special geographical location, the change of LSWT in plateau lakes has important impacts on climate diversity, biodiversity, and cultural diversity. As a result, it is critical to monitor and model the variation characteristics of LSWT in the plateau area. Based on the data set of natural factors representing climate change and human factors representing human activities, this study proposes a classification of lake types by K-Means clustering method. At watershed scale, 11 lakes in the study area are divided into three types: Natural Lake, Semi-urban Lake, and Urban Lake (UL). Based on this classification, the variation characteristics of LSWT for the eleven lakes from 2001 to 2017 are analyzed. The causal relationship and contribution of climate change and human activities to the rise of LSWT are discussed. Results show that (1) from 2001 to 2017, the annual mean of LSWT-day/night and near-surface air temperature in the 11 lakes show a warming trend, a significant correlation (R = 0.82, α = 0.0164 ©2019.
