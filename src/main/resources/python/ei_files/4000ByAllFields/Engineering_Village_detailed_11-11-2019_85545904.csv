In this study, the nonconventional processes of electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electro-polishing (EP) have been conducted to investigate the machining of Mo metal and fabrication of Mo grid. Satisfactory surface quality was obtained using appropriate EDM parameters of Ip 3A and Tonmax= 8.51μm) to 0.23μm (Rmax= 1.48μm). Machined Mo metal surface, when used as grid component in electron gun, needs to be modified by coating materials with high work function, such as silicon carbide (SiC). The main purpose of this study is to explore the electrical discharge coating (EDC) process for coating the SiC layer on EDMed Mo metal. Experimental results proved that the appropriate parameters of Ip= 5A and Ton= 50μs at Toff= 10μs can obtain the deposit with about 60μm thickness. The major phase of deposit on machined Mo surface was SiC ceramic, while the minor phases included MoSi2and/or SiO2with the presence of free Si due to improper discharging parameters and the use of silicone oil as the dielectric fluid. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","12","Molybdenum","Coatings - Deposits - Electric discharge machining - Electric discharges - Electrolytes - Electron guns - Refractory metals - Silica - Silicon carbide - Silicon oxides - Silicones - Surface roughness","Coating material - Electrical discharge machining - Electrical discharges - Electrolyte flow rates - High work function - Molybdenum metals - Nonconventional process - Silicon carbides (SiC)","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 604.2 Machining Operations - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is one of the most difficult issues in mineral prospecting and potential resource assessment as how to separate gravity and magnetic anomaly, which is significant for mineral exploration from original composite anomaly. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is considered to be an effective method in superimposed information separation. In this paper, a new bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) method is proposed, that is, biharmonic spline interpolation (BSI) instead of general spline interpolation for improving stability. As a case study, gravity and magnetic data in Gejiu, Yunnan, China, have been used to extract local anomaly which could reveal potential information in mineral exploration by multiscale and nonlinear decomposition with BEMD method.

E. adenophorum could be made use of an energy plant for biogas production, despite the fact that EaS straw rich in cellulose. We speculate that utilizing E. adenophorum as a biogas feedstock will maximize energy conversion efficiency and this method can maximize benefits with respect to carbon management and greenhouse gas emissions, creating benefits for both environmental remediation and energy production [1]. Compared with only methane production or only hydrogen production, the hydrogen fermentation process previous methane fermentation, by regulating pH value of E. adenophorum fermentation system, can increase material utilization ratio and shorten the methane fermentation reaction time.

In this paper the chromatic contrast was defined as color difference CIEDE2000, the sensitivity was defined as reciprocal of threshold of the color difference, and the CSFs called color difference sensitivity functions were measured. Methods. The CSFs of 4 subjects were measured for nine spatial frequencies(0.28, 0.56, 1.00, 1.97, 2.95, 4.72, 6.74, 11.80 and 15.74cpd) gratings of mean luminance of 40cd/m2 on a CRT display. Measurements were made for gratings whose average color was a chromatically neutral point(a*=0 and b*=0) and also for modulations around four chromatic points along the color directions a* and b* in the CIELAB color space. Results. The thresholds of color difference are from 0.74 to 6.67 in the range of experimental frequencies. The color difference sensitivity functions are similar with known results that CSF curves for the two chromatic directions are consistently low-pass irrespective of the average color of the stimulus. The sensitivity to gratings for b* direction is identical as for a* direction below spatial frequency 4.72cpd, however, the sensitivity for b* direction is smaller than the one for a* direction above spatial frequency 4.72cpd, which indicates that the CIEDE2000 threshold for grating with lower frequencies(i.e., small color differences) is not related to the chromatic direction and chromatic point of modulation, however, the threshold is related to the chromatic direction and chromatic point of modulation for large color differences.","","10","Color vision","Biomedical engineering - Cathode ray tubes - Color image processing - Diffraction gratings - Sensitivity analysis - Spatial variables measurement","Chromatic contrast - CIE DE2000 - CIELAB color space - Color difference - Contrast sensitivity functions","943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 921 Mathematics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 741.2 Vision - 741.1 Light/Optics - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 461.1 Biomedical Engineering","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In fact, decision makers cannot always provide exact utilities and in some cases, it is more convincible to describe utilities with interval values than precise ones. This paper is about extending general IDs (with precise single-valued parameters) into IDs with interval-valued utilities. Such extension is interesting because it enables one to model decision making processes in the situation that utilities are represented by interval values.

Its existence exacerbates the degree of damage of the instrument. We are not willing to see it. However, all large-scale heavy equipment has a certain degree of danger. For operators, there has been a lack of effective guidance methods for the monitoring of metal structure damage for a long time. The cranes involved in this article are even more bulky. If problems arise, they will not only endanger the life of the workers, but also cause some economic losses. Due to a variety of man-made uncontrollable and complicated factors, there are no concrete simple and feasible methods for engineering cracking of some metal cracks. Therefore, it is a very important topic to study the monitoring method of cracks in metal structures of cranes.

This paper will operate indoor isothermal experiments of adsorption and desorption, the specific surface area - pore radius distribution instrument to measure the phase composition, specific surface and the characteristics of pore radius of passivators. The main result shows that: (1) The results of indoor isothermal experiments of adsorption and desorption show that steel slag, palygorskite and phosphate rock all have a good adsorption of heavy metal ion bivalent cadmium; the adsorption isotherm is conforming to L equation and F equation. These four passivators' adsorption on Cd2+ tend to increase as the initial concentration increases. Under the condition of same initial concentration, these four passivators have different adsorption capacities on Cd2+. Under the condition of same equilibrium concentration, these four passivators' adsorptions on Cd2+ is steel slag phosphate rock≈palygorskite charcoal and under the condition of low concentration. (2) Experiments of adsorption and desorption show that steel slag has a relatively small desorption on heavy metal ion Cd2+, ground phosphate rock, charcoal and palygorskite have an increasing desorption on this heavy metal ion as the adsorptions increase. Specifically, when the adsorption reaches its peak, desorption on Cd2+ is charcoal palygorskite phosphate rock steel slag. After the comparisons we could find that among these four passivators, charcoal has a relatively huge desorption on Cd2+. (3) Among these four passivators, charcoal and palygorskite have relatively huge specific surfaces and pore volumes. The passivation mechanism of heavy metal is mainly physical adsorption and ion exchange adsorption. Though steel slag and phosphate rock have relatively smaller specific surfaces and pore volumes, they have higher pH values. The passivation mechanism of heavy metal is mainly chemical precipitation reaction. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","26","Adsorption","Adsorption isotherms - Bridge decks - Charcoal - Composite materials - Desorption - Heavy metals - Ion exchange - Manufacture - Metal ions - Passivation - Phosphate deposits - Pollution - Precipitation (chemical) - Rocks - Slags","Adsorption and desorptions - Chemical precipitation - Equilibrium concentration - Ground phosphate rock - Initial concentration - Ion-exchange adsorption - Isothermal experiments - Pore radius distribution","401.1 Bridges - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 524 Solid Fuels - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 531.1 Metallurgy - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 539.2.1 Protection Methods - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It requires abundant knowledge with prominent skills. Normally, the medical staffs, especially novices are trained to master the skills and accumulate experiences with several methods such as watching video, training with the simulated patient (SP), and so on. However, the drawbacks of the above methods, such as lack of multi-symptoms, lack of active interactions, etc, limit the training effects. To make up them, several kinds of medical training simulators have been developed to improve training effectiveness. However, most of these simulators just focus on mimicking the symptoms. The could not simulate the pathology of diseases. In this paper, we will propose an elbow robot named WKE-2(Waseda Kyotokagaku Elbow Robot No.2) to simulate the symptoms of motor nerve system for neurologic examination training on elbow force examination. In this paper, the mechanism of the elbow robot and physiological neurological model is described. As a sample, the performance of lead-pipe symptoms is introduced. Taking advantage of the robot, the trainee can get a full training on the examination skills and knowledge as well as the understanding of disease effection. Finally, several experiments are performed to verify the proposed robot. The results lead to the consideration that the approach is worth following in further research.1 © 2015 IEEE.","","24","Robots","Automation - Medical education - Neurology - Physiological models","Medical robots - Medical training - Medical training simulator - Neurological examination - Neurological models - Physical examinations - Simulated patients - Training effectiveness","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.5 Robotics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Multiple concrete spring points were distributed at side edges of the prism, deformation of concrete spring points were separately considered in axial directions and tangential directions, and they were mutually coupled in stiffness and strength. Reinforced spring points were arranged at intersection points between reinforcements and polygon prisms, and dowel action of reinforcements were neglected. Through a comparison between numerical simulation results and model test results, it could be seen that numerical simulation could accord with model test very well in aspects of failure mode and load-displacement curve. Axial compression ratio and out-of-plane deformation were taken as parameters to expand test data. Research found that when axial compression was not large, increase of axial compression ratio improved bearing capacity of the specimen. If in-plane force was conducted after a certain displacement out-of-plane was applied, the greater the out-of-plane displacement above the shear wall was, the more the in-plane bearing capacity reduced, and the more in-plane deformability degraded. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","19","Shear walls","Axial compression - Bearing capacity - Bridge decks - Composite materials - Data compression ratio - Deformation - Earthquakes - Manufacture - Numerical models - Prisms - Reinforced concrete","Bi-directional earthquakes - Load-displacement curve - Model and simulation - Out-of-plane deformations - Out-of-plane displacement - Reinforced concrete shear walls - Tangential directions - Thickness direction","401.1 Bridges - 402 Buildings and Towers - 412 Concrete - 484 Seismology - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 90715004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 90715004.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the aspect of system overhead, an identity based batch signature verification algorithm is adopted, which makes the number of bilinear pairings calculated only 3 times and has nothing to do with the number of users. Moreover, the improved Paillier algorithm used also greatly reduces the computational overhead.

This is characterized by advanced technology. The safety issues of large-scale machinery have always been the focus of our attention, especially based on their consideration of experimental public safety. For cranes, its large size is not strong enough for sudden gale-like disasters. This is something we need to consider. Therefore, improving the wind resistance of cranes and even their components, such as brakes, is a very necessary research topic. This article is devoted to this article and hopes to bring great help to engineering practice and put them into practice. We have simply calculated the windproof capacity and braking capacity required by the crane, simulated some important components, studied some differences between the actual and ideal, and obtained a certain requirement for the brake and crane to meet. Relationships, experiments show that this method does have its actual effect. At the same time, we have inevitably given some detailed countermeasures for some rough and sudden natural disasters.

But for some sparse signals, the separation effect is not ideal. The alternate decomposition algorithm can be used as the optimization method for the signal that is less sparse. Alternate decomposition approach is to update the mixed matrix in each iteration and estimate the source signals so that the parameters can be updated in each iteration, the sparse components can be obtained, and then the source signal is reconstructed. If a decorrelation step has been joined in every iteration, it can reduce the correlation between signals effectively, and get sparse and independent of composition in the separation process.

The acetogenesis pathway almost disappeared between days 24 and 72.6) Even though the overall microbial communities consisted of >400 species, the key bacteria and archaea for hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis comprised 13–15 species, and most of these species had high similarity (≥97%) to culturable strains. © 2017","","53","Bacteria","Biogas - Cellulose - Fermentation - Fertilizers - Hydrolysis - Manures - Metabolism - RNA - Throughput","Abiotic factors - Bacterial community - Biogas fermentation - High-throughput sequencing - Metabolic pathway analysis - Metabolic pathways - Microbial community dynamics - Microbial community structures","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes",,"Number: 20135303110001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015KF07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; Number: 31160123/C0309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 2013DH041, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FA030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","The authors thank the following for their generous grant funding: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC; 31160123/C0309 ); the Yunnan Provincial Sciences and Technology Platform Promotion Plan ( 2013DH041 ); the Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Universities ( 20135303110001 ); the Yunnan Province Key Fund of Applied Basic Research ( 2014FA030 ); and the Open Fund from Yunnan Provincial Renewable Energy Engineering Key Laboratory ( 2015KF07 ).

Simulation results show that the reflection spectrum moves to the lower frequency side with respect to a small change of sample permittivity, and the relation between resonant frequency and sample permittivity reveals a good linearity. Finally, the Dual-D CSR can increase the interaction area between electric field and sample. This feature making the sensor very sensitivity to surrounding sample substances.

It focuses on finding an efficient scheduling strategy for massive computing in parallel and distributed systems so that the make-span of the workload is minimized. Most existing scheduling models assume that all processors are idle at the beginning of workload assignment. However, in the real parallel and distributed environments, many processors may still in busy when a new workload arrived. Processors may have different waiting time from the busy state to the idle, that is, processors have different release time. This paper proposed a release-time aware divisible-load scheduling model with hybrid time constraints and designed an effective global optimization genetic algorithm to solve it. Finally, the experiment results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","","17","Scheduling algorithms","Genetic algorithms - Global optimization - Network security - Parallel processing systems - Scheduling","Distributed environments - Divisible load scheduling - Efficient scheduling - New genetic algorithms - Optimization genetic algorithms - Parallel and distributed systems - Release time - Time constraints","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we present a novel attack and detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping where the malicious node drops one packet or more and injects a new fake packet instead. Our novel detection mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. It relies on a very simple yet powerful idea, the creation time of each packet.

It is an essential issue in plenty of robotic applications. Safety aware collision-free coverage motion planning of an autonomous vehicle is one of the major challenges in intelligent vehicle systems. Many studies have been focused on the obstacle avoidance to prevent 'too close' or 'too far' from obstacles, but difficult to obtain an optimal path. In this paper, a virtual obstacle (VO) based safety aware strategy integrated with a biologically inspired neural network (BNN) method is proposed for CMP in a non-stationary environment as safety consideration is greatly crucial in vehicle CMP. The real-time vehicle trajectory is planned through the varying neural activity landscape that represents the dynamic environment. The proposed model for vehicle navigation with safety consideration is capable of planning a real-time appropriate trajectory. The proposed approach is capable of overcoming the either 'too close' or 'too far' shortcoming. Simulation and comparison studies validate that the proposed model is capable of performing CMP mission to plan more reasonable and shorter collision-free trajectories in non-stationary and unstructured environments. © 2015 IEEE.","","15","Robot programming","Automation - Collision avoidance - Motion planning - Navigation - Neurons - Robots - Trajectories - Vehicles","Bio-inspired neural network - Biologically inspired neural networks - Collision-free - Collision-free trajectory - Intelligent vehicle systems - Non-stationary environment - Safety-aware - Virtual obstacle","461.9 Biology - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.5 Robotics - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Assessment of local influence is investigated in nonlinear structural equation models with nonignorable missing outcomes from reproductive dispersion models on the basis of the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function. Some local influence diagnostics are obtained via observations of missing data and latent variables that are generated by the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm on the basis of the conformal normal curvature.

Comparing the vector magnetograms obtained by S3T and by the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), basic agreement on the longitudinal and transverse components between the S3T and MSFC magnetograms is found, resulting in correlation coefficients ρB = 0.904, ρBt = 0.749 and ρaz = 0.941.

When the filling fractions are riveted, altering the radiuses of elliptical cylinder transverse cross sections, the wider band gaps can be achieved at larger filling fractions. While the widths of band gaps are expanded by rotating the elliptical cylinders around their central axes, the maximums of band gap widths appear at the elliptical cyinders rotated by an angle of 44° or 45°, and the band gaps wider than the dimension of cylinders phononic crystals can be obtained.

With its set-a-time nature, the KNN-join is able to facilitate many data mining tasks such as classification, outlier detection and clustering. MuX and Goreder are two algorithms specially designed for KNN-join. Since the MuX makes use of R-tree to reduce CPU cost, it suffers like all of the algorithms based on R-tree. In order to optimize both I/O and CPU cost, the Goreder applies a grid on data space. With the difference of data distribution, however, it is difficult to determine the cell's appropriate granularity. In the consequence, the Goreder tends to perform poorly. In this paper, a novel parallel method-pgi-distance (parallel grid index-distance)-is proposed, which combines the advantages of MuX and Goreder. On the one hand, the pgi-distance utilizes a two-tier structure to optimize I/O and CPU time separately. On the other hand, the index based on distance makes the pgi-distance adapted well to data dimensionality and data distribution. Especially the index in the pgi-distance is B+-tree, which is supported by all commercial DBMS. So, this method becomes more applicable than that based on R-tree. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real datasets are conducted, and the results illustrate that pgi-distance is efficient.","","14","Data mining","Classification (of information) - Data processing","Data distribution - Datasets - KNN-join - Parallel grid index distance - R-tree","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Applications (APP); Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Atomic force microscope (AFM) provided the surface conditions. The results show that inhibition efficiency increases with the inhibitor concentration, while it decreases with the sulfuric acid concentration. The adsorption of inhibitor on the cold rolled steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. Effect of immersion time was studied and discussed. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of cold rolled steel was also studied at four temperatures ranging from 30 to 60°C, the thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption heat, adsorption free energy, and adsorption entropy were calculated. The results revealed that the adsorption was physisorption mechanism. A kinetic study of cold rolled steel in uninhibited and inhibited acid was also discussed. The kinetic parameters such as apparent activation energy, pre-exponential factor, rate constant, and reaction constant were calculated for the reactions of corrosion. The inhibition effect is satisfactorily explained by both thermodynamic and kinetic models. Polarization curves show that Tween-20 is a cathodic-type inhibitor in sulfuric acid.
