For the electrode of a-Si/Ag/a-Si, a critical thickness of the silver layer (30 nm) is found; in this case, it exhibits the highest capacity retention of 70% after 200 cycles at a current density of 65.2 μA cm−2 within the voltage range of 0.01-1.5 V.

The results showed that the content of water soluble polysaccharide was increased, and the activity of hydrolase such as cellulase, pectinase and glucomylase were also enhanced. The content of neutral sugar increased with the ferment time increasing and the MW of raw polysaccharide showed significant difference during fermentation. The main polysaccharide TPS2 and TPS1 were isolated and purified from Pu-erh tea and its materials by DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-150 column chromatography. TPS2 contains the higher content of uronic acid, but TPS1contains the higher contents of neutral sugar and protein. Monosaccharide analysis by GC-MS revealed that TPS1 and TPS2 were composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, rhamnose, xylose and mannose with molar ratios of 24.2:23.6:5.9:3.2:1.8:1.1 and 19.3:26.9:3.2:2.7:1.3:5.5, respectively. The average molecular weight of TPS1 and TPS2 was 1.68 × 104 and 1.21 × 104 Daltons, respectively. UV scanning spectrum showed that TPS1 and TPS2 had no characteristic absorption between 200 and 400 nm wavelength, it suggested that they contain trace protein. IR spectrum of TPS1 and TPS2 demonstrated that pyranoid rings were contained in them. As shown in the image of atomic force microscope, the molecular appearance of TPS1 and TPS2 resembled islands and apparently consisted of conglomerations. The height of conglomerations of TPS2 was about 40 nm and the length or width was 0.5-0.8 μm, while the height of conglomerations of TPS1 was about 4 nm and the length or width was 0.2-0.4 μm. TPS2 shows sheet conglomerations with rough surface, but TPS1 shows squama conglomerations with smooth surface in the image of scanning electron micrograph. The experimental data suggested that the variation of composition and spectral properties of polysaccharide isolated from Pu-erh tea and its materials owed to the action of microorganism and humid and thermal action for long time process.","14","Fermentation","Absorption spectroscopy - Atomic force microscopy - Column chromatography - Glucose - Ignition - Ion exchange - Molar ratio - Polysaccharides - Proteins - Scanning electron microscopy - Yeast","Average molecular weight - Characteristic absorption - Green tea - Pu-erh teas - Scanning electron micrographs - Solid-state fermentation - Spectral properties - Water-soluble polysaccharides","521.1 Fuel Combustion - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The two intersecting coplanar circles have four intersection points in the projective plane: two real points and two circular points. In the image plane, the diagonal triangle-on which the image of the four intersection points composes a complete quadrangle-is a self-polar triangle for the projection curves of the circles. The vertex of the self-polar triangle is the null space of the degenerate conic formed by the image of the four intersection points. By solving the three vertices of the self-polar triangle using the image coordinates of the two real intersection points, the degenerate conic can be obtained. The image of the two circular points is then computed from the intersection points of the degenerate conic.

First of all, we localized large-scale cortical regions of interest (ROIs) by recently developed and validated brain reference system named Dense Individualized Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL) to address the limitations in the identification of the brain network ROIs in previous studies. Then, the structural brain network of each subject was constructed based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data.

With such large databases, effective tools are needed in order to browse these sites. Search using keywords, tags and albums provide a basic level of filtering but is not sufficient to handle the thousands of results that are typically returned. Consequently, there is a need to go beyond image metadata, taking into account the image content itself to perform integrated browsing based on visual characteristics as well as keywords. While various approaches to visualisation and browsing of image databases have been introduced, these are too slow to be applied to online retrieval results, since the complete image files would need to be downloaded for feature extraction and exploitation. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem whilst being entirely client-side. We construct an interactive image database navigation application that uses the Huffman table in JPEG files as features, and projects image thumbnails onto a 2-dimensional visualisation space based on principal component analysis derived from the Huffman entries. Images are dynamically placed into a grid structure and organised in a tree-like hierarchy for visual browsing. Since we utilise information only from the JPEG header, we significantly reduce the required bandwidth and thus allow for interactive browsing of photo search results. © 2013 IEEE.","13","Signal processing","Content based retrieval - Principal component analysis - Visualization","Content based image retrieval - Flickr - Grid structures - Image browsing - Image database - Image thumbnails - Interactive browsing - Interactive images","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper studies the appropriate combination of features extracted from the mirror-like odd and even face images under the noise condition, respectively, with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method. The recognition effects of different combinational methods are studied. Experiments show that when the noise signals are added into the face images, the composition of the features from the mirror-like odd images and the mirror-like even images will change in order to keep good recognition effect, that is, the proportion of mirror-like even features should be increased in the combinational eigenvectors, compared with the mirror-like odd features.

However, such superior performance, especially the resolution capability is greatly restricted by the number of observed measurements. Specially, if the measurements are reduced, images with high sidelobes and lower resolution are formed. The recent developed compressed sensing (CS) as well as its application in radar imaging demonstrates that, if the sparsity constraint is cooperated in the imaging technique, high resolution imaging quality can be still achieved, even using limited measurements. In this paper, a new chirp scaling azimuth compression technique based on CS theory is proposed, which exploits the sparse property of the measurements in azimuth dimension, and the sparsity constraint is combined with the CSA to perform all the azimuth processing steps. Comparisons were performed between the proposed algorithm using data under-sampled in the azimuth dimension at different ratios and the traditional CSA using full data set at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Results show that the proposed CS based algorithm has better performance than the traditional algorithm even with using low percentage of the azimuth data and also indicate that the proposed algorithm is robust with the existence of low SNR. © 2013 IEEE.","16","Radar imaging","Compressed sensing - Computation theory - Radar measurement - Radar signal processing - Signal to noise ratio - Synthetic aperture radar","Azimuth compression - Chirp scaling - Chirp Scaling algorithm - Compressive sensing - High-resolution imaging - High-resolution SAR - Resolution capability - Sparsity constraints","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is even hard for experts, let alone computer-aided diagnosis systems. Recently, some deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based methods have been introduced to tackle this problem, achieving much impressive performance. However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision. In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task. We implement extensive experiments on the public benchmark MICCAI gland 2015 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our method achieve a better segmentation result in terms of visual perception and two quantitative metrics, compared with other methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","17","Image segmentation","Binary images - Biochemistry - Bioinformatics - Computer aided diagnosis - Deep neural networks - Neural networks - Semantic Web - Semantics - Textures","Adversarial learning - Adversarial networks - Colon gland - Computer aided diagnosis systems - Convolutional neural network - Quantitative metrics - Segmentation results - Semantic segmentation","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 801.2 Biochemistry - 903 Information Science",,"","This work is supported by the innovative research program of Yunnan University (nos.

The crystal structure, impurity formation energy, electronic structure and optical properties of TiO2 supercells containing subsitutional nitrogen, interstitial nitrogen or oxygen vacancies were calculated. TiO2 doped with substitutional nitrogen has shallow acceptor states above the valence band. In contrast, TiO2 doped with interstitial nitrogen has isolated impurity states in the middle of the band gap. These impurity energy levels are mainly hybridized by N 2p states with O 2p states and Ti 3d states. TiO 2 containing oxygen vacancy has shallow donor states below the conduction band, which consists of Ti 3d states. Except for containing oxygen vacancies, the band gaps of N-doped TiO2 are narrowed in the range 0.03-0.23 eV, and thus their fundamental absorption edges extend to the visible-light region. By nitrogen doping, the octahedral dipole moments in TiO2 increase due to the changes in lattice parameters, bond length and charges on atoms, which is very effective for the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs.
