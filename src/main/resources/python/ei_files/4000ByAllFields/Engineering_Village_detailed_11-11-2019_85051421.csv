The depth of the hypocenter is 10 km. Due to this disaster, 617 people were died, 112 people disappeared and 108 840 000 people were injured. According to the superposition effects of the moon declination angle, sunspot extreme year cycles and the two, summed up 2013-2014 years is Yunnan strong earthquake periods of high risk, with the condition for the occurrence of Ms7 earthquake. The following year, forecast method based SW fingerprint information using the earthquake precursory instrument, developed by the end of 2014 211 earthquake prediction table, predict 2014 August Sichuan (26.18°N, 105.33°E) Ms5.3 earthquake will occur. The Ludian Ms6.5 earthquake occurred on August 3, 2014 indicates that the error of the predicted date is only 1 day, the predicted epicenter is about 226 km away from the actual earthquake epicenter. Besides that the actual magnitude is Ms1.2 larger than the predicted magnitude. According to the comprehensive analysis in tectonic setting, the S-wave crustal velocity structure and the focus mechanism of the Ludian earthquake, we believe that the Baogunao-Xiaohe left-lateral strike-slip fault triggered the Ludian earthquake, while the junction of the middle-low crust's low-velocity (high-conductivity) body and the Baogunao-Xiaohe fault is the location of the focus releasing the accumulated energy which practically is the epicenter.

How to find more accurate structural holes has become a key problem in the research. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect the top-k structure holes based on the shortest path increment.

It was also discovered that, the decomposition takes place for all the derived words, regardless of participants' familiarity with them. Based on these results, it was proposed that, the morphological decomposition is an automatic processing mechanism for polymorphemic words.

To full utilize cluster resources, the cluster management system is being challenged by the scaling cloud size and the often more complicated application requirements. Omega scheduling software provides a flexible and scalable shared-state scheduling architecture for large scale cluster scheduling. One of its key ideas is using an optimistic concurrency control (OCC) algorithm to let parallel schedulers concurrently make decisions. However, there are few studies exploring to extend OCC for a shared-state scheduling architecture. Furthermore, most of the traditional' shared-state scheduling architectures also use the same OCCs as Omega does. In this paper, we present a multi attribute Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory based OCC for shared-state scheduling. This OCC adapts the multi attribute D-S evidence theory to help making conflict decisions for some scheduling transactions. Experiments' results show that our method can obtain in some respects more optimized scheduling results compared to coarse-grained conflict detection of Omega.","26","Scheduling","Big data - Cluster computing - Computation theory - Concurrency control","Application requirements - Cluster management system - D S evidence theory - Dempster-Shafer evidence theory - Large-scale clusters - Optimistic concurrency controls - Scheduling architecture - Shared state","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 912.2 Management",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Due to the increasing population, the number of residential areas, schools, hospitals and other facilities is increasing, and unreasonable distribution will inevitably take place. The main purpose of urban planning is to coordinate the specific arrangement of urban spatial layout and various concrete construction by rationally utilizing the urban land according to the determined nature, scale and development direction of the city. From this point of view, by planning the city to make the population of the city rationally distributed, and fully analyzing the factors of people's gathering according to the existing layout of the city, these elements can be planned and constructed in a centralized manner so as to solve the problems of transportation, environment, etc. in the city. This paper analyzes the reasonable and advanced urban layout and extracts useful knowledge from the spatial data, thus helping the relevant agencies of the government to plan and develop the new urban area. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","5","Urban planning","Physics","Continuous development - Development directions - Living quality - Residential areas - Spatial data - Spatial layout - Urban construction - World economy","403.1 Urban Planning and Development",,"","Finally, I would like to thank everyone who helped me throughout the writing process.

A method to correct the results of mobile observations by using the information from GPS continuous observation in the same area is given in this study. Firstly, amplitudes of annual motion in GPS continuous stations were calculated. The amplitudes were used to obtain the amplitudes in mobile stations by using spatial interpolation method. With the results above, the vertical time-series of mobile GPS could be corrected to weaken the annual motion effect, so the vertical velocity results were acquired with improved precision. Two tests based on the continuous (from 2010 to 2013) and mobile observation (from 2011 to 2013) from tectonic and environmental observation network (hereinafter referred to as TEONET) in Yunnan area are proposed to prove its reliability.

It was calculated that the rock mass at two adjacent adits shows statistical similarity in the lower limit of weak weathering, slightly weathering and fresh rock zones, and can be divided into statistically homogeneous areas, however it shows no statistical similarity in the upper limit of weak weathering.

The border effect literatures show that geographic boundaries have obvious impacts on economic, social and cultural relations in both sides of a nation border. Particularly in cross-border ethnic areas, each ethnic group has strong internal spatial structure relevance, and the boundary effect is more obvious. However, most of China's border areas are cross-border ethnic areas, each of border issues is unique. Under this perspective, we analyze the border effects of various boundaries can provide basis for formulating border management policies. For small scale of cross-border ethnic minority areas, how to formulate the boundary management policy is a good question to explore. This paper is demonstrated by a study of the impact of border management policies in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province at the border area to Burma. The comparative method is used to analysis the border management policies in past 50 decades for the border area of Yunnan Province .This research aims to define trends within border policy and its influences to national security. This paper also examines Wendy Brown's liberal theory of border management policy. We found that it is not suitable for Sino-Burma border area. The conclusion is that the changes or instability of international economic and political situation has more influence to this cross-border ethnic area, and only innovative policy will be effective in cross-border ethnic area. So the border management policies should reflect the change of international context.","19","National security","Artificial intelligence - Earth sciences - Remote sensing - Software engineering","Border effects - Cross-border - Geographic border - Liberalism - Management policy","404.1 Military Engineering - 723.1 Computer Programming - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The environmental factors such as temperature-humidity and soil humidity are the key influencing factors on crop growth, therefore, how to rapidly and accurately acquire the environmental information of crop growth and learn about their real-time growing environment is of vital importance. The wireless sensor networks (WSN) can make real-time environmental information acquisition as well as communication and processing of network environmental data. Based on this, the RSSI range-based positioning method was optimized in this paper in order to greatly improve its precision. To be specific, in this study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was firstly applied in the hybrid mutation strategy to make more accurate node positioning and significantly improve the evolutionary performance by enlarging the hunting zone; besides, through the use of WSN, the influencing parameters on crop growth such as soil humidity, and temperaturehumidity etc. would be monitored; finally, to realize the precise location and derive the unseeded nodes, GPS was applied for accurate positioning, and the intelligence algorithm was adopted to determine the coordinate position of unknown nodes. At last, the actual field test indicates that the designed monitoring system in this paper satisfies the requirements for precise measurement, playing a positive role in promoting the development of precision agriculture. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.","20","Precision agriculture","Crops - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Seed - Sensor nodes - Wireless sensor networks - Zigbee","Agricultural development - Environmental information - Influencing parameters - Intelligence algorithms - Key influencing factors - Particle swarm optimization algorithm - Unseeded system - ZigBee technology","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effect of PLA, PLA/TiO2, and PLA/TiO2+ Ag film on the physicochemical and microbiological properties of Yunnan cottage cheese stored at 5 ± 1 °C for 25 days was investigated. The low density polyethylene (LDPE) film was used as the control. The weight loss, pH value, lactic acid bacteria count (LAB), texture, sensory quality, and antimicrobial activity were determined. Cheeses packed by PLA/TiO2and PLA/TiO2+Ag film provided better retention in pH value, LAB, sensory quality, and antimicrobial activity compared with those packed by PLA and LDPE film. Migration of Ti and Ag nanoparticles was lower than the limit of 10 mg/kg as defined by EFSA for food contact materials. The results indicated that the incorporation of TiO2or Ag nanoparticles into PLA matrix could maintain cheese quality and prolong its shelf life to 25 days. Practical applications: Yunnan cottage cheese is one of the most popular cheeses in China. However, the shelf life of unpacked Yunnan cottage cheese is only 5–7 days under refrigerated condition.

Modularity is a quality function used to measure the strength of the community structure discovered with social networks. Existing methods detect community structures through modularity analysis. However, the existing modularities are unable to identify community structures correctly when communities are very different in size, in particular, when the size of some communities is very small compared with others. To address this problem, we propose the concept of a coupling coefficient between two communities and define a new modularity, MC modularity, to evaluate the quality of the discovered community structures. This method can provide adequate measures for the quality of community structures. In addition, we develop the DC-MC algorithm to detect community structures based on the concept of MC modularity. An algorithm for shifting a group of nodes, instead of one node at a time, amongst communities also is designed to achieve optimal results. The effectiveness and efficacy of the approach we proposed have been demonstrated through a set of experiments involving real data benchmarks and synthetic data sets that are purpose-built for evaluating different types of networks. © 2014 The British Computer Society.

Then the low frequency coefficients will be fused by Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML) and the fused high frequency coefficient are obtained using CBF, and the high frequency fusion rule is a weighted average method using the weights computed from the detail images that are extracted from the two high frequency coefficient maps. Finally, the inverse NSCT is utilized to get the fused image in which all the objects are clear.

The traditional manual document classification method is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and the classification effect cannot be fully guaranteed. With the popularity of computers and the development of machine learning, the convolutional neural network model is becoming more and more mature, and the CNN model is suitable for the problems encountered in the current official document classification. This paper proposed a model based on convolutional neural network to solve the problem of official document classification. To train and test the model, we manually classify the dataset into ten categories according to the classification of college archives entities. And it was trained on a dataset with size of 6765. And on the testing dataset with size of 676, it reached an accuracy of 90%. And for comparison, we also trained a LSTM model and a GRU model (they are both popular in the natural language processing field), and results showed that the automatic official document classification method based on convolutional neural network can improve the efficiency of traditional official document classification. Also, it provides a new way of thinking for the solution of the official document classification problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","9","Information retrieval systems","Classification (of information) - Convolution - Learning algorithms - Learning systems - Long short-term memory - Natural language processing systems - Problem solving - Statistical tests","CNN models - Convolutional neural network - Document Classification - Labour-intensive - Model-based OPC - NAtural language processing","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"","This work is funded by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2015SE204.

However, the provision of environmental studies and the incorporation of environmental protection and sustainable development into the academic curricula have not been reported. Here, we analyzed the curricula of 267 out of 810 public universities and colleges in China- a sample of 30% from each of the 12 different types (China's universities are categorized 12 types as agriculture, forestry, engineering, comprehensive colleges, education, ethnic study, medicine, economics, law, arts, language and sports). The results showed that 19.47% of the sampled institutions failed to establish a comprehensive environmental education framework; the education is 'greener' in agriculture- and forestry-based institutions, while those focus on sports, art and linguistics are less successful in addressing environmental problems; the institutions funded by the Ministry of Education provide relatively 'greener' education than those funded by local and provincial governments. Moreover, the institutions located in underdeveloped areas are less concerned with environmental education than those in more developed area, as reflected by their academic curricula. The level of environmental education is also significantly higher in the 'Project 985' universities (the top 39 universities in the country) and the 'Project 211' universities (the top 116 universities in the country) than any other universities. The number of textbooks published that address environmental issues showed an increase between year 2005 and 2010, but less significantly in literature, philosophy and education-related textbooks. Our results indicate that environmental education needs to be improved in most of the institutions of higher education in China, and it should be systematically assessed and improved to meet the nation's rising demands in sustainable development, nature and resource conservation. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","41","Sustainable development","Conservation - Curricula - Economics - Environmental protection - Forestry - Planning - Sports - Sports medicine - Textbooks - Timber","Colleges and universities - Environmental education - Environmental problems - Environmental studies - Green curricula - Institutions of higher educations - Ministry of Education - University curricula","454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 901.2 Education - 903.2 Information Dissemination - 912.2 Management - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: 2012T001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012ZX07102-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1133604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 30760049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Dr. Wang Yutao and two anonymous reviewers for their comment.

Especially since 1998, the annual investment in national highway has been over hundred billion yuan, and road construction has reached a new historic level in recent years. The country requests that in 2007 the national main line should be constructed into highway completely. However, because the geological condition in Chinese western area is complex (above 90% of it is mountainous area), highway construction and development face a series of challenges. The comparatively outstanding things among them are: First, the cost of road construction is very high (the highest can reach 50 to 60 million yuan per kilometer), which is 3 to 5 times of the construction inland; Second, it is difficult to build, the proportion of bridges and tunnels is more than 50 percent in some highway construction; Third, more than 90% road construction projects exceed budgetary estimate, some of which exceed it at more than 30%, so it is more difficult to control the investment.

To address the problem, we switch Poisson cloning to bilateral image coarsening (BIC) space that binds similar pixels together in smooth regions and leaves pixels across edges independent to reduce the bleeding artifact. We present three ways to project Poisson cloning into the BIC space. Direct projection projects a result image into BIC space by solving a minimization problem. Gradient projection projects boundary and gradient of a source patch instead of the cloned image, which is more robust and is more consist with the operation of Poisson cloning. Modified gradient projection computes a correction function with deleted gradient of boundary in BIC space, and it improves the computation performance while it can obtain the similar result as gradient projection when the regions near the boundary are smooth. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the bleeding artifact significantly and the sacrifice of performance is quite small.

Based on the data of rice blast occurrences over the years in Fengqing County, Yunnan, China, the G-P algorithm was applied to study their K entropy and inserting space dimension. It was found that their values were all positive. So the rice blast occurrence has some chaos characteristics, and the number of model input layer can be determined. This model was used to make forecasts of rice blast in this county during 2001-2009, and was compared with other forecasting models. The results proved that the accuracy rate and convergence velocity of this model were higher than other forecasting models, and its forecasting results were also effective and believable.

In this paper, we analyzed characteristics, causes and rationality of land use at three poverty alleviation reallocation project area in Xundian which is a typical mountainous poverty county in Yunnan province located at southwest of China, with help of field surveying(random sampling for door to door questionnaire survey), GIS technology (coordinate conversion, geometric Correction, pattern vectorizaton and spatial overlay analysis, etc.) and other technical methods, so as to finding out rationality and constraints of land use and define directions for rational utilization of land resource for those project areas. Results showed that limited by the fragile physical environment and low input, resettlement area increased a large number of new construction land which mainly transferred from cultivated land and the other transferred from forest land and grassland in poor mountainous area. Those new added construction lands mainly located at slope area among 6° to 25°, few construction land even located in the areas above 25°. The results also showed that it was significantly lagged for land reclamation from homestead and reforestation from steep slope cropland at the out-migration area restricted by shortage of necessities, challenges of existing industries, traditional cultural habits and life styles. In addition, reasonability indexes were above 0.50 for the three studied project areas. Shanglongtanqing and Yilangku had reached low-rationality level with 0.642 6 and 0.605 3, respectively, Damoqing had the low-irrationality level with 0.530 9. The common factors which affected land use rationality included slope at the resettlement area (I1), reclamation rate from homestead (I6) and reforestation rate from steep slope cropland (I7) at the out-migration area. The other factors such as resettlement area dispersion (I3) and land-use type transferred into new added construction land at the resettlement area (I9) had some extent influences on land use rationality. Moreover, our results showed that the main impact factors which influenced land use rationality for the whole Xundian county included slope of resettlement area (I1), reclamation rate from homestead at out-migration area (I6), reforestation from steep slope cropland at out-migration area (I7), and land-use type transferred into new added construction land at the resettlement area(I9). It was necessary to implementing the policy strictly, taking full account of both regional land resources and environmental conditions, planning spatial layout for project land properly for the further poverty alleviation reallocation project. Measures should be implemented such as reclamation from homestead and reforestation from steep slope cropland at out-migration area without delay, and improve living environment practical at poor mountain areas. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

A polling-based scheme called the point coordination function (PCF) was developed for 802.11 LANs to support the transmission of multimedia traffic. However, the PCF is not able to meet the desired practical traffic differentiation requirements for real-time data. This paper describes a QoS support polling scheme based on the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol. The scheme uses a two-level polling mechanism with the QoS classes differentiated by two different access policies. Stations with higher priority traffic such as key or real-time data form the first level and can access the common channel through an exhaustive access policy. Other stations with lower priority traffic form the second level and can access the channel through a gated access policy. A system model based on imbedded Markov chain theory and a generation function were setup to explicitly analyze the mean information packet waiting time of the two-level polling scheme. Theoretical and simulation results show that the new scheme efficiently differentiates services to guarantee better QoS and system stability. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.","10","Quality of service","IEEE Standards - Markov processes - Medium access control - Mobile telecommunication systems - System stability - Wireless local area networks (WLAN)","Access policies - Information packets - Markov Chain theory - Medium access control protocols - Multimedia traffic - Point coordination functions - Polling system - Waiting-time","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Over many years, the production of Yunnan Ham has relied on the manual skills of workers. Therefore, the production process is confronted with such problems as inefficiency, extremely high salinity, and instability in quality. Because of the impact of other domestic and foreign ham brands, the market share of Yunnan Ham has been declining every year. Considering this situation, the Yunnan Agricultural University has developed a novel HTRZJ500 ham-kneading machine (hereinafter referred to as HTRZJ500) suited for the production features of Yunnan Ham. The HTRZJ500 operates based on the following principles: while dry-cured pig legs are conveyed on a belt, it is kneaded by a cam gear and pressure-rolling device located below and above the conveyor belt, respectively; the pig leg is kneaded and massaged through a combination of top kneading and roll kneading. Based on the anatomical structure of a Yunnan Ham and the structural dimensions of the kneading device, the pig leg model is divided into 4 kneading sections (i.e., A, B, C and D), and a working position graph for the 7 typical kneading positions used during the process is drawn, from feeding the pig leg onto the kneading area to the complete exiting of the pig leg through the second group of pressure rollers in the kneading area. As shown in the working position graph, there is a phase angle difference of 90° between the adjacent cams. The pig leg is jointly kneaded by 2 groups of cams and 2 groups of pressure rollers throughout the process, from the entry of Section A to the exit of Section D through the second group of cams. The pig leg experiences a wavelike kneading effect under the joint action of top kneading by cams and roll kneading by pressure rollers. Based on the working position graph and design parameters, the pig leg is top-kneaded approximately 36 times by the cams for 12 s. The 2 peak values of kneading force are 609 and 973 N. The Yunnan Agricultural University developed a SolidWorks-based virtual prototype of the ham-kneading device, and employed SolidWorks Motion to simulate the kneading process during which the pig leg passed through 3 groups of pressure rollers. The simulation time was 4 s, and the velocity diagram and acceleration diagram for the pig leg was obtained with the simulated variation curve for the kneading force. The following simulation results were obtained: (1) Both the velocity and acceleration of the pig leg changed in the vertical direction; the acceleration changed uniformly. The continuous up-down vibration of the pig leg helped in fully eliminating the accumulated blood in internal blood vessels, loosed the leg meat and caused rapid penetration and diffusion of salt into the leg meat. (2) The simulated variation curve of kneading force had 2 peak values (677 and 994 N), and the relative errors between simulation and calculated value of the working position graph were 10% and 2.1% respectively, proving the practicality of the kinematics simulation analysis model. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the kneading process of the kneading machine developed for Yunnan Ham through a combination of diagrammatic method and virtual simulation technology. The research methods and ideas are very novel, and the research contents are significant for improving the mechanized production process of Yunnan Ham. The research conclusions provide theoretical and technical guidance for pilot production and structure optimization of the physical prototype of HTRZJ500 in the future study. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In contrast, almost all species of evergreen tree and tall shrub in warm temperate rain forest (WTRF) in Japan and sclerophylls in Mediterranean-climate forest (MSF) of the Mediterranean Basin have two or more cohorts of old leaves in early spring; they drop their oldest cohort during or soon after leaf outgrowth in spring. Japanese WTRF has no dry season and MSF a dry summer. SMSF has a dry winter. On four evergreen Rhododendron species from SW China with only one cohort of old leaves in spring when in cultivation in Scotland, the majority of leaves in the senescing cohort fell by the end of December. We hypothesize that with dry winters, there is an advantage to dropping older leaves in autumn, because there is a low chance of appreciable positive assimilation in winter and a high chance of desiccation, reducing the resorption of dry mass and mineral nutrients from ageing leaves. Our hypothesis may be extended to cover evergreens at high altitude or high latitude that experience cold soils in winter. © 2014 by the authors.","46","Forestry",,"Evergreen species - Leaf longevity - Mediterranean basin - Mediterranean climates - Mineral nutrients - Moist forests - Rhododendron - Yunnan","821.0 Woodlands and Forestry",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Concerns have been raised about the consequences of the development for the ecosystems, livelihoods and food security in the region. The largest planned hydropower dam cascade in the basin, the Lancang-Jiang cascade, is currently under construction and already partly built into the Upper Mekong Basin, China. In this paper we assess the impact of the Lancang-Jiang cascade on downstream hydrology by using a combination of a hydrological model and a reservoir cascade optimization model. The hydrological changes were quantified in detail at the Chiang Saen gauging station in Thailand, the first gauge station downstream from the cascade, and in lesser detail at four other downstream locations in the Mekong mainstream. We found that on average the Lancang-Jiang cascade increased the December-May discharge by 34-155 % and decreased the July-September discharge by 29-36 % at Chiang Saen. Furthermore, the Lancang-Jiang cascade reduced (increased) the range of hydrological variability during the wet season (dry season) months. The dry season hydrological changes were significant also in all downstream gauging stations, even as far as Kratie in Cambodia. Thus the Mekong's hydrological regime has been significantly altered by the Lancang-Jiang cascade, but what the consequences are for ecosystems and livelihoods, needs further study. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","59","Reservoirs (water)","Drought - Dynamic programming - Ecosystems - Food supply - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants","Hydrological impact assessments - Hydrological modelling - Hydropower operation - The Mekong Basin - Yunnan","441.2 Reservoirs - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 822.3 Food Products - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,"Number: 133748, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Academy of Finland; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Aalto-Yliopisto; ","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the Mekong River Commission for providing the discharge data for the study.

For instance, real-time kinematic GPS positioning, as an enabling positioning technology for PA, has already delivered net benefits that meet both food security and sustainability criteria. However, recent investigation reveals that the current PA adoption rate is very low. Even in the developed countries such as in the UK the average PA adoption rate is around 10%. In developing countries such as China, PA has the greatest potential to feed its largest population. This paper starts with a brief overview of the recent GNSS development and is followed by the analysis of the GNSS roles in PA. A trial using Network Real-time Kinematic (NRTK) GNSS positioning for auto-steering a John Deere 8345R tractor was carried out to assess the NRTK performance for PA. To address the pervasive issues of a low GNSS adoption for PA, a low-cost high precision positioning GPS platform that was jointly developed between the University of Nottingham and the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping under ICUK scheme is introduced. The overall performance of this device is assessed and the preliminary results are presented in the paper.

The existing unknown time-varying delay is well resolved by using parameter separation method and signal replacement mechanism in the process of the design, and the lack of a priori knowledge of the control direction is also dealt with by the Nussbaum-gain technique incorporated into the control design. Moreover, both difference and differential updating laws are configured for the estimates of the unknown time-varying parameter and the constant parameter. Then based on a constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii composite energy function, a sufficient condition of the convergence of the system error asymptotically along the iteration axis and the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is given.
