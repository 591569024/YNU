There is a thrust nappe structure in the SE-NW direction shown by tectonic deformation analysis from metamorphic rock to sedimentary layers. Inside the Song Chay dome, the extrusion caused the formation of two metamorphic sedimentary strata (Saxipetrofabric and Nanyangtian petrofabric)which presented as fault blocks in between the igneous rocks (Tuantian+Laochengpo gneissic granite and Nanlao tectonic gneiss). In the outer area of Song Chay dome, the allochthonous sequences (Cambrian strata and Devonian strata) were thrusted onto the autochthonous sequences (Permian strata and Triassic strata). The thrust nappe structure deformation is characterized by klippen, fault block, mylonite zone, inclined fold and mineral shear deformation. It has changed the regional tectonic framework. According to both the age of Zircon U-Pb and previous research results, this extrusion began in the Middle-Late Triassic, and ended in 159 Ma. This extrusion was consistent with the large-scale compression of the NW Pacific and South China plates during the Mesozoic period. This Mesozoic tectonic event provided the space for the following tungsten polymetallic mineralization. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

Near-surface density is an important parameter in these two corrections. Assuming that Bouguer gravity anomalies vary smoothly with surficial topography, we estimate the near-surface density from 1-D free-air gravity anomalies by using the Bayesian method and simultaneously obtain the smooth Bouguer anomalies fitted by the cubic B-spline function. We determine the trade-off parameters between the data misfit and prior constraints automatically by the Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC). Synthetic data tests by using uniform and non-uniform subdivisions verify the effectiveness of the presented method. Relevant parameter evaluations show that more of the spline coefficients are involved in the method, better results will be produced. When the number of spline coefficients are close to the number of observed stations, a more stable estimation can be obtained. More noise in the data, higher weight for smooth constraints will be determined automatically by the ABIC algorithm. The application of this method to two gravity profiles in the Yunnan area shows that near-surface density along the profiles varies significantly (2.45~2.80 g•cm-3). The Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata have relatively high density (mainly 2.53~2.75 g•cm-3), and the Mesozoic strata have relatively low density (2.45~2.73 g•cm-3). The estimated near-surface density in this paper is in a good agreement with regional physical data and surface geological characteristics, and the estimated Bouguer gravity anomalies have good smoothness. The density differences between both sides of the Honghe fault are as large as 0.4 g•cm-3. The near-surface density structure and Bouguer gravity anomalies obtained in this paper provide reliable basic data for the study of deep structure in this area. © 2019, Science Press.

An upward flow of groundwater discharge was observed near the water spring, with the value of some sites over 10 cm day−1, and a downward flow was observed with increasing distance from the water spring in summer. Additionally, a slight upward flow was observed in winter. The arsenic levels, spatial distributions and the conductivity in monitoring sites were closely related to the seepage flux.

The district has the following geological characteristics: (1) high ore grade (Zn + Pb ≥ 25 wt.%); (2) enrichment in Ag and a range of other trace elements (Ge, In, Ga, Cd, and Tl), with galena, sphalerite, and pyrite being the major carriers of Ag, Ge, Cd and Tl; (3) ore distribution controlled by both structural and lithological features; (4) simple and limited wall-rock alteration; (5) mineral zonation within the orebodies; and (6) the presence of evaporite layers in the ore-hosting wall rocks of the Early Carboniferous Baizuo Formation and the underlying basement. Fluid-inclusion and isotope geochemical data indicate that the ore fluid has homogenisation temperatures of 165-220 °C, and salinities of 6.6-12 wt.% NaCl equiv., and that the ore-forming fluids and metals were predominantly derived from the Kunyang Group basement rocks and the evaporite-bearing rocks of the cover strata.

The sown area of maize in 2010 was 1.35 million ha, representing one of the most important crops with the largest cultivation area among all crops in Yunnan Province. Agricultural drought is a complicated process under the combined impact of many natural and human factors, including precipitation, crop growth, soil properties, and irrigation. In this study, a drought loss assessment (DLA) approach integrating remote sensing and a denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model were proposed to estimate maize loss in Yunnan Province in 2010. A fishnet with a grid size of 5 km × 5 km was used to divide the entire province into 15,562 units. Basic data for every unit, including the maize area, fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, temperature, soil properties, and background nitrogen content, were collected for the construction of a database. Remote sensing data were used to monitor crop growth in different periods. Daily maize growth and drought stress in all units were simulated based on metrological and management information using the DNDC model. Scenarios involving full irrigation or no irrigation were used for the comparison of maize yields and assessment of drought loss. The results showed that the proposed framework considering both drought development and crop phenology was an effective approach for the analysis of drought impact on crop yield. In 2010, the maize losses caused by drought were 3.2 million tons. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","33","Remote sensing","Crops - Cultivation - Drought - Irrigation","Agricultural drought - Crop growth model - Denitrification decompositions (DNDC) - Effective approaches - Full irrigations - Management information - Nitrogen content - Remote sensing data",,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

That is because the Sn and Cu hydrothermal mineralizations in this district are associated with granite intrusions, as sources of both hydrothermal fluid and heat. In this paper, a new high-pass filter technique based on a singularity analysis was applied to gravity and aeromagnetic data to delineate local anomalies characterizing granite intrusions. A PCA was applied to stream sediment geochemical data of 39 trace elements and compounds to derive a new integrated geochemical variable representing an element association, indicating the presence of granite intrusions. This new integrated geochemical variable is positively correlated with K2O, Na2O, Al2O3, Zr, Th, U, and Sr and negatively correlated with MgO and Fe2O3. To further characterize the granite intrusions, PCA was applied to integrate the local gravity and aeromagnetic anomalies obtained through singularity analysis and the new integrated geochemical variable obtained through PCA. The results show that the presence of outcropping and buried granitic intrusions is indicated by the principal component with positive loadings on the integrated geochemical variable and gravity data singularity and negative loadings on aeromagnetic data singularity.

By applying the Coexistence Approach to pollen data from this core, a quantitative reconstruction of climate over the last 9,300 years was made based on each pollen zone and individual core sample, which reveals the temperature and precipitation change frequently during that time. The qualitative analyses show that from 9300 to 8700 cal. yr BP, the vegetation was dominated by needle-leaved forest (mainly Pinus and Abies), indicating a slightly cool and moderately humid climate. Between 8700 and 7000 cal. yr BP, evergreen broad-leaved forest, dominated by Quercus, became the predominant vegetation type, replacing needle-leaved forest at this elevation, implying a warmer and more humid climate. During the period 7000 to 4000 cal. yr BP, the vegetation changed to mixed needle-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved forest, indicating a warm and moderately humid climate, but somewhat cooler than the preceding stage. From 4000 to 2400 cal. yr BP, the vegetation was again dominated by evergreen broad-leaved forest, but coniferous trees (mainly Pinus) began to increase, especially relative to a decline in Quercus. This implies that the climate remained warm and humid but slight drier than previously. The evergreen Quercus phase (8700-2400 yr BP) was designated as the Holocene climatic optimum in the Haligu core sediments. It is correlated with a markedly greater abundance and diversity of pteridophytes spores than was recorded before or after this period. From 2400 cal. yr BP to present, the vegetation was dominated by needle-leaved forest, of which Pinus formed the predominant component, accompanied by Abies and Tsuga. This reflects a slightly cooler, humid climate but also correlates with a period of increasing human settlement on the lower slopes of the mountain. At this elevated site, several hundred metres above the highest present day settlements, direct palynological evidence of anthropogenic activity is uncertain but we discuss ways in which the marked decline in Quercus pollen during this period may reflect the impact of ways in which natural resources of the mountain have been utilised. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","76","Climate change","Cooling systems - Forestry - Landforms - Needles - Silicate minerals - Snow - Vegetation","Anthropogenic activity - Changing climate - Coniferous trees - Evergreen broad-leaved forests - Human settlements - Precipitation change - Qualitative analysis - Vegetation type","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Doctoral Scientific Research Starting Foundation of Baoji University of Arts and Science; Number: 30811130219, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NIAB, Sponsor: National Institute of Agricultural Botany; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2004CB070205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2010021032-2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 30990241, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements The authors thank Prof. Nai-Qiu Du from the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences for her help with this study.

Human disturbances and climate change in recent decades have put the ecosystem under stress, making it urgent to study biodiversity and stability of this region. Here, sediment records covering 1820s-2006 were collected from Lake Yangzong and were used to explore the patterns of diversity and stability and their relationship. Changes in lake nutrient, chironomid diversity (species richness), evenness (Invsimpson), similarity (Jaccard) and stability (ar1) were reconstructed based on nutrient indicators (total organic carbon (TOC) content, total nitrogen (TN) content and TOC/TN) and chironomid assemblages. Principal components analysis of chironomid community data was used for critical point detection. We found that TOC and TN contents increased, and abrupt changes in the chironomid community occurred since 1990. Meanwhile, community diversity, evenness and similarity all showed a rising trend. Clear increases in diversity from the 1950s, evenness from the early 1990s, and similarity and instability from 1970s indicate higher diversity and evenness of chironomid communities, corresponding well with the rising in TOC content. The increasing in TOC/TN ratio had a positive correlation with species richness, evenness and similarity, respectively, however, a negative correlation was obtained with stability. The significant negative correlation between chironomid species richness and stability in Lake Yangzong suggested that the species richness depleted its stability. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","47","Stability","Biodiversity - Climate change - Convergence of numerical methods - Ecosystems - Lakes - Nutrients - Organic carbon - Principal component analysis","Chironomid - Community diversity - Critical point - Diversity - Negative correlation - Positive correlations - Principal components analysis - Total Organic Carbon","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Quantitative analysis of these non-mineral inorganics is therefore helpful to better understand their behavior during coal utilization. Lignite samples collected from the Mile Basin in southeast Yunnan Province, China, were studied to provide further insights into the modes of occurrence of the NMIE Al, Mg, Ca, and Fe. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations were performed using a multiple analytical approach, including a three-step sequential leaching process, oxygen plasma low-temperature ashing, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (FE-SEM), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Mile lignites have an elevated content of authigenic gypsum, which was deposited from dissolved SO42−and organic-bound or dissolved Ca. A large proportion of the Ca, Mg, and Fe in the Mile lignite occurs as dissolved salts, ionic species attached to carboxylates, and metallic species held in organometallic complexes, which were completely leached by water, ammonium acetate, and NH4-EDTA, respectively. In contrast, only a low proportion of Al in the lignite occurs in non-mineral inorganic form. Non-mineral Fe, Al, and Ca largely occur as organometallic complexes; only a small proportion of Ca occurs in a water-soluble form or in extractable carboxylates if present. Magnesium, however, occurs in various non-mineral inorganic forms, and could be leached not only by NH4-EDTA but also by water and ammonium acetate solutions. Iron is effectively leached only by NH4-EDTA and the leaching does not appear to affect the occurrence of pyrite in the coals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","52","Coal combustion","Carboxylation - Dealloying - Dissolution - Enamels - Field emission microscopes - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Leaching - Lignite - Organometallics - Pyrites - Scanning electron microscopy - Temperature - X ray powder diffraction - X rays","Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (ICPMS) - Inorganic elements - Low rank coals - Low temperature ashing - Modes of element occurrence - Organo-metallic complexes","524 Solid Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 932.1 High Energy Physics",,"Number: B17042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41420104001 ), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902 ), the 111 Project (No. B17042), and the Yue Qi Distinguished Scholar Project.

The study of shale brittleness evaluation can provide basic data for fracturing design. The mineral composition characteristics of shale gas reservoir in the early Cambrian Qiongzhusi formation of Huize area, Eastern Yunnan Province are reported in this paper, and the brittleness is evaluated according to the proportion of brittle minerals in total minerals. The results show that the mineral composition of the reservoir is complex. After comparing the brittleness index calculated by different formulas, it is considered that the minerals with high young's modulus and low poisson's ratio should be considered as brittle minerals, which is conducive to the universality of the brittleness index formula and the objectivity of reservoir brittleness evaluation. Shale gas reservoir of Qiongzhusi formation is obviously divided into two sections: the layers of 1 to 7 with a large brittleness index (77.60% on average) on the lower part are beneficial to reservoir fracturing reconstruction, while the layers of 8 to 14 with a small brittleness index (37.78% on average) on the upper part are not conducive to reservoir fracturing reconstruction.

Especially, aftershocks distribute in a reverse L-shape on conjugated faults (i.e., the NNW-SSE fault and the ENE-WSW fault), making it difficult to determine the causative fault and rupture process. For better understanding the seismogenic structure of the Ludian earthquake, we invert local seismic (strong-motion and broadband data) as well as teleseismic data to investigate the rupture kinematics. Three cases of fault ruptures were tested. (1) Ruptures occur only on the NNW-SSE fault. (2) Ruptures occur only on the ENE-WSW fault. (3) Ruptures can propagate freely on the conjugated faults. A linear technique was used in these inversions. We have two steps in this work. First, local seismic data were inverted for rupture process to identify the rupture faults. Second, with the determined rupture faults, the rupture model was renewed by jointly inverting local seismic and teleseismic waves. Local seismic data inversions show that data fitting of the NNW-SSE fault is better than that of the ENE-WSW fault, suggesting the NNW-SSE fault is the major rupture fault of the Ludian earthquake. Meanwhile, the best data fitting was found in inversion of conjugated faults, in which data fitting per seismic moment of the ENE-WSW fault was even slightly better than that of the NNW-SSE fault, indicating that both conjugated faults may have ruptured during the earthquake. From the joint inversion of local and teleseismic data, rupture initiated on the ENE-WSW fault in the first two seconds, and after 2 s, the NNW-SSE fault began to rupture. The source duration is about 17 s, but most seismic moments were released in the first 10 s after the rupture initiation. On the conjugated faults, ruptures propagated toward up-dip directions and mainly occurred in very shallow depth, which may account for the terrible earthquake damages. However, rupture extent of the NNW-SSE fault is much larger than that of the ENE-WSW fault. As a result, rupture area on the NNW-SSE fault is comparable with aftershocks along that direction, but on the ENE-WSW fault, the dimension of rupture area is much smaller than that of aftershock distribution. The above inversion results show that the Ludian earthquake is a complex conjugated ruptured earthquake. Ruptures firstly initiated on the ENE-WSW fault, and then triggered the NNW-SSE fault. Consecutive ruptures on conjugated faults constitute the complex rupture process of the earthquake.

Here we use the Maozu (∼20 Mt of sulfide ore, grading 7.25 wt% Zn and 4.15 wt% Pb) Zn-Pb deposit in the Upper Yangtze Zn-Pb metallogenic province as a case study, utilizing NanoSIMS in situ S, femtosecond LA-MC-ICPMS in situ Pb and conventional bulk Sr isotopes, as well as field data, aimed to reveal its origin and ore formation process. NanoSIMS in situ δ34S values of sulfide minerals from the Maozu deposit have a wider range (+5.9–+20.7‰) than that of bulk δ34S values (+9.9–+19.9‰). Such S isotope signatures reflect the enrichment of heavy S isotopes in ore-forming fluids, and further indicate the source of S is multiple reservoirs (e.g. marine evaporites, coeval seawater, and metamorphic rocks/fluids). Pb isotopic ratios of galena determined by LA-MC-ICPMS in situ techniques have a narrower range (206Pb/204Pb = 18.20–18.21, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.69–15.71 and 208Pb/204Pb = 38.40–38.43) than that of bulk Pb isotopic ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 18.13–18.38, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.64–15.69 and 208Pb/204Pb = 38.22–38.58). This implies that in situ Pb isotopes can truly reflect the source of Pb, which is due to impurities enclosed by sulfide crystals and pollutants introduced by chemical analysis could significantly affect the quality of the bulk Pb isotopic data. Compared with previously reported Pb isotopic data of potential source rocks (i.e. late Permian Emeishan basalts, Paleozoic ore-bearing sedimentary rocks and Proterozoic basement metamorphic rocks), the in situ Pb isotopic data are significantly different from those of basalts, but are similar to those of both basements and sediments. This means that metal-rich fluids were mainly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments. Sphalerite separates have initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.711–0.719) that are distinctly different from those of ore formation age-corrected basalts (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.704–0.708) and basements (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.724–0.729), whereas partly overlap with those of age-corrected sediments (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.707–0.714). Such Sr isotope signatures suggest that hydrothermal fluids were predominantly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments with a certain influence from basalts. Hence, the Maozu deposit has complex source rocks that are related to the local geological setting. The mixing of metal-rich fluids (related to basements and sediments, and even basalts) and S-bearing fluids (associated with multiple S reservoirs) plays a key role in the formation of sulfide ores. Therefore, the Maozu deposit, formed during Early Mesozoic (∼196 Ma), is an epigenetic Zn-Pb deposit that hosts in carbonate rocks, occurs along fault-fold structures, and has a mixed source of mineralizing elements and associated fluids. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","112","Strontium","Basalt - Binary alloys - Buildings - Crystal impurities - Deposits - Geochronology - Grading - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Isotopes - Lead zinc deposits - Metamorphic rocks - Ore analysis - Ores - Quality control - Sedimentary rocks - Sediments - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","MC-ICP-MS - Ore formation process - S isotopes - South China - Sr isotopes","402 Buildings and Towers - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice",,"Number: 2017YFC0602502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41763003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB440905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41430315, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China ( 2017YFC0602502 ), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41430315 ), the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2014CB440905 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41763003 ).

In the upper parts of the ore bodies, the element association of principal factors is similar, which indicates that the ore bodies formed by the same ore-forming fluids. In the lower part of No.I ore body, the element association of principal factors associated with galena separated from element association associated with sphalerite, which may reflect the change of the ore-forming fluids or superposition of multi-stage ore-forming fluids. R-type factor analyses of tectonites in different level show that barite and lead-zinc mineralization are closely related, and this indicated that the barite is one of important prospecting indicator, which is consistent with field observation. The distribution of tectonic geochemical anomalies can reflect the migration direction of the ore-forming fluid, and provide evidence for ore-finding prediction.

Thermal potential production (TPP) refers to the highest yield of ideal crop colony in the condition of local sunlight and temperature assuming that the agricultural production condition has been fully guaranteed in adequate supply of water, CO2and suitable states of other environmental factors, while climatic potential production (CPP) refers to the theoretical yield of crops taking precipitation effect into further consideration based on TPP. The 'Regulation for Gradation on Agriculture Land Quality' GB/T 28407-2012 (Regulation) provides the crops' TPP and CPP nationwide according to the reports of sowing/harvest date from all provinces, and the meteorological data of 2231 stations from the National Meteorological Administration within 30 years (1961-1990). Each county just provides one set of TPP and CPP data for appointment crop according to the meteorological data from only one station in the county, and the PP value of crop only represents the local conditions. Yunnan Province is the most prominent and representative region of stereo climate in China. There are 1669 dams with the area of larger than 1 km2across Yunnan Province, totally covering the area of 245.35 hm2. Each county has many combined configurations of 'dam-hill-mountain' with larger differences in TPP and CPP. In the first-round grading work on agricultural land quality in Yunnan Province, most of the counties use the TPP and CPP from meteorological stations representing the value of TPP and CPP of the whole county to calculate the agricultural land quality grade index, which must be very different from the actual situations. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to make altitude correction of TPP and CPP in order to ensure the objectivity and veracity of classification results in Yunnan Province. This paper is aimed to obtain the PP value of appointment crops outside the regions with meteorological stations by making altitude correction on TPP and CPP of appointment crops from county meteorological stations in plateau basin regions of Yunnan according to the 'Regulation', and to investigate its influence on agricultural land physical quality grade. This paper made an altitude correction model on the TPP and CPP of one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat according to the TPP and CPP data of appointment crops from 56 county meteorological stations in plateau basin regions where Luliang County locates. Then a paddy land and a dry land of high quality were respectively chosen in each village to verify the rationality of the model according to per unit area yield of actual crops in paddy land and dry land. The differences of agricultural land physical quality grade before and after altitude correction of TPP and CPP in Luliang County were testified. The results showed that the actual crop yield per unit area for one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat was all less than the value of TPP and CPP before and after altitude correction, and had the same change tendency of the TPP and CPP after altitude correction with the altitude change, and the TPP and CPP after altitude correction of one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat much more conformed to actual situations than that before. The reduction range of agricultural land physical quality grade after altitude correction was between [-0.8,1.7], 99.76% of which was within 1.5 in Luliang. There is only one meteorological station in each county actually, and most are located in dams, while just few in mountains. The PP could not be calculated based on the meteorological data because lacking the meteorological stations for regions around. Most counties obtained the crops' PP value by using altitude correction in the regions outside meteorological stations in Yunnan. The TPP and CPP after altitude correction were chosen to evaluate the agricultural land physical quality grade if the altitude of the majority of agricultural land in the county was higher than that of the meteorological station, which was a little lower than that before. The regulation model of crop PP changing with altitude is the key to altitude correction, which is directly influenced by choosing standard spot. It is different to build up an altitude correction model for whole province conforming to the actual situation by taking the crops' PP of county meteorological stations as standard spot for certain appointment crops, because the meteorological stations have limited amount and uneven distribution in Yunnan Province. The further research direction is to build up altitude correction model and program in partitions, and to perform the connections in partitions. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

To achieve this, the hydrochemistry, travertine precipitation rates, and variations in Ca isotopic compositions (δ44/40Ca) of present-day endogenic (thermogenic) travertine in two different hydrodynamic systems (canal and pool) are studied at Baishuitai (Yunnan, SW China). In the canal, where the travertine precipitation is faster, δ44/40Ca values of both solution and travertine show a downstream increase, with Ca isotopic fractionation (δ44/40CaCaCO3-aq) equal to ~-1.6‰. Compared to the canal, Ca isotopic fractionation between travertine and aqueous Ca2+is smaller (δ44/40CaCaCO3-aq≈ -1.2‰) in the pools where travertine precipitation rates are lower. The spatial variations in δ44/40Ca values of solution and travertine are related to the amount of Ca removed from the solution when δ44/40Ca values of spring water remain stable. In addition, the results confirm the control of precipitation rates on Ca isotopic fractionation between calcite and parent aqueous Ca2+using natural samples. The observed negative correlation between δ44/40CaCaCO3-aqand travertine precipitation rates can be explained by the steady-state kinetic surface reaction model proposed by DePaolo (2011), with equilibrium and kinetic fractionation factors of αeq= 1.0000 ± 0.0001 and αf= 0.9983 ± 0.0002, respectively. An important consequence of this study is that Ca isotopes in travertine systems are good tools to have access to variations of δ44/40Caaq, which are directly linked to the amount of precipitated Ca. This could then be useful for reconstructing past hydrodynamic conditions when applied to travertine core data. © 2016 .","54","Limestone","Calcite - Calcium - Groundwater - Hydraulic structures - Hydrodynamics - Isotopes - Kinetics - Reaction rates - Surface reactions","Hydrodynamic conditions - Isotopic composition - Isotopic fractionations - Kinetic fractionations - Precipitation rates - Steady-state kinetics - Surface reaction models - Travertine","444.2 Groundwater - 482.2 Minerals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity",,"Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 2013CB956703, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1301231, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41430753, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172232, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41372263, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41172232 , 41372263, 41430753 , and U1301231 ) and the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2013CB956703 ).

It is suggested that aerial algae play an active role in bioerosive processes that may affect the formation of karst erosional forms. These effects include both direct and indirect ones. The direct effect is the initiative control ('algal shape-controlling role') of algae on the formation of karst forms of various scales, mostly micro-scale (-3 m) and minor-scale (10-3-10-1m) erosional forms. The algal shape-controlling roles can be divided into the algal individual shape-controlling role and the algal community shape-controlling role. The former mostly controls the formation of micro-scale erosional forms, while the latter mostly controls the formation of micro-scale and smaller minor-scale erosional forms. The indirect effect refers to the 'promoting role' of algae in the formation of karst forms, which may affect the formation of karst forms of all types and scales. The bioerosion of algae accelerates the weathering process of the whole Stone Forest karst landforms.

The minerals in the coal were identified using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM–EDS), and low temperature ashing plus X-ray diffraction (LTA + XRD). The results show that quartz and kaolinite are the major components of the coal mineral matter; followed by pyrite, marcasite, anatase, and calcite; and in some cases, mixed-layer illite/smectite, chamosite, illite, ankerite, apatite, and anorthite. The highly-elevated concentration of quartz in the coal is mostly derived from siliceous solutions produced by weathering of the Emeishan basalt. However, quartz discrete particles with large size (>100 μm) and rounded shape probably resulted from the input of felsic rock materials. The distribution and modes of occurrence of kaolinite, mixed-layer illite/smectite, illite, and anatase reflect a terrigenous origin. In comparison with the coals from eastern Yunnan, the Yueliangtian coals have lower proportion of authigenic chamosite, the formation of which was probably related to the injection of seawater. Pyrite occurring as individual particles or clustered framboids was most likely influenced by seawater during the stages of peat accumulation or early diagenesis, while fracture-filling pyrite probably had an epigenetic origin. Additionally, an intra-seam volcanic ash-derived tonstein layer, which contains sharp-edged quartz, vermicular kaolinite, and well-developed zircon crystals, has been identified in the coal of the present study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","81","Coal","Basalt - Calcite - Chlorite minerals - Coal deposits - Feldspar - Kaolinite - Phosphate minerals - Pyrites - Quartz - Scanning electron microscopy - Seawater - Silicate minerals - Spectrometers - Sulfide minerals - Temperature - Titanium dioxide - Volcanoes - Weathering - X ray diffraction - X ray spectrometers - Zircon","Elevated concentrations - Emeishan basalts - Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometers - Guizhou Province - Late permian coal - Mineralogical compositions - Minerals in coals - Mixed-layer illite/smectite","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 484 Seismology - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 524 Solid Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 20120023120019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41272182, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41420104001 and 41272182), and the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No. 20120023120019).

The variation of trace elements in coal samples of different size and density were investigated. The results showed that the vertical variation of As and Hg through the seam section is the result of hydrothermal activity. Arsenic and Hg are highly concentrated in coal layers far from the parting, roof and floor in vertical section. For example, the highest concentrations of As (44.3 μg/g) and Hg (2.8 μg/g) occur in ply 6, which is 40-cm vertically away from partings. Elements As, Hg, Co, Ni, Se, Sb and Tl occur mainly in pyrite; Be, F, Cs, Th and U are evenly distributed in clay minerals and organic components; V and Cr mainly occur in the organic portions of the coal. The As and Hg content generally increases with greater particle size and density, with content in the light fractions as low as 1.1 and 0.14 μg/g, respectively, and as high as 75.8 and 3.8 μg/g, respectively, in heavy fractions. Co, Ni, Se, Sb and Tl exhibit similar density dependence. Vanadium and Cr are more concentrated in lower-density fractions. The genetic type and mode of occurrence of elements in coal both exert a great impact on their removability; epigenetic and coarse minerals may be readily liberated by gravity separation. Elements associated with pyrite (e.g., As, Hg, Co, Ni, Cu, Se, Sb and Tl) demonstrate high removability; F, Th, U, V and Cr, which mainly occur in clay minerals and/or organic components of the coal, show a relatively low removability.

But the quality of the unused land is generally relatively poor in many provinces. Because of the poor quality and complexity of explotation for the unused land, the difficulty of exploitation is often relatively large. This is especially true in the mountainous areas of Yunnan province, where there is an undulating terrain, and severe cutting or tearing action. Therefore, geoscience factors show significant spatial differentiation in the province. As a result, exploitation of unused land in Yunnan province is different from others. In order to guide a better space-time configuration of the exploitation for arable unused land in the province, exploitation suitability evaluation and potential area partition for the arable unused land is researched in this paper which focuses in a typical mountainous area county of Yunnan province which is named Midu for example. Based on combining spatial analysis techniques of the Geographical Information System (GIS), the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Delphi method, this study constructed the suitability evaluation for exploitation of the arable unused land model, the new land indices and additional land potential model, and the evaluation of the partition for potential area of the arable unused land model respectively. Then it was analyzed the exploitation suitability and partition of the potential area of the arable unused land in the mountain area of Yunnan province. The results show that the exploitation suitability of the unused land includes four grades which are the most suitability area, the medium suitability area, the barely suitability area, and the unfit area. The area of them is 71.21 hectares, 1177.39 hectares, 1681.00 hectares, and 62.00 hectares respectively, and accounts for 2.38%, 39.36%, 56.19% and 2.07% of the total area of the study area separately. The actual exploitation potential of the unused land in study area is 1248.60 hectares, and among them there are 977.45 hectares excepted to develop into cultivated land. The result of the partition is indicated so that the study area could be divided in five potential areas and one non-potential area. Among these areas, the actual exploitation potential from one-level to five-level are 164.97 hectares, 53.38 hectares, 210.64 hectares, 773.93 hectares, and 45.68 hectares respectively. The potential of additional cultivated land are 144.21 hectares, 46.66 hectares, 164.01 hectares, 590.11 hectares, and 32.46 hectares respectively. The application of the research results show that the suitability evaluation results, cultivated land estimation results, and potential partition results are consistent with the local circumstances.","28","Agriculture","Land use - Models - Zoning","Analytical Hierarchy Process - Estimation results - Exploitation potentials - Midu county - Research results - Spatial analysis - Spatial differentiation - Suitability evaluation","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Moreover, ground failure caused by debris flow needs a long time to be recovered. The hazards of debris flow can be prevented or released by some engineering countermeasures such as erosion control. The check dam is one of the most effective structures to control the debris flow in the original area. Based on the examination of architectonic geology, engineering geology, rock mechanics and remote sensing geology, two major tributary gullies (one with check dams but the other without) of Jiangjia Gully in Yunnan Province, are compared in three aspects (channel longitudinal gradient, stability of lateral slopes and trailing edge of channel, soil erosion by debris flow) to prove that check dam or check dam series can: (1) effectively uplift the basic level of erosion of debris-flow channel; (2) reduce the longitudinal gradient of the debris-flow channel, and accordingly velocity slowed down and energy dissipated; (3) fix the channel and stabilize the slope so as to facilitate or restore the growth of the vegetation. In addition, several problems, needed to be taken into account during the design of check dam, are also discussed.","12","Soil mechanics","Accident prevention - Dams - Disasters - Rock mechanics - Soil conservation - Watersheds","Channel erosion - Check dam - Debris flow countermeasure - Mud-rock flow","441.1 Dams - 444.1 Surface Water - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention","Applications (APP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The Yao'an monzonite and quartz monzonite porphyry intrusions are alkaline and potassic with high K2O/ Na2O ratios (1.1-1.5). They have Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes similar to coeval lamprophyres and are characterized by uniform zircon ΕHf (-6.4 to -8.7) and δ18O values (6.6-7.0‰). They are interpreted as products of fractional crystallization of lamprophyre-like potassic mafic magma derived from ancient metasomatized lithospheric mantle, a scenario similar to the mid-Cretaceous postcollisonal Scheelite Dome gold system in Yukon, Canada. The Machangqing granitic intrusions are high K calc-alkaline and show high Sr, Sr/Y, and La/Yb, but low Y and Yb geochemical signatures. They have Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions similar to amphibolite xenoliths hosted by potassic felsic intrusions in western Yunnan. The zircon ΕHf values of the Machangqing granitic intrusions are positive (0.3-4.7), and the zircon-depleted Hf mantle model ages are 1.1 to 0.8 Ga. They also have mantle-like zircon δ18O values (5.5-6.4‰). The Machangqing granites were most likely derived from partial melting of Neoproterozoic lower crust. The Beiya granitic intrusions are alkaline, with high K2O/Na2O (1.9-2.7), Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, high Sr contents, and low Y and Yb contents. They contain abundant zircon inheritance and have variable magmatic zircon ΕHf (-4 to +4) and the highest magmatic zircon δ18O values (6.6-7.8‰). The Beiya felsic intrusions are interpreted to be derived from partial melting of a K-rich mafic source mixed with a metasedimentary component. The Eocene-Oligocene intracontinental potassic intrusions and associated mineralization in western Yunnan are located proximal to the Mesozoic Jinsha suture, suggesting that this Mesozoic lithospheric boundary may have provided a first-order control on localization of Cenozoic mineral systems. These potassic felsic intrusions are coeval with regional potassic mafic magmatism in western Yunnan and were emplaced between 37 to 33 Ma, after the collision between India and Asia at ca. 60 to 55 Ma. It is therefore postulated that continental collision may have preferentially thickened the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) adjacent to the Jinsha suture, in which overthickened lower continental lithospheric mantle was subsequently removed during 37 to 33 Ma, inducing melting of residual metasomatized lithospheric mantle as well as lower crust. The gold-rich Yao'an and Beiya intrusions are alkaline and potassic, characterized by high zircon δ18O values (>6.5‰), which is consistent with supracrustal contributions.

Homonoia riparia (H. riparia) Lour, a species native to Yunnan Province, China, is a medicinal plant with high ecological and economic value. Its population has declined significantly, and the species has become locally endangered in recent decades. Understanding the habitat requirements of this species, evaluating habitat quality, and predicting its potential habitat are significant for protecting H. riparia Lour. One positional variable, three topographic variables and eight bioclimatic variables were used to model its distribution and potential habitat. The eight main bioclimatic variables influencing species distribution were selected from 19 bioclimatic variables based on correlation analysis and principal component analysis. An MAXENT model, because of the advantages of using presence-only data and performing well with incomplete data, small sample sizes and gaps, was employed to simulate the habitat suitability distribution. The results show that seven variables, namely, annual mean temperature, altitude, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of coldest quarter, the distance to the nearest river, temperature seasonality, and precipitation during the driest month, are significant factors determining H. riparia Lour's suitable habitat. Habitat suitability for three historical periods and two future climate warming scenarios were calculated.

However, the application of YNBY is limited by the toxicity of CW. Notably, CW is not used alone in YNBY, but is combined with other herbs in a formula for clinical use. In the present study, the compatibility of the protective effects and mechanism of YNBY with the potential toxicity of CW was investigated. After combining with other compatible herbs, the serum metabolic disorder induced by CW can be regulated. Using UPLC-MS-based metabolomics, 63 endogenous serum metabolites were identified as being associated with the potential toxicity of CW, 17 of which were regulated to normal levels when CW was combined with other compatible herbs in YNBY. These regulated metabolites were closely related to glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis metabolic pathways. This study aims to evaluate the attenuation mechanism of CW compatibility with YNBY. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","46","Metabolism","Amino acids - Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Body fluids - Medicine - Metabolites - Physiology - Toxicity","Clinical use - Glycerophospholipids - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors - Metabolic disorders - Metabolic pathways - Primary bile acids - Protective effects - Traditional Chinese Medicine","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Our results show that the granitic gneisses, which were taken from the previously-mapped Pake Formation of the Ximeng Group, are high-K calc-alkaline, strongly peraluminous S-type granites. Zircon separates from two representative samples (11ML-73 and 11ML-74) yield the U-Pb weighted mean ages of 461.4±2.5 Ma and 461.5±3.3 Ma, respectively, which are interpreted as their crystallization ages. Their corresponding ΕHf(t) values range from -6.45 to -1.90 for 11ML-73 and -5.60 to -1.44 for 11ML-74 with mean values of -4.73±0.36 and -4.46±0.57, respectively. The two-stage Hf model ages range from 1.57 Ga to 1.86 Ga and 1.54 Ga to 1.90 Ga, respectively. These data indicate that the granitic gneisses in the Pake Formation of the Ximeng Group are of Ordovician origin rather than previously-mapped Mesoproterozoic period. They might have been derived from ancient metasedimentary rocks. These data, together with other observations, suggest that the Ximeng granitic gneisses were the elements of the Paleozoic igneous belt of the Andean-type orogen along the northern margin of Gondwana. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Comparative analyses between the theoretical calculation and measurements of the AN demonstrate that a concussion trend under operation conditions of the half-voltage positive pole and full-voltage, half-voltage, and full-voltage negative pole can be obtained. AN error between the theoretical calculation and measurement from full-voltage of bipolar for different months reaches its minimum in comparison to that of half-voltage positive pole and full-voltage, half-voltage negative pole and full-voltage negative pole. Furthermore, the AN distribution according to measurement locations perpendicular to YG UHVDC transmission lines shows an attenuation trend from a peak value to both ends, a smaller measurement value is obtained at the location with an altitude of 700 m due to the influence of the surrounding plants.

Natural deformation behaviors of feldspars are not well understood due to the complexity of their mineral compositions, crystal structures, as well as changing deformation conditions. The refined microstructure, fabric and composition of major minerals in the deformed granitic rocks within the Gaoligong shear zone (GLGSZ), southwestern Yunnan, China, were studied. With increasing mylonitization, two fabric types of end-members have been distinguished (type-I banded granitic mylonite and type-II banded ultramylonite). The two types of deformed granitic rocks have the same mineral assemblage, but different mineral modes. The type-I banded granitic mylonite has a greater proportion of K-feldspar (mostly present as porphyroclasts)>plagioclase>quartz±biotite, however, the type-II banded ultramylonite has a greater proportion of fine-grained plagioclase>K-feldspar>quartz±biotite. The crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) patterns of quartz combined with two-feldspar geothermometer, confirm that the quartz grains in the type-I and type-II granitic rock have undergone high-temperature dislocation creep deformation. The K-feldspar grains in the matrix of type-II banded ultramylonite show a dominant (100) [010] slip system with dislocation creep recrystallization, while the fine-grained plagioclase grains present a weak CPO pattern with superplastic flow. The K-feldspar porphyroclasts show grain-size reduction associated with mineral composition and fabric transformation. The myrmekite formation with the fine-grained neocrystallization of plagioclase and quartz significally replaced the K-feldspar porphyroclasts.

Known for enriched small shelly fossils, it is a prominent section for investigating the Early Cambrian phosphogenic event. Paava et al. (Econ Geol 105:1047–1056, 2010) reported anomalously high PGE concentrations in this section, up to 576 × 10−9(434 × 10−9Pt, 142 × 10−9Pd) for the total PGE concentrations of a K-bentonite sampled from the bottom of Bed 5. This finding can illustrate two significant statements: (1) in addition to the attested polymetallic Ni-Mo-PGE ore layer, another potential PGE enrichment layer exists with PGE concentrations up to the mineralization level; and (2) acid volcanics have high PGE contents overturning conventional views. To inspect whether the anomalous PGE concentration is pervasive, we investigated Bed 5 of the Meishucun section systematically, and sampled from a profile with a thickness of 3.5 m. The major and trace element geochemistry indicate the Bed 5 K-bentonite is derived from acid volcanic ash. PGE concentrations were determined repeatedly by isotope dilution-ICP-MS using improved digestion technique (Qi et al., in J Anal At Spectrom 26:1900–1904, 2011), and were duplicated by fire assay method. The results showed that each sample had total PGE concentrations of less than 0.90 × 10−9, and Pt + Pd concentrations of no higher than 0.70 × 10−9. Combined with the petrological and mineralogical features, and trace and rare earth element analyses, it is inferred that no generality of PGE enrichment exists in Bed 5 and that the anomalous PGE concentration is likely due to the nugget effect of volcanic ash modified by currents in a shallow coastal environment. © 2015, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","57","Stratigraphy","Bentonite - Exploratory geochemistry - Ores - Rare earths - Trace elements - Volcanoes","Coastal environments - Lower cambrians - Major and trace elements - Mineralogical features - Phosphogenic event - Platinum group elements (PGEs) - Stratigraphic correlation - The Meishucun section","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Properties of solvents used in preheating stage could greatly affect structure of coal and conversion of its oxygen-containing functional groups. In this work, the preheating process of one Chinese Yunnan lignite (YN lignite) was conducted in tetralin (THN) and 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN) to figure out the interactions between YN lignite and nonpolar aromatic solvents. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformation (DRIFT) technique coupled with curve-fitting analysis and ion-exchange titration analysis and solid-state 13C NMR were used to investigate the structural changes of YN lignite when preheated in different solvents at different temperatures. Additionally, swelling ratio determination and density function theory (DFT) calculation were employed to evaluate the strength of interactions existing between YN lignite and THN or 1-MN. The results show that, the decrease of oxygen-containing functional groups and increase of aromaticity occur when YN lignite are preheated in THN and 1-MN, and these changes are intensified with temperature rising. Moreover, THN and 1-MN have different effects on variation of YN lignite, especially for phenolic hydroxyl groups, which are more likely to be decomposed in THN, while carboxyl groups break down more easily in 1-MN at 200–300 °C. DFT calculation and swelling ratio results show that stronger noncovalent interactions (OH–π hydrogen bonds in particular) between THN and YN lignite result in weaker O–H bond in phenolic hydroxyl groups and subsequently decomposition of more phenolic hydroxyl groups compared to 1-MN. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","49","Coal liquefaction","Curve fitting - Density functional theory - Fourier transforms - Hydrogen bonds - Indium compounds - Ion exchange - Ions - Lignite - Lignite liquefaction - Oxygen - Preheating - Probability density function - Solvents - Temperature","Density function theory calculations - Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transformations - Direct coal liquefactions - Effects of temperature - Low rank coals - Non-covalent interaction - Oxygen-containing functional groups - Phenolic hydroxyl group","524 Solid Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 642.1 Process Heating - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory",,"Number: U1703252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Province; Number: 21576274, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by joint foundation of Natural Science Foundation of China and Xinjiang Province ( U1703252 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21576274 ).

It has experienced multi-stage metamorphism and deformation, especially since the late Oligocene it widely suffered high-temperature ductile shear deformation and exhumation of the metamorphic rocks from the deep crust to the shallow surface. Based on the previous research and geological field work, this paper presents a detailed study on deformation and metamorphism, and exhumation of deep metamorphic rocks within the Diancangshan metamorphic massif, especially focusing on the low-temperature overprinted retrogression metamorphism and deformation of mylonitic rocks. With the combinated experimental techniques of optical microscope, electron backscatter diffraction attachmented on field-emission scanning electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence, our contribution reports the microstructure, lattice preferred orientations of the deformed minerals, and the changes of mineral composition phases of the superposition low-temperature retrograde mylonites. All these results indicate that: (1) Diancangshan deep metamorphic rock has experienced early high-temperature left-lateral shear deformation and late extension with rapid exhumation, the low-temperature retrogression metamorphism and deformation overprinted the high-temperature metamorphism, and the high-temperature microstructure and texture are in part or entirely altered by subsequent low-temperature shearing; (2) the superposition of low-temperature deformation-metamorphism occurs at the ductile-brittle transition; and (3) the fluid is quite active during the syn-tectonic shearing overprinted low-temperature deformation and metamorphism. The dynamic recrystallization and/or fractures to micro-fractures result in the strongly fine-grained of the main minerals, and present strain localization in micro-domians, such as micro-shear zones in the mylonites. It is often accompanied by the decrease of rock strength and finally influences the rheology of the whole rock during further deformation and exhumation of the Diancangshan massif. © 2018, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","57","Metamorphic rocks","Dynamic recrystallization - Fault slips - Field emission microscopes - Fluids - Fracture - Microstructure - Minerals - Optical lattices - Scanning electron microscopy - Shear deformation - Shearing - Shearing machines - Strike-slip faults - Temperature","Brittle ductile transitions - Electron back scatter diffraction - Exhumation - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Lattice preferred orientation - Low temperature deformations - Mylonites - Rheological weakening",,,"Number: 2017YFC0602401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41722207, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 41472188, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements We would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments, which have greatly improved the quality of this paper.

Yunnan-Guangdong UHVDC islanded system also has ultra-low-frequency oscillation (ULFO) phenomenon because of the inconsistent control features between UHVDC and frequency regulation of generators. The ULFO analysis model is put forward based on the complete coherence characteristics of all generator rotors. There exists a frequency band of negative damping in the hydraulic turbine control system by frequency domain analysis. The larger value of turbine time constant, the more serious negative damping exists in the frequency control system. And if the forward gain of governor becomes larger, the negative damping will be more remarkable. An effective frequency control strategy for UHVDC islanded system frequency control is proposed by withdrawing a part of primary frequency control functions of generators or coordinating the dead zone values of governors and UHVDC frequency limitation controller (FLC). By the proposed strategy, islanded system frequency is mainly controlled by UHVDC FLC, which can successfully suppress the ULFO problem. Verification simulations are carried out and the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed frequency control strategy. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","15","Frequency domain analysis","Control systems - Damping - Governors - Hydraulic motors - Hydroelectric generators","Analysis models - Control strategies - DC islanded system - Frequency regulations - Hydraulic power station - Primary frequency control - Turbine control system - Ultra low frequencies","602.1 Mechanical Drives - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 632.2 Hydraulic Equipment and Machinery - 731.1 Control Systems - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: 51777066, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51777066).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It has two mineralization types, one is the Fe-Cu deposit of Xikuangshan type from the Yinmin Formation of the Kunyang Group, the other is the Cu deposit of Dongchuan type from the Luoxue Formation. In this paper, major and trace elemental analyses were combined with thermodynamic calculation to reveal rock characteristics, tectonic setting, sedimentary environment, and mechanism of migration and accumulation of iron and copper. Results show that the Yinmin and Luoxue formations mainly consist of dolomites and siliceous dolomites with dolomitic sandstone as a minor component. Comprehensive analyses of various diagrams, such as 100(Fe2O3/SiO2)-100(Al2O3/SiO2), Fe2O3/TiO2-Al2O3/(Al2O3+Fe2O3), La-Th-Sc and Th-Co-Zr/10 graphs, indicate that the contents of carbonate samples from the two formations were consistent with an active continental margin sedimentary system. Discrimination diagrams of redox environment, such as V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Ce/La, indicate that the Yinmin and Luoxue formations were deposited in a deep water to semideep-water transitional dysaerobic basin. Thermodynamic calculation results show that iron and copper transported mainly in the form of Cl complex. First, temperature, Eh and f(S2) decreased while pH increased in the ore-forming system as ore-forming fluid transported to the surface and mixed with the reduced water. Then instability occurred in the complexes of copper and iron. Finally, oxides including hematite and magnetite, sulfides including pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite changed sequentially with changes in the physical and chemical environment, and formed the ferro-copper and copper ore bodies of the Xikuangshan and Dongchuan types, respectively. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

The results show that there are two low velocity channels between depths of 20–30 km in Yunnan and that the fast axes are sub-parallel to the strikes of the low velocity channels, which supports the crustal flow model. The azimuthal anisotropy pattern is quite complicated and reveals a complex crust–mantle coupling mechanism in Yunnan. The N–S trending Lüzhijiang Fault separates the Dianzhong Block into two parts. In the western Dianzhong Block, the fast axis of the S-wave changes with depth, which indicates that the crust and the lithospheric mantle are decoupled. In the eastern Dianzhong Block and the western Yangtze Craton, the crust and the lithospheric mantle may be decoupled because of crustal flow, despite a coherent S-wave fast axis at depths of 10–110 km. In addition, the difference between the S-wave fast axis in the lithosphere and the SKS splitting measurement suggests that the lithosphere and the upper mantle are decoupled there.

Singularity index as an efficient anomaly analytical tool helps to identify anomalies as well as characterize formation processes of these anomalies. In this study, the singularity-based mineral potential mapping method was utilized to characterize hydrothermal mineralization associated with magmatic, tectonic and sedimentary processes in this district. Based on the results, a mineral prospectivity model was constructed to delineate target areas. In addition to mineral prospectivity, controlling effects of geo-processes on mineralization are spatially non-stationary. Geographically-weighted regression analysis was thus employed to investigate these spatially-varied controlling effects and it has contributed to improve understanding to local metallogeny in the study area.

The present study aimed to incorporate the relationships between species distribution (or vegetation spatial distribution pattern) and topography and human disturbance factors with remote sensing data, to improve the accuracy of mountain vegetation maps. Two different mountainous areas located in Lancang (Mekong) watershed served as study sites. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture classification was used as image classification protocol. In addition, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination was applied to address the relationships between topography and human disturbance factors with the spatial distribution of vegetation patterns. We used ordinary kriging at unobserved locations to predict the CCA scores. The CCA ordination results showed that the vegetation spatial distribution patterns are strongly affected by topography and human disturbance factors. The overall accuracy of vegetation classification was significantly improved by incorporating DEM or four CCA axes as additional channels in both the northern and southern study areas. However, there was no significant difference between using DEM or four CCA axes as extra channels in the northern steep mountainous areas because of a strong redundancy between CCA axes and DEM data. In the southern lower mountainous areas, the accuracy was significantly higher using four CCA axes as extra bands, compared to using DEM as an extra band. In the southern study area, the variance of vegetation data explained by human disturbance factors was larger than the variance explained by topographic attributes. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","112","Vegetation","Factor analysis - Image classification - Interpolation - Landforms - Network architecture - Neural networks - Remote sensing - Satellite imagery - Spatial distribution - Surveying - Topography","Canonical Correspondence Analysis - Digital elevation model - Human disturbances - Ordinary kriging - Remote sensing data - Spatial distribution patterns - Species distributions - Vegetation classification","405.3 Surveying - 481.1 Geology - 655.2 Satellites - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

According to the results of previous studies, the typical depth of brittle-ductile transition zone on mature faults is about 10 km. However, several moderate earthquakes occurred on young faults in stable cratons, and focal depths of those events are very shallow (e.g. the 1993 Mw6.1 India Killari earthquake and a series of shallow earthquakes in Australia). Those observations suggest that depth of the brittle- ductile zone on young faults in cratons is shallower than that on mature faults. In this study, we report a case on a young fault in a tectonically active region that has not been well studied and discuss implications for the rheology structure. On October 7, 2014, an Mw6.1 earthquake occurred in Jinggu, Yunnan (China), the southeastern part of the tectonically active Yunnan-Myanmar block, followed by two aftershocks of M>5 in December. According to historical seismicity and geologic studies in this region, it is suggested that the seimogenic fault of the Jinggu earthquake is a young fault. We use data from global and regional seismic networks, as well as aftershock data from the Lozhadu reservoir network and temporary stations, to study focal depths of the mainshock and aftershocks. The hypocenter of a reference event (Mw4.3) that was recorded with two close temporary stations is determined, and then the hypocenters of the mainshock and two moderate aftershocks are relocated with a relative method based on Pn/Pg arrival times. The relocated hypocenter of the mainshock is 9.5 km deep, whereas the hypocenters of the two aftershocks are about 10 km deep. The centroid depth is investigated with the CAP method based on waveform modeling. Both teleseismic and regional waveforms are used to invert for the centroid depth of the mainshock. The optimal waveform fit is obtained with a depth of 5 km. The two aftershocks are studied with regional waveforms only and the results are close to the hypocenter depths. Since the hypocenter indicates the initial point of rupture whereas the centroid location is close to the center of the main rupture patch, we propose the mainshock initiated at 10 km depth and expanded to the brittle layer at shallower depth. For two aftershocks, the consistency of hypocenter depth and centroid depth suggests circular rupture patterns. Therefore, we propose the bottom of the seismogenic layer and brittle-ductile transition zone is about 10 km deep. This hypothesis is also supported by other observations. Magnetotelluric study in this region reveals a low conductivity layer above 10 km that is regarded as brittle rock, whereas the high conductivity layer beneath 15 km is regarded as ductile rock. Furthermore, a regional rheology model, which is obtained with surface temperature, seismic velocity, and GPS data, also suggests the brittle-ductile transition zone is at about 9 km depth. In summary, the depth of the brittle-ductile transition zone on the young fault in the tectonic active region is similar to that of mature faults, which is useful information for lithosphere geodynamics studies. © 2019, Science Press.

Consequently, tools that can efficiently monitor changes in communities are becoming increasingly important. In the case of birds and other vocalizing animals, it has been suggested that passive acoustic methods can be used for this purpose. Multiple acoustic indices have been developed recently, to be used as proxies for species diversity. Preliminary results have been promising. Yet, before the indices can be applied widely, it is necessary to understand better how well they reflect the communities to be monitored, and how they perform under diverse environmental conditions. Here, we tested seven of the available indices, on sound recordings made in two biodiverse regions in Yunnan Province, south China. We assessed each index's performance by measuring its correlation to bird species richness and diversity, estimated using point-count surveys. Each survey was conducted by an expert observer, at the same time each recording was made, and for the same duration. We also tested whether the performance of the indices was affected by levels of environmental dissimilarity between the sites sampled. We found that although no index showed a very strong correlation with species richness or diversity, three indices (the acoustic entropy, acoustic diversity and acoustic evenness indices) performed consistently better that the other four, showing moderate correlations. The levels of environmental dissimilarity among the sites did not seem to affect the performance of any of the indices tested, suggesting consistency − an important property for the indices to have. We conclude that although the acoustic indices have the potential to be used for passive acoustic monitoring, perhaps they need to be refined further before they can be applied widely. Meanwhile, they should be tested in more environments to reveal fully their potential and limitations. © 2017","44","Bioacoustics","Acoustic measuring instruments - Biodiversity - Birds - Ecology - Forestry - Surveys","Avian communities - Bird species richness - Ecoacoustics - Environmental conditions - Passive acoustic monitoring - Passive acoustics - Species richness - Strong correlation","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 941.1 Acoustical Instruments",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For the purpose of energy saving and environmental protection, a “low-carbon tide” has swept the globe. Despite of the bargaining in right and obligation associated with carbon emissions abatement, most countries per se have taken the low-carbon path to prepare for strategic competitiveness in the long run. Beyond all question, lowcarbon economy would be a significant issue in China’s development, which has already orientated by policies such as National twelfth Five-year plan. As a typical resource-based city, Kaiyuan has consolidated and developed several pillar industries including coal, electricity, chemical, building materials, and food industries around its coal energy industry. The well-developed industrial system and especially the heavy industries have contributed a lot to local economy, however, also brought about severe challenges to the sustainable development of Kaiyuan. As a city whose 90 % energy depends on coal, Kaiyuan is suffering serious pressure in reduction of CO2, SO2, and oxynitride. Therefore, supportive works for Kaiyuan’s low-carbon planning are in sore need and could make profound meaning. This paperfirstly establishes an accounting model for measurement of city’s carbon emissions in which every category, namely husbandry and energy consumption, which should be taken into account has been recognized. After the definition of accounting scope, the calculation method and standard for the emission of each category has been formulated. Some quantitative researches for the total carbon emissions and their sub-items have accordingly carried out to reveal the contradictions and problems during the development of Kaiyuan. Based on the current status as to carbon emissions, three sceneries, referred as Basic analysis unit (BAU), Basic policy (BP) and Low-carbon (LC) scenery, have been set up to check out the development goals for LC urban development of Kaiyuan. According to these analyses, some policy advices have been proposed for reference. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","12","Industrial economics","Carbon - Chemical analysis - Coal - Coal deposits - Coal industry - Energy conservation - Energy utilization - Environmental management - Environmental protection - Population statistics - Sustainable development - Urban growth","Carbon emissions - Economy - Low carbon - Low-carbon urban planning - Scenario analysis","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 524 Solid Fuels - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to reveal the damage mechanisms of slurry to this type of coal reservoirs, we analyzed the physical and chemical properties and potential damage modes of coal rocks. Then, the development situations of fractures and pores before and after the coal core samples were internally contaminated and the invasion and plugging situations of slurry in fractures and pores were analyzed intuitively by means of CT scanning and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the percentage of slurry and fractures in coal core volume was calculated. In this way, a method to quantitatively evaluate the damage of slurry to coal reservoirs was established. And the following research results were obtained. First, under the effect of differential pressure, slurry and its filtrate invade into coal reservoirs along the fractures. The invasion degree varies with the development degree of fractures and pores. The more developed the fractures and pores, the higher the invasion degree. Second, the cement products formed after the slurry in the reservoirs gets cemented and solidified fill the fractures and pores tightly and cover the surface of coal core samples densely, so CBM flowing channels are blocked severely. Consequently, the permeability of coal core samples decreases and the compressive strength of coal rocks increase, leading to the abnormal increase of subsequent fracturing pressure and impacting the fracturing stimulation effects. Third, the effect of slurry filtrate on the alkali sensitivity and speed sensitivity of coal rocks is much less than the damage degree of slurry invasion to coal rocks. In conclusion, this newly developed quantitative evaluation method for the damage of slurry to coal reservoirs is of guiding significance to improving the cement job quality of coal reservoirs and ensuring the efficient CBM development. © 2018, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

The urban expansion of Chuxiong City over the past 30 years could be divided into three periods: the slow development period from 1979 to 1991, the accelerated development period from 1992 to 2003 and the rapid development period from 2004 to 2008. In the past 30 years, the center of the city moved northward. The annual average expansion area increased from 0.4 km2 to l.21 km 2, and the urban expansion and population rise flexibility index increased from 0.86 to 1.56 gradually. The built-up area has increased by 7 times, mainly by occupying the farmland and garden. Urban expansion has had a great effect on heat island effect in the past 30 years. The heat island effect hardly occurred before the 1980s. But in 1989, the temperature of urban areas was 0.5°C higher than that of suburbs, 1.1°C in 1999 and 1.35°C in 2007. The temperature of new town was 0.7°C higher than that of old town in 1999 and 0.1°C in 2007. The hot island intensity in urban areas has increased, the temperature difference between new town and old town has reduced and the temperature of old town has also gradually increased in the past 30 years. At the same time, the distribution of city high-temperature zone has extended to the west of old town and industrial areas, and was significantly affected by human activities, topography and industry development. The distribution of low-temperature zone has changed from sporadic area to Longchuan River zone.","14","Atmospheric temperature","Expansion - Land surface temperature - Landforms - Topography","Chuxiong City - Flexibility index - Heat island effect - High temperature zones - Industry development - Temperature differences - Urban expansion - Urban Heat Island Effects","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 481.1 Geology - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Yunnan pine forests are the most widespread conifer forest type in Southwest China, and are frequently threatened by fire disturbance. Post-fire regeneration of this forest type, however, has not been previously studied. In this study, we investigated the early post-fire regeneration in mixed Yunnan pine forests five months after a severe burn in 2013 on Mt. Qinglongling, Yunnan Province, China. We found very active post-fire regeneration in the burned area likely facilitated by ample summer rainfall, with an average regeneration density of ∼105stems ha−1. Species composition of the post-fire regeneration was highly similar to the pre-fire community–the similarity between the pre- and post-fire communities was 0.530 ± 0.222. Elevation, pre-fire community type, and slope position were the three primary factors in the variations in regeneration density and species composition, while the impact of fire severity was low. The regeneration density of Pinus species and evergreen broadleaf species showed contrasting patterns across the environmental gradients, and the results implied that Yunnan forests are generally resilient to fire disturbance. The controlling impacts of the pre-fire community on post-fire regeneration are driven by the efficient regenerating strategies of dominant species, and are a comprehensive reflection of habitat conditions, which are primarily mediated by topographic features. Species regeneration strategies and the high resilience of the community to fire disturbance should be taken into account in fire prevention and management approaches for this forest type. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","50","Fires","Decision trees - Deforestation - Fireproofing - Rain - Reforestation - Topography","Fire severity - Pine forest - Post fire regeneration - Pre-fires - Random forests - Species composition","443.3 Precipitation - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection - 951 Materials Science - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: 41371190, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31321061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 41371190, 31321061).

Yet, few studies have examined the effects of hoeing tillage on soil redistribution in rocky mountainous areas. Due to a high rock fragments content of gravelly soils, a special type of hoe called the two-tooth harrow has been widely used in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, China. In order to assess gravelly soil redistribution, a series of tillage experiments were set up and the subsequent data were compared with those acquired previously in hilly areas. The displacement distance of gravelly soils increased with slope gradient linearly in the range of 0.05 to 0.69 m m−1; however, when the slope gradient extended further, an exponential equation could better describe the relationship between them. The repose angle of gravelly soils was approximately 0.69–0.70 m m−1. Large-size rock contents and implement types are two important factors affecting tillage depth. Tillage transport coefficients (k3and k4) of gravelly soil in rocky mountainous areas were 40 and 78 kg m−1tillage pass−1, respectively, displaying a slightly large k3value but a significantly small k4value compared with those in hilly areas. Due to its energy saving and applicability to gravelly soils, the two-tooth harrow is more attractive to farmers than the normal hoe in rocky mountainous areas. Moreover, the two-tooth harrow is proved to be efficient and effective in reducing tillage erosion than the normal hoe. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","57","Agricultural machinery","Agriculture - Energy conservation - Erosion - Soils","Gravelly soils - Mountainous area - Muddy soils - Tillage erosion - Two-tooth harrow","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 821.1 Agricultural Machinery and Equipment",,"Number: 2015CB452704, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41571267, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41271242, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was carried out under financial supports from the National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB452704) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571267 and 41271242).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Orebodies occur in the contact zone between lower Upper Permain Emeishan basalt and lower Permian Maokou Formation limestone, as well as nearby basaltic-carbonated breccia layers. This study presents new data on fluid inclusions and C-H-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions to discuss the genesis of the Huangtian lead-zinc deposit. Fluid inclusions analyses reveal that ore-forming fluid was characterized by stage evolution. The early sulfide-forming stage (Stage I) contains various types of fluid inclusions, including daughter mineral containing type, CO2-H2O type and H2O type, with homogenization temperatures of 245~320 (an average of 270). Fluid inclusions in the middle sulfide-forming stage (Stage II) and the late sulfide-forming stage (Stage ) are dominated by H2O type, with homogenization temperatures of 180~250 (an average of 224) and 100~210(an average of 174), respectively. Homogenization temperatures and salinity of the ore-forming fluids gradually decreased from the early stage to late stage. Laser Raman analysis shows that the fluid inclusions are dominated by liquid H2O, and gaseous H2O, CO2, CH4 and N2. Carbon isotopic compositions (δ13CPDB from -8.54‰ to 3.76‰) and oxygen isotopic compositions (δ18OSMOW from 8.57‰ to 24.22‰) are plotted in the transition zone of primary carbonatite and marine carbonatite in the δ18O-δ13C diagram, suggesting that CO2 was probably derived from mantle, dissolution of marine sedimentary carbonate, and dehydroxylation of organic matter in the sediments. Hydrogen isotopic compositions (δD from -97.4‰ to -71.4‰) and oxygen isotopic compositions (δ18OH2O from -4.6‰ to 8.0‰) indicate that the ore-forming fluids were generated from the magmatic fluid, mixed with the meteoric water in later process and perhaps some seawater added. Sulfur isotopic compositions (δ34S from -5.5‰ to 10.3‰) indicate that reduced sulfur was derived from basalts, ancient seawater sulfate and the carbonate strata by thermal-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR). 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb ratios of ore sulfides are 38.320 to 39.365, 15.603 to 15.860, and 18.136 to 18.786, respectively, and all the data are plotted above the average line of crustal lead evolution and within the lead isotopic range of Emeishan Formation basalt, carbonatic rock and Proterozoic basement rocks. All these features suggest that ore-forming material was multiple in origin and homogenization of Pb isotopes occurred in hydrothermal fluids before the lead-zinc mineralization. Based on the origin of ore-forming material and fluids, as well as regional metallogenic geodynamic setting, it can be concluded that the Huangtian lead-zinc deposit belongs to an typical MVT deposit superimposed by magmatic hydrothermal reconstruction. © 2019, Science Press.

The thin-bedded succession, exposed on the south bank of Zaotang River, is formed of three-dimensional dendrite bushes that are up to 6cm high and 3cm in diameter with multiple levels of branching. Bedding is defined by color, which ranges from white to gray to almost black and locally accentuated by differential weathering that highlights the branching motif of the dendrites. The succession developed through repeated tripartite growth cycles that involved: Phase I that was characterized by rapid vertical growth of the dendrite bushes with ever-increasing branching; Phase II that developed once growth of the dendrites had almost or totally ceased, and involved an initial phase of etching that was followed by the precipitation of various secondary minerals (sheet calcite, trigonal calcite crystals, hexagonal calcite crystals, hexagonal plates formed of Ca and P, Mn precipitates, Si-Mg reticulate coatings, opal-CT lepispheres) on the branches of the calcite dendrites, and Phase III that involved deposition of detrital quartz, feldspar, clay, and calcite on top of the dendrite bushes. The tripartite growth cycle is attributed primarily to aperiodic cycles in the CO2content of the spring water that was controlled by subsurface igneous activity rather than climatic controls. High CO2coupled with rapid CO2degassing triggered growth of the dendrite bushes. As CO2levels waned, saturation levels in the spring water decreased and calcite dendrite growth ceased and precipitation of the secondary minerals took place, possibly in the microcosms of microbial mats. Deposition of the detrital sediment was probably related to surface runoff that was triggered by periods of high rainfall. Critically, this study shows that intrinsic factors rather than extrinsic factors (e.g., climate) were the prime control on the development of the tripartite growth cycle. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","81","Phosphorus compounds","Calcite - Carbon dioxide - Deposition - Feldspar - Groundwater - Hot springs - Isotopes - Magnesium compounds - Silicon compounds","Climatic controls - Differential weathering - Extrinsic control - Extrinsic factors - Growth cycle - Intrinsic factors - Saturation levels - Tengchong","444.2 Groundwater - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 2012CB417300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: A6090, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The samples used in this study were collected with the permission of Yunnan Tengchong Rehai Tour Developing Co., Ltd., the administration section of the Rehai geothermal area.

In this study, the horizontal maximum (SHmax) and minimum (Shmin) principal stress and vertical stress (Sv) were systematically analyzed for the first time. The results indicated that the magnitudes of SHmax, Shmin, and Sv showed positive correlations with burial depth. In general, three types of in situ stress fields were determined: (1) SHmax > Sv > Shmin in shallow layers with burial depths less than approximately 600 m (~1970 ft) below ground level (bgl), indicating a dominant strike-slip faulting stress regime; (2) in medium layers approximately 600–800 m (~1970–2625 ft) bgl, the in situ stress state followed multiple relationships, suggesting that the in situ stress regime was transformed; and (3) Sv > SHmax >Shmin in deep layers with burial depths greater than approximately 800 m (~2625 ft) bgl, indicating a dominant normal faulting stress regime. Coal permeabilities obtained from injection–falloff well tests showed that they were widely distributed, and no obvious relationships were found between coal permeability and effective in situ stress magnitude. In the study area, the development and orientation of previously generated natural fractures combined with the present-day in situ stress distribution controlled the permeability in coal reservoirs. Differential stress and presence of natural fractures significantly affected the geometry and pattern of hydraulic fractures. In addition, in the eastern Yunnan region, locations with relatively deep depths in vertical wells and approximately west–northwest/east–southeast-trending horizontal wells suffered high potential of borehole instability because of the high differential stress.

In this paper, the mineralogical and geochemical features have been further advanced through a study of two regionally extensive and relatively flat-lying mineralized layers from No. XW drill core. The layers are clay-altered volcanic ash and tuffaceous clay, and are dominated by clay minerals (mixed layer illite/smectite, kaolinite, berthierine, and chamosite); with lesser amounts of quartz and variable amounts of anatase, siderite and calcite; along with trace pyrite, barite, zircon, ilmenite, galena, chalcopyrite, and REE-bearing minerals. The mineralized samples have higher Al2O3/TiO2values (13.7–41.4) and abundant rare metal elements (Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, REE, Ga, Th, and U) whereas less mineralized samples are rich in V, Cr, Co, and Ni and have lower Al2O3/TiO2values (2.32–7.67). The mineralized samples also have strong negative δEu in chondrite-normalized REE patterns. Two processes are most likely responsible for the geochemical and mineralogical anomalies of the mineralized samples: airborne volcanic ash and multi-stage injection of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. Based on paragenetic analysis, this polymetallic mineralization is derived from the interaction between alkaline volcanic ashes and subsequent percolation of low-temperature fluids. The intense and extensive alkaline volcanism of the early Late Permian inferred from this study possibly originated from the coeval Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP). This unique Nb(Ta)-Zr(Hf)-REE-Ga mineralization style has significant economic and geological potential for the study of mineralization of the lowest Xuanwei Formation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","88","Mineralogy","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Calcite - Chlorite minerals - Cobalt deposits - Concrete aggregates - Copper compounds - Exploratory geochemistry - Kaolinite - Percolation (fluids) - Pyrites - Rare earths - Silicate minerals - Solvents - Temperature - Titanium dioxide - Volcanoes - Zircon","Alkaline volcanism - Emeishan - Emeishan large igneous provinces - Geochemical features - Hydrothermal fluids - Low-temperature hydrothermal fluids - Mineralogy , geochemistries - Mixed-layer illite/smectite","412 Concrete - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 484 Seismology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 201406430026, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: CUMT, Sponsor: China University of Mining and Technology; Number: IRT13099, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fine&nbsp;Ceramics&nbsp;Opening&nbsp;Fund; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41420104001 ), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University ( IRT13099 ), and the China Scholarship Council (No. 201406430026 ).

The study of petro-geochemistry suggests the Bengge intrusion is not the product of simple crystallization differentiation of single magma. Its magma resources are diversity and multi-period, and they mainly represented the magmatism of subduction oceanic slab and mantle wedge and low-crust partial melting in Late Triassic Indosinian and phlogopitebearing metasomatic enrichment mantle partial melting with a low degree in Cenozoic. The formation and evolution of Bengge intrusion had roughly undergone three stages that are formation of initial magma in Late Indosinian, superimposing of subsequent magma in Yanshanian and magma emplacing in Himalayan, and with mantle fluid metasomatism and crust-mantle materials contamination caused by the former in the whole magmatism process. And the gold mineralization related to Bengge alkaline complex igneous is mainly subject to the multi-period magma interacting with ore-bearing mantle fluid and mantle fluid metasomatic superimposing contamination.

The ore bodies of this deposit occurred as either stratiform-like or lentiform within the marbleization-limestone of the Upper Cambrian Baoshan Formation, and was controlled by NEE trending fault, with sphalerite and galena as main and chalcopyrite and pyrite as occasionally ore minerals; dolomite, chlorite, calcite, quartz and sericite as dominant gangue minerals. Based on the detailed study of the geological features of the deposit, combined with H, 0, S and Pb isotope compositions, this paper focused on the sources of metallogenic fluids and materials, and compared with the adjacent Luziyuan super-large Pb-Zn-Fe-Cu polymetallic deposit. This research indicates that the values of ΔD and Δ;180H20 of quartz in the deposit range from - 101. 1‰ to - 93. 3‰ with average of - 96. 85‰ (n = 4) and from 3. 37‰ to 3. 77‰ with average of 3. 57‰ (n = 4) respectively, implying magmatic as dominant early metallogenic fluids, while increasing gradually mixed with meteoric water later. δ34S values of the sulfides are all positive, varying from 4. ‰ to 12. 2‰ with average of 8. 23‰ (n = 10), and approaching Δ34S values (8. 9‰ to 12‰) of the adjacent Luziyuan deposit. This deposit can be divided into three metallogenic phases, phase II is the main metallogenic stage of the deposit related to sphalerite and galena (Δ34S values are mainly concentrated between 4. ‰ to 6. 2‰).

Pb isotope analysis of metal sulfides in this deposit is made, and the results show that it is very concentrated (ranges from 18. 3408 to 18. 4483 with average of 18. 3815, and from 15. 8337 to 15. 9440 with average of 15. 8745, and from 38. 8224 to 39. 4391 with average of 38. 9941 respectively for206Pb/204Pb,207Pb/204Pb and208Pb/204Pb, n = 10). The points are mainly distributed above the upper crust evolution line, indicative of primarily the upper crust materials related to magmatism. This paper argues that the deep crustal magmatic hydrotherm in the mining area is the most important sources of metallogenic fluids and materials in the Shuitoushan deposit, that the mixing of fluids is an important mechanism for the precipitation and enrichment of metal elements, that the deposit is characterized by low temperature and epigenetic mineralization, speculating that the formation of the deposit is related to magmatic hydrothermalism of Late Yanshan epoch.","104","Sulfur compounds","Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper alloys - Copper compounds - Deposits - Iron alloys - Isotopes - Lead zinc deposits - Lime - Lutetium alloys - Metals - Precipitation (chemical) - Pyrites - Quartz - Temperature - Zinc sulfide","Baoshan block - Distribution characteristics - Equilibrium fractionations - Geological features - Isotopic composition - Metallogenic fluids - Pb isotopes - Pb-zn deposits","482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Since 1900, more than 10 earthquakes with magnitude over 7 occurred in this region, which account for more than a half of the great earthquakes in Yunnan. Moreover, the recent MS7.2 earthquake occurred in Mong Hpayak on March 24, 2011, and a series of MS5.5 earthquakes in the western Yunnan. If these earthquakes are not isolated, does they mean early warning of great earthquakes in the future? Therefore, for the purpose of earthquake prevention and disaster mitigation, it is urgent and necessary to carry out seismic risk assessment in this region especially along the NE-trending fault zones. The method of tectonic geomorphology was used to analyze fault activity. By measuring the deformation of the typical geomorphic or geologic units together with dating data, fault activity was estimated. The measurement was finished indoor or in the field. Remote sensing data were interpreted and geologic maps were prepared. According to the interpretation of drainage systems based on the remote sensing data, displacement of faults were determined. In the field, the rope and scale were employed for measurement (if displacement is too long, GPS equipment was used). Using dating technology, motion rates on the faults in the study area were estimated. The analysis of tectonic geomorphology along the Nanting fault zone, and drainages and channels across the fault zone shows systematically left-lateral offset. The largest offset occurs along the Nujiang River, and total displacement of the fault here is about 10 km. Moreover, offsets of rivers near the village Datianba range from 1.5 to 5.5 km and 1.8 to 2.1 km near Panhe Farm, respectively. Besides geomorphic units, geologic units are also displaced. Granite bodies west of the Yun County show obviously sinistral slip ranging from 4.1m to 5.6 km. Based on the tectonic characteristics and deep dynamic mechanism of NE-trending tectonics within the Yunnan-Myanmar block, the following conclusions are obtained. Firstly, the maximum displacement of the NE-trending left lateral strike-slip fault zone is 10 km. According to its initial age of 5 Ma, the minimum of the left lateral strike slip rate is ca. 2 mm·a-1. Secondly, the late Cenozoic tectonic deformation and seismic activity of the Yunnan-Myanmar block are mainly controlled by the East India plate subduction, and the deformation in dominated by strike slip on faults. Thirdly, based on the analysis of the scales of NE direction left-lateral faults and recurrence times of historical earthquakes, the study region including the Nantinghe, Wanding and Dayingjiang fault zones and the surrounding areas has risk of large earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater. More attention should be paid to earthquake prevention and risk assessment of large engineering projects in this region. © 2015, Science Press.

In the context of the increasing human activities, sediments of alpine lakes could record the processes of human-nature interaction. Here we present multi-proxy records, including total organic carbon, total nitrogen and n-alkanes along with elementals, inferred from a 37-cm-long sediment core collected from a small alpine lake (Lake Cuoqia) in northwestern Yunnan Province, China. Together with instrumental data and other published regional records, we divide environmental changes into four stages over the past 200 years: ca. 1807-1900: increased lake level and expanded surface area, declined organic matter abundance, and exogenous mainly contributions of organic matter with growing endogenous contributions; ca. 1900-1950: slightly declined lake level and decreased surface area, decreased abundance of organic matter, and slightly increased exogenous organic matter; ca. 1950-1982: further dropped lake level and shrank lake surface, declined abundance of organic matter, and increased exogenous organic matter; ca. 1982-2007: further decreased lake level and surface area, increased organic matter content which was dominated by terrestrial inputs with the addition of endogenous contributions. We also divide the industrial pollutions into three stages based on the heavy metal results: before ca. 1950: very low heavy metal concentration indicating natural background without anthropogenic influences; ca. 1950-1982: beginning of industrial pollutions; after ca. 1982: abruptly increased heavy metal pollutions due to the development of ore industry. As Lake Cuoqia has a very small catchment without any human activity and industry, the heavy mental pollutions are likely transported through atmospheric circulation. Our records indicate the considerable environmental fluctuations over the last 200 years, and suggest that industry pollutants could be transported and influence the remote high-altitude areas. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","51","Lake pollution","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Catchments - Heavy metals - Lakes - Organic carbon - Paraffins","Abundance of organic matters - Alpine lakes - Atmospheric circulation - Environmental fluctuations - Heavy metal concentration - Lake levels - n-Alkanes - Organic matter abundances","453 Water Pollution - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the interpretation of remote sensing image, the SSXF clearly shows the linear feature and continuous distribution as a single, penetrating fault. It has a total length of about 70km, trends generally about 20° to the northeast and protrudes slightly in the middle to the east. A typically geomorphologic phenomenon about the synchronous left-lateral dislocation of ridges and gullies can be found at Liangchahe, Longtan Village along the SSXF. The distribution of faults, the sedimentary features, attitude variance and the primary dating results of the offset strata in the trench section across fault sag ponds reveal three paleoseismic events rupturing obviously the surface, which demonstrates that the SSXF has the ability of recurrence of strong earthquakes. High-precision topographic map about two gullies and the platform between them with synchronous dislocation is acquired by using the Trimble 5800 GPS real-time difference measurement system. The dislocation is (18.3±0.5)m. As the top geomorphologic surface between the above two gullies and their adjacent area, the terrace surface T2stopped accepting deposits at ~2606a, based on the linear regression analysis of three dating data. According to the geological method, a sinistral strike-slip rate of (7.02±0.20)mm/a on the SSXF in the Holocene is obtained, which has a good consistency with the results provided by using GPS data. The preliminary results about the Holocene activity and slip rate of the SSXF demonstrate that the southward or south-southeast motion of the Sichuan-Yunnan block in the SE Yunnan region has not been absorbed by the possible shortening deformation and the sinistral strike-slip rate of the SSXF has not been drastically reduced. The SSXF is a Holocene fault with obvious activity. This preliminary understanding provides some basic geological data for the seismic risk evaluation of the SSXF in the future, and for the establishment and inspection of the seismotectonic model about the Sichuan-Yunnan block. © 2017, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.

The equivalent charge method and the empirical formula of International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) were employed to obtain the maximum potential gradient on conductor surface and the distribution of RI, respectively, and then the results were compared with measured value. According to the results, there was a gradually decreasing trend of RI for half-voltage and full-voltage negative-pole operation with the increasing distance between the measuring location and negative-pole conductors. Furthermore, the measured RI of half-voltage positive-pole and full-voltage negative-pole operations changed gradually, and it was greater than that of half-voltage negative-pole operation, but less than that of full-voltage negative-pole and bipolar operations. Moreover, though the error between the simulative calculation and measured RI for full-voltage bipolar operation was smaller in comparison with the other operation modes, the measured RI become slightly larger with a conductor height of 49 m, or a measuring location near 500 kV AC transmission lines, or an altitude height of 1900 m. Finally, with increasing altitude heights, RI firstly increased and then decreased when the measuring location was in an area between the positive polar and negative polar with 20 m extending on both sides; meanwhile RI showed an attenuation trend in other locations. It is concluded that the difference in RI distribution between simulative calculation and measurement existed due to environmental factors; never the less all the RI of full-voltage of bipolar at different altitudes were within the electromagnetic environment standard limit.","22","Radio interference","Electric lines - Location - Poles - Radio transmission","Corona performance - Electromagnetic environments - Environmental factors - High altitude area - Simulative calculations - Transmission projects - UHVDC - UHVDC transmission lines","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is also a well known deposit in China. The large scale of the mineralization and especially the huge volume of H2S that was required to precipitate the Zn-Pb sulfide are of great interest to ore geologists. Ore microscopy shows microbial structures such as framboidal sphalerite, spherical aggregates of galena-sphalerite, oolite sphalerite, dendritic colloidal sphalerite-pyrite, metacolloidal sphalerite-pyrite, multinuclear-metacolloidalring-like sphalerite-pyrite, botryoidal sphalerite-pyrite, framboidal pyrite and bacterial plate-like of galena-sphalerite. Detailed observations and analyses of the microbial structures at micron to nanometer scales by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) reveal that the bacteria fossils are composed of sphalerite, galena or pyrite or of multiple sulfide minerals with calcite and that they are distributed in bacterial colonies in the ore. The individual bacteria fossils are spherical, botryoidal or ring-like with a diameter of 200–500 nm. Filamentous, mucoid and tubular extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are commonly observed that are closely associated with, and have the same composition as, the bacteria fossils. Secondary ion microprobe analysis (SIMS) by in situ sulfur micro-isotopic analysis of the microbial sulfide structures and bacteria fossils yield δ34SV-CDTvalues varying from −48.6 to−9.5 per mil, indicating that there was a high percentage of sulfate reducing bacteria in the Zn-Pb sulfide mineralization process. Previous analyses have shown that the Zn-Pb mineralization was formed at a shallow depth and low temperature with barely visible hydrothermal alteration, the presence of evaporitic sulfate layers and paleo-oil reservoir characteristics. The authors believe that bacterial sulfate reduction might be the key H2S production mechanism in the Jinding dome that was required to form this giant Pb-Zn sulfide ore body. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","90","Zinc sulfide","Bacteria - Binary alloys - Calcite - Clay alteration - Cobalt deposits - Deposits - Field emission microscopes - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead zinc deposits - Mineralogy - Ore reduction - Petroleum reservoir engineering - Petroleum reservoirs - Pyrites - Reduction - Scanning electron microscopy - Sulfur compounds - Temperature","Bacterial sulfate reduction - Energy dispersive spectrometry - Extracellular polymeric substances - FESEM and EPS - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Jinding Pb-Zn deposit - Sulfate reducing bacteria - SW-China","482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 512.1.1 Oil Fields - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 40772061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41072069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported mainly by Grants to Xue from National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC ( 41072069 , 40772061 ).

The results show that there is a great difference in the drainage dynamic of CBM wells in the study area. The producing resource abundance and permeability determine the gas production capability of CBM wells as basic factors. The higher the producing resource abundance and the permeability are, the higher gas pro-duction is. Meanwhile, the reservoirs with coal body structure Type I and II have a higher gas production compared to that with coal body structure Type III. The primary drainage rate is the key controlling factor of drainage dynamics of CBM wells. When the primary drainage rate is relatively high, even with the permeability and the producing resource abundance being high, the gas production is still relatively low. Controlling the primary drainage rate has two meanings:one is to slow down the reduction of absolute permeability(stress-sensitive), and the other is to delay the occurrence of two-phase flow, both having objective to extend the depression cone to maximum.Based on the above understanding, it is pointed out that slow drainage should be key in the study area. A low rate-ladder type pressure reduction,during primary drainage, is proposed. This pressure reduction regime has a certain practical significance for co-production from multiple-coalbeds in East Yunnan-Western Guizhou area. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

Research on the structural origin and properties of these tectonic domes is beneficial for revealing the regularity of regional low temperature ore formation. The Jiache Dome in northeast Yunnan situates near Awang and Jiache towns. Compared with other domes in the area, the Jiache Dome developed a complete structure-rock assemblage, typical of the regional tectonic domes. Focusing on the structural features of the Jiache Dome, the structural origin and deformation sequences of tectonic domes, characteristics of background anomaly of low temperature metallogenic elements, and occurrence of Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Sb elements were determined in this work, through detailed geological investigation, structural analysis, key stratum sample collection, geochemical and EMPA analyses, in combination with regional background data. By completing three crosscutting structural profiles of the Jiache Dome, it is discovered that the dome has experienced at least three stages of structural deformation (D1, D2, D3): D1period developed consequent flow layer deformation, possibly of the Caledonian age; D2period formed the NEE trending buckling fold with a supposed deformation age of the Indosinian; D3period resulted in the NNE trending buckling fold, whose deformation age is postulated to be the Yanshanian. Results of geochemical analyses show that low-grade metamorphic rocks in the Kunyang Group (for example muddy and silty slate) have background anomaly values 3 to 5 times higher than background levels for Pb, Zn, Ag, Sb, As and siltstone in the Chengjiang Formation of Sinian. Similarly, dolomite and black shale in the Dengying Formation exhibit background anomaly levels 3 to 5 times higher than background values for Pb, Ag, and As. And part of black shales in the Yuhucun Formation of the lower Cambrian show background anomaly values 5 times higher than background values for Pb, Zn, Ag, Sb, As. EMPA analysis suggests that these low temperature ore-forming elements are mainly hosted in the primary pyrite. Results of structure analyses further show that the main body of the dome formed over the superposed NNE- and NEE-trending folds, and it has experienced multi-stage tectonic superposition and transformation. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

Using field emission scanning electron microscopy and low-pressure N2adsorption, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the structural characteristics of nano-micro pores in this formation. Our results show that the pores in the Qiongzhusi Formation shale are mainly organic, intragranular and intergranular. We quantitatively described the pore structure using surface fractal models and the Image J software for image processing. The mean Mandelbrot fractal dimension and the boxcounting fractal dimension were different, with values of 1.2543 and 1.5203 for organic pores, 1.4520 and 1.5781 for intragranular pores, and 1.5111 and 1.5171 for intergranular pores, respectively. The organic pores had the most regular pore morphology and a moderately homogenous pore distribution. The intragranular pores had moderately irregular morphology and the most homogenous distribution. The intergranular pores had the most irregular morphology and the least homogenous distribution. Based on the pore development characteristics of the Qiongzhusi Formation shale, we divided the shale minerals into three categories: easily dissolved minerals, braced minerals, and clay minerals. Low-pressure N2adsorption results showed that the organic matter content, easily dissolved mineral content and braced mineral content determine the pore volume and specific surface area.

The main reason for this puzzle is the lack of geochemical studies on mantle-derived mafic rocks in SE Asia. In this paper, we report Early Cretaceous Nbenriched diabases (ca. 139 Ma) and Late Cretaceous Nb-enriched (ca. 68 Ma) and oceanic-island basalt (OIB)-like (ca. 73 Ma) amphibolites from the Ailaoshan tectonic zone in the Yunnan-Burma region. The ca. 139 Ma diabases and ca. 68 Ma amphibolites display similar geochemical features with typical Nb-enriched basalts, e.g., high Na2O, TiO2, and Nb (>7 ppm) contents, and high (Nb/Th)PM, (Nb/La)PM, and Nb/U ratios. Unlike adakite-associated Nb-enriched basalts, our Nb-enriched diabases and ampibolites were derived through mixing between OIBlike and arc-like mantle source components in the spinel stability field (2and Nb (20.0-26.0 ppm) contents, and OIB-like rare earth element patterns and trace-element spidergrams. The OIB-like rocks were generated by a low degree of partial melting of garnet-facies peridotite (>80 km). In combination with previous Cretaceous to early Eocene age data from granitoids, three significant magmatic flare-ups are identified at 140-115 Ma, 75-64 Ma, and 55-50 Ma, with two magmatic gaps at 115-75 Ma and 64-55 Ma. Given the distances of the studied area from the Pacific and Neotethyan trenches (2400-5000 km and 320 km, respectively), these Cretaceous igneous rocks more likely formed in a Neotethyan subduction-related tectonic setting, rather than a Pacific Ocean-related setting. We propose a tectonic model involving episodic flat slab subduction, slab rollback, and intracontinental back-arc extension for Neotethyan subduction in the Yunnan-Burma region. © 2016 Geological Society of America.","127","Basalt","Exploratory geochemistry - Geodynamics - Magnesium compounds - Melting - Niobium - Oceanography - Rare earths - Sodium compounds - Tectonics - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements","Back-arc extensions - Early Cretaceous - Flat-slab subductions - Geochemical features - Geodynamic process - Late cretaceous - Oceanic island basalts - Tectonic settings","471.1 Oceanography, General - 481 Geology and Geophysics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 2015M582456, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2016YFC0600303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB440901, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41502210, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41190073, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to Editor David Ian Schofield, Associate Editor Stephen T.

The results show that the coal reservoirs can be divided into three categories: type A (Ro,max o,max o,max > 2.15%). The structural parameters of pores in the range from 2 to 100 nm are influenced by the degree of coal metamorphism and the compositional parameters (e.g., ash and volatile matter). The dominant diameters of the specific surface areas are 10–50 nm, 2–50 nm, and 2–10 nm, respectively. The pores in the range from 2-specific surface area and CO2-total pore volume relationships show a positive linear correlation. The metamorphic degree has a much greater control on the pores (pore diameter less than 2 nm) structural parameters than those of the pore diameter ranges from 2 to 100 nm. Dv1 and Dv2 can characterize the structure of 2–100 nm adsorption pores, and Dv1 (volume heterogeneity) has a positive correlation with the pore structural parameters such as N2-specific surface area and N2-total pore volume. This parameter can be used to characterize volume heterogeneity of 2–10 nm pores. Dv2 (surface heterogeneity) showed type A > type B > type C and was mainly affected by the metamorphism degree. Ds2 can be used to characterize the pore surface heterogeneity of micropores in the range of 0.62–1.50 nm. This parameter has a good correlation with the pore parameters (CO2-total pore volume, CO2-specific surface area, and average pore size) and is expressed as type C v1, Dv2, and Ds2 can be used as effective parameters to characterize the pore structure of adsorption pores.

This study reports new data on the petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical compositions of 57 samples (including coal bench samples, roofs, floors, partings, and batholith granite) of three high-Ge coal seams (S3, Z2, and X1) from the Dazhai Mine, Lincang Ge ore deposit, and provides new insights into the origin and modes of occurrence of the minerals and elements present.The coals have huminite random reflectances in the 0.33-0.48% range. On a mineral-free basis, the coal samples are dominated by huminite-group macerals, all having more than 88.5% total huminite. Ulminite and attrinite generally dominate the huminite macerals. Structured inertinite is rare, with funginite being the most abundant inertinite form. The minerals in the coals are mainly composed of quartz, and, to a lesser extent, kaolinite, illite, and mica. A hydrous beryllium sulfate phase (BeSO4·4H2O) is present in the low temperature ashes of several coal samples.Compared to average values for world low-rank coals, beryllium (up to 2000 μg/g and 343. μg/g on average), Ge (up to 2176 μg/g and 1590 μg/g on average), and W (up to 339 μg/g and 170. μg/g on average) are unusually enriched in the Lincang coals, with a concentration coefficient >. 100 (CC = ratio of element concentration in investigated coals vs. world low-rank coals); elements As (156. μg/g on average), Sb (38. μg/g), Cs (25.2 μg/g), and U (52.5 μg/g) are significantly enriched (10 2-bearing and volcanogenic CO2-bearing fluids, which led to the enrichment of trace elements, not only including assemblages of Ge-W and Be-Nb-U (both leached from granite and the deposited in the peat), but also As-Sb (from volcanogenic solution), as well as the alteration and argillization of the batholith granites, and the formation of carbonate and quartz-carbonate metasomatites. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","109","Coal deposits","Antimony compounds - Beryllium compounds - Carbon dioxide - Carbonation - Coal - Cobalt deposits - Deposits - Exploratory geochemistry - Floors - Germanium - Granite - Kaolinite - Leaching - Mica - Ores - Petrography - Petrology - Quartz - Rare earths - Roofs - Rubidium compounds - Silicate minerals - Silver deposits - Sulfur compounds - Temperature - Ternary alloys - Trace elements - Volcanoes","Coal mineralogies - Coal petrologies - Concentration coefficients - Element concentrations - Geochemical composition - Hydrothermal solution - Low temperature ashes - Modes of occurrences","402 Buildings and Towers - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 524 Solid Fuels - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: IRT13099, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41272182, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41420104001 and 41272182 ), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (No. IRT13099 ).

The genetic diversity among 14 populations (bulk samples) and within two populations (individual samples) was studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) amplification markers. The field survey showed that 44% natural populations of O. granulata in Yunnan have become extinct during the last 30 years. Of the 37 remaining wild populations, 28 (76%) are on the verge of extinction and nine (24%) were unaffected. For the study among the 14 populations, the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 59% for RAPDs and 64% for ISSRs. However, within populations, the PPB generated by RAPDs and ISSRs was 26 and 26% in the first population (S1) and similarly within the second population (S2) (21 and 22%, respectively). The results showed that genetic variation is much higher among populations of O. granulata than within populations. Analyses of Nei's gene diversity, unbiased genetic distance and Shannon's index also agreed with these results. Therefore, we proposed an appropriate strategy for conserving the genetic resources of O. granulata in Yunnan; namely, rescuing and conserving the core populations for in situ conservation, and sampling and preserving more populations with fewer individuals from each population for ex situ conservation. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To address the need for BVOC emission estimates in regional atmospheric chemistry simulations, 95 common plant species were screened for emissions of BVOC in and near the Xishuangbanna Tropical Biological Gardens in southern Yunnan Province, Peoples' Republic of China in February 2003. In situ measurements with leaf cuvettes and branch bag enclosures were used in combination with portable gas chromatography, flame ionization, photoionization, and mass spectral detection to identify and quantify BVOC emissions. Forty-four of the species examined emitted isoprene at rates exceeding 20 μg C g-1 (leaf dry weight) h-1. An emphasis was placed on the genus Ficus, which is important in the region and occupies a wide range of ecological niches. Several species in the footprint of a nearby flux tower were also examined. Several palm species and an abundant fern (Cyclosorus parasiticus) emitted substantial amounts of isoprene, and probably accounted for observed daytime mean isoprene fluxes from the understory of a Hevea brasiliensis plantation of 1.0 and 0.15 mg C m-2 h -1 during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. These measurements verify that both the forest floor and canopy in this region can be sources of isoprene. Monoterpene emissions exceeded 1.0 μg-C g-1 (leaf dry weight) h-1 from only 4 of 38 species surveyed, including some Ficus species and H. brasiliensis. However most of the trees of the latter species were sparsely foliated due to dry season senescence, and emission factors are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those reported during the wet season. BVOC emission rates and physiology of many species are impacted by reduced moisture availability, especially Mangifera indica. South Asia is a region undergoing rapid landuse change and forest plantation establishment, with large increases in area of high BVOC-emitting species in the genera Bambusa, Elaeis, Eucalyptus, Hevea, Pinus, and Populus (among others). This could result in profound changes in atmospheric chemistry in these regions, for instance, terpene emissions from H. brasiliensis could increase wet season biogenic organic aerosol burdens by approximately a factor of 2 in the Xishuangbanna region. Increases in plantation area established with high isoprene emitting species, (e.g. Bambusa spp. and Eucalyptus spp.) are also projected for China and other parts of Southeast Asia in the near future. Thus, landcover change in South Asian landscapes is usually associated with large increases in BVOC flux with the potential to alter the atmospheric chemical composition and air quality over this rapidly developing region. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a lack of neutral Cl waters at Banglazhang, and the geothermal waters are mainly Na-HCO3type with low but comparable SO4and Cl concentrations. The SiO2concentrations of the Banglazhang geothermal waters indicate equilibration in a shallow reservoir with a temperature around 150 °C. While dilution by Mg-rich cold groundwaters complicates geothermometry, the Na-K geothermometer suggests that this shallow reservoir is fed by geothermal fluid from a deeper reservoir above 200 °C. The geophysical investigations made in the neighboring regions of Banglazhang indicate that the Banglazhang system is likely to be located above the margin of a comparatively shallow-seated magma chamber. However, the hydrochemical and O, H and S isotopic evidence doesn't imply a mixing of magmatic fluid with Banglazhang geothermal waters. The geochemical scenario below Banglazhang is quite different than some typical magmatic-hydrothermal systems in China (such as Yangbajain and Rehai) where the geochemistry of geothermal waters are strongly affected by the input of magmatic fluid. The efforts made in this study might be suggestive for identifying the geothermal and geochemical origin of a large number of unexplored high-temperature hydrothermal systems in remote Yunnan and Tibet of China whose heat sources and geological conditions are unclear. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","41","Geothermal energy","Binary alloys - Chlorine - Geochemistry - Groundwater - Hydrochemistry - Magnesium alloys - Mixing - Potassium alloys - Silica","Banglazhang - Geological conditions - Geothermal provinces - Geothermal water - Hydrothermal activity - Magma chamber - Magmatic-hydrothermal systems - Reservoir temperatures","444.2 Groundwater - 481.2 Geochemistry - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,"Number: GBL11505, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41521001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41120124003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572335, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015-138-HHS-KJ-X, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41572335 , 41120124003 and 41521001 ), the research program of China Power Investment Corporation ( 2015-138-HHS-KJ-X ), and the research program of State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology of China ( GBL11505 ).

The dam, with a height of 83 m and a lake capacity of 260 × 106 m3, threatened more than 10,000 people. A unique feature of this landslide dam was that it formed between a man-made dam and a hydropower plant. An existing drainage tunnel connecting the lake and the hydropower plant became a natural drainage conduit for the landslide dam, which played an important role in the mitigation of the landslide dam risks. This paper reports a quantitative risk assessment for the Hongshiyan landslide dam considering both engineering and non-engineering risk mitigation measures. The risk assessment is divided into three stages according to the implementation of two engineering measures: construction of a diversion channel and excavation of a branch drainage tunnel. The dam breaching hydrographs, flood zones, population at risk, and likely fatalities in each of the three stages are analysed. The optimum evacuation strategy in each stage is also studied based on the principle of minimum total consequence. It is found that the diversion channel decreases the dam breaching peak discharge and the associated risks significantly. The branch drainage tunnel prevent the landslide dam from overtopping failure in non-flooded period; however, the landslide dam may fail by overtopping in a future flood if the inflow rate is larger than the outflow rate through the drainage tunnels, resulting in serious losses of lives and properties. The dam breaching risks in all the three stages could be largely reduced by the optimal evacuation decision, which shows that timely evacuation is vital to save life and properties. The study provides a scientific basis for decision making in landslide dam risk management. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","31","Risk assessment","Behavioral research - Dams - Decision making - Drainage - Earthquakes - Erosion - Floods - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants - Lakes - Landslides - Risk management","Dam failure - Engineering measures - Evacuation strategy - Hydropower plants - Landslide dam - Overtopping failures - Quantitative risk assessment - Risk mitigation","441.1 Dams - 484 Seismology - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: 20131942, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 973, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013CB036404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41402257, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41372272, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 14PJ1408200, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51129902, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research reported in this paper was substantially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41372272, 41402257 and 51129902), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (14PJ1408200), the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973??Program)??(No.??2013CB036404),??and the Program for Young Excellent Talents in Tongji University (20131942).

In this paper, SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment–2 (GOME-2), and gross primary productivity (GPP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture and precipitation are used to investigate vegetation stress in six areas of Yunnan Province in China. The results illustrate that SIF, NDVI, and GPP all decrease in the condition of water stress and increase when recovering towards a healthy condition; LST increases under stress conditions and decreases gradually during recovery conditions. Then, analyses of long time-series for SIF, GPP, NDVI, and LST from 2010 to 2017 are conducted. These performances demonstrate SIF is much more sensitive than GPP, the NDVI, and LST during drought conditions. When vegetation is in the condition of water stress, SIF has earlier responses than other parameters. Last, the relationships between SIF and soil moisture in 2010–2016 yield significant results, with the correlation coefficient r = 0.56, 0.71, 0.75, 0.74, 0.62, 0.52 and 0.47, sequentially.

The concentrations of Cd vary greatly from one type to another type of rocks in the mining district. In the host rock, Cd concentrations range from 50 × 10-6 to 650 × 10-6 with an average of 310 × 10-6. In primary ores, Cd concentrations range from 14 × 10-6 to 2800 × 10-6 with an average of 767 × 10-6. However, in oxidized ores, Cd concentrations are highest, varying within the range of 110 × 10-6 to 8200 × 10-6, averaging 1661 × 10-6. It is shown that the oxidized ores are the main carrier and environmental source of Cd. Leaching test showed that Pb/Zn ores are easy to oxidize and thereafter release Cd and other harmful elements. These leached elements in the leachate may be precipitated rapidly in the order of Zn>Pb>Cd. As for the concentration distribution of Cd in the Bijiang River, it is estimated to be 15.7 μg/L Cd in water, 49.3 mg/L in suspended substances, and 203.7 mg/L in sediments. The average value of Cd in soil from the polluted area is 83.0 mg/kg. Natural weathering of Cd-rich rocks and minerals imposes a potential environmental risk on the aquatic ecosystem of the Bijiang catchment. © Science Press 2008.","27","Mineralogy","Cadmium - Environmental impact - Geochemistry - Leaching - Mineral resources - Mining - Pollution","Cadmium pollution - Concentration distribution - Environmental geochemistry - Leaching test","454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.1 Mineralogical Techniques - 502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Theoretical (THR)","Number: 2006, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 40773072, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","financially supported jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grand No. 40773072), the "Western Talent Plan" sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2006) and the Special Fund provided by the Chongqing Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

These precipitates include arrays of aragonite crystals, calcite cone-dendrites, red spar calcite, unattached dodecahedral and rhombohedral calcite crystals, and late stage calcite that commonly coats and disguises the earlier formed precipitates. Some of the microbial mats that grow on the ledges around the pools have been partly mineralized by microspheres that are formed of Si and minor amounts of Fe. The calcite and aragonite that are interspersed with each other at all scales are both primary precipitates. Some laminae, for example, change laterally from aragonite to calcite over distances of only a few millimetres. The precipitates at Shiqiang are similar to precipitates found in and around the vent pools of other springs found in Yunnan Province, including those at Gongxiaoshe, Zhuyuan, Eryuan, and Jifei. In all cases, the δDwaterand δ18Owaterindicate that the spring water is of meteoric origin. These are thermogene springs with the carrier CO2being derived largely from the mantle and reaction of the waters with bedrock. Variations in the δ13Ctravertinevalues indicate that the waters in these springs were mixed, to varying degrees, with cold groundwater and its soil-derived CO2. Calcite and aragonite precipitation took place once the spring waters had become supersaturated with respect to CaCO3, probably as a result of rapid CO2degassing. These precipitates, which were not in isotopic equilibrium with the spring water, are characterized by their unusual crystal morphologies. The precipitation of calcite and aragonite, seemingly together, can probably be attributed to microscale variations in the saturation levels that are, in turn, attributable to microscale variations in the rate of CO2degassing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","82","Calcite","Calcium carbonate - Carbon dioxide - Carbonate minerals - Degassing - Dendrites (metallography) - Groundwater - Hot springs - Isotopes - Lakes - Vents","Aragonite - Aragonite crystals - Calcite crystals - Crystal morphologies - Micro-scale variation - Opal-A - Primary precipitates - Saturation levels","444.2 Groundwater - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 531.2 Metallography - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: SIDSSE1301, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: ZA635, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41272370, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Samples used in this study were collected with the permission of the owners of the Shiqiang site.

XRD analysis is used to determine the mineral composition and brittleness indexes of three shale suites in these areas. These parameters are important for evaluating shale gas resources, analyzing reservoir-forming mechanisms, and planning prospecting. The investigation results indicate that the three shale suites have a mean quartz content of more than 27% and a mean clay mineral content of less than 37.27%. Their sedimentary environment is euxinic. They passed through a telodiagenetic phase. The mean relative brittleness index of the samples from Qiongzhusi, Wufneg, and Longmaxi formations are 69.54, 67.33, and 60.44%, respectively. Such high relative brittleness indexes imply that the studied shale suites have good fracturability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","22","Geochronology","Brittleness - Energy resources - Fracture mechanics - Fracturing (fossil fuel deposits) - Minerals - Petroleum deposits - Plasticity - Shale - Shale gas","Brittleness index - Forming mechanism - Lower Paleozoic - Mineral composition - Quartz contents - Sedimentary environment - South sichuan - X ray structure analysis","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 511.1 Oil Field Production Operations - 512.1 Petroleum Deposits - 522 Gas Fuels - 525.1 Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Issues - 931.1 Mechanics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
