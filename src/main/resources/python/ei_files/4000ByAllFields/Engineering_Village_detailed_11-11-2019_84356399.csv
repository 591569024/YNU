The results indicate that there are differences between the variability and controlling factors of Pt concentration at large scale and middle-small scale.

The result shows that the average precipitation in past 50 years is 928.1 mm. The trend of precipitation is declining, and a mutation appears in 2009. Besides, precipitation has a dry and wet season in these region, and the wet season is between May and October but the dry season is between November and April of next year, There are more precipitation in the rainy season and less precipitation in dry season. The maximum of precipitation (184.0 mm) appears in July, but the minimum of precipitation (13.8 mm) appears in December. According to the wavelet analysis, the change of annual precipitation is about 22 years, the summer precipitation has a 19-day increase-decrease cycle with more precipitation and smaller variation, and the winter precipitation has a 20-day increase-decrease cycle with less precipitation and larger variation. The grey relational analysis show that the temperature and the specific humidity are dominant natural factors, and the population and the city size are dominant human factors.

ArcGIS and the big data platform of Baidu-Map API were also used to calculate fractal dimension, in order to identify the spatial structure of urban system. There are some findings discovered in this study. Firstly, the density of urban agglomeration in the middle of Yunnan Province is decreasing while taking Kunming as the center. The urban system has a large number of blanks in the coverage of the region, and the potential spatial development of urban agglomeration is huge. Secondly, the capacity dimension is much larger than the information dimension, which shows that the topography of Yunnan High-mountain and Flat-dam restricts the spatial distribution of the urban agglomeration in central Yunnan Province, and the urban agglomeration is still in the primary stage of development. Thirdly, the cow-crow dimension is generally low, showing that the urban agglomeration in central Yunnan Province is limited by natural factors such as topography and water system. The level of traffic correlation needs to be improved.

However, the exact annual output of biomass resources has not been statistically calculated. Through carefully collecting and recalculating data from 2000 to 2008 year, the accurate main crops straw yield of Yunnan were calculated by using the Straw to Product Ratio (RPR) coefficient of different crops in this paper. Yunnan produced some 23 million tons of crops straw per year. The three largest contributions to the total output of crops straw were from corn, sugarcane and rice, which amounted to 39%, 28% and 16% of the total crops straw respectively. This paper analyzed the present status of utilization of biomass in Yunnan and proposed that more than 60% of crops straw were burnt in the field at present, which has caused serious environmental pollution. There was still 19 million tons of biomass from agriculture, forestry and flower industry each year can be used as biomass energy resources, which was equivalent to about 9.5 million tons of standard coal, and can provide about 2.76 × 1014KJ biomass energy. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","12","Biomass","Coal industry - Crops - Energy resources - Forestry","Annual output - Bio-mass energy - Biomass energy resources - Biomass resources - Environmental pollutions - Present status - Product ratios - Yunnan province","913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 821.0 Woodlands and Forestry - 525.1 Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Issues - 524 Solid Fuels - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We use the fundamental mode of vibrations at two stations that are located on the same great circle as the focus to calculate an inter-station attenuation coefficient of the Rayleigh wave with periods between 0. 0 and 80. 64 s, and invert for the inter-station S-wave Q-factor (Qβ) at depths of 0-200 km. The results indicate that Qβin Yunnan is 20-140, presenting a low Qβbackground with apparent lateral variation. Taking the Honghe Fault as the boundary, Qβof the crust is only 20 on the west side, extending to a depth of 120 km. The distribution of Qβis consistent with large-scale Cenozoic volcanic and intrusive rocks in western Yunnan, implying that the crust and mantle are in the thermally active state. In the eastern Yunnan Block, east of the Xiaojiang Fault, Qβin the upper 120 km is 140 in the south but only 20 in the north. Additionally, around the Dukou-Chuxiong in the mid-Yunnan Block, Qβin the lithosphere is relatively high at 60-100, corresponding to a stiff crust. This is because the suture between the Indian and Eurasian plates reversed the tension in the rifting stage into the compression of orogenesis, leading to the closure of a gap in the crust. After some time, interstitial fluids gradually disappeared, resulting in a high velocity layer in the crust and low heat flow on the surface. The Yunnan region consists of an obvious block of elevated Qβ, distributed within the low background, consistent with the distribution of heat-flow values on the surface. The Honghe and Xiaojiang faults are tectonic boundaries in addition to being boundaries between regions of high and low crustal Qβ. The low Qβis probably the result of crustal rupture and disturbance caused by strong earthquakes and the upwelling of hot substances along the deep fault zones. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","36","Shear waves","Faulting - Heat transfer - Matched filters - Phase matching - Q factor measurement - Rayleigh waves - Signal processing - Structural geology - Surface waves - Volcanic rocks","Attenuation coefficient - Attenuation of surface waves - Interstitial fluids - Phase-matched filtering - S wave Q factors - Strong earthquakes - Tectonic boundaries - Yunnan region","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 703.2 Electric Filters - 713 Electronic Circuits - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 931.1 Mechanics - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",,"Number: U0933602, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 200808061, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Fundation of China (Grant No. U0933602), and Professional Projects of the Chinese Seismological Bureau (Grant No. 200808061).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The research results show that the magnetic anomalies are relatively weak in the Sanjiang (Three Rivers) and western Yunnan orogenic belts west of the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe, and Red River fault zones, and relatively strong in the rhombic block. The crustal magnetic anomalies in the study region were mainly generated by the shallow magnetic bodies superposed on the background of weak magnetism basement. The satellite magnetic anomalies show that the central Yunnan depression area has clear dipole field characteristics. The positive and negative magnetic anomaly zones distributed along the Red River fault zonet have consistent strikes with that of the faults. The Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault, the Red River fault, the Kangding-Yiliang-Shuicheng fault and the Mile-Shizong-Shuicheng fault zones surrounding the rhombic block are transition belts between strong and weak magnetic anomalies. The places with active seismicity and the areas with high terrestrial heat flow values have negative or relatively weak crustal magnetic anomalies. © 2017, Science Press.

China's installed hydropower capacity is not only the highest in the world; it also shows a globally unique dimension in growth and dynamic. The southwestern province of Yunnan has one of the highest hydropower potentials within China. Its development makes the province one of the key suppliers of electric energy in China, supplying the economic and energy hungry load centers of coastal China but also Southeast Asia. In a decade Yunnan will have an installed hydropower capacity that exceeds that of Canada or the United States. The province is therefore often referred to as China's forthcoming (hydro-) powerhouse or as Asia's battery. Yunnan's rapid development is mainly based on large and prestigious hydropower projects along major rivers, often forming large reservoirs. Secondly it rests on centers of small hydropower development. They are based on small (sub-)catchments where SHP stations mostly form cascades of diversion type projects affecting entire watersheds. Both developments are creating hydroscapes. While Yunnan's large scale hydropower development is relatively well studied, there is an obvious research gap on Yunnan's small hydropower sector. But the latter has not only a huge relevance it also causes serious tangible cumulative implications. This rapid expansion of Yunnan's hydropower sector takes place in one of the most biologically, geographically and ethnically diverse regions in China. This creates a large need for careful management in order to avoid potentially significant environmental and social conflicts. Therefore the article shows the current status of Yunnan's ambitious hydropower development program including its political frame. It critically analyses the environmental and socio-economic consequences of both large and small hydropower projects. It further describes the transboundary implications and the relevance of the power grid. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","49","Economic and social effects","Catchments - Economics - Electric power transmission - Electric power transmission networks - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants","Environmental implications - Hydro-power development - Hydropower potential - Hydropower projects - Large dams - Small hydro power - Socio-economic consequences - Yunnan/China","611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: -, Acronym: DFG, Sponsor: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Number: -, Acronym: DFG, Sponsor: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Number: U1202232, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013BAB06B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research was supported by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China , No. U1202232 , by the National Key Technologies R&D Program of China during the 12th Five-Year Plan Period , No. 2013BAB06B03 , as well as by the DFG (German Research Foundation) .

The results show that, East edge of Sichuan-Yunnan block: Xianshuihe fault, Anninghe fault, Zemuhe fault, Xiaojiang fault have intense activity, and the movement of the faults are given priority to left-lateral strike-slip. Honghe fault is still in the weak deformation area and the middle section of the Honghe fault zone is the maximum shear strain rate region, while the shear deformation in the northwest and southeast segment of the Honghe fault is higher, which deserves further attention. After Wenchuan earthquake, due to the adjustment of regional stress field and strain redistribution, the activity of the Anning river fault zone is relatively small, easing gradually, and the sliding component has the obvious tendency of slowing down, and the blocking depth of the Anning river fault zone has increased to a certain extent. With the south of the material, the speed of the south segment of the Xiaojiang fault is slowed down and the locking depth increases. GPS velocity profile in parallel to the fault direction of the Xiaojiang fault line shows that the deformation of the fault zone is smooth and the deformation scale is large, showing that there are strong blocking phenomenon. After the Ludian earthquake, the strain release of Zhaotong and Lianfeng fault zone was not significant, compression strain and shear deformation accumulation of Zhaotong-lianfeng is weakening, may indicate that the compressive strain accumulating background is higher. © 2017, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

Our results indicate the precipitation indices showed spatially complex trends. Most precipitation indices present increasing trends in western Yunnan and decreasing trends in eastern Yunnan. The western, southern and central regions experienced an increase in consecutive dry days (CDDs) and decrease in consecutive wet days (CWDs). In addition, a widespread increase was also found in precipitation intensity over Yunnan. On a region-wide scale, a weak decrease was observed in total precipitation, accompanied by an increase in precipitation intensity. CDDs tended to be prolonged while the CWDs tended to be shortened. The days with precipitation amounts totaling more than 10mm and maximum 5-day precipitation amount had decreasing but not significant trends. In contrast, insignificant increases were found for the maximum 1-day precipitation and annual total precipitation exceeding 95th and 99th percentiles. The contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation increased during 1960-2012. Overall, occurrences of extreme precipitation are more concentrated in time. The weakening of the Asian summer monsoon strength and local topography had contribution to the variations of extreme precipitation over Yunnan. However, the forcing mechanisms are very complicated and need to be studied in subsequent work. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","57","Precipitation (meteorology)","Climatology - Earth atmosphere","China - Daily precipitations - Extreme precipitation - Trend analysis - Yunnan province","443 Meteorology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The diversity of mineralization, an objective reflection of mineralization, is a mixed product of the evolutions of both interior and exterior influences, such as the mineral sources, minerogenetic environment, factors controlling mineralization and others. In eastern Yunnan province, there was stable sedimentary block from Sinian Period, which is available to form the sedimentary ore deposits and the strata-bound ore deposits. Many strata, from upper Proterozoic Subera to Pleistocene Epoch, were found to pay rocks in this area, in which mineral resources hosted in sedimentary rocks include: Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Au, Mo, Ni, V, U, REO, PGE, bauxite, phosphorus, barite, gypsum, peat, coal, diatomite, refractory, and so on. In this paper, we discuss the diversity of mineralization in eastern Yunnan province, and get some parameters of it, such as Ra (resources available) of 82.86%, Rp (resources potential) of 17.14%, and regional maps of Di (diversity intensity) and ID (index of diversity intensity).

This study provides results of petrological and geochemical characteristics of the Cenozoic shoshonitic volcanic rocks, aiming to offer some food to thoughts related to volcanism and mantle-crust interation induced by to the continental collision between India and Asia plates. Results showed that Cenozoic shoshonitic basalts from this area have relatively high and variable alkali contents (2.94%-8.23%), and are rich in potassium (average K2O/Na2O of 21 samples is 1.26). They are classified as shoshonitic basalts or basanite. They are enriched in both light rare earth elements (LREE) and large ion lithophile elements (LILE), and distribution patterns in the chondrite-normalized diagram and primitive-normalized spidergram collectively resemble the pattern of OIB. The shoshonitic basalts contain abundant mantle-derived xenoliths and xenocrysts, and are poorly crystallized with very low contents of phenocrysts, and have considerably high abundance of compatible elements such as Ni, implying that the Cenozoic basaltic rocks of Maguan area are representatives of primary magma derived from mantle sources. The relatively low Mg#of rocks, ranging from 0.49 to 0.72, can either be ascribed to the intrinsic characteristics of the source region or to the mixing of crust and mantle materials in the source region, which needs to be further studied. The Cenozoic shoshonitic basalts formed in a within-plate tectonic setting, the petrogenesis of which is related to the lateral extrusion of asthenospheric mantle along the southeastern of Tibetan plateau induced by the Indo-Asia collision.","47","Basalt","Exploratory geochemistry - Geochemistry - Petrology - Rare earths - Tectonics - Transport properties","Cenozoic potassic basalts - Continental collisions - Geochemical characteristic - Intrinsic characteristics - Large ion lithophile elements - Light rare earth elements - Maguan area of yunnan provinces - Tectonic settings","481 Geology and Geophysics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, we investigated the seed dynamics of canopy and soil seed banks in this species, as well as the resulting fate of seed in different locations. We found few seeds on the soil surface, and virtually no viable seed within the soil. In serotinous populations, the size of the seed bank was 20 times greater than that of non-serotinous populations. The number of seeds stored on the forest floor was considerably lower than the number input by seed rain. Almost all seeds on the floor lost viability within 17 months, and most died during the rainy season. Seed mortality in the canopy was considerably lower than either on or in the soil. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that serotiny enhances the size of the P. yunnanensis seed bank and that in this species, serotiny has an adaptive advantage over soil seed storage in Central Yunnan. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","43","Soils","Floors","Adaptive advantage - Forest floors - Pinus - Rainy seasons - Seedbank - Serotiny - Soil seed bank - Yunnan , China","402 Buildings and Towers - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics",,"Number: 31160092, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31260111, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31770450, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for helpful comments and suggestions, Boqiang Huang and Dongfang Huo for field and laboratory assistance, Prof. Cindy Q.

After a long period of destructive exploitation including agriculture development, overlogging for timber and cutting for fuelwood, these forests are being allowed to reestablish themselves. A large area is now dominated by the conifer Pinus yunnanensis forest which has naturally regenerated and represents an early intermediate stage in the reestablishment of the evergreen broad-leaved forest. In 2006, a mega-fire burned approximately 18.49km2of this forest. The Pinus is growing back. To examine the process of regeneration dynamics and recovery of the Pinus community after the mega-fire, we investigated plant communities in burned and unburned areas, including a P. yunnanensis shrubland regenerated after the fire, a P. yunnanensis forest without fire occurrence, a P. yunnanensis and Lithocarpus mairei mixed forest, and a Castanopsis orthacantha and Lithocarpus dealbatus evergreen broad-leaved forest, as well as a plantation of P. yunnanensis. Abundant seedlings and saplings of P. yunnanensis and some light-demanding deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved tree species were found in the Pinus shrubland five years after the fire. The frequency distribution by height-classes after the fire was of an inverse-J type, representing very good regeneration. We used space-for-time substitution to obtain an understanding of the directions and pathways of the succession. The approximate successional trend in the area was from the Pinus shrubland to the Pinus forest, then to the mixed coniferous and evergreen broad-leaved Pinus-Lithocarpus forest, then to the evergreen broad-leaved Castanopsis-Lithocarpus forest. In the early successional stage, the floristic richness and species diversity of the Pinus shrubland had lower values as compared to those in the middle and late successional stages, but much higher than those of the Pinus plantation. Our results indicate that the natural recovery of P. yunnanensis after the fire was more efficient than that of a man-made forest of the same species.

It was found that the mean content of Ti, V, Cr, Mo, Co, Ni, Y, and Zr is higher than the national average. The occurrence of Mn, Ni, and Co in the different coalfields is distinctly different. Most of the enriched transition metal elements exist mainly as inorganic minerals. In the Zhina coalfield, Co, Ni, and Nb are primarily associated with sulfur. Mn, Cs, and Mo are mostly sulfides. Almost all Co was organic and a significant part of the Ni is also organic in the Liupanshui coalfield. Cs, Co, and Ni are related to sulfur in the coal taken from eastern Yunnan. Carbonate is the main form of Mn in the coal from eastern Yunnan and the Liupanshui coalfield. Ti is the oxide in the coal samples where Ti is enriched. Zr is in the form of zircon in the samples where Zr is enriched. The situation for most of the transition metal elements is consistent with terrestrial genesis. Coal seams are universally influenced by the sea. The strongly seawater effected peat bog with a reductive and alkaline environment favors the relative enrichment of Mn. A reducing environment is conducive to transition metal element enrichment. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of China University of Mining & Technology.","20","Trace elements","Coal - Coal deposits - Cobalt - Geochemistry - Mass spectrometry - Molybdenum compounds - Nickel - Seawater effects - Silicate minerals - Sulfur - Sulfur compounds - Titanium oxides - Zircon - Zirconium","East Yunnan - Geochemical - Guizhou - Late Permian - Transition metal elements","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 524 Solid Fuels - 548.1 Nickel - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 40730422, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40730422 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Targeted poverty alleviation stratagem which aimed to fully eliminating regional overall poverty in 2020 was put into practice since 2013 in China. Since then, it achieved huge success and the number of people living in extreme poverty reduced sharply in China. But absolute poverty still existed in rural, for the increasing development disparity on account of regional variation; the urban-rural gap was prominent. According to research on rural poverty influencing factors, we found that it had significant differences at different areas and different scales, and lacked a common understanding. For it rarely thought about spatial effects of regional rural poverty for those current existing research on rural poverty influencing factors, it was necessary to study rural poverty influencing factors further. This paper analyzed spatial pattern of rural poverty and main influencing factors on county scale, by applying spatial econometric model and GIS spatial analysis based on the field trip and statistical data which including 15 factors that might influence rural poverty potentially for all of 129 counties in Yunnan province from 2010 to 2015, which intended to providing the theory basis for the formulation and implementation of scientific and effective regional macroscopic poverty reduction policy, and improving poverty reduction that combining poverty status and regional differences even more. This study carried out poverty alleviation and development zoning in Yunnan province, and proposed discrepant policy of regional rural poverty reduction. Results showed that: 1) The number of rural poverty population decreased year by year in Yunnan province, but which was still a high incidence area for rural poverty in China. Rural poverty demonstrated a 'center-periphery-edge' pattern which corresponded to low, medium and high poverty among the 129 counties in Yunnan. High poverty areas were concentrated on the northwest, northeast, southeast and south of Yunnan, which involved Jinsha river reaches, Lancang river valley, Nujiang river valley and Red river basin. 2) Regression results of spatial lag model (SLM) showed that the significant influencing factors which affected county rural poverty included terrain relief, traffic distance to municipal government, illiterate rate of population at 15 years old and above of rural, number of hospital beds per thousand people, rate of elderly population at 65 years old and above of rural in Yunnan for the past few years. The regression coefficients of the five significant influencing factors were 0.005, 0.044, 0.380, -1.257 and -2.132 respectively. It produced positive effects on rural poverty for factors of terrain relief, traffic distance to municipal government, illiteracy rate at 15 years old and above of rural in Yunnan province, and the other two factors produced negative effects. 3) Rural poverty had regional differences in Yunnan. In terms of poverty degree and major factors of poverty influencing, Yunnan province was divided into 6 poverty reduction areas which were high poverty area at northwest of Yunnan, high poverty area at northeast of Yunnan, medium-high poverty area at west frontier of Yunnan, medium poverty area at west of Yunnan, high poverty area at southeast of Yunnan and low poverty area at central area of Yunnan. Poverty reduction should be accurately implemented according to regional poverty and major factors of poverty influencing, and strengthened the join forces between adjacent counties to consolidate results of poverty reduction in Yunnan. The spatial effect is an important part of regional rural poverty research, and can provide references for scientific and rational policy setting of regional poverty reduction. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Knowing of the R factor facilitates the prediction of soil erosion and of the impact of climate change on erosion. However, defining of the R factor is challenging because its spatiotemporal variation can be complex. We combined the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), North criteria, and Mann-Kendall test (M-K) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the R factor for a study area in a typical mountain plateau region of Yunnan Province (YP), China. Daily rainfall records from 1960 to 2012 were collected from 115 national meteorological observation stations in YP. Based on the daily rainfall erosivity estimating model, we determined that the average annual R factor was 4383.85 MJ·mm·ha− 1·h− 1, the seasonal R factor exhibited an order of summer > autumn > spring > winter, and the summer R was significantly higher than winter R. The spatiotemporal variation of the R factor was complex and did not reveal a uniform pattern. The spatial distribution revealed that the annual and seasonal R factors in the west were higher than those in the east, and R in the south were higher than those in the north. The temporal trends of annual, summer, and autumn R factors had decreasing trends from 1960 to 2012. On the contrary, the spring and winter R factors showed an increasing trend. The EOF analysis identified two typical spatiotemporal patterns of the annual R factor in YP, and three for spring, summer, autumn, and winter R factors. These patterns represented the influence of the monsoon, circulation systems, and complex terrain conditions on the rainfall in the YP. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","90","Orthogonal functions","Climate change - Erosion - Rain - Soils","Daily rainfall records - Empirical Orthogonal Function - Meteorological observation stations - Rainfall erosivity - Soil erosion - Spatio-temporal variation - Spatiotemporal patterns - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 41401614, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41561063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013BAB06B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (Grant number: 41561063 , 41301099 and 41401614 ), National Science and Technology Support Program ( 2013BAB06B03 ), and the Department of Water Resources of YP : Water Science and Technology Project.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The difference of Yunnan Out-of-Print woodcut printing from ordinary printing is that carving alternates with printing in cycles to produce multi-color printings, and all colors are printed just out of one block which is recarved for each color. This is a complex process and requires high technical skills. We propose an image stylization method for Yunnan out-of-print woodcut through virtual carving and printing. First, image segmentation is applied to isolate areas for carving. In each segmented region, scores collected from real woodcut are placed to simulate the carving process. We introduce an algorithm to automate the placement according to the image feature. In the printing process, we mainly focus on the simulation of the mixture of oil paint and the special effect of random color blending in Yunnan out-of-print woodcut. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","12","Image segmentation","Color - Color printing - E-learning - Printing presses","Complex Processes - Image stylizations - Multi-color printing - Printing process - Segmented regions - Stylization - Virtual carving - Yunnan out-of-print woodcut","741.1 Light/Optics - 745.1 Printing - 745.1.1 Printing Equipment",,"Number: 61163019, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61540062, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61271361, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FA021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by NSFC projects (No. 61163019, No. 61540062, No. 61271361), Key project of Yunnan applied basic research program (No. 2014FA021), and Digital Media Technology Key Laboratory of Universities in Yunnan.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Yunnan province, the congruity area of undeveloped region with high vehicle population increasing, as well as special natural conditions, was taken as the study area. We estimated the vehicle emissions during 2003–2015 with COPERT IV model, including private cars (PC), buses (BUS), light duty vehicles (LDV) and heavy duty trucks (HDT), then analyzed the vehicle emission characteristics, involving CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, Volatile organic compounds (VOC), Ambient Air Non-Methane Volatile Organic compound (NMVOC), CH4, PM2.5, PM10, PM (exhaust), Cadmium and Zinc. The results indicated that all pollutants as well as heavy metals were increased at different growth trends except SO2 although more stringent emission standard implementation, the rising of vehicle population become the main contributor to the vehicle emission growth, and CO2 emission was the major vehicle emissions accounted for one third of total CO2 emissions in Yunnan. PC was the main contributor to the rising of CO, VOC, NMVOC, CH4, NH3, CO2, Cadmium and Zinc, which was also the major vehicle growth type; HDT and LDV brought to the emissions of N2O, NOx, NO, PM10, NO2, PM2.5, and PM (exhaust) respectively.

Systemically petrological and geochemical studies of the host rocks and their xenoliths show that they can be classified into three groups, basanlte and ultrapotassic rocks as cements of volcanic breccia rocks, and spinel mantle peridotite which can be further divided into two groups. The one is primitive peridotite which stands for residues of highly melted primitive mantle, and the other one is metasomatied peridotite which origins from depleted mantle and contaminates with slab fluid. Besides, an altersted basicultrabasic rock, whose protolith is not known still, and some metamorphic xenoliths are discovered. They develop black opaque materials and various alterations, such as chloritization, carbonatation, serpentinization and uralitization, companied by metalliferous mineralization and sulfidization. The geochemical similarities of altersted basic-ultrabasic rock, metamorphic xenoliths and metasomatied peridotite suggests that mantle fluid from lateral asthenosperic mantle flow resulted by collision and subduction of India-Eurasia initiates alterations, and contaminated with slab fluid, which makes the mantle fluid change from melt of high temperature to hydrothermal fluid of relative low temperature. The mechanism of alkaline magma and mantle fluid can be manifested metalliferous mineralization and sulfidization in microcosmic, and have something to do with polymetal ores related to alkaline porphyry and long-distance middle-low hydrothermal deposits. So, studies of volcanic breccia rocks, basanlte and mantle xenoliths are of great significance for deep mineralization principles at western Yunnan Province. © 2011 IEEE.","8","Volcanic rocks","Geochemistry - Metamorphic rocks - Mineralogy - Ore deposits - Ores - Petrology - Remote sensing - Temperature - Volcanoes","Element geochemistries - Maguan, Yunnan - Mantle fluids - Mantle xenoliths - Metamorphic xenolith","481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 641.1 Thermodynamics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The factor analysis, geostatistics and multifractal S-A filtering method are applied in this paper to quantitatively extract and estimate the Pt-Cu-Au mineralization anomalies from the complicated geological background. The research shows that: (1) The results of factor analysis illustrate that there are three element associations existing in eastern Yunnan area: Factor I (Cu-Pd-Co-Pt-V-Cr-Ni), which characterizes the element association of the Permian Er'meishan basalt occurred in the Yangtz block, Similarly; factor II (Sb-As-U-Mo), which characterizes the carbonaceous sediment formation occurred in the South China fold system and factor III (Pb-Ag-Zn-W-Zn-As-Au), which represents the hydrothermal mineralization with the base metal mineralization as the typification; (2) The semivariation analysis illustrates that the concentrations of Pt, Cu and Au are continuous in NE trend (9°-18.6°) and the maximal ranges are about 95 km. The geochemical maps obtained by the universal Kringing imply that the concentration distributions of Pt, Cu and Au are mainly controlled by the faults and magmatism; (3) The multifractal S-A filtering method characterizes the detailed information of local mineralization and extracts the conceal mineralization information. The anomaly maps delineated by the S-A method may provide important evidence for Pt-Cu-Au targeting; (4) Different geological and ore-forming problems can be solved by different geomathematic methods. The linear geomathematic methods such as the factor analysis and geostatistics can be used to explore the regional ore-forming background and the regional spatial variability of the ore-forming elements and the element associations, while the nonlinear geomathematic methods such as S-A method are efficient in extracting the local ore-forming information. These methods are of benefit to the concealed ore-forming anomaly information extraction.","42","Factor analysis","Antimony compounds - Copper - Copper alloys - Extraction - Fractals - Geology - Information filtering - Lead compounds - Mineral exploration - Mineralogy - Multivariant analysis - Ore analysis - Ore treatment - Ores - Platinum alloys - Platinum compounds - Platinum metals - Silver compounds - Ternary alloys - Zinc compounds","Concentration distributions - Eastern Yunnan - Geo-statistics - Geological background - Hydrothermal mineralization - Mineralization anomaly - Quantitative extraction - S-A method","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921 Mathematics - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Zircon U-Pb dating, geochemistry and petrology of the xenoliths were studied to assess the petrogenetic origin and geodynamic setting of these high-Mg volcanic rocks in this paper. The high-Mg volcanic xenoliths are porphyritic texture and contain only large phenocrysts of olivine, which show as dense mass, develop as lenticulars in the Permian Emeishan basalts in Jianshui area, Southeast Yunnan. The igneous zircons from the volcanic xenoliths yield a weighted age of ca. 259±2 Ma that is interpreted to be the formation age of the magmatic protolith, which is the same as the host rocks of the Emeishan basalts. The volcanic xenoliths are characterized by low SiO2, moderate TiO2 and high Mg#. All the volcanic xenoliths are enriched in LREE but depleted in HREE. The geochemical characteristics of the xenoliths show that they belong to sub-alkali basalts and intra-plate tholeiitic basalts, suggesting that the primary magma of the high-Mg volcanic rock is likely produced by low partial melting of garnet lherzolite. The original magma may have undergone the process of fractional crystallization of olivines and clinopyroxenes. The original magma has not been affected obviously by crustal material contamination in the emplacement and uplifting. The high-Mg volcanic xenoliths may origin from riched-mantle and may be the product of the main stage of the mantle plume activity. All above indicates that there was a mantle branch developed in the study area in Late Permian. It is proposed that several mantle branches have not only ascending motion but also lateral movement while the thermal melting mantle plume arrives at the boundary of mantle and crust. © 2019, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

The objectives of this study are to (1) construct a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database of toponyms in Yunnan from a comprehensive toponymical dictionary series of China, and identify their ethnic roots; (2) enhance the mapping of their spatial patterns and detect possible clusters of ethnic toponyms by spatial analysis methods; (3) analyze the association of multiethnic toponyms with geographic factors by statistical methods; and (4) examine the historical evolution of toponyms. The results show that the highest concentrations of Zang-Mian (Tibeto-Burman) toponyms are in the northwestern and the northeastern mountainous areas, and Zhuang-Dong (Kam-Tai) toponyms cluster in the southwest and the southeast lowlands. In comparison to Han (Chinese majority) toponyms, the Zhuang-Dong toponyms also tend to be closer to rivers and in more remote areas (i.e., farther from major transportation routes and major cities). The centrographic method helps reveal the historical trend of gradual expansion of Han settlement in Yunnan as recorded in the time stamp of toponyms.

This paper presents the paleofloral assemblage from the top of Xuanwei and the lower of the Kayitou Formations in western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan, China. Fossil plants in this area (Annularia shirakii, Lobatannularia sp., Paracalamites stenocostatus, Gigantopteris sp., Pecopteris sp., which are all the Permian relicts) from the bottom of the Kayitou Formation described by other people in 1970s are covered. In addition, many important new fossil plants in the evolution during the Permiansic interval, such as Isoetes Annalepis (including A. zeilleri, A. brevicystis), Peltaspermacae Peltaspermum (including P. martinsii, P. lobutalum, P. sp.), Lepidodendron and Stigmaria and so on are also reported. Both the new type and the 'Gigantopteris-flora' relicts are characterized with the Early Triassic Induan paleofloral features in South China. This paleofloral assemblage contains 31 species in 14 genera. These fossil plants are in association with an early Lower Triassic marine fauna (Bivalves, Ostracods, Brachiopods and Ammonites). So the geological age of this paleoflora is Early Triassic Induan stage, while the FAD of Annalepis is regarded as the marker, representing the beginning of Triassic. Based on analyzing paleoflora and limnology of the top of Xuanwei and the lower of Kayitou Formations, it is concluded that tropical and humid conditions persisted in western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan throughout the Permian and Earliest Triassic.","25","Animals","Stratigraphy","FAD of Annalepis - Paleoclimates - Paleoflora - Triassic - Western guizhou and eastern yunnan","481.1 Geology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The depth of the hypocenter is 10 km. The study area is seismically active in history and prone to earthquake in northwestern Yunnan. Then the focal mechanism solutions show that the Diqing Ms5.9 earthquake is of normal faulting with dextral strike-slip and the attitude of the NW nodal plane is consistent to the Deqin-Zhongdian fault. In this paper, we discuss the bouguer anomaly near the epicenter using EIGEN-6C2 model, and the epicenter is located at the Moho depth undulating position, and place where the crustal thickness is unstable. From the profile of P wave velocity and crustal structure, we know that low-velocity layer exists at the bottom of the upper crust, and the layer is likely to be closely related to seismic energy accumulating and storing. The joint location of the edge of the low-velocity (high conductivity) layer and the Deqin-Zhongdian fractures is the location for the focus to release the accumulating energy.

Three-times background deliminated data are recognized as simple fractal. Hence, fractal analysis in the studied area also indicates four Cu distributions formed in different geological processes and with different mechanisms. In combination with geological settings, the four peaks in histogram and four distributions indicated by fractal analysis might be matched to four geological processes in the studied area with different mechanisms, although not one to one.

The geochemical mechanism of adsorption was discussed. The results show that CS2extraction changes the adsorptivity of coals and the change direction and magnitude are controlled by the coalification degree. The extraction reduces contents of hydrocarbon generating and oxygen-containing functional groups in extracted coals, and the reduce magnitude also depends on the coalifcation degree. The second coalification jump plays a key role in the changes of the adsorptivity and the contents of functional groups. There is a synchronous response between the adsorptivity and the D-value of functional group contents of extracted coals. The adsorptivity of extracted coals is enhanced by extracted non-polar molecules like alkanes and aromatics and weakened by extracted polar molecules like nonhydrocarbons and asphaltenes. The CS2extraction induced variation in contents of the two functional groups is the fundamental reason of the adsorptivity change under the control of coalifcation degree. ©, 2015, China University of Mining and Technology.

However, energy consumption in rural households relies mainly on straw (12.15%), firewood (41%), and coal (38.5%). This pattern of energy consumption has been imposing pressure on the environment, water resources and soil in recent years with the rapid growth of Yunnan's economy. This paper reports the achievements in Yunnan's rural energy development in the past two decades. Issues of the greatest concern and interest, which are unfavorable for further development of rural energy, have been identified, and a new proposal of developing green rural energy in Yunnan is suggested based on its economy and resource conditions. The proposal addresses the development of biogas, small hydropower and solar energy, which are abundant in Yunnan. It is estimated that the new program will annually bring direct benefits of about 5 billion yuan to farmers by 2010, and the indirect benefits, such as those from tourism due to the improvement of the environment resulting from the use of green rural energy, will be enormous. It is believed that the program will speed up rural economic growth through the integrated utilization of rural energy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Sn-Cu polymetallic system of mineralization in the area includes Sn-W greisen-quartz vein type, Cu-massive-sulfide cassiterite type, Cu-Sn altered-basic-rock type, and Sn-Pb-Zn vein types of deposits. The study of the relationship between the tectono-magmatic evolution and the Gejiu system of mineralization shows that Sn-Cu polymetal enrichment occurred in and near the contact zone between granite and wall rock through contact metamorphism, metasomatic and filling processes, when the composite granites invaded into folded limestones of Middle Triassic (Gejiu Formation). These metals may come from two reservoirs, i.e. granitic magma originated from the middle-lower crust in the Yenshan period and basalt-diabase-gabbro from the mantle in the Indo-Chinese period. Pulsatory magmatic activities are believed to be the main driving force for the formation of the hydrothermal system for the ore-forming progress. A regional model of mineralization is proposed in this study for assisting mineral exploration and prediction for new types of mineral deposits in this area.","23","Tin alloys","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Copper compounds - Deposits - Economic geology - Granite - Lead alloys - Lime - Mineral exploration - Mineral resources - Mineralogy - Ores - Reservoirs (water) - Sulfur compounds - Ternary alloys - Tungsten alloys - Zinc alloys","Contact metamorphism - Hydrothermal system - Magmatic activity - Magmatic evolution - Magmatisms - Southeast Yunnan - Tectonic settings - Type of mineralization","441.2 Reservoirs - 481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 543.5 Tungsten and Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546 Lead, Tin, Zinc, Antimony and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the substantial fear of the damaging due to the freezing of collectors has apparently hampered their popularization in the areas with cold winters, even in the areas with mild winters. Just like a water pipe, one approach to the anti-freezing of collectors is to make the water inside the collectors flow. For a thermosyphonic SDHWS, this can be achieved by appropriate measures which make the systems produce thermosyphonic or reverse circulation. The object of this study is to investigate the temperature depression of collector absorbers at nights and the feasibility to employ reverse flow of thermosyphonic SDHWS for anti-freezing under climatic conditions of Yunnan, China.","3","Freezing","Dust collectors - Hot water distribution systems - Office buildings - Solar collectors - Solar energy - Water pipelines","Climatic conditions - Flat-plate collector - Reliable performance - Reverse circulation - Solar domestic hot water systems - Temperature depression - Water heating - Yunnan , China","402.2 Public Buildings - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The three new genera (Psarolepis, Achonoichthys and Styloichthys) are assigned to Porolepiformes based on cranial and lower jaw features. The three forms are characterized by the unique dermal ornamentation pattern and the lateral pillar flanking the lateral cranial wall and the lateral wall of the notochordal pit. Psarolepis and Achonoichthys differ from porolepiforms in the toothed median rostral, absence of frontal pit-line on the fronto-ethmoidal shield and absence of a ventral or ventro-lateral endoskeletal opening of the nasal capsule. Styloichthys resembles Youngolepis in many respects but differs from it in the dermal ornamentation and in the presence of the lateral pillar. The new forms provide new information for studying the morphology of the choana and external nasal openings, median rostral and premaxilla, internasal cavity, palatoquadrate articulation, suborbital ledge, lateral pillar, basicranial muscle and intracranial joint. These forms reveal character correlations between the size of the internasal cavity, position of the endoskeletal opening of the nasal capsule, size and development of the premaxilla and degree of downward bending of the snout. Such characters may be used to explain a close relationship between porolepiforms and dipnoans. The cladistic analysis using PAUP (version 2.4) produced two shortest trees, each of 123 steps and with a consistency index (CI) of 0.626. The two trees differ only in the positions of Coelacanthiformes and Struniiformes. In the consensus tree, Psarolepis, Achonoichthys and Styloichthys form a sister group to Porolepiformes (s.s.) plus Youngolepis and Powichthys. Together, this more inclusive clade constitutes Porolepiformes (s.l.). Diabolepis forms the sister group of the Dipnoi and together they constitute Dipnoi (s.l.). The consensus tree unites porolepiforms (s.l.) and dipnoans (s.l.) and regards osteolepiforms as most closely related to tetrapods. Osteolepiformes form a paraphyletic group in the sense that tetrapods are not formally included. Osteolepiforms and tetrapods together form a monophyletic group, the Choanata. Rhipidistians turn out to be a polyphyletic group and should no longer be regarded as a valid taxonomic unit.

Situational analysis, as an important foundation for the optimization of land use, needs to focus on the impact of climate factors and socio-economic factors. In this paper, the Markov model and the DLS (Simulation of Land System Dynamics) model are combined for the first time, and the land use pattern in 2020 is simulated based on the data of land use in 2000 and 2010 as well as the climate, soil, topography and socio-economic factors of Yunnan Province. In his paper, we took Yunnan Province as the case study area, and selected 12 driving factors by logistic regression method, then the land use demands and layout of Yunnan Province in 2020 has been forecasted and simulated under business as usual (BAU) scenario and farmland protection (FP) scenario and the changes in ecosystem service value has been calculated. The result shows that: (1) after the regression analysis and ROC (Relative Operating Characteristics) test, the 12 factors selected in this paper have a strong ability to explain the land use change in Yunnan Province. (2) Under the two scenarios, the significant reduction of arable land area is a common feature of land use change in Yunnan Province in the future, and its main land use type will be construction land. However, under FP scenario, the current situation where construction land encroach on arable land will be improved. Compared with the change from 2000 to 2010, the trend of arable land, forest land, water area, construction land and unused land will be the same under the two scenarios, whereas the change trend of grassland was opposite. (3) From 2000 to 2020, the value of ecosystem services in Yunnan Province is on the rise, but the ecosystem service value under FP scenario is higher than that of the ecosystem services under BAU scenario. In general, land use in 2020 in Yunnan Province continues the pattern of 2010, but there are also significant spatial differences. Under the BAU scenario, the construction land is mainly in the south of Lijiang City and the northeastern part of Kunming. Under the FP scenario, the new construction land is concentrated near the Lashi dam in northern Yunnan Province, and the high-quality arable land in the valley will be better protected. The research results can provide reference for the optimization of land use pattern in Yunnan Province, and provide scientific basis for land use management and planning. Based on the value of ecosystem services, we should implement the policy of strict protection of arable land, both to ensure food supply and promote the healthy development of ecological environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","45","Land use","Climate change - Climate models - Dynamic light scattering - Economics - Ecosystems - Factor analysis - Food supply - Forestry - Markov processes - Regression analysis","Ecosystem service values - Ecosystem services - Logistic regression method - Markov model - Relative operating characteristics - Spatial patterns - Value of ecosystem services - Yunnan province","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 741.1 Light/Optics - 822.3 Food Products - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: 71363061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71363061 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Typical fractal models, including P-A and box-counting methods, have also been used for such kind of studies. Basalts from seven sections in Laochang deposit, Yunnan Province, are well developed, but their forming processes and their contributions to deposits of Sn and other metals are still in issue. Based on the GIS-based P-A and box-counting fractal models, this paper focuses on the size distribution and irregularity analysis of pyrrhotites of the basalts. Three parameters DA (fractal dimension of area), DPA (fractal dimension of area and perimeter) and DP (fractal dimension of perimeter) of pyrrhotite are calculated. The results show that, from the first-section basalt to the seventh-section basalt, with the depth of rock body increasing, the values of DA and DP change a little, but the value of DPA shows an increasing trend. This indicates that the shapes of pyrrhotites become more and more irregular as the depth increases, probably due to the increase of temperature and pressure.","18","Fractal dimension","Basalt - Deposits - Iron ores - Sedimentary rocks - Textures","Box-counting - Box-counting method - Fractal model - Micro texture - Temperature and pressures - Three parameters - Yunnan , China - Yunnan province","482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Methods: Total melanoidins from medium roasted arabica were extracted by hot water extraction method, and then were fractionated into three fractions: > 100 kDa (M1), 10-100 kDa (M2) and 3) by ultrafiltration. The antioxidant capacity of four samples was determined by hydroxyl radical scavenging, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and total reducing power assays. The effects of the total melanoidins at different concentrations on body mass, body fat content, blood lipid levels, body fat ratio, adipose tissue morphology and liver tissue morphology in a rat model of high-fat dietinduced obesity were determined. Results: All melanoidin samples had antioxidant activity varying with molecular mass at identical concentrations. The total melanoidins at all doses reduced body mass and body fat content in the obese rats. Histological examination showed that the liver tissue structure in the melanoidin treated rats at medium and high doses remained intact, accompanied by homogeneous hepatocytes and cytoplasm as well as clear nuclei. In addition to being intact and orderly arranged, the hepatocytes of the high-dose treated rats were smaller than those of the model group. Conclusion: The total melanoidins and three fractions from Yunnan grown arabica all had strong antioxidant capacity. The total melanoidins had an antiobesity effect by inhibiting body mass gain and reducing fat accumulation in the liver and consequently protecting the liver. © 2019, China Food Publishing Company.

In the weighted weights of evidence model, an adjustment of weight of evidence is made to reduce the influence of correlation among evidence layers. In the stepwise model, each evidence layer is added into the logistic model as if a single layer whose weight can be calculated by using the previously calculated posterior probability as a new prior probability. These two models are compared with other models through a case study of calculating posterior probability maps for Sn-Cu mineral deposits in Gejiu, Yunnan, China. The result shows that both models are effective to reduce the influence of correlations among evidence layers on delineation of Sn-Cu anomalies.","15","Tin alloys","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Mineral resources - Probability","Conditional independences - Logit modeling - Mineral potential mappings - Posterior probability - Prior probability - Weight of evidences - Weights of evidences - Yunnan province","544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
