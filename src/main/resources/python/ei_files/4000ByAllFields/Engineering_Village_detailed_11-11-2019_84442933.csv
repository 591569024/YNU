Virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water-scarce regions, while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water-rich regions. In this study, Yunnan, a typical province in southwest China, was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socio-economic development in the context of water sustainability. Both input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on Yunnan's water footprint for the period of 2002–2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level. Results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress, Yunnan's total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion. From the sectoral perspective, sectors with large water footprints include construction sector, agriculture sector, food manufacturing & processing sector, and service sector, while metal products sector and food manufacturing & processing sector were the major virtual water exporters, and textile & clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers. Based on local conditions, policy suggestions were proposed, including economic structure and efficiency optimization, technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme.

Based on previous research results, this paper summarized the temporal and spatial distribution of bimodal volcanic rocks and associated minerals resources, and discussed the geotectonic setting about the bimodal volcanic rocks in Yunnan. The process of geologic evolution history in Yunnan can be summarized below: (1) Proterozoic: the Mesoproterozoic alkaline volcanic rocks series and spilite-keratophyre association of Dahongshan Group, Hekou Group, Dongchuan Group, Kunyang Group, etc. in central Yunnan, and also the Neoproterozoic bimodal volcanic rocks, which is equivalent to the Suxiong Formation; (2) Meishucunian stage of early Cambrian: basalt and tuff in the western margin of the Yangtze Block; (3) Middle-Late Silurian: spilite-quartz keratophyre assemblage of the Da'aozi Formation (S2+3d) in the Dapingzhang copper-polymetallic ore district in Pu'er, western Yunnan; (4) Middle-Late Devonian: clasolite of Linong Formation (D2+3l), intercalated with bimodal volcanic rocks and carbonate rocks, in Yangla, Deqin, northwest Yunnan; (5) Early Triassic: Pantiange Formation (T1p) rhyolite and Cuiyibi Formation (T1c) basalt (spilite or altered basalt) in the Jinshajiang orogen, and Eryuan Group bimodal volcanic rocks in western Yunnan; (6) Middle-Late Triassic: Manghuai Formation (T2m) rhyolite, rhyolitic dacite, rhyolitic pyroclastic rock, minor basalt, and Xiaodingxi Formation (T3x) basaltic pyroclastic rock and Manghuihe (T3mh) basalt rhyolitic pyroclastic rock; and (7) Paleogene: Jianchuan Formation (E2j) alkali basalt and potassic volcanic breccia constitute seven episodes of bimodal volcanic rocks, characteristic of various geotectonic settings and related special minerals.

The mylonites are characterized by porphyroclastic microstructures and the ultramylonites are highly lineated with alternating amphibole- and quartzofeldspathic domains. Microstructural analysis and P/T estimation suggest that the amphibole grains in the mylonitic rocks are deformed and dynamically recrystallized at amphibolite facies.In the mylonitic amphibolites, there are two types of amphibole porphyroclasts, i.e. type I ' hard' and type II ' soft' porphyroclasts. They have their [001] crystallographic orientations subnormal and sub-parallel to the stretching lineation of the rocks, respectively. The two types of porphyroclasts show distinct deformation microstructures and sub-microstructures formed by various deformation mechanisms, which contribute in different ways to the generation of the fine-grained matrix. Shape preferred orientation analysis, misorientation analysis of the two types of porphyroclasts and new fine grains around them further prove the generation of the fine grains in matrix from the type II porphyroclasts. The type I ' hard' porphyroclasts are deformed mainly by mechanical rotation, work hardening and intragranular microfracturing. In contrast, the deformation of the type II ' soft' porphyroclasts is mainly attributed to crystalline plasticity, i.e. twinning, dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization. During the deformation of the type II porphyroclasts, the (100) [001] slip system plays a dominant role during deformation and grain size reduction of amphibole. Twinning along the active (100) slip system, in combination with dislocation creep (gliding and climbing) governs the nucleation of subgrains and formation of dynamically recrystallized fine grains, a process here named Twinning Nucleation Recrystallization. © 2010.","67","Twinning","Creep - Crystal microstructure - Dynamic recrystallization - Metamorphic rocks - Nucleation - Strain hardening - Structural geology","Crystalline plasticity - Crystallographic orientations - Deformation microstructure - Diancang Shan of Yunnan - Fabric analysis - Microstructural analysis - Mylonites - Shape preferred orientations","481.1 Geology - 531.1 Metallurgy - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: B07011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CUG, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; Number: GPMR200837, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 40772133, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 90814006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40872139, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study has received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 90814006, 40872139 and 40772133 ), the 111 Project (B07011) of the Ministry of Education and State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (Grant No. GPMR200837 ).

Four distinct components of Erhai Lake, three components of Chenghai Lake, and three components of Lugu Lake were identified by the PARAFAC model, based on fluorescence excitation-emission spectra. These included two terrestrial and marine humic-like components (E1 and E3) for Erhai Lake, one terrestrial and marine humic-like component (C1) for Chenghai Lake, and one autochthonous tryptophan-like component (L1) for Lugu Lake. The autochthonous tryptophan-like component S1 (E4, C2, and L3) and autochthonous tyrosine-like component S2 (E2, C3, and L2) were also identified. In addition, the S1 and S2 components were highly similar to one another and had almost identical extraction and emission wavelengths. Both S1 and S2 components were highly prevalent in plateau lakes but rarely appeared in plain lakes. Principal component analysis (PCA) found a great correlation between the S1 and S2 components in all studied lakes, indicating that they had a common source or the same variation trend. To be noted, we found that with the decrease of eutrophication level, relative abundance of S1 and S2 presented significance increase, the relative abundance of S1 and S2 components can be used as an indicator of lake trophic status in the Yunnan Plateau. Special attention should be given to these components with regard to plateau lake protection. PCA score analysis for the studied lakes found obvious quantitative and qualitative differences in the fluorescence components of different regions of Chenghai Lake. No significant discrepancy was found between Erhai Lake regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","39","Principal component analysis","Amino acids - Dissolution - Emission spectroscopy - Eutrophication - Fluorescence - Lakes - Nitrogen - Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy","Dissolved organic nitrogen - Overlying water - PARAFAC - PCA analysis - UV/ Vis spectroscopy - Yunnan Plateau","741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 41503113, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41503113 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

There are two kinds of xenoliths: one is red and the other is black in color. It can be identified by X-ray crystal powder diffraction that the red one is a mixed crystal of aphanites-amorphous material, the major potential component of which is spessartine, while the black one is a mixed crystal of aphanites-amorphous material, major potential component of which is omphacite. To some extent the two kind of mixed crystals are similar to melting glass or melt pockets. It shows that they have the similar geochemical characteristics of cogenetic rock evolution. By analyzing their microscopic features and geochemical characteristics, the present paper suggests that they are partial melting products from the depleted mantle and are carried, transported and erupted by alkaline basaltic magma, as an immiscible melt. They represent the component of garnet (eclogite phase) mantle, and it is suggested that the Cenozoic asthenospheric upwelling, in addition to the release of small-volume of melt to replace upper mantle causing its enrichment, had also resulted in the delamination of lithospheric mantle, and the spinel mantle components were transformed to the garnet mantle components. Besides, according to the different origins of the two kinds of mixed crystals, and of other types of xenoliths and the host magma, it is suggested that the deep lithospheric mantle after metasomatism had undergone two stages of transformations at Maguan area The first is the transformation of the primitive mantle to depleted mantle, and accompanied by partial melting; the second is the transformation of depleted mantle to enriched mantle, and then generated the alkali-rich magma and the immiscible mantle fluid which is further enriched in ore-forming elements. This implies that the alkali-rich porphyry-related polymetallic mineralization is constrained by this deep geological process and crust-mantle contamination mechanism in western Yunnan.","25","Garnets","Amorphous materials - Basalt - Delamination - Geochemistry - Melting - Mineralogy - Structural geology - Volcanoes","Crust mantle - Geochemical characteristic - Geological significance - Lithospheric delaminations - Lithospheric mantle - Maguan, Yunnan - Microscopic features - Ore-forming elements","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 484 Seismology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 933.2 Amorphous Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

China is a large agricultural country, so drought is nor ignored for China. Drought hazards in agriculture growing, so timely and accurate monitoring of the development of drought is necessary to reduce the harm of drought. Over the years, many scholars established a variety of drought monitoring models, aiming at better monitoring of drought. Southwest China has been the drought-prone areas and Yunnan Province is the most serious area. [Method]: In this paper, in February 2012-May period of remote sensing data obtained with moderate-resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) conducts dynamic monitoring of drought in Yunnan. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated with the first bang and the second bang of MODIS data and Negative NDVI values that are representative of the water and snow should be removed. By split window algorithm method, land surface temperature (LST) in Yunnan is retrieved with 31-band and 32-band of MODIS data, but some places in where there is much cloud are removed. Then the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) calculated Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI) that dynamically monitors the drought in Yunnan. this model's results are validated based on 10 cm-shallow soil moisture data measured by the meteorological stations at the 0.05 confidence level and passed the correlation test which indicates that the results calculated by the model is sensitive to changes in drought. In the soil moisture data, some data collection sites have been irrigated, so these data should be removed. So this drought index can be used to monitor drought developments and we can get real-time, accurate drought. These monitoring results as a basis, We can make timely and correct drought policy to reduce losses caused by the drought; [Conclusions] :from spring drought monitoring results can be seen that Northwest Yunnan has been in a semi- arid and arid state. In February and May, it is more serious drought, drought affecting a wide range. There are two reasons about development of drought: First, the terrain reasons, northwest, eastern and Central Yunnan are the highland area, low rainfall, dry climate, so the severe drought in these areas; Second, the climatic reason, the spring belongs to the dry season, Rainfall is relatively small and its distribution is not balance. Relative to previous years, three months and it rarely rains in March and May, so it is severe drought. In recent years, natural hazards occur frequently on the world in witch drought is most. Drought is characterized by a wide spread range, long duration and great harm. China is a large agricultural country so it be harmed when drought occurred witch hinders the development of society. So it is necessity of Real-time, dynamic and accurate monitoring of drought.

The technology of hyperspectral remote sensing is an important method to estimate SOM content efficiently and accurately. This study researched the best hyperspectral estimation model for SOM content in Shangri-La forest soil. The spectral reflectance of soils with sizes of 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.50 mm, and 0.25 mm were measured indoors. After smoothing and de-noising, the reciprocal reflectance (RR), logarithmic reflectance (LR), first-derivative reflectance (FR), reciprocal first-derivative reflectance (RFR), logarithmic first-derivative reflectance (LFR), and mathematical transformations of the original spectral reflectance (REF) were carried out to analyze the relevance of spectral reflectance and SOM content and extract the characteristic bands. Finally the simple linear regression (SLR), multiple stepwise linear regression (SMLR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for SOM content estimation were established. The results showed that: (1)With the decrease of soil particle size, the spectral reflectance increased. The smaller the soil particle sizes, the more obvious was the increase in spectral reflectance. (2) The sensitive bands of SOM were mainly in the 580-690 nm range (correlation coefficient (R) > 0.6, p-value (p) v 2) = 0.91, root mean square error of validation (RMSEv) = 13.41, the ratio of percent deviation (RPD) = 3.33). The results provide a basis for monitoring SOM content rapidly in the forests of Northwest Yunnan, and provide a reference for forest SOM estimation in other areas. © 2019 by the authors.","56","Soils","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Estimation - Forestry - Least squares approximations - Mathematical transformations - Mean square error - Organic compounds - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Reflection - Regression analysis - Remote sensing","Coefficient of determination - HyperSpectral - Hyperspectral remote sensing - Northwest Yunnan - Partial least squares regressions (PLSR) - Soil organic matters - Soil particle size - Stepwise linear regression","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,"","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.

Its origin is in debate. The paper deals with its origin by studying rock's REE and Sr isotope. Although the rocks are different in their REE contents varying from 77.53 μg/g to 1 798.3 μg/g, they have very similar features in REE parameters. On the triangular diagram of REEs, the sample dots are concentrated on the end area of light REEs, representing a product of low-degree melting of upper mantle or lower crust materials. The initial 87Sr/86Sr values of rocks vary between 0.706 4 and 0.709 8, showing a feature of mantle-crust mixed source. Moreover, REEs show a logarithmic linear positive correlation between them. This type of correlation strongly supports the fractional-partial melting model. The result of geochemistry inversion shows that the source rock of alkaline-rich porphyry is plagioclase-bearing harzburgite and of mantle-crust mixed type. At the early state of melting, some crust components of the source rock were partially melted into intermediate-acidic magma; with the crust components consumed, the magma evolved to basic.","16",,,,,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Fluid inclusion studies show that the generation of pure quartz peritecticum, Quartzic calcite peritecticum and pegmatitic xenolith of quartz-albite is bounded with immiscibility, which is caused by continuous decompressing of CO2-rich fluid. The paragenetic relationship, which glass inclusions were associated with H2O-NaCl inclusions and CO2inclusions, indicates that inclusions have been trapped with immiscibility of melt and fluid.

In order to undertake a detailed spatial analysis at a long-Term level, a monthly 1-km NPP time series from 1982 to 2014 was constructed from multisource remote sensing data sets. The altitudinal variation of the relationship between NPP and climatic factors was disclosed at annual, seasonal, and monthly scales, respectively. The results indicated that the correlation between NPP and precipitation gradually decreases from positive to negative with the ascending elevation at an annual scale, which is completely the opposite to temperature. The relationships at seasonal and monthly scales are also consistent, but significant seasonal heterogeneity was found due to the uneven climate. It was also concluded that downward run-off is responsible for the altitudinal heterogeneity, in that high-elevation areas cannot easily retain water, and only low-elevation areas benefit from the increased precipitation. What is more, we also found that the impact of climatic drought on NPP is related to topography. Large river valleys help to facilitate droughts, but the negative impacts on NPP can be mitigated in the rugged area with fluctuating slope. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","72","Remote sensing","Climate change - Climate control - Drought - Ecosystems - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Time series analysis","Climatic factors - elevation transect - Mountainous area - Multisource remote sensing data - Multisources - Net primary productivity - Spatial analysis - Yunnan province",,,"Number: 2017YFA0604402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41422108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received September 15, 2017; revised June 14, 2018; accepted July 30, 2018.

In this study, we combined the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI), meteorological aridity indices, and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEI) to identify the drought responses of planted and natural forests. In particular, we used the EVI standard anomaly (ESA) as a physiological drought indicator and analyzed the applicability of SPEIs at time scales of 1-30 months, thereby determining the optimal time scale for the SPEI (SPEIopt), i.e., the SPEI that best represents the drought responses of forests in Yunnan. Next, we employed the optimal SPEI and the ESA as indices to statistically analyze the response characteristics of planted and natural forests under different drought intensities. The results indicated the following: (1) The SPEI in June and a time scale of five months (i.e., SPEIJun,5) comprise the optimal meteorological aridity indicator for forests in Yunnan Province, which had the strongest correlation with the EVI standard anomaly (ESAJun). (2) All forest types were affected by drought in Yunnan, but their responses varied according to the forest type, elevation, and drought intensity. In general, natural forests are more vulnerable and sensitive to drought than planted forests, especially natural coniferous forests at low (0-2000 m) and moderate (2000-4000 m) altitudes, and natural mixed forest at low altitudes (0-2000 m). (3) The remote sensing-based ESA (ESAJun) is sensitive to the intensity of water stress, which makes it a good indicator for drought monitoring. In addition, the forests' inventory survey revealed that 8.05% of forests were affected by drought; thus, we used this as a guide to estimate an approximate threshold to map forest responses to drought across the region.

The results showed that the magnetic susceptibility of the surface soil in the 15 samples of red bare lands was lower than that of vegetated lands in the same area,which was 7∼67% lower, respectively. The mean value was 994.1410-8m3⋅kg-1, which was 39.84% lower than that of the vegetated lands, and the variation coefficient was 36%, higher than that of the vegetated lands. The profile soil's variation coefficients of the magnetic susceptibility in the red bare lands were 5.3% and 16.8% respectively, which were lower than those of the vegetated lands (31.5% and 25.3%). The conclusion is as follows: the soil of red bare lands is rich in magnetic minerals; the surface soil's susceptibility is lower than those of the vegetated lands in the same region and the degree of variation is higher, while the degree of profile soil's variation coefficients of the magnetic susceptibility is lower. We can conclude that there is a chemical erosion process which a large number of magnetic minerals are lost or transformed in the erosion process of red bare lands, and the acid rain may be one of its important causes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","6","Soils","Acid rain - Erosion - Magnetic susceptibility - Magnetism","Chemical erosion - Eastern Yunnan - Erosion process - Karst regions - Magnetic minerals - Mean values - Surface soil - Variation coefficient","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena",,"","Thanks for the support of national nature science foundation of China (41061021) and Yunnan science and technology plan(2012CA024).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We also analyzed the deformation of the active blocks in the whole SYG before and after the Wenchuan earthquake, and analyzed the deformation of active blocks near the epicenter of the Wenchuan earthquake in detail. The results show that, (1) Under the effects of the carving from India plate and the crimping from the potential energy of Tibetan Plateau for a long time, there is a certain periodicity in crustal deformation in SYG. And the period change and the earthquake occurrence have a good agreement. (2) The differences in GPS velocity fields relative Eurasian reference frame shows that the Wenchuan earthquake and the Ya'an earthquake mainly affect the crustal movement in the central and southern part of SYG, and the average velocity difference is about 4–8 mm/a for the Wenchuan earthquake and 2–4 mm/a for the Ya'an earthquake. (3) For the Wenchuan earthquake, the average strain changed from 10 to 20 nanostrian/a before earthquake to 40–50 nanostrian/a after the earthquake, but before and after the Ya'an earthquake, the strain value increased from about 15 nanostrian/a to about 30 nanostrian/a.

This paper uses GIS technology to analyze the distribution of rural primary schools in a mountainous county of China. Analyzing population, school distribution, relevant education resource databases, and combined altitude map, allowed us to calculate the spatial accessibility of every administrative village in the county. The main evaluation factors for school distribution are spatial accessibility, fairness, and efficiency. Using a spatial accessibility index, we constructed a Gravity Model and an Improvement Gravity Model to explore the spatial distribution of rural schools. Through our analysis, we found there were differences in regard to education resources, school distribution, and spatial accessibility in Zhenyuan County, where our study was conducted. In some villages, the education resources are inadequate, some villages the distance to school is too far, more than half of the villages were poorly for the accessibility to school. We suggest that when school adjustments are being made, instead of merely considering efficiency alone, fairness should also be taken into account. Providing rural students with a school near their home is the most suitable and beneficial situation for rural families. © 2017 IEEE.","15","Spatial distribution","Education computing - Efficiency - Geographic information systems - Rural areas","Accessibility index - Education resource - Evaluation factor - Primary schools - Rural primary schools - Rural schools - Spatial accessibility - Yunnan province","903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: No.EMA150354, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Office for Education Sciences Planning Project No.EMA150354.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of two samples yield 261.9±2.2 Ma (MSWD=0.80) and 264.8±1.7 Ma (MSWD=1.12) respectively. The basalts and andesites are characterized by low TiO2(0.50%-0.88%), high Mg#(52.0-64.5), slightly enriched LREE ((La/Yb)N=1.42-3.44), enriched LILE (Rb, Th, U, Pb) and slightly depleted HFSE (Nb, Ta, Ti), which are typical of island arc basalt (IAB). The dacites and rhyolites are characterized by high ΣREE (139.5×10-6-313.6×10-6), enriched LREE ((La/Yb)N=4.16-9.78) and LILE (Rb, Ba, Th, U), depleted HFSE (Nb, Ta), and strongly depleted Sr, Ti, Y, which are similar to those of island arc rhyolite. However, unlike common acid island-arc volcanic rocks, the dacites and rhyolites are characterized by high K2O contents (average 7.73%), calc-alkaline (δ=0.93-2.94) and strongly peraluminous features (A/CNK=1.13-2.10), which are similar to those of the S-type granites. Considering the regional geologic background, rock association, and geochemical features, we argue that this set of volcanic rocks was formed in an extensional back-arc basin of active continental margin. They were derived from partial melting of the mantle and experienced crystallization differentiation and subsequent contamination of the upper crust. Similar to the island arc volcanic rocks at the Yunnan-Guangxi border and the island arc basalts along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, this set of volcanic rocks was most likely formed during the northward subduction of the Ailaoshan Ocean. © 2016, Science Press.

The spatial variability of species richness has been postulated to be related with influencing factors such as climate, habitat and human activities using many geostastical methods. Understanding the relationship between species richness and its influencing factors is of critical importance for its conservation. As tree cover data with high resolution can reflect the terrestrial habitat with environment, its efficiency for modelling spatial pattern of biodiversity was investigated in this study. The spatial distribution of tree cover and its influencing factors in Yunnan province, and the relationship between tree cover and species richness of mammals and birds were analyzed by linear regression method and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)model. The results showed that tree cover in this study region exhibited a substantially spatial heterogeneity, which was affected by human activities, topography and climate. Linear regression analysis showed that tree cover was significantly correlated with the species richness of mammals and birds. The explanatory power (local R2)of GWR model between tree cover and species richness of mammals and birds showed great spatial variability. The predicted spatial distribution of species richness of mammals and birds was consistent with the actual observed values. Our study revealed that the GWR model provides local details of spatial variation in species richness of mammals and birds. These results will be helpful to understand the impact of tree cover on variation of species richness of mammals and birds under global change and will be of theoretical significance for better conservation and management of biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","57","Population distribution","Biodiversity - Birds - Conservation - Ecosystems - Forestry - Linear regression - Mammals - Spatial distribution - Topography - Trees (mathematics)","Geographically weighted regression - Geographically weighted regression models - Influencing factors - Linear regression methods - Spatial heterogeneity - Spatial variability - Terrestrial habitat - Yunnan province","405.3 Surveying - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 921 Mathematics - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,"","This study was funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Grant No. 41571173)and National Key Research and Development Project (Grant No. 2016YFC0502103).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is determined that the hailstorms were found to present dominant negative CG lightning flashes at any given stage. One specific hailstorm occurring on July 16, 2006, is analyzed in detail by using the data from a CG lightning location network and Doppler radar. This severe hailstorm, which exhibited strong vertical development with cloud tops reaching 15.9 km, produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifespan of 3 h and 12 min. The total CG lightning within the hailstorm showed high levels of activity with flash rates of up to 79 fl/5 min. The analysis of the storm cell's lifecycle shows similar trends between the CG lightning flash rates and radar-derived parameters. Cloud-to-ground flashes tended to initiate within the cloud region with reflectivity of more than 30 dBZ at the -10 °C isotherm height. A distinct increase in CG flash rate is shown during the rapid development stages of hailstorms. The CG lightning jump pattern appears to be an effective tool for short-term forecasting of possible occurrences of severe weather. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","35","Clouds","Doppler radar - Lightning - Lightning protection - Storms","Cloud-to-ground flash - Cloud-to-ground lightning - Derived parameters - Development stages - Hailstorms - Radar echoes - Short-term forecasting - Yunnan province","443 Meteorology - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,"Number: 2014RA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: K-YN2013-186, Acronym: CSPG, Sponsor: China Southern Power Grid; Number: 41305002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41265001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 41305002 and 41265001 ) and the Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province (No. 2014RA002 ) and the  Science Foundation of the China Southern Power Grid (Grant no.

In 2007, the Qingshuihai water supply project was launched with the purpose of meeting the water demand of the new development zone in Kunming city. During the construction phase, a series of mitigation measures were adopted by the Kunming municipal government to protect the environment. This article focuses on the 4-year monitoring of the water quality of the Qingshuihai reservoir. The analysis has shown that the water quality of the reservoir is better in the dry season than the raining season when the water quality was affected primarily by polluting sources in the reservoir catchment and by the construction activities. The study has also concluded that the implementation of the environmental mitigation measures during the construction phase has played an important role in protecting the water quality of the Qingshuihai reservoir. As the construction activities are near completion, rural non-point sources, sewage and upstream flow will become the major factors affecting the water quality of the reservoir. © 2011 IEEE.","7","Reservoirs (water)","Catchments - Construction industry - Flood control - Quality control - Sewage - Water quality - Water supply - Water supply systems","Central Yunnan water Eversion - Construction activities - Construction phase - Environmental mitigation - Municipal government - Reservoir catchments - Water diversion project - Water supply projects","405 Construction Equipment and Methods; Surveying - 441.2 Reservoirs - 442.1 Flood Control - 445.2 Water Analysis - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 452.1 Sewage - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is located on the northern side of the Beiya superlarge gold polymetallic deposit and is a component part and a new deposit type of the porphyry-hydrothermal ore-forming system of the Beiya superlarge gold polymetallic ore field. Based on a review of local geology and a comparative study of the mineralization characteristics of the Beiya deposit, the authors held that there should exist some unsubstantial structures in the axes of Beiya syncline which could provide the channel way and space for the ore-forming fluid from the Wandongshan orthophyre mineralization system. In combination with the existence of good combinatorial anomaly of Pb-Au-Ag-Zn-Cu-As-Sb in the area, the Luping lead polymetallic deposit was eventually discovered by means of drilling. The ore bodies of the deposit are hosted in the fracture zones within limestone of Middle Triassic Beiya Formation and sandstone-mudstone interlayered bedding of Qingtianpu Formation and limestone of Middle Triassic Beiya Formation. Ores of the ore deposit mainly consist of oxidized ores and mixed ores together with minor sulfide ores. The main metal component of the ores is lead along with some accessory components such as gold, silver, iron and zinc. Based on an analysis of the mineralogical characteristics as well as the distribution and modes of occurrence of useful components in the deposit, the authors put forward the suggestion that the relevant research work should be strengthened in further development and utilization of the ore deposit.","13","Ores","Deposits - Gold - Gold deposits - Lead - Limestone - Mineralogy - Ore deposit geology - Silver - Zinc","Geological implications - Heqing - Mineralogical characteristics - Polymetallic - Yunnan","617 Turbines and Steam Turbines - 612 Engines - 547.1 Precious Metals - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 532 Metallurgical Furnaces - 505 Mines and Mining, Nonmetallic - 504 Mines and Mining, Metal - 502 Mines and Quarry Equipment and Operations - 482 Mineralogy - 414 Masonry Materials",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Samples were gathered from a COPR site in Luliang County in Qujing, Yunnan Province of China. The total Cr, Cr(VI) and chromium species were investigated. Results indicated the concentration of total Cr was between 110.5 and 21,774 mg/kg, and the concentration of Cr(VI) was between 0.1 and 1075 mg/kg. The map of total-Cr and ratio of Cr(VI)/total-Cr (%) showed that the maximum of total-Cr and Cr(VI) appeared in the layers near the surface. In the horizontal direction, the pollution was more serious in the middle and southeast part than that in the west. Additionally, acid extractable chromium increased in the layers at depth from −0.3 to −2.0 m, and it decreased in the deeper layers. There was a trend that the movable Cr(VI) migrated to the deeper layers, and then it turned into Cr(III). Water played an important role for the Cr distribution. Cr(VI) in COPR released to the soil solution after rainfall, and then gravity led the solution down to the deeper layers. After repeated rainfall and leaching, Cr(VI) moved to the deeper soil layers. Due to capillarity and evaporation, Cr(VI) migrated and was enriched at the surface layer. Therefore, measures on controlling water movement should be taken in the remediation of the COPR site. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","27","Chromium compounds","Chromite deposits - Drilling - Rain - Soil moisture - Spatial distribution","Chromite ore processing residues - Chromium oxidation - Chromium species - Migration - Soil solutions - Surface layers - Water movements - Yunnan province","443.3 Precipitation - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Fractal dimensions D1and D2(at relative pressure of 0-0.5 and 0.5-1, respectively) were obtained from the nitrogen adsorption data using the fractal Frenkel-Halsey-Hill (FHH) method. Not only have the relationships among pore structure parameters of shale, the relationships between TOC content, mineral compositions, pore structure parameters and fractal dimensions been discussed, but also the significance of two fractal dimensions D1and D2and the impact of fractal dimensions on adsorption capacity have been investigated. The results showed that fourteen shale samples have TOC content ranging from 1.25% to 7.72%, two fractal dimensions both increase with the increasing TOC content, and gradually come to a standstill-the curves present the shape of 'parabola'. The major mineralogical compositions of shales are quartz and clay minerals, the quartz contents are between 25.5% and 42.7%, the clay contents are between 26.6% and 44.2%. Fractal dimension D1has a negative correlation with quartz contents and a positive correlation with clay minerals contents, but fractal dimension D2has no apparent relationship with quartz and clay minerals contents. The specific surface area is in the range of 4.98 m2/g-19.66 m2/g, the total pore volume is between 0.00479 cm3/g and 0.01765 cm3/g, and the average pore diameter is between 3.37 nm and 6.02 nm. Two fractal dimensions increase with the increasing surface area and pore volume, and also increase with the decreasing average pore diameter because of the complicated pore surface and structure of small pores. Further investigation indicates that D1represents fractal characteristics from the irregular pore surface, while D2represents fractal characteristics related to the complicated pore structure, and shale samples with larger fractal dimensions have higher methane adsorption capacity. Therefore fractal analysis is helpful to have a better understanding of pore structure and adsorption capacity of marine shale. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","47","Fractal dimension","Analytical geochemistry - Clay minerals - Enamels - Field emission microscopes - Gas adsorption - Methane - Nitrogen - Organic carbon - Pore structure - Quartz - Scanning electron microscopy - Shale - X ray diffraction analysis","Adsorption capacities - Eastern Yunnan - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Methane adsorption capacity - Mineralogical compositions - Nitrogen adsorption - Organic-rich shales - Total organic carbon content","482.2 Minerals - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 921 Mathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,"Number: 2011ZX05018-001-002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011ZX05009-002-205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016ZX05046-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41072098, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41372139, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 41072098 and 41372139 ) and the Important National Science and Technology Specific Projects of China (Nos. 2016ZX05046-003 , 2011ZX05018-001-002 and 2011ZX05009-002-205 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Forests are mainly composed of conifers in Northwestern Yunnan Plateau, but variations of growth response to climate conditions among the species are not well understood. To detect the growth response of multiple species to climate change, we developed residual chronologies of four major conifers, i.e., George's fir (Abies georgei Orr), Likiang spruce (Picea likiangensis (Franch.) E. Pritz.), Gaoshan pine (Pinus densata Mast.) and Chinese larch (Larix potaninii Batalin) at the upper distributional limits in Shika Snow Mountain. Using the dendroclimatology method, we analyzed correlations between the residual chronologies and climate variables. The results showed that conifer radial growth was influenced by both temperature and precipitation in Shika Snow Mountain. Previous November temperature, previous July temperature, and current May precipitation were the common climatic factors that had consistent influences on radial growth of the four species. Temperature in the previous post-growing season (September-October) and moisture conditions in the current growing season (June-August) were the common climatic factors that had divergent impacts on the radial growth of the four species. Based on the predictions of climate models and our understanding of the growth response of four species to climate variables, we may understand the growth response to climate change at the species level. It is difficult to predict future forest growth in the study area, since future climate change might cause both increases and decreases for the four species and indirect effects of climate change on forests should be considered. © 2017 by the authors.","58","Climate change","Climate models - Forecasting - Forestry - Landforms - Plants (botany) - Snow","Climate condition - Climatic response - Dendrochronology - Hengduan Mountains - Moisture conditions - Northwestern Yunnan - Redundancy analysis - Residual chronology","443 Meteorology - 481.1 Geology - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2015Z136, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012HC007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31600395, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: We gratefully acknowledge the field assistance of Guanglei Chen, Zhenya Liu, and Zhibao Wang.

In particular, the time window segmentation divides initial wave and reflected wave into two inconsistent time windows, hence the reflected wave from the superimposed oscillation that usually follows the travelling wave can be effectively separated, such that the identification of reflected wave can be significantly simplified. Lastly, the superimposed oscillation is thoroughly analysed while both the field data with and without obvious superimposed oscillation are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The results demonstrated that the industrial carbon emissions would reduce 0.49billion tons in the supply-side reform scenario in 2050 compared to the reference scenario. However, carbon emissions in Yunnan would rise steadily which led to missing the target of achieving a peak in 2030. Most of the carbon emissions were contributed by five carbon intensive sectors as electricity, metal processing, non-metal production, transportation and chemistry. In these five sectors, only carbon emissions in transportation sector would increase substantially while carbon emissions in other 4sectors would all decrease. Seven carbon intensive energies would contribute over 96% of industrial carbon emissions and this proportion would keep stable during 2012~2050. In these carbon intensive energies, coals' contribution would decrease stably but oils and nature gas would contribute more carbon emissions. In order to realize low-carbon transformation, the government of Yunnan province should make more efforts on achieving the target to control the volume of carbon emissions. Measures on supply-side reforms should be strengthened to deal with the sharp increase of carbon emissions in the transportation sector in the future.

However, the cancer-causing culprit is not settled as Tian [Tian, L., 2005. Coal Combustion Emissions and Lung Cancer in Xuan Wei, China. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley.] found nanometer quartz in these coals, soot emissions, and lung cancer tissues. We have conducted mineralogical and geochemical studies of the coals from Xuan Wei for the purpose of shedding light on the minerals which may be related to the epidemic lung cancer. In this paper, abundances, modes of occurrence, and origins of minerals and elements in the coals from two mines in Xuan Wei have been studied using optical microscope, low-temperature ashing, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The minerals in the coals are mainly composed of quartz, chamosite, kaolinite, and calcite. The particle size of quartz is rather small, mostly less than 20 μm and it is of authigenic origin. Chamosite occurs mainly as cell-fillings. The occurrence of quartz and chamosite indicates that they were derived from the hydrothermal fluids. Epigenetic calcite is derived from calcic fluids. Kaolinite is derived mainly from sediment source region of Kangdian Oldland to the west of coal basin. The composition of Xuan Wei coal is high in SiO2, Fe2O3, TiO2, CaO, MnO, V, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. The high SiO2 content is attributed to quartz, and the Fe2O3 content to chamosite. The high Mn and low Mg contents in the coal indicate the inputs of hydrothermal fluids. CaO occurs mainly in epigenetic calcite. Elements Ti, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and rare earth elements were derived from the basaltic rocks at sediment source region. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For a long time, the deposit has been thought to be of continental sedimentary genesis with potassium derived from sea water. However, there are some researchers who hold that there existed other sources, but they have failed to present any evidence. In order to find out the source and origin of the deposit, the authors studied the component characteristics of the salt layer in Mengyejing Formation and its underlying Bashahe formation by XRD, ICP-MS, EPMA and microscopy in this paper, and pointed out that there existed two potassium sources for the deposit. The first was sea water because the average value of the trace element bromine (Br) in evaporates is 578×10-6 which is higher than 200×10-6, indicating Br came from sea water. In addition, a small amount of marine mineral glauconite exists in quartz sandstone of lower Bashahe Formation. The second was deep hydrothermal solution, as evidenced by the existence of lots of pyrite rich in Co and Ni in grayish green mudstone of Mengyejing Formation. Furthermore, comblainite is one of the main mineral phases of fracture filling in the salt layer, and azurite and malachite that contain copper minerals were found in quartz sandstone of Bashahe Formation. The elements of Cu, Co and Ni in minerals were provided by deep hydrothermal solution because the deposit was located in strongly active tectonic belts. Therefore, deep hydrothermal solution also provided important potassium sources for the Mengyejing potash deposit in addition to sea water.","15","Potash","Deposits - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Mica - Minerals - Nickel - Potash deposits - Quartz - Sandstone - Seawater","Active tectonics - Component characteristics - Fracture filling - Genesis - Hydrothermal solution - Lanping-Simao Basin, Yunnan - Marine minerals - Potassium source","804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 801 Chemistry - 617 Turbines and Steam Turbines - 612 Engines - 548.1 Nickel - 532 Metallurgical Furnaces - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 482.2 Minerals - 471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As compared with the common Chinese coals and the upper continental crust, the Luquan coals are enriched in Li, B, Cu, Ga, Se, Rb, Mo, Ba, Pb, Bi, and U, with averages of 99.9, 250, 111, 24.4, 4.55, 130, 58.8, 1276, 162, 3.85, and 34.1 μg/g, respectively. The SEM-EDX results show that V, Cr, Ga, and Rb occur mainly in clay minerals, and Cu and Pb are associated with clay minerals and pyrite, and Mo and U are mainly in clay minerals and organic matter. Barite and clay minerals are the main carrier of barium. The high B and U contents are probably resulted from deep seawater influence during coal formation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to promote the exploration and development of CBM resources in this area, we studied previous coalfield survey data and CBM geological exploration data. Then, we analyzed the relationships of gas content and methane concentration vs. coal seam thickness, burial depth, coal petrology, coal quality and roof and floor lithology from the aspects of gas bearing property, coal seam distribution, coal petrology, coal quality, and lithological assemblage of coal bearing strata. Besides, we briefly discussed the main influential factors of CBM accumulation. Finally, we established a CBM area selection evaluation model based on multi-layered fuzzy mathematics and applied it to CBM favorable zone evaluation in this study area. And the following research results were obtained. First, the main factors controlling CBM accumulation are coal seam thickness, burial depth and sealing capacity of roof and floor. Second, eleven third-order evaluation parameters are selected out from the aspects of resource potential, reservoir property, storage condition and development condition as CBM exploration target evaluation indicators. Third, the evaluation results of CBM area selection evaluation model show that the CBM exploration and development potential is the best in the Xinzhuang Field, followed by Luowang, Niuchang-Yigu, and Mahe.
