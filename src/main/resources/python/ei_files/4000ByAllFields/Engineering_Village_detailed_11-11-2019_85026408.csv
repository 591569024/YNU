Heterobalanus were collected from the Upper Pliocene Sanying Formation in Heqing County, Yunnan Province, China. Leaves are oblong, elliptic or obovate with entire margin or spinous serrations, 3.1-8.7 cm in length and 1.8-5.7 cm in width. Leaf apex is round, mucronate or blunt round, while leaf base is heart-shaped, slightly heart-shaped or blunt round, and occasionally asymmetric. The petiole is slightly sturdy, straight or a bit curved, with 1.8-4.9 mm in length. The main vein of these specimens is slightly zigzagging, with a sturdy base attenuating to the apex. Secondary veins are pinnate, 7-12 pairs, alternate and parallel with the stretching angles from 40° to 73°, bifurcating near 1/3 to 1/2 of the leaf margin. Tertiary veins are, relatively thin, 5-7 bands in 1 cm2, and perpendicular to secondary veins. Quaternary, blind and marginal veins are not clear. The upper epidermis has both unicellular and multicellular trichomes without stomata, and most of the epidermal cells are nearly quadrangular. The lower epidermis has only unicellular trichomes and cyclocytic stomatal apparatuses, and the epidermal cells are nearly quadrangular or pentagonal. The stomatal apparatuses are 20-33 μm in length, 17-27 μm in width, with 2-6 μm wide in apertures. They spread casually with the stomatal density of 503±98 mm-2and the stomatal index of 8.90%±0.32%. The guard cells show kidney-shaped, with 5-7 subsidiary cells. These features are similar to Q. rehderiana, Q. guyavifolia, Q. preguyavifolia and some other extant or fossil species of Q. sect. Heterobalanus, but they are different in terms of density and type of trichomes. Both Q. guyavifolia and Q. preguyavifolia have more trichomes in total, and multicellular trichomes in lower epidermis which spread in veins and between veins. The fossil leaves of Q. sect. Heterobalanus in Heqing and Q. rehderiana have less trichomes, and the former has no multicellular trichome in lower epidermis, while the latter's multicellular trichome are just found in veins. Hence, it was designated as a new species-Quercus heqingensis n. sp. The estimates of palaeoatmospheric-CO2using the positive relationships between stomatal frequency and atmospheric CO2partial pressure in its Nearest Living Relatives (NLRs)-Q. guyavifolia show that, the palaeo-CO2levels in the late Pliocene reconstructed by Q. heqingensis were 263.42±24.86 ppm (equation with extant field collections) and 234.25±22.49 ppm (equation with historical herbarium samples). These results are slightly lower than most previous estimates of the same age. Our results are in agreement with other estimates when palaeoaltitude is considered. This indicates that it is feasible to apply the stomatal index of Q. heqingensis to the positive relationship between stomatal index of Q. guyavifolia and atmospheric pCO2to reconstruct palaeo-CO2levels. Meanwhile, the results further support lower palaeo-CO2level in the late Pliocene than present. This study provides credible evidence for future palaeo-CO2estimates using NLRs as proxies. © 2016, Science Press.

There is a large-scale copper (Cu)–zinc (Zn)–stannum (Sn) polymetallic ore deposit in Dulong, Yunnan Province, China. The polymetallic ore deposit contains a lot of silver (Ag) and indium (In). In this paper, the polymetallic ore is investigated to explore the characteristics of its process mineralogy by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), optical microscopy (OM), and electron probe micro-analyser (EMPA). The contents of the main valuable elements in the ore are Cu 0.20%, Zn 3.93%, Sn 0.47%, Fe 22.70% and S 9.90%. Cu, Zn, Sn, and Fe mainly occur in chalcopyrite, marmatite, cassiterite and magnetite, respectively. In addition, as rare metal elements, there are also Ag 4.9 g/t and In 90.50 g/t in the ore. Ag mainly occurs in matildite and an unknown mineral (Ag0.75(Zn, Fe)0.25S) and these two minerals are all enclosed and disseminated in marmatite. In does not form an independent mineral, but an isomorphism element which mainly occurs in marmatite. Based on the results of the process mineralogy and actual conditions, a feasible flowsheet for this polymetallic ore is designed and optimized.

According to the monitoring data of high fill subgrade, a novel model, called PSOMGVM model, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Markov chain is proposed. Firstly, the typical characteristics of settlement curve are analyzed from the aspect of geomechanics theory and based on the grey theory, the grey Verhulst model (GVM) with unequal time-interval is proposed. Then, according to the theory of Markov chain, the grey Verhulst model is built to revise the relative residuals of the GVM, in which the effects of volatility characteristics can be considered. Finally, the PSOMGVM model based on PSO algorithm and Markov chain is set up, which whitens the parameters of the grey interval. In order to demonstrate the fitness and the ability of the proposed model, five competing models are introduced to predict the settlement of the high fill subgrade of Xiangli Expressway in Yunnan Province.

Here, we propose a visual analysis method based on multiple perspectives. At first, visual analysis is used to calculate the probability of occurrence of new cases of dengue and the relative risk of occurrence of dengue cases influenced by various variables causing dengue. As a result, we find that climatic variables (rainfall, maximum, minimum and average temperature), imported case and density of Aedes aegypti are three major factors affecting outbreak of dengue.

The results show that the basalt fiber can effectively improve the shear strength of the tailings. Under the same fiber length, the shear strength and cohesion of the fiber-reinforced tailings increase with the increase of fiber mass content. The cohesion increases with the fiber getting longer. When the fiber length is 9mm and the ratio to tailings by weight is 1.2%, the cohesion increased by 305.74%, which is maximum. Overall, the internal friction angle does not alter a lot. When the fiber is 12mm or fiber ratio to tailings by weight is 0.6%, the internal friction angle is always less than that of raw tailings regardless of fiber content and length. Permeability coefficient is always greater than that of raw tailings regardless of fiber length on the condition that fiber content is 1.2%.

Here, sediment samples from four Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) sections of western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan provinces in South China, representing a terrestrial to marine transitional setting, were analyzed for δ13C of organic matter (δ13Corg). These values were subsequently compared to published δ13C values of carbonates (δ13Ccarb) from the Global Stratotype Section and Point at Meishan and many other marine and terrestrial sections. A similar isotopic trend evident through all four sections is characterized by a negative shift of 2–3‰ at the top of the Xuanwei Formation, where we tentatively place the PTB. This negative shift also corresponds to a turnover in the vegetation and the occurrence of fungal spores, which is generally interpreted as a proliferation of decomposers and collapse of complex ecosystems during the end-Permian mass extinction event. Moreover, the absolute values of δ13Corgare more extreme in the more distal (marine) deposits. The δ13Corgvalues for the studied sediments are more variable compared to coeval δ13Ccarbrecords from marine records especially in the interval below the extinction horizon. We contend that the depositional environment influenced the δ13Corgvalues, but that the persisting geographic δ13Corgpattern through the extinction event across the four independent sections is an indication that the atmospheric δ13C signal left an indelible imprint on the geologic record related to the profound ecosystem change during the end-Permian extinction event. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","148","Organic carbon","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Ecosystems - Geochronology - Isotopes - Stratigraphy","Carbon isotopes - Depositional environment - Mass extinction - Mass extinction events - Sources of variability - South China - Triassic - Western guizhou and eastern yunnan","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: -, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; Number: 2011-7176, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; Number: 40972002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41272024, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: Wuhan, Acronym: CUG, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; Number: GBL11302, Acronym: CUG, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; Number: -, Acronym: SI, Sponsor: Smithsonian Institution; Number: EAR-0807744, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: 09DA76A, Acronym: NAI, Sponsor: NASA Astrobiology Institute; Number: 349-2007-8705, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Y.C. and L.R.K. acknowledge support from NSF grant EAR-0807744.

The number of birds increases as human awareness of environmental protection increases. Thus, the probability of suspension insulator string flashover induced by bird streamer would also increase. Analysis of transmission line faults in Yunnan, China, shows that many transmission line faults occurred in the winter bird migration zone, and most of the towers affected are 110 kV transmission line towers. Hence, investigating the flashover process of the 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator strings induced by bird streamer and designing a well bird-preventing installation for 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator strings is necessary. In this study, a simplified, self-designed 110 kV transmission line tower is utilized to experiment on the three types of 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator string with bird simulation excrement. The analysis of withstand test results has revealed the mechanism of flashover caused by bird streamer of the three types of suspension insulator string, and the protection radius R of the three types of insulator string has been presented. The mechanism of flashover and test results have been testified by means of the distributions of electric field and potential calculated by FEM method. Thus, the bird streamer caused flashover could be classified as the shortest air gap breakdown. Hence, it is valuable for designing or selecting a well bird-preventing installation. © 2016 IEEE.","16","Birds","Electric insulators - Electric lines - Flashover","Flashover process - Insulator string - protection radius - Suspension insulator strings - Suspension insulators - Transmission line faults - Transmission line towers - Yunnan , China","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Nowadays, we can decrease the RFIs' influences by using advanced circuits, such as high dynamic range analog receivers, remote gain or attenuation controlling software, high performance ADCs and so on. In this paper, we will introduce a new solar radio observation system in Yunnan observatory's 10 meter solar observation system for 800-975MHz observation band which was given up because of some strong RFIs in the past. This new solar radio observation system can adjust the gain from -25dB to +35dB by remote software through RF(Radio Frequency) and MF (Medium frequency) attenuators. Based on advanced FPGA processor we can achieve high spectral resolution of about 30 KHz/channel and high time resolution of about 34ms. This system can easily improve the capability of old solar radio telescopes for adding abandon bands in. © 2014 IEEE.","4","Radio interference","Radio - Radio waves - Spectral resolution","High dynamic range - High spectral resolution - High-time resolution - Medium frequencies - Radio frequencies - Radio frequency interference - Radio observation - Solar observations","711 Electromagnetic Waves - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 741.1 Light/Optics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Vetulicola longbaoshanensis Yang et al., 2010 is a unique species reported from the Guanshan Biota, Cambrian Series 2, Stage 4 at eastern Yunnan, South China, which expands our understanding of vetulicolians. Here, new exceptionally preserved materials of V. longbaoshanensis from the Lower Cambrian Wulongqing Formation (which yields the so-called Guanshan Biota) in both Wuding and Kunming areas are described, in which the gill structures of V. longbaoshanensis are well preserved. The gill structures of our fossils are more complicated than those in the type species: the gill sac is gourd-shaped and can be divided into a smaller anterior part and a larger posterior part, prominent gill silt and dense gill filaments present in the joint of the two parts. Comparative analyses indicate that vetulicolians from the Guanshan Biota are similar to the Vetulicola rectangulata Luo et Hu, 1999 from the Chengjiang Biota in gross morphology. However, compared with the V. rectangulata, the Guanshan forms possess a larger body size, a higher length/ height ratio of anterior body, and a higher ratio of gill sac width to anterior body height, probably typifying the derive characters anticipated of vetulicolians. These new materials, therefore, shed new light on our understanding of vetulicolians morphology and the early evolution of the gill structures. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","26","Natural sciences","Earth sciences","Animal evolution - Chengjiang - Comparative analysis - Eastern Yunnan - Gill filaments - Guanshan Biota - Lower cambrians - Vetulicola longbaoshanensis",,,"Number: 2013CB837100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41102012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41621003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41222014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements    We are grateful to all the field and laboratory technique workers of Early Life Institute of Northwest University, particularly grateful to Li Yan for her helpful photography and the images disposal suggestions.

By stacking the S receiver functions, the Sp converted phases from the Moho and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) are clearly visible. The Moho depth ranges from 40 to 50. km beneath Sichuan Basin and from 55 to 60. km on the west side of the Longmenshan (LMS) fault. The largest depth is 70. km, occurring at the northern Sichuan-Yunnan terrane. The LAB depth beneath Sichuan Basin ranges from 130 to 170. km, while that on the west side of LMS ranges from 100 to 120. km. From the east to the west across LMS, there is a sudden rise of the LAB, followed by a gradual dip. Western Sichuan Basin is found to be surrounded by thinner lithosphere, extending northeastward along the LMS and southward to Indochina. The thinner lithosphere may indicate that the lower part of eastern Tibet lithosphere is heated and delaminated by the underlying hot asthenospheric flow, thus reflecting the size and direction of the flow. It appears that asthenospheric flow from Tibet is resisted by the cold rigid Sichuan Basin, thus branching into northeastward and southeastward parts. The complicated topography of the lithosphere likely results from this dynamic process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","44","Structural geology","Laboratories","Eastern Tibet - LAB - Longmenshan - S-receiver functions - Sichuan Basin","481.1 Geology - 801 Chemistry",,"Number: 2011CB808904, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U0933602, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank Editor Peter M.

Here we analyze the distribution laws of the crustal magnetic anomaly and its vertical gradient, the decay characteristics of the anomaly, the contributions from different wavelength bands to the anomaly, and the relationship between the anomaly and the crustal regional tectonics in the plateau and nearby, based on a new and higher degree geomagnetic model NGDC-EMM-720-V3 constructed from the surface, aeromagnetic, marine and satellite survey data. The results reveal that the positive and negative anomalies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are weak, while those of the surrounding areas are strong. The boundary agrees well with the border of the plateau regional tectonics. The anomaly is nearly east-west in the central and western plateau, arc-shaped in the southwestern and eastern, and nearly north-south in the southeastern, consistent with the tectonic trends. There are strong negative anomaly foci in the east and west syntaxis, whereas no significant differences exist among the Cenozoic blocks in the plateau interior. No direct correspondence exists between the anomaly and the crustal depth. On the background of a weak magnetic anomaly in the plateau, relatively stronger short wavelength fields from the shallower crust are overlapped in the Lhasa, Qilian, Qaidam, and Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic blocks. A strong negative anomaly in the east-west direction is distributed along the Himalayas, mainly caused by the middle and long wavelength bands in the deep and central crust. The magnetic structural layers are stable in the Sichuan and Tarim basins.

The relationship between magnetic anomaly and geological structure was discussed. The results show that the distribution of crustal magnetic anomalies over the study area is considerably non-uniform. Relatively strong negative magnetic anomalies were distributed over Himalaya-Eastern syntaxis-Longmen mountains-Daba mountains, whereas positive magnetic anomaly is present over Sichuan Basin, with weaker magnetic anomalies over other regions. The eastern syntaxis had important impact on magnetic anomalies around. All crustal magnetic anomalies over eastern syntaxis and the surrounding regions were medium- and short-wavelength positive/negative ones superposed onto a negative or weak magnetic anomaly setting. These meso- and micro-scale magnetic anomalies were generated from magnetic materials in the upper and middle crust, with strikes basically consistent with geological structures.

Agricultural vulnerability is analyzed as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity using a multi-indicator approach. Spatial and temporal assessment is undertaken through constructing maps of agricultural vulnerability in China. The results indicate that using multiple indicators is very practical for assessing agricultural vulnerability and that agricultural vulnerability is already significant in Guizhou, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces in China and will become more serious in the 2040s. It was also found that adaptive capacity was generally underdeveloped in poor regions, such as Guizhou, Yunnan and Gansu.

This is because traditional practices are believed to be often favourable towards conservation and sustainable use. It is therefore valuable to establish a framework to evaluate the contribution of traditional knowledge to forest management today.

The H-k technique has become popular to determinate their values in recent years. However, if a complex structure exists in the crust, the reverberated phases from different depths may interfere with each other, resulting in reduction or even absence of the PpPs phase from the Moho, such that the H-k algorithm may not reveal unambiguous estimates of these two parameters. In this paper, the H-k technique is applied to process a synthetic receiver function for a test case, the result of which is compared with that from direct picking of the time delays of the converted and reverberated phases. Then we process the observational data recorded at two stations in eastern Tibet, determine the crustal thickness and the velocity ratio using the two methods, compare the result with that obtained by Xu et al. at the same location, and analyse the potential causes for discrepancy as well as the reliability of the two methods. Finally, the crustal thickness and the Poisson's ratio in eastern Tibet and Sichuan Basin are determined from the receiver functions recorded at 51 broad-band stations, using the two different methods. The results indicate that the crustal thickness from the time delays is thicker than that from the H-k algorithm near the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, and the crustal Poisson's ratio in the rigid Sichuan Basin from the time delays ranges from 0.26 to 0.28, which are more reasonable than that from the H-k (0.28 to 0.34). Additionally, the Poisson's ratio under the faults from the time delays is found to be higher than those on the two sides, which is consistent with the tectonic background and previous study. © 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2011 RAS.","21","Structural geology","Poisson ratio - Reverberation - Tectonics - Time delay","Asia - Body waves - Composition of the continental crusts - Crustal thickness - Observational data - Receiver functions - Tectonic settings - Teleseismic receiver functions","481.1 Geology - 713 Electronic Circuits - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Gold mineralization in the Jinfeng deposit is almost entirely fault-hosted and structurally controlled, with very little disseminated ore occurring in the adjacent host rocks. The structural elements in the Jinfeng deposit can be subdivided into 3 groups comprising NS-, NW-, and NE-striking faults and folds, with NW-striking structures controlling the overall framework of the deposit. Four tectonic stages have been recorded in the Jinfeng area, i.e., rifting, orogenic compression, lateral transpression, and lithospheric extension. A series of contemporaneous normal faults, such as the N-striking and east-dipping F1 and F7 faults developed along the edges of a carbonate platform during basin rifting (D2-T2). These structures provided an initial framework for subsequent basin evolution, and also represent the principal hydrothermal conduits. A gradual change of the compression direction during the orogenic stage (T3) from E→W to NE→SW, gave rise to the NW-striking structures, including large, tight to overturned folds such as the Huangchanggou synclinorium and associated thrusts such as the F3 fault. The development of these orogenic, predominantly NE-dipping structures, as well as accompanying NE-striking dextral shear and transform faults (such as the F2 fault) along the margin of the Laizishan Dome established the structural pattern of the deposit area. The NW-striking folds were refolded by NE-striking superimposed folds during post-collisional lateral transpression (J1) and NW-SE directed compression. Oblique stress distribution gave rise to NS-trending compression and EW-trending extension, with dilational zones developing at the intersection of the F2 and the F3 faults east of the Laizishan dome. It is these dextral- and sinistral-normal dilational zones in which gold was precipitated during the main ore-forming event at Jinfeng. Following the main ore stage lithospheric extension occurred during the Yanshan stage (J2-K) resulting in minor reverse faults that in places cut pre-existing structures. The above four main structural deformation stages mirror the evolution of the Youjiang Basin from inception to basin inversion and post-orogenic collapse and renewed extension. Significant gold metallogenesis at Jinfeng occurred during the transition from collisional compression to extensional tectonics in the early Jurassic, and is focussed into intersections of F2 and F3 and fault splays adjacent to F3. This structurally controlled gold metallogenic model is likely to be applicable to analogous settings elsewhere in the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi triangle area, and has implications for the targeting of Carlin-type gold mineralization in this region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","34","Gold deposits","Deposits - Domes - Fault slips - Faulting - Metals - Mineralogy - Ores - Transform faults","Compression directions - Extensional tectonics - Jinfeng (Lannigou) - Lithospheric extension - Metallogenesis - Southwest China - Structural deformation - Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi region","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 482 Mineralogy - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines",,"Number: 200911007-28, Acronym: MLR, Sponsor: Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2007CB411405, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2007CB411407, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We would like to thank Sino Gold Mining Limited (Australia) for their financial and logistical support, and their permission to publish this paper.

Firstly, the square direction gradient method was applied to extract the rough direction of the fingerprint field, and then the quality of the fingerprint was evaluated by using the gradient consistency based on the weights. The quality block was divided into four levels. Subsequently the neighborhood discrimination method was performed to correct the misjudged fingerprint block. After correcting the misjudged quality block, the number of the evaluated blocks in the neighboring block was counted. Thereafter, the blocks with the same quality score were divided into three priority levels. Finally, the fingerprint orientation field was iteratively calculated according to the quality and priority. During the iteration process, different weight values were assigned according to the square gradient of the neighborhoods of the block to be evaluated. After the iteration of the evaluation block was completed, the final orientation field was obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the reliability of the low-quality region through quality diffusion, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the regions with poor reliability. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with two different potential evapotranspiration formulations, i.e. the Thornthwaite and Penman–Monteith equations, (denoted as SPEI-Th and SPEI-Pm, respectively) are two popular drought indices used today. These two SPEI versions have the limitations of overestimation of drought (as a response to global warming) and high data requirements, respectively. A new SPEI variant was developed with precipitation and pan evaporation (Epan) as its inputs (denoted as SPEI-Pe), which overcomes the shortcomings of SPEI-Pm and SPEI-Th. Climatic data at ground stations in the Yunnan Province (YP) of China were collected to validate this new SPEI variant with SPEI-Pm as the standard measure. Month-by-month comparison of SPEIs suggested that SPEI-Pe had a better agreement with the SPEI-Pm standard than SPEI-Th, with the criterion measures of mean absolute error and refined index of agreement (dr). The sensitivity analysis showed that two energy variables, net and global radiation are the most influential factors for evapotranspiration, and for SPEI-Pm and differences between SPEI-Pm and other two variants too. The validity of SPEI-Pe was also tested against the historical drought records in YP. Results demonstrated that SPEI-Pe generally agreed with historical drought events at different durations with only several exceptions, and thus it had a comparable performance to identify drought episodes with the other two SPEI variants in YP. The results suggest that SPEI-Pe has a better agreement with SPEI-Pm than SPEI-Th, and that it provides a good replacement for the standard measure when underlying climatic data (especially the energy variables) are not available. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society","28","Evapotranspiration","Atmospheric radiation - Drought - Evaporation - Global warming - Sensitivity analysis","Drought disasters - Index of agreements - Influential factors - Mean absolute error - Potential evapotranspiration - Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index - Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2013BAB06B01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015B00114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: IAM201510, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015M580450, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 201501004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51509067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41330854, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41371063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 51509067, 41330854, 41371063), National Natural Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (no. 2013BAB06B01), Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry of the Ministry of Water Resources of China (no. 201501004), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (no. 2015B00114), Project Funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 2015M580450) and Research Funds for Arid Meteorology (no.

The zone is characterized by four stages of deformation (D1-D4). D1 structures record early compressive deformation during the Indosinian orogeny, which formed tight to isoclinal F1 folds of bedding with a penetrative S1 foliation developed parallel to fold axial planes. Mid-crustal horizontal shearing during D2 resulted in overprinting of D1 structures. D1 and D2 structures are associated with granulite facies metamorphism. D3 doming resulted in late crustal thickening and the development of a regional NW-SE trending F3 antiform. Synchronous with or slightly subsequent to D3 deformation, the zone experienced D4 ductile strike-slip shearing, resulting in its exhumation to shallow crustal levels and retrograde metamorphism. Granitic D4 mylonites predominantly yield 40Ar/39Ar mica ages of 15-16 Ma, indicating that D4 dextral strike-slip shearing occurred in the Miocene. Weakly deformed leucogranite and protomylonite yield 40Ar/39Ar ages of 10-11 Ma, suggesting that ductile strike-slip shearing continued to the Late Miocene. The new 40Ar/39Ar data indicate that escape-related deformation along the Gaoligong strike-slip shear zone occurred in the Miocene. In association with recent geophysical studies, and on the basis of the structural, crystal preferred orientation (CPO), and geochronological data presented in this paper, we suggest that the Gaoligong metamorphic zone formed in response to intracontinental transpression in the southeast of Tibet, characterized as intense deformation and metamorphism at middle-upper crustal levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","71","Deformation","Geochronology - Mica - Shearing - Structure (composition) - Tectonics","Axial planes - Compressive deformations - CPOs - Crustal levels - Crustal thickenings - Crystal preferred orientations - Gaoligong metamorphic zone - Granulite facies - Intense deformation - Late Miocene - Leucogranites - Miocene - Mylonites - Strike-slip shear zones - Tectonic implications - Transpression - Western yunnan","951 Materials Science - 604.1 Metal Cutting - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 482.2 Minerals - 481.1 Geology - 422 Strength of Building Materials; Test Equipment and Methods - 421 Strength of Building Materials; Mechanical Properties",,"Number: 20070420065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 40802050, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40872149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scientists (Grant numbers 40802050 and 40872149 ) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number 20070420065 ).

The deposit is related to a porphyry intrusion (~216 Ma), which was emplaced in the Upper Triassic sedimentary rocks of the Tumugou and Qugasi Formations. At the Langdu skarn copper deposit, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of fresh limestones (δ18O = 3.0–5.6 ‰ relative to V-SMOW; δ13C = 24.5–25.7 ‰ relative to PDB) and partly altered limestones (δ18O = 27–7.2 to −1.9 ‰; δ13C = 11.8–15.2 ‰) indicated that the deposit was a typical marine carbonate source. Oxygen and carbon isotope values for calcites formed at different hydrothermal stages are −9.1 to 0.2 and 10.1–16.3 ‰, respectively. Moreover, the carbon–oxygen isotopic composition of an ore-forming fluid (δ18O = 5.0–9.5 ‰, δ13C = −7.3 to −5.3 ‰) suggested the presence of magmatic water, which most likely came from the differentiation or melting of a homologous magma chamber. The deposition of Calcite I may arise from metasomatism in an open system with a progressively decreasing temperature. Later, the minerals chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz and Calcite II were precipitated due to immiscibility.

The ore-bodies are located in the cataclastic dolomite of the Lvzhijiang Formation which was controlled by diapir structure. This study suggests that not all diapir hosts ore-bodies. Diapir may be divided into the ore-controlling type and non-ore-controlling type. The two types of diapirs have obviously different macro-distribution, petrography, and geochemical characteristics. The rocks from the ore-controlling type diapir have composition and pre-tectonic recrystallization more complex than these of the non-ore-controlling type diapir. Moreover, the rocks in the ore-controlling type diapir are closely related to crypto-explosions as indicated by the intermediate-acid crystal tuff breccias and dacite breccias. In addition, the geochemical characteristics of rocks from the ore-controlling type diapir have higher MgO contents (3.18% to 15.64%), and widely varied FeO/Fe2O3ratios (0.43-28.50), whereas the tuffite and sericite slate from the non-ore-controlling type diapir have lower MgO contents (1.90%-3.77%,) and narrow ranges of FeO/Fe2O3ratios (0.14-0.56).

Then with the aid of 10 m × 10 m resolution DEM and the GIS platform, several impact factors, such as elevation, slope aspect, earthquake intensity, and distance from drainages are used to analyze the spatial distribution of the coseismic and pre-earthquake landslides by employing two indexes include LAP (Landslide Area Percentage) and LND (Landslide Number Density). © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","28","Earthquakes","Antennas - Landslides - Risk analysis - Risk assessment - Spatial distribution - Spatial variables measurement","Aerial Photographs - Earthquake intensity - Earthquake-induced landslides - Landslide areas - Number density - Spatial distribution analysis - Visual interpretation - Yunnan province","484 Seismology - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics - 922 Statistical Methods - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Aimed at the situation of supporting difficulty of deep granite tunnel at a Metal mine in Yunnan province, through the X-ray diffraction, free swelling ratio test and slaking test, the destabilizing mechanism of the granite tunnel is studied and its supporting measures were proposed. Finally, the numerical simulation was used to analyze the supporting effect. The results show that: (1) the granite contains plentiful high hydrophilicity clay minerals, its average free swelling ratio is up to 27.17%, after comparing, the granite can be classified as the medium-strong swelling soft rock. (2) The failure mechanism of granite tunnel can be understood as a constantly swelling, slaking and disintegration process of granite under water condition, while the existence of clay minerals is just the critical reason resulting in aggravated deformation of granite. (3) Through simulation calculation and analysis, the proposed combined supporting measures, bolts anchoring in the roof, sidewalls and floor (bolt length is 1.8 m, bolt space is 0.75 m × 1.0 m), shotcrete (thickness is 10 cm), floor counter-arch poured (thickness is 25 cm), are reasonable and feasible.

Our new observations from northwestern Yunnan, China, and northwestern Vietnam on different sides of the shear zone demonstrate that the sinistral offset was ∼600 km according to correlations of Permian-Triassic flood basalt successions and late Paleogene highly potassic mafic magmas. We conclude that the shear was propagating on the South China continental margin and does not correspond to a suture between South China and Indochina. Furthermore, the highly potassic magmas were emplaced from ca. 40 to 30 Ma, before the shear movement, which was caused by the late Oligocene to early Miocene (ca. 27-22 Ma) extrusion activity. This suggests that a late Eocene to early Oligocene intraplate extension, possibly induced by delamination of thickened continental lithosphere, took place in north- western Yunnan (or eastern Tibet) as a response to the India-Asia collision. This extension, and sea-floor spreading of the South China Sea that began ca. 30 Ma, could have accounted for the initiation of the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone.","35","Extrusion","Basalt - Lithology - Rivers - Structural geology","Continental lithosphere - Continental margin - Early Oligocene - Left-lateral movements - Northwestern Yunnan - Red River Shear Zone - Seafloor spreading - South China sea","481.1 Geology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The mineralization is closely associated with K-feldspathization, fluoritization and pyritization, which can be divided into four ore-forming stages: skarn, quartz-cassiterite, quartz-sulfide and carbonate. Major, trace and rare earth element characteristics of the least altered granites, chloritized-epidotized granites and K-feldspathized granite ores, as well as the sulfur and lead isotopic features of the pyrites from this deposit were systematically studied. The results show that the ores are rich in W, Bi, Sn, Cu, Zn and Ag. REE characteristics of the granite ores and chloritized-epidotized granites are similar to those of the least altered granites, indicating a close relationship between the mineralization and granite. Sulfur isotopic features of the pyrites are similar to the basalt and basalt ores developed in Kafang Cu-Sn polymetallic deposit adjacent to the Xi'ao deposit, implying that the basalt probably was a source of Cu. Lead isotopic characteristics indicated a mixing origin of ore forming elements. Eu anomalies, fraction of Y and Ho, and high Y/Ho ratios suggested that the ore forming fluid was high temperature and fluorine rich. Combined with the widespread fluorite and K-feldspar, and previous results on fluid inclusions, we suggest that the ore-forming fluid was of high temperature and riched in CO2and potassium and fluorine, which is similar to the intrusion-related hydrothermal deposits developed in the collisional orogeny, implying the deposit was formed in the post-collisional extensional tectonic setting.","26","Copper alloys","Basalt - Binary alloys - Deposits - Exploratory geochemistry - Feldspar - Feldspar deposits - Fluorine - Fluorspar - Granite - Isotopes - Mineralogy - Ore deposits - Pyrites - Quartz - Rare earths - Sulfur compounds - Tectonics - Tin alloys - Trace elements","Extensional tectonics - Geochemical characteristic - Geochemical features - Geological significance - Isotopic characteristics - Polymetallic - Tectonic settings - Yunnan province","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The nature of cloud computing requires cloud data processing systems that can handle huge volumes of data and have high performance. However, most cloud storage systems currently adopt a hash-like approach to retrieving data that only supports simple keyword-based enquiries, but lacks various forms of information search. Therefore, a scalable and efficient indexing scheme is clearly required. In this paper, we present a skip list-based cloud index, called SLC-index, which is a novel, scalable skip list-based indexing for cloud data processing. The SLC-index offers a two-layered architecture for extending indexing scope and facilitating better throughput. Dynamic load-balancing for the SLC-index is achieved by online migration of index nodes between servers. Furthermore, it is a flexible system due to its dynamic addition and removal of servers. The SLC-index is efficient for both point and range queries. Experimental results show the efficiency of the SLC-index and its usefulness as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures. © 2018, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","27","Data handling","Cloud computing - Digital storage - Indexing (materials working) - Indexing (of information) - Search engines","Cloud applications - Cloud data processing - Cloud storage systems - Distributed index - Flexible system - Information search - Layered architecture - Skip listes","722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis",,"Number: 2017SE206, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Foundation item: Projects(61363021, 61540061, 61663047) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Project(2017SE206) supported by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, China Received date: 2017−07−11; Accepted date: 2018−01−09 Corresponding author: ZHOU Wei, PhD, Professor; E-mail: zwei@ynu.edu.cn; ORCID: 0000-0002-5881-9436",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, negative co-location patterns, which are strong negative associated but whose participation index are less than a minimum prevalence threshold, sometimes would include great valuable information. In this paper, the concept of the negative co-location patterns is defined. Based on the analysis of the relationship between negative and positive participation index, methods for negative participation index calculation and negative patterns pruning strategies are given. The methods make it possible to discover both positive and negative co-locations efficiently.

To construct and improve the fidelity of traffic flow scenarios on the driving simulator, simulated traffic flows under two special traffic volumes with and without the climbing lane were obtained from VISSIM. Thirty-two subjects were selected to drive on the test road in the driving simulator. On the basis of the simulation results, comparison evaluations of speed and track lateral position of the test vehicle along the section with and without climbing lane were conducted. In addition some simulation experiments from VISSIM were done to find the threshold of traffic volume for the setting of climbing lane. The result shows that there is a higher and steady speed after setting a climbing lane under different given traffic volumes. Moreover, it reduces conflicts with cars from the opposite direction.

In the northernmost part of the zone in the vicinity of the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, it consists of mylonitic gneiss, granite, and schist. Based on field relations and mineral assemblages, the rocks are classified into gneiss belt in the west limb, including banded gneiss, augen mylonite and migmatite gneiss, and schist belt in the east limb. Except for the massive granite pluton, the other three tectonites are affected by polystage deformation (D1-D4). Fold deformation of the first stage D1 is isoclinal to tight pattern with nearly N-S fold axes and steeply axial planar cleavage S1, which resulted in the local crustal thickening under a contractive setting. D2 overprinted D1 and is characterized by tight folds with steep axes and N-S fold axial planar, which are also characterized by large-scale ductile strike-slip shear foliation S2, parallel to the nearly N-S trending axial planes of D1 and D2. The structural pattern of D2 represents a transpression along the zone. D3 occurred during the late stage of the transpression or post-transpression, producing the NW-SE and NE-SW trending strike-slip faults of the third stage D3. Following the D3 deformation, the zone was exhumed to shallow crustal level where the various tectonites underwent a brittle transtensional deformation D4, combined with one N-S trending strike-slip component and one normal faulting component. Structures and previous geochronologies presented in the paper suggest that the study area is correlated with those in the adjacent tectonic zones, Ailaoshan-Red River shear zone and Gaoligong shear zone in the western Yunnan. It underwent intensive polyphase deformation, namely, crustal thickening, transpression, and transtension, responding to syn-collision and post-collision of India-Eurasia from 65 Ma to current period east of the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","54","Deformation","Granite - Minerals - Structural geology - Tectonics","Axial planes - Brittle deformation - Crustal levels - Crustal thickenings - Late stage - Migmatite - Mineral assemblage - Mylonites - polystage deformation - Post-collision - Shear zone - Strike-slip component - Strike-slip fault - Structural feature - Structural pattern - Study areas - Tertiary - Transpression - Transtension - Transtensional deformation - Western yunnan","421 Strength of Building Materials; Mechanical Properties - 422 Strength of Building Materials; Test Equipment and Methods - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals",,"Number: 20070420065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 40802050, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: UWO, Sponsor: Western University; ","We thank Wang Erqi for suggestions on Tertiary structural evolution of western Yunnan.

The massif, exposed in the southeastern segment of the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone, reveals a rapid cooling in the early Miocene (25-21 Ma) after a very slow cooling ca. 34-25 Ma. The slow cooling period most likely resulted from a geothermal perturbation in the lithosphere owing to the late Paleogene (40-30 Ma) extension in eastern Tibet and western Yunnan, China. The rapid cooling, consistent with evidence of a wider rapid cooling span from 27 to 17 Ma compiled from the entire Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone, constrains the duration of left-lateral shearing, which eventually offset Indochina from South China by about 600 km. The time constraints we have established reinforce the argument that the onset of the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone postdates the opening of the South China Sea that began ca. 30 Ma. This result highlights the necessity for reevaluating the Cenozoic tectonic models of Southeast Asia.","24","Rivers","Structural geology","Cenozoic tectonics - Early Miocene - Lateral shearings - Red River Shear Zone - South China sea - Southeast Asia - Time constraints - Western yunnan","481.1 Geology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Tomicus beetles are secondary pests in temperate regions and the aggressiveness of the beetles in SW China is considered to be due to the warm subtropical climates as well as the beetles’ virulent fungal associates. Here, we assessed the virulence of three blue-stain fungi (Leptographium wushanense, L. sinense and Ophiostoma canum) associated with pine shoot beetles to Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis) in SW China. Following fungal inoculation, we measured necrotic lesion lengths, antioxidant enzyme activities and monoterpene concentrations in the stem phloem of Yunnan pine. Leptographium wushanense induced twice as long lesions as L. sinense and O. canum, and all three fungi induced significantly longer lesions than sterile agar control inoculations. The activity of three tested antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and superoxide dismutase) increased after both fungal inoculation and control inoculation. However, L. wushanense and L. sinense generally caused a greater increase in enzyme activities than O. canum and the control treatment. Fungal inoculation induced stronger increases in six major monoterpenes than the control treatment, but the difference was significant only for some fungus-monoterpene combinations. Overall, our results show that L. wushanense and L. sinense elicit stronger defense responses and thus are more virulent to Yunnan pine than O. canum. The two Leptographium species may thus contribute to the aggressiveness of their beetle vectors and could damage Yunnan pine across SW China if they spread from the restricted geographical area they have been found in so far. © 2018 Pan, Zhao, Krokene, Yu, Qiao, Lu, Chen and Ye.","63","Monoterpenes","Antioxidants - Enzymes - Fungi - Network security","Defense response - L. sinense - Leptographium wushanense - Ophiostoma canum - Reaction zones","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: 2013-1477, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; Number: 229-2011-890, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; ","We thank Yong-liang Wang and Dong-mei Wu (Yunnan University) for assistance in field and laboratory work, and the Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory Resources of the Ministry of Education for providing experimental facilities.

The concentration spatial and temporal profiles (Ce(z, t)s) are obtained from a single experiment using an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens. The concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is assumed to be a polynomial D(C) = D0 × (1 + α1C + α2C2 + α3C3 + …), where D0 is diffusion coefficient in infinite dilute solution, α1, α2 and α3 are under-determined parameters. The finite difference method (FDM) is applied to solve numerically Fick diffusion equation, the calculated concentration profiles (Cn(z, t)s) by varying the under-determined parameters are compared with the profile Ce(z, t), the parameters(α1, α2, α3, …) corresponding the minimum concentration standard deviation are selected to determine D(C). To verify the proposed method, we have carried out the diffusion experiment of ethylene glycol aqueous solution, the obtained concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with literature values. On the other hand, the obtained polynomial D(C) has been used to calculate refractive index profiles (nn(z, t)s). Based on the nn(z, t)s, ray tracing method has been applied to simulate the diffusion images, which fit the experimental images very well over a wider range of diffusion time, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable in rapidly measuring concentration-dependent liquid diffusion coefficients with high accuracy and stability. © 2019","31","Diffusion","Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Finite difference method - Lenses - Liquids - Optical data processing - Polynomials - Ray tracing - Refractive index - Solution mining","Concentration dependent diffusion coefficients - Concentration-dependent - Cylindrical lens - Finitedifference methods (FDM) - Infinite dilute solutions - Liquid diffusion coefficient - Ray-tracing method - Refractive index profiles","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.1 Algebra - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,"Number: 11804296, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant no. 11804296), Joint Key Project of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2018FY001-020) and Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Fund (Grant no. 2016CYH05).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Secondly, the non-native speech data is transcribed based on the baseline HMM models. In more detail, we analyze the error recognition rates of all initials and all finals, and their typical substitute error. The results obtained from our experiments might be useful for adapting a native speaker ASR system to model non-native accented data. ©2004 IEEE.","5","Speech analysis","Error detection - Iterative methods - Microphones - Parameter estimation - Semantics - Speech recognition - Technology transfer - Vocabulary control","Acoustic-phonetic analysis - Mandarin speech recognition - Non-native speakers - Pronunciation dictionary adaptation","903.2 Information Dissemination - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 901.4 Impact of Technology on Society - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 752.1 Acoustic Devices - 731.1 Control Systems - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 751.5 Speech","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Medical radiologists normally describe the tumor in words, making reference to its mass, shape and margins. Meanwhile, pattern recognition specialists have their own methodologies. Since there are significant gaps between two approaches, it has proven to be very difficult for those following the pattern recognition route to directly adapt parameters of mass, shape and margins for the automated recognition of different cancers. This paper describes a joint R&D project of Yunnan University & Yunnan First People's Hospital. A meta-shape tool and conjugate meta-feature clustering technology have been developed. These represent initial steps in the descriptions of mass, shape and margins on the road towards possible Automated Mammograph Image Analysis. In this model, ten meta-shape feature clusters are used to provide a systematic means of representing different cancerous symptoms. To indicate potential applications, a group of selected results are outlined to illustrate possible linkages between the two approaches. © 2005 IEEE.","33","Image analysis","Feature extraction - Mammography - Parameter estimation - Tumors","Breast cancer detection - Convexity property - Feature clustering - Meta shape feature extraction - Micro calcification clusters","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.7 Health Care - 731.1 Control Systems - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 741.1 Light/Optics - 746 Imaging Techniques","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
