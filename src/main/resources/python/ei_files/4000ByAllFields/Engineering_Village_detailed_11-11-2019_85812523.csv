In our protocol, the ATIM window is divided into two windows. The first window is called deciding channel window (DCW). The source nodes and destination nodes can negotiate to decide a channel that can be used to compete the final data channel in the DCW. The second window is called exchanging packet window (EPW). The pair source node and destination node can compete to get a channel to transfer packets in the EPW. This mechanism can distribute pair source node and destination node to compete data channel. Hence, the collisions can be avoided greatly and throughput can be increased. The simulation results show that our protocol successfully exploits to use bandwidth of multiple channels effectively. © 2009 IEEE.","6","Mobile ad hoc networks","Internet protocols - Medium access control - Mobile computing","Data channels - Destination nodes - Distributed channels - Multi-channel MAC protocols - Multiple channels - Source nodes","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the dynamic processes involved in the evolution and deformation of the region remain poorly understood due to a lack of reliable geophysical observations. We collected abundant seismic data recorded by 108 permanent broadband stations deployed in the SE margin of Tibet since 2000, and obtained 4536 pairs of P-wave receiver functions (PRFs) with high signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we have implemented a novel two-step data inversion procedure that can reduce the dependence of the inversion results on the initial model. We first use low-frequency PRFs obtained by iterative deconvolution in the time domain, and then an initial model consisting of a series of 2-km-thick isotropic layers to fit velocity models, and thus determine an overall statistical solution by means of the bootstrap resampling technique. This statistical solution is then regarded as a new initial model to adjust high-frequency PRFs. Hence, the same resampling process is executed again to estimate the optimal S-wave velocity structure below each station. The results provide an accurate 3D image of the crust and uppermost mantle in the SE margin of Tibet. We infer a wide intra-crustal low-velocity zone that varies laterally and in depth, which is thinner or even absent in the most southern part of Yunnan. Our hypothesis is that this low-velocity zone is the result of the accumulation of lower crustal flow coming from central Tibet. Furthermore, we show that this lower crustal flow extends largely through the Sichuan–Yunnan diamond-shaped block, and that there are significant variations in both crustal velocity structure and deformation mechanism across the great strike-slip faults of the Jinshajiang–Red River and Xiaojiang fault systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","66","Time domain analysis","Acoustic wave velocity - Deformation - Iterative methods - Sampling - Seismic waves - Seismology - Shear waves - Signal receivers - Signal to noise ratio - Strike-slip faults - Wave propagation","Bootstrap technique - Low velocity zones - Lower crustal flows - Receiver functions - southeast margin of Tibet - two-step inversion","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: 41464003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are very grateful to the editor Dr. Arthur Snoke and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions that made possible a better presentation of this paper.

According to the relationship between activity and density of catalyst found in this paper, theory of air accelerating classification was built and the particle dynamical equation was developed. Based on the theory of air acceleration classification, calculation was made with the Fluent software and EDEM software, based on the standard k- turbulence model and the Eulerian model. The coupled CFD-EDM simulation of material separation was performed to analyze the state of particle and column and obtain the statistics of particle in the classification column, which can help to study further of classification mechanism and particle movement in column and the experiment results are consistent with simulation. The maximum separating efficiency was up to 89%, which verified the possibility of air accelerating classification applied in separating different activity catalysts.

The mutation operations are executed according to this ratio, which can generate as more feasible individuals as possible. In addition, the objective space is also divided into grids to find non-dominated solutions, which can reduce the computation time evidently. Xperimental results show that these technologies based on space-gridding can improve the efficiency of the algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","14","Multiobjective optimization","Constrained optimization - Evolutionary algorithms","Computation time - Constrained multi-objective optimizations - Feasible ratio - Gridding - Multi-objective optimization problem - Mutation operations - Nondominated solutions - Uniform distribution","921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Herein, we report that Fe-MIL-101 possesses an intrinsic enzyme mimicking activity similar to that found in natural horseradish peroxidase and shows highly catalytic activity even at neutral pH. The Michaelis constant (Km) of Fe-MIL-101 with H2O2as the substrate is about 616-fold (at pH 4.0) and 20-fold (at pH 7.0) smaller than free natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), indicating a much higher affinity for H2O2than HRP and most of the peroxidase mimetics. Moreover, Fe-MIL-101 was successfully used to detect cancer cells by conjugating folic acid onto Fe-MIL-101 without any surface modification. The detection limit of the method for HeLa cells was estimated to be 50 cells and the reaction colour produced with 10 cells could also be observed by the naked eye.

Results: By supplying the MFCs with seafood wastewater, the maximum power density produced from the SCMFC was higher than that produced from the DCMFC, which is a consequence of the difference in internal resistance of the two systems. The electrochemical reduction of oxygen catalyzed by C/CoTMPP was comparable with that promoted by commercial C/Pt catalyst. The SCMFC achieved higher organic degradation than the DCMFC, which corresponded to less accumulation of volatile fatty acids being decomposed aerobically promoted by the oxygen diffused from the cathode in the absence of the membrane. Owing to electron losses via aerobic decomposition rather than the electricity-producing pathway, the higher removal efficiency was in line with the low coulombic efficiency. In addition, the DCMFC having a membrane had a more severe pH polarization than the SCMFC without the membrane. Conclusions: This study provides a conceptual demonstration of sustainable utilization of seafood wastewater while carrying out biological decomposition in an MFC system in an economical manner. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.","20","Microbial fuel cells","Economic analysis - Efficiency - Electric power generation - Electrocatalysts - Electrolysis - Electrolytic reduction - Meats - Oxygen - Volatile fatty acids - Wastewater treatment","Aerobic decomposition - Biological decomposition - Electricity generation - Electrochemical reductions - Maximum power density - Removal efficiencies - Simultaneous degradation - Sustainable utilization","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 461.8 Biotechnology - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The method takes the structural distribution of the foreground into account, and a structured sparsity constraint is used on the foreground pixels. Moreover, a two-stage framework based on motion saliency is introduced to address the parameter setting issue in dynamic background videos and to tune regularization parameters adaptively. Motion block candidates are obtained by using the low rank and structured sparsity decomposition in the first step. Then, motion saliency analysis is applied to these candidates and the adapt block sparsity decomposition is used to detect the foreground in the second step. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is more adaptive than the existing foreground detection methods based on matrix decomposition in complex videos, and that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods according to the precision and recall results on dataset I2R. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

The control method is implemented on the Baxter® robot with a brush attached on the endpoint of its arm to imitate human writing skills, and a MYO sensor is used to measure the surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals generated by contractions of human muscles involved in writing tasks. A haptic device Sensable® Omni is used to control the motion of the Baxter® robot arm, and V-Rep® is employed to simulate the movement of the arm and to calculate the inverse kinematic of Baxter® robot arm. All the communications for Baxter® robot, V-Rep simulator, Omni device and MYO are integrated in MATLAB®/Simulink®. The main test is to make the Baxter® arm following the movement of a human subject when writing with Omni stylus, and the EMG signals are processed using low pass filter and moving average technique to extract the smoothed envelope which is utilised to control the variation of position instead of variation of force along the vertical Z axis, so when the operator writes with force variations, the Baxter® can draw lines with variable thickness. This imitation system is successfully tested to make the Baxter® arm to follow the writing movement of the operator's hand and would have potential applications in more complicated human robot teleoperation tasks such as tele-rehabilitation and tele-surgery. © 2015 IEEE.","16","Electromyography","Automation - Inverse kinematics - Low pass filters - MATLAB - Remote control - Robotic arms","Control methods - Electromyographic - Force variation - Moving average technique - sEMG - Teleoperated robots - Telerehabilitation - Variable thickness","703.2 Electric Filters - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 921 Mathematics - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: EP/L026856/1, Acronym: EPSRC, Sponsor: Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","This work was supported in part by EPSRC grants EP/L026856/1 and EP/J004561/1, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61473120, Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China 2014A030313266, State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT) SKLRS-2014-MS-05, the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University under Grant NCET-12-0195, and National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) Grant No. 2015AA042303.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through the definition of the coupling of highway traffic risks under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions and combined with the role of highway traffic risk indexes, the coupling model of highway traffic risks under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions was constructed by dint of N-K model and the improved coupling degree model. The coupling degrees of various elements of the coupling model with single risk factor and double risk factors were calculated. The risk levels of various kinds of couplings were quantified. Finally, the correlation mechanism of highway traffic risk values and risk components under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions was analyzed. The results show that strong couplings will aggravate the consequences of risks, ultimately causing a sharp increase in risk volume or a new form of risks to conduct and spread in the system after the coupling mutation. “Sharp turns”, one of the geological environment elements in Yunnan plateau areas, and the couplings of other elements usually present strong couplings. The coupling degrees of “rain” and “fog”, meteorological environment essential elements, with other elements are high. The local codes and standards for the minimum turning radius, the speed limit, the load and the distance between the trucks during rainy and foggy days in the plateau areas should be strengthened. As time goes by, the number of strong couplings declines from 10 to 7 and the coupling degrees show a significant downward trend, which indicates that the degree of accident risks resulting from the coupling of geological and meteorological elements in 2015 is declining compared with the previous three years. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Assessing standards and methods of cropland soil pollution play important role in reference of results. Taking the croplands of Chichangping village in the Middle Reaches of the Bi River as research area, this paper measures the contents of four kinds of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, As) through field sampling and laboratory analysis. Evaluates the pollution degree by using the Soil Background Value of both Yunnan Province and China, and the Standard Value of National Soil Environmental Quality (Grade II) with three assessing methods: the pollution index, the geo-accumulation index and the potential ecological risk index. The results indicate: (1) the cropland soils of Chichangping village are polluted seriously whatever the soil standard value and assessing methods is used. The pollution order is Cd (severe pollution) > Pb (light-severe pollution) > Zn (middle-severe pollution) > As (no pollution). The polluting sources come from the Lanping Lead-Zinc Mine; (2) The pollution degree is higher with the background value of both Yunnan Province and China than the National Soil Environmental Standard (Grade II). The pollution degree is consistent with the background value of both Yunnan Province and China. Therefore, it is more reasonable to use background value as assessing standards in soil environment quality evaluation. (3) Because heavy metals have different toxic to crops, it is necessary to use the advantage of the pollution index and the potential ecological risk index in assessing soil pollution, and to consider both mean and maximum in using the potential ecological risk index in order to a better understanding of heavy metal pollution. © 2011 IEEE.","20","River pollution","Biomedical engineering - Heavy metals - Quality control - Risk assessment - Rivers - Rural areas - Soil pollution - Soils - Zinc mines","Assessing standards and methods - Environmental quality - Environmental science - Geo-accumulation index - Heavy metal pollution - Integrated assessment - Potential ecological risk - Soil environmental standards","453 Water Pollution - 461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Due to the deposition of extra-thin Ge film on Si surface, the capabilities of discharge power and rate performance are improved obviously in the lithium insertion and extraction processes. It indicates that the optimal thickness of Si and Ge film in LIBs are 75 and 27 nm, respectively. The Ge/Si electrode exhibits excellent performance that the capacity retention of 78% after 500 cycles at a 4 A/g current density in the voltage range of 0.01–2.0 V, and the average lost of capacity is as low as 0.53 mAh/g per cycle.

Based on the formal definition of features, three important relations of consistent, gradation and overlap among features were investigated. According to the analysis of dependent and mutually exclusive relations among feature properties, requirements for software evolution and intentions for software evolution were formally defined. Requirements for software evolution were normalized as from first evolution requirements normal form (1ERNF) to 4ERNF. The normalization process provides a method to transform requirements for software evolution to intentions for software evolution. The results show that the five important properties of requirements for software evolution are embodied in RSEMM.

This means that the power demand has increased and the fuel efficiency has decreased in vehicles. Thus, we recognize the need for power saving in automotive systems. As a result, the automotive industry has released a new method called 'Partial Networking' through 'Selective wake-up'. When a node of the existing vehicle receives the message of operation via the controller area network (CAN) bus, it receives all the messages, including those not related to itself. Thus, the node of the CAN bus is not able to actively distinguish between relevant messages. This means that the entire node is activated via the CAN bus. In contrast with existing vehicles, partial networking receives only relevant messages through a predefined message. Therefore, it is possible to activate each node individually. This is a method of power saving that maintains an inactive status in unnecessary nodes. In this paper, we measure the effect of power saving using a partial networking technique. To accomplish this, we designed a scenario for the operation of a running vehicle. We analyzed power consumption through a comparison between an existing vehicle network and a partial network based on the designed scenario. Finally, we show the possible power saving using partial networking in an automotive system. © 2015 IEEE.","15","Automation","Automobile engines - Automotive industry - Control system synthesis - Controllers - Electric power utilization - Industrial electronics - Servomechanisms - Wakes","CAN communications - Electronic control units - In-vehicle networks - Partial networkings - Selective wake-ups","631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 661.1 Automotive Engines - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 732.1 Control Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Conducting medium and long term consumption pattern analysis of major customers can help the electricity providers grasp the changing trends of the future consumption, and thus better formulate the dedicated tariff offers and provide professional services according to various consumer demands. However, it's computationally costly and impossible to conduct such analysis for every single customer. To overcome this complexity, this paper aims to provide an effective solution to group customers into certain number of categories with similar electrical behavior by utilizing clustering techniques. By combining distance and correlation, a novel clustering validity indicator is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering procedure, which is subsequently helpful for choosing algorithms and the optimum number of clusters. Eventually, a case study has been conducted with electricity market data including various electricity customers from different industrial fields. Two frequently-used clustering algorithms have been employed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.","16","Clustering algorithms","Automation - Cluster analysis - Commerce - Electric industry - Electric load forecasting - Electric power transmission networks - Power markets - Public relations - Sales - Smart power grids","Clustering procedure - Clustering techniques - Consumption patterns - Customer relationship management - Data similarity - Electricity customer classification - Electricity customers - Professional services","706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Many control algorithms, including the PID method, have been proposed to restore normal glucose tolerance via closed-loop insulin regulation. This paper analyzes the physiologically plausible glucose feedback control system involving the islets-based controller and the nonlinear pharmacokinetic model for glucose and insulin interactions. The model consists of six differential equations, and the islets-based controller is represented by a sigmoidal function. Our study reveals that, unlike most controllers, the islets-based controller's glucose setpoint cannot be explicitly set because it is implicitly determined by the parameters of the controller and model. We establish mathematical formulas relating the setpoint to the controller gain and to the steady states of other variables in the model. We also use the Lyapunov's linearization stability criterion to investigate system's local stability for a range of setpoint values. Finally, our simulation study shows that the islets-based controller moderately outperforms the linear PID controller optimized by a genetic algorithm. We conclude that developing more and better physiologically-inspired glucose controllers is important and promising. More research in that direction is needed. © 2015 IEEE.","25","Controllers","Adaptive control systems - Automation - Convergence of numerical methods - Differential equations - Feedback control - Genetic algorithms - Glucose - Insulin - Medical problems - Physiological models - Physiology - Stability criteria - Three term control systems","Blood glucose concentration - Glucose feedbacks - Insulin regulation - Mathematical formulas - Normal glucose tolerances - Pharmacokinetic model - Sigmoidal functions - Simulation studies","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 732.1 Control Equipment - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.2 Calculus - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The wavelet de-noising lacks directivity and does not preserve image details, which limits its effectiveness. To solve the problem, an adaptive threshold de-noising method based on wavelet transformation is employed. As to misalignment, a registration method basis of shape context descriptor is proposed to accurately align multiple MR image sequences. In order to achieve better MRI de-noising capabilities, a new threshold criteria that is adaptive to the noise distribution in the high and low sub bands is developed to replace traditional threshold function used in wavelet transform denoising. Multiple sequences MRI registration are performed by identifying edge points with matching shape context firstly. Then, an iterative procedure is invoked to obtain the deformation field, which determines the B-spline interpolated output image. Experimental results show that the de-nosing method removes image noise effectively whilst preserving original information. The registration method can reach an overlap of 96%±0.8 between multi-sequence MR image. © 2015 IEEE.","18","Magnetic resonance imaging","Alignment - Automation - Iterative methods - Wavelet transforms","Adaptive thresholds - atherosclerotic - De-nosing - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - registration - Registration methods - Threshold functions - Wavelet transformations","601.1 Mechanical Devices - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 746 Imaging Techniques - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Needle sharing drove the epidemic and HIV spread rapidly to IDUs in neighboring cities and along drug trafficking routes. By 2002, HIV was present amongst IDUs in all mainland Chinese provinces. It is believed that IDUs may have been the core source for all later subepidemics in China. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is the dominant paradigm in social complex network simulation which allows one to simulate the complex systems emerge from the bottom-up are composed of a multitude of heterogeneous objects called agents. This article puts forward an HIV/AIDS spatial and temporal transmission model of IDUs based on the multivalent system and geographic information systems (GIS) in an urban environment, and simulates the HIV/AIDS spatial and temporal transmission process among injection drug users during 10 years on the Repast Simphony1.2 platform. In the model, the crowd is classified into 5 types: healthy person, HIV person, AIDS person, IDU person and HIV-IDU person. Individuals represented by agents are associated to places where they interact with each other. The relationship among different agents is described with random social network. To better represent individuals in reality, each agent has its only sex, age, career, education, geographic location and other attributes. In each time step, the model defines these agents' specific behavioral rules. The model is implemented using the propagation of HIV/AIDS among injection drug users in Yunnan province southwest of China as a case study. The simulation results show that the number of initial HIV in injection drug users, the proportion of needle sharing and individual social impact have influence on the spread of HIV/AIDS in Kunming. The results also reveal the increasing HIV/AIDS transmission among injection drug users and interpret the necessity of carrying out solutions to contain the transmission of HIV/AIDS.","14","Diseases","Autonomous agents - Complex networks - Computational methods - Geographic information systems - Multi agent systems - Needles","Geographic location - Heterogeneous object - HIV/AIDS - Multi agent based simulations - Network simulation - Random network - Transmission model - Urban environments","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this work, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Na2S·9H2O and thioglycolic acid were used to prepare ZnS quantum dots through a facile water-bath method. The structure and morphology of the ZnS quantum dots were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used to observe the surface morphology of the test paper prepared by a simple dipping-drying process. The Co2+sensing properties of as-prepared test paper were investigated. And it was found that the color of as-fabricated test paper could change from white to brown within 1 min with addition of Co2+aqueous solution, which makes it possible for qualitative detection of Co2+through naked eyes. In this mode, a widely detectable range from 10 to 1000 mg L−1is reached by the test paper. In addition, through measuring the grey level of the test paper by ordinary smart phone and laptop, a semi-quantitative function of the test paper is realized. Moreover, the as-fabricated paper sensor can resist the interference of a serious cations and anions, and suits for a wide pH surrounding from 1.08 to 9.65, which makes it a promising Co2+sensor for practical use. In addition, through X-ray diffraction and UV–vis spectra, the sensing properties of as-fabricated test paper are attributed to the chemical reaction between as-prepared ZnS quantum dots and Co2+ions.

Electron microscopic images characterized the sizes of AuNPs. UV-Vis spectrometer was utilized to study the absorption spectra of gold colloid and the effect of different factors for synthesis. It is found that the quantity of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is an important factor in determining the formation of the final colloidal product. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to examine the crystalline structure of the AuNPs, and indicating the nanoparticles present a face-centered-cubic (fcc) crystalline structure. Moreover, the possible mechanism of the progress and the effect of NaOH on the reduction reaction were discussed. The alcohol and hydroxyl ions (OH-) are indispensable to generate the gold particles for one-step at room temperature in just few minutes.

The obtained powders were characterized by XRD, TEM, UV-Vis, PL, respectively. The results show that Zn-doping can decrease the phase transition temperature, broaden the absorption spectrum to the visible light region, and inhibit the recombination of photoelectron-hole pairs. The experiments of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) suggest that the photocatalytic activity of the Zn-TiO2 powders at n(Zn):n(Ti)=0.045 (molar ratio) and the calcinated temperature of 400°C was the best. Under the fluorescent light irradiation, the degradation rate of the Zn-TiO2 sample to methyl blue reaches 95.77%, which was obviously higher than 44.95% of P25, the pure TiO2 photocatalyst made in Degussa, German.","18","Zinc","Absorption spectroscopy - Aromatic compounds - Degradation - Photocatalysts - Powders - Sol-gel process - Titanium dioxide","Calcinated temperature - Fluorescent light - Nano-TiO - Photo catalytic degradation - Photo-catalytic - Photocatalytic activities - Visible light region - Zn-doping","536 Powder Metallurgy - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 813.1 Coating Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
