Many current MAC protocols use an exponential backoff mechanism. In that mechanism, a node picks a random backoff time uniformly in an interval that doubles in size after a collision or decreases to the minimum value after a successful transmission. It can cause unfairness problem to some nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient contention-based backoff mechanism for wireless ad hoc networks, namely, the adaptive efficiency-fairness tradeoff (AEFT) backoff algorithm, which provides not only a higher throughput and a larger fairness index, but also a tradeoff between efficiency and fairness. We increase the contention window when the channel is busy, and use an adaptive window to fast decrease the backoff time when the channel is idle by fair scheduling. The fair scheduling mainly adopts maximum successive transmission and collision limit to finish the fairness. © 2009 IEEE.","","13","Ad hoc networks","Efficiency - Medium access control - Mobile computing - Scheduling","Back-off mechanisms - Backoff algorithms - Distributed ad hoc networks - Efficiency and fairness - Efficiency fairness tradeoff - Exponential backoff - Medium access control protocols - Unfairness problem","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

But the quality of service (QoS) in grid cannot be guaranteed because of the complexity and diversity of grid environments. QoS parameters should be described for solving the QoS issues in grid. At present, a lot of works have been done on resources optimization on the grid, but less on the optimization of multi-dimensional QoS and the analysis of the multi-dimensional QoS optimization of resources. In this paper, we put forward a QoS-based grid banking model based on the idea of stratification. It is divided into the application-layer, the virtual organization layer, and the physical resources and facilities layer. At each layer, the consumer agent, service agent, and resource provider agent optimize the multi-dimensional QoS resources. The optimization is done within the framework of the grid banking model and the hierarchical constraints in their respective conditions so that it can maximize the utility function. The optimization algorithm at all levels has been presented. It uses the principle of market economy about the price of constant iteration and the interaction among all levels to carry out the Service Level Agreement. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","15","Quality of service","Economics - Iterative methods","Application layers - Multi dimensional - Optimization algorithms - Physical resources - Resource providers - Resources optimization - Service Level Agreements - Virtual organization","921.6 Numerical Methods - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The separation was performed on a reversed-phase EP-100-20/45-3-C18 capillary column (total length of 45 cm, effective length of 20 cm, diameter of 100 μm, ODS packing inside for 3 μm). The mobile phase ratio of organic phase, the concentration of phosphate buffer and sodium heptanesulfonate, separation voltage, and other experimental conditions were investigated and optimized. The mobile phase was 15 mM NaH2PO4 and 12 mM sodium heptanesulfonate (pH 3.0)/methanol (64:36) at a flow rate of 0.04 mL/min. Under optimal conditions including applied voltage of −4 kV and a UV detection wavelength of 230 nm, the six catechins in the tea were well separated. The calibration curves for the analytes had good linearity in the range of 8.02 μg/mL–202.13 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9928–0.9997. The limits of detection (LOD) for the six catechins were 4.62 μg/mL–11.63 μg/mL (S/N = 3). The recoveries of the six catechins were 96.2%–108.4% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) between 0.78% and 4.51%.

A hybrid sampling procedure combining the Gibber sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented to draw observations from the conditional distributions. Because missing data mechanism is not testable, we develop the logarithm of the pseudo-marginal likelihood, deviance information criterion, the Bayes factor, and the pseudo-Bayes factor to compare several competing missing data mechanism models in the current considered NRDMMs with nonignorable missing covaraites and responses.

Firstly, the key points including fingertips and valley points, which are called key points, are located from the hand contour image. Secondly, the middle finger is cropped from the hand image based on the information of the key points' positions and the knuckle's texture near the finger root. Finally, the fingerprint is extracted from the middle finger through the first knuckle's texture. Because of the low resolution of the fingerprint images, linear projection methods such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are used for fingerprint feature extraction.

In order to reduce the impact of water and soil erosion of sloping fields on the eutrophication of water and improve sustainability of fragile slopes, the field experiment was conducted in Kunming,Yunnan Province in 2011, where Yunlong reservoir is the largest city centralized drinking resource region of Kunming. And effects of different mixed grass strip treatments on reducing nitrogen and phosphorus losses in slope land of red soil were analyzed. Four treatments, including perennial ryegrass + alfalfa (A), perennial ryegrass+trifolium repens (B), natural vegetation(C) and without grass strip(CK), were designed with three replications in the slopes with 15°. The zone of grass strip standard was 3m*1m and sow seeding rate planted at the upper of slope land of each plot was 10 g/m2. Runoff and sediment were collected during maize growing season from May to October). Results showed that runoff and soil erosion of different grass strip treatments were lower than that of the contrast. The surface runoff and soil control effects of different grass strip were presented a trend of A>B>C>CK, and the control effects of soil erosion were better than those of surface runoff. Compared with CK, A and B decreased the runoff rate by 35.19% and 46.26%, and the erode rate decreased by 73.51%and 78.13%, respectively. N existed in the runoff of slope land was mainly in the form of silt N, which accounted for 80%~85%. P existed in the runoff was mainly in the form of granular P, which accounted for 90%-95%. The effects of different grass strip on preventing N and P loss were: A>B>C>CK. The control effects of total nitrogen loss were better than those of total phosphorus. Compared with CK, B decreased total N and P in runoff by 59.96% and 48.57%, A decreased by 63.31% and 56.91% and C decreased by 29.46% and 26.03%, respectively.

The same control frequency requires only a lower sampling frequency module, which saves hardware costs and has advantages in practical application.

In the present study, the coding sequence and the 50- and 30-untranslated regions of MHC class II DR alpha chain (the DRA gene) from rare gayal and gaytle were cloned and analyzed to dissect structural and functional variations. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the DRA genes in gayal (Bofr-DRA) and gaytle (Bofr × BoLA-DRA) were almost identical to those for cattle and yak (99%). Compared to yak, two amino acids substitutions in the signal peptide (SP) domain for gayal were found within all Bos animals. Except for only one replacement in the amino acid within the a2 domain of the DRA protein in gayal, the additional residues were highly conserved across the species investigated. The 20 peptide-binding sites (PBS) of Bofr-DRA and Bofr × BoLA-DRA were essentially reserved in the a1 domain among all species investigated. The lesser degree of substitution in Bofr-DRA is concordant with the concept that the DRA gene is highly conserved among all mammals. The very high degree of conservativity of the DRA gene among ruminants, including gayal, suggests its recent evolutionary separation. © 2014 The Author(s).

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides information on the biochemical profile of tissue and is increasingly being used as a non-invasive method of classifying brain tumor. MRS is analysed using LCModel software to yield metabolite profiles. Yet previous works have not used the nonnegative information of MRS for classification. A novel scheme is proposed in this paper. Firstly, non-negative and local nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF, LNMF) are used to extract features from metabolite profiles. Then support vector machines (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are applied to train classifiers based on features extracted by NMF and LNMF. The new scheme can extract meaningful features and therefore obtains a classifier with good generalization. Experimental results show that the new method has better performance than other previous ones. © 2013 IEEE.","","13","Matrix algebra","Brain - Classification (of information) - Diagnosis - Discriminant analysis - Factorization - Image retrieval - Magnetic levitation vehicles - Magnetic resonance - Magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Metabolites - Noninvasive medical procedures - Signal processing - Support vector machines - Tumors","Brain tumor classifications - Brain tumors - Intelligent strategies - Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) - Magnetic resonance spectra - Magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS) - Nonnegative matrix factorization - Signal processing technique","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The mice were orally given Schisandra polysaccharide continuously for 7 days. After the last administration, effects of Schisandra polysaccharide on autonomic activities of the mice were observed using an independent activity recorder; effects of Schisandra polysaccharide on the sleep number, sleep latency, and sleep time of mice treated with a subthreshold dose of sodium pentobarbital were observed. The results showed that Schisandra polysaccharide could significantly reduce the number of autonomic activities, increase the sleep number, shorten the sleep latency, and prolong the sleep time of mice treated with the threshold dose of sodium pentobarbital, indicating that Schisandra polysaccharide has a sedative and hypnotic effect in mice. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","6","Mammals","Anesthetics - Sleep research - Sodium","Autonomic activity - Distilled water - High dose - Schisandra - Sleep latency - Sleep time - Subthreshold - Threshold dose","461.4 Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering - 549.1 Alkali Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It appears that this variability among gayals could confer the ability to mount immune responses to a wide variety of peptides or pathogens. © 2014 The Author(s).","","38","Binding sites","Amino acids - Mammals - Peptides","Amino acid substitution - Balancing selection - DQB exon 2 - Frontalis - Genetic characterization - Major histocompatibility complex - Major histocompatibility complex class - Peptide binding","461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: 31101640, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; ","Funding for this study was provided by the National Nature Science Foundation of China [grant number 31101640].","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The fact that methanogens associate with hydrogen-producing organisms means endosymbiotic methanogens cling not to free-living eubacteria, but hydrogenosomes themselves in the cytosol of amitochondriate protists.

Services ranking mechanism is an important service for e-commerce that facilitates consumers’ decision-making process. Traditional services ranking methods ignore the fact that customers cannot rate services under the same criteria, which leads to the ratings are actually incomparable. In this paper, we propose to exploit the ordinal preferences rather than cardinal ratings to rank online services. Ordinal preferences are elicited from filled ratings so that the intensity of ratings is ignored. We construct a directed graph to depict the set of pairwise preferences between services. Then, the strongest paths of the directed graph are identified and the evaluation values of services are calculated based on the strongest paths. We prove our method satisfies some important conditions that a reasonable services ranking method should satisfy. Experiments using real data of movie ratings demonstrate that the proposed method is advantageous over previous methods, and so the proposed method can rank services effectively even the ratings are given by customers with inconsistent criteria. In addition, the experiments also verify that it is more difficult to manipulate the ranking result of our method than existing methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","15","Directed graphs","Decision making - Information management - Sales","Decision making process - Inconsistent rating criteria - Manipulation - On-line service - Ordinal preference - Ranking mechanisms - Service selection - Traditional services","912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,"Number: 2014FB133, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61462051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560296, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61462056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grand 61462056, 61472345, 61462051, 81560296), the Applied Fundamental Research Project of Yunnan Province (Grand No. 2014FA028, 2014FA023, 2014FB133).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Overall multi-spectral image brightness is low, contrast is low, and the target and the background to distinguish are not obvious. For dispersion-type multi-spectral imaging system, different wavelengths of light have different refractive indices, leading to every image of different bands focusing in different positions. So for all bands, collecting a group of images at one position will affect the multi-spectral's focusing accuracy. The current digital image focusing algorithm based on optical theory sets the ideal focused image after a degradation process to form a focal and noisy image. This paper considers the coke degradation model, forms frequency domain field beginning, chooses Gaussian point spread function inversion model to do full digital autofocusing for multi-spectral images, and multiplies them by a low pass filter to reduce noise from high frequency component. The results show that this algorithm can keep the energy of spectrum and contrast ratio, enhance details, and reduce noise at the same time, to make the details of original images more clear which are close to the focus images. Based on the above researches, this paper also uses high performance objective evaluation function, gray difference function, to evalute this filter's validity in subjective and objective aspects.","","16","Low pass filters","Algorithms - Dispersion (waves) - Focusing - Frequency domain analysis - Functions - Imaging systems - Optical transfer function - Refractive index - Signal filtering and prediction - Spectroscopy","Auto-focus algorithm - Degradation process - Difference functions - High frequency components - Multi-spectral imaging systems - Multispectral images - Multispectral imaging - Performance objective","703.1.1 Electric Network Analysis - 703.2 Electric Filters - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 731.1 Control Systems - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 741.1 Light/Optics - 746 Imaging Techniques - 801 Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Manifold regularization and pairwise constraints are representative semi-supervised learning methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel local structure preserving approach by considering both manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. Specifically, we construct a new graph Laplacian that takes advantage of pairwise constraints compared with the traditional Laplacian. The proposed graph Laplacian can better preserve the local geometry of data distribution and achieve the effective recognition. Upon this, we build the graph regularized classifiers including support vector machines and kernel least squares as special cases for action recognition.

In this paper, we chose three different irrigation emitter types (drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, 2-hole flow adjustable emitter and 8-hole flow adjustable emitter) as study subject under the water quality condition combined with three fertilization concentrations (0, 0.6 and 1.2 g/L) and three sediment particles size range were applied on root area infiltration irrigation and surface drip irrigation. The irrigation experiment of 5 min each time was conducted under working pressure of 20 kPa for three days. The difference in weight of the flowerpots before and after irrigation was the amount of water irrigated. After the experiment, the irrigation amount of emitters was recorded. If the relative flow rate of emitter was below 75%, the test stopped and then recorded effective irrigation times. The results showed that there was a very significant interaction between the soil particle size and emitter types, fertilizer concentration and emitter types, irrigation types and emitter types (P0.05). The bigger Yunnan red loam particle size, the easier clogging was made on flow adjustable emitter. Such as 2-hole flow adjustable emitter on surface drip irrigation,when the application rate of fertilizer was 0 g/L, the effective irrigation times of muddy water with three different particles size range were 11, 8 and 5, respectively. As for drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, Yunnan red loam particle size ranging 0.0385 - 0.074 mm was the easiest to cause clogging and the particle size ranging 0 - 0.0385 mm was the least to cause clogging. The fertilization has a significant influence on the clogging of the emitter. When the fertilizer concentration was less than 0.6 g/L, the large impact of fertilizer application on emitter was most obvious. When the fertilizer concentration was more than 0.6 g/L, the number of effective irrigation times did not have obvious change. However, the trend of the relative flow rate of the emitter increased, indicating that the blockage of the emitter increased. The irrigation type was an important factor affecting the clogging of emitter and it had different effects on different emitter. For 8-hole flow adjustable emitter, the anti-blocking performance of the surface drip irrigation was better than the root area infiltration irrigation. Under the surface drip irrigation, when the application rate of fertilizer was 0, the total effective irrigation times with three different particle sizes were four times more than root area infiltration irrigation. When the application rate of fertilizer was 1.2 g/L, the total effective irrigation times with 3 different particle sizes were 18 times and the root area infiltration irrigation were 15 times. For 2-hole flow adjustable emitter and drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, two different irrigation types did not have abviously different for effective irrigation times. Under the condition of fertilizing in muddy water, the performance of different emitter on clogging was different.

The Green's function for the initial value problem is adapted by localized dilution at the juncture of conduit flows. Then the model is employed to simulate three breakthrough curves measured near Emerald Sink, Northwest Florida. The simulation of the tracing experiment from Cheryl Sink to Emerald Sink yields a recharge of 1.49 m3/s at Emerald Sink. For the oxbow that connects Cheryl Sink with Emerald Sink, the major shortcut and the long side convey about 90 and 10% of water, respectively. The simulations of other two experiments yield a consistent value for the flow from a tributary conduit into the main conduit 200 m downstream of Emerald Sink, being 1.9-2.0 m3/ s. The proposed theory is novel and robust in that the peak arrival time, time width, and amplitude of the measured curves are fully utilized, and the resulting water fluxes are independent of conduit radius. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","21","Confined flow","Dilution - Dispersion (waves) - Gems - Green's function - Initial value problems","Arrival time - Break through curve - Consistent values - Dye tracing - Florida - Karst conduit - Sink - Water flux","482.2.1 Gems - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 921 Mathematics - 921.2 Calculus",,"Number: -, Acronym: FSU, Sponsor: Florida State University; Number: 41162008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments Funding support of this research was provided by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 41162008.

The result showed that the distinction degree of PCA was 96.492%, which can separate the Pu'er unfermented tea aroma of different years. Loading analysis showed that the sensors of No.8 and No.9 made the greatest contribution to the first and second principal components of aroma. LDA analysis indicated that electronic nose can differentiate the aroma of unfermented Pu'er tea with the same type in different years.

P2P e-commerce as a new commercial mode, there are still important challenges to overcome before the full potential of P2P e-commerce can be really realized. In this paper, we discuss some security related issues about P2P e-commerce, such as authentication, authorization, non-repudiation, and integrity; moreover, we discuss some trust models in P2P e-commerce.

Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of Pr-N-TiO2is remarkable improved due to the synergistic effect of the co-doped ions. The degradation rate of MB in 6 h is 92.81%, which is much higher than that of Degussa P25 (45.01%). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Without efficient structures, cloud systems cannot support the necessary high throughput and provide services for millions of users. However, most existing cloud storage systems generally adopt a distributed Hash table (DHT) approach to index data, which lacks to support range-query and dynamic real-time character. It is necessary to generate a scalable, dynamical and multi-query functional index structure in cloud environment. Based on the summary and analysis of the double-layer index systems for cloud storage, this paper provides a novel concurrent skiplist based double-layer index (referred as CSD-index) for cloud data processing. Two-layer architecture, which can breakthrough single machine memory and hard drive limitation, is used to extend indexing scope. Online migration algorithm of skiplist's nodes between local servers is used to make dynamic load-balancing. The details of the design and the implement of the concurrent skiplist are discussed in this paper. Optimistic concurrency control (OCC) technique is introduced to enhance the concurrency. Through concurrent skiplist CSD-index improves the load bearing capacity of the global index and enhances the overall throughput of the index. Experimental results show the efficiency of the concurrent skiplist based double-layer index and it has viability as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Hence, The RDF graph matching algorithm becomes the technical foundation of many tasks in Semantic Web, such as semantic search, data fusion, ontology matching, data filter and dissemination. An RDF-graph-matching-based query can enables searching with additional semantic information, so that it can be utilized for obtaining expected ranking in semantic search and personalized information retrieval on the web of data. Yet, the need for this approach is disregarded. This paper proposes a novel similarity-oriented RDF graph matching approach for ranking linked data, which considering the element-level and structure-level similarity of statements, and also the similarity of URIs and blank nodes in RDF graphs. The efficiency of this approach is improved over the traditional RDF graph matching algorithm. And the effectiveness is improved by analyzing and measuring the structure-level similarity of statements. The experimental results shows that this approach can effectively measure the similarity between RDF graphs, and also returns results with respect to a query RDF graph as a ranked set of promising alternatives. © 2012 IEEE.","","25","Semantic Web","Data fusion - Data handling - Linked data - Ontology - Pattern matching","Element level - Ontology matching - Personalized information retrieval - RDF graph - Semantic information - Semantic search - Structure similarity - Web of datum","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903 Information Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Almost all existing methods for analyzing GPLMMs are developed on the basis of the assumption that random effects are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as normal distribution. In this paper, we extend the GPLMMs by specifying a Dirichlet process prior for a general distribution of random effects, and propose a semiparametric Bayesian approach by simultaneously utilizing an approximation truncation Dirichlet process prior of the random effects and a P-spline approximation of the smoothing function. By combining the block Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a hybrid algorithm is presented for sampling observations from the posterior distribution. A procedure for selecting the degree of the polynomial components in nonparametric approximation using Bayes factor is given via path sampling. Some goodness-of-fit statistics are proposed to evaluate the plausibility of the posited model. Several simulation studies and a real example are presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Equipped with an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens (ALCL), the spatially resolving ability of the ALCL in measuring refractive index of liquid was utilized to obtain the gradient distribution of the liquid concentration along diffusive direction. Based on Fick's second law, the D value was then calculated by analyzing diffusion images. It was worth mentioning that only one instantaneous diffusive image was required to measure D value by the method, reducing the measurement time greatly from several hours in traditional methods to a few seconds. The diffusion coefficients of ethylene glycol diffusing in pure water, at temperatures from 288.15 to 308.15 K, were measured by analyzing instantaneous diffusion images, the results were consistent well with the values measured by using holographic interferometry and Taylor dispersion methods. The method is characterized by faster measurement, direct observation of diffusive process, and easy operation, which provides a new method in measuring diffusion coefficient of liquids rapidly. © 2015 Optical Society of America.","","23","Diffusion","Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Holographic interferometry - Image analysis - Liquids - Refractive index","Diffusive process - Direct observations - Fick's second law - Gradient distributions - Liquid concentration - Liquid diffusivity - Resolving ability - Taylor dispersion method","741.1 Light/Optics - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
