Forest transitions, the change from net deforestation to net reforestation, may follow different pathways depending on a complex interplay of driving forces. However, most studies on forest transitions focus on the national level rather than the local level. Here, case studies from 10 villages in Yunnan, China, are used to clarify the complex interactions among various pathways of forest transitions, derive insights on the underlying drivers that shaped the forest transitions, and determine the importance of changes in drivers over time. The results demonstrate that China's recent forest transition was caused by a range of interrelated pathways that were mediated by local circumstances. The degradation of forest ecosystem services caused by rampant deforestation and forest degradation created a scarcity of forest products and triggered state-initiated afforestation efforts, particularly in the 1990s, which continue to be important. More recently, economic development concomitant with smallholder intensification spurred reforestation, while the importance of state forest policy declined. The complexity of local land-use changes demonstrates the difficulty of identifying distinct transition pathways and calls for a more diverse approach that recognizes the interdependence of local processes. © 2014 by the authors.","54","Climate change","Biodiversity - Deforestation - Economics - Ecosystems - Land use - Reforestation","Agroforestry - China - Economic development - Forest cover change - Forest degradation - Forest transition - Land-use change - State forest policy","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The local karstic environment might cause the biogeochemical processes involving POC to be different from those in non-karstic regions. Isotopic composition of particulate organic C (POC) and total N (TN) (δ13CPOC, δ15NTN) and C/N ratios (atomic) were used to identify sources and fates of POC in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments over space and time in the karstic watershed. Distributions of POC in SPM and sediments show great seasonal and spatial variations. The δ13CPOCin SPM ranges from -27.4 to -19.0I and -33.4 to -22.3I in summer and winter, respectively. The C/N ratios in SPM in both seasons are lower than 12 and most are around 7. The surface and core sediments have lower δ13CPOCbut higher C/N ratios than those of SPM. According to source analysis using C/N ratios, δ13CPOCand δ15NTN, the major source for POC in SPM is phytoplankton, while POC in surface sediments are attributed to land-derived and aquatic sources. Core sediments in the region affected by less anthropogenic impact have a similar POC source to surface sediment. However, in regions with intense deforestation and farming, land-derived sources may be major contributors to POC in core sediments. Calculated contributions from these sources to POC in the riverine-lacustrine system confirm the above observation. The flux and export rate of POC in SPM are 7.85×108ga-1and 492mgm-2a-1, respectively. In contrast to some world rivers, POC output from the karstic watershed is mainly from in-stream photosynthesis. Land-derived POC is merely redistributed in river and lake beds and sediments in the karstic riverine-lacustrine system act as an organic C pool. The observed features are likely due to intense anthropogenic impact and particular geomorphology of the karstic environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","74","Suspended sediments","Deforestation - Isotopes - Organic carbon - Particles (particulate matter) - Surficial sediments - Watersheds","Anthropogenic impacts - Biogeochemical process - Isotopic composition - Lacustrine systems - Particulate organic carbon - Spatial variations - Surface sediments - Suspended particulate matters","444.1 Surface Water - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 2013CB956700, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41073096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40473051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are most grateful to Profs R.

The deposit contains over 4.2 million tonnes (Mt) of contained Zn + Pb metal reserves at 5.09% Zn and 2.40% Pb, and 301 Mt of Fe ore resources at 30.02% TFe. The stratiform or vein-type orebodies are hosted in the Upper Cambrian Shahechang Formation. Similar to many major Zn skarn deposits worldwide, the Luziyuan deposit shows a distinct metal zonation pattern with depth, which correlates with the different calc-silicate mineral assemblages: From Zn-Pb (sphalerite + galena) ores in marble, through Zn-Pb-Fe-Cu (sphalerite + galena + magnetite ± pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in pyroxenoid (± clinopyroxene)-bearing skarn, to Fe-Cu (magnetite ± pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in garnet (± clinopyroxene ± pyroxenoid)-bearing skarn. The syn-ore calcite has δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values of −1.0 to +0.9‰ and +10.3 to +12.7‰ respectively, suggestive of isotopic affinities to both granite and marble. δDH2O values of the fluid inclusions in the pre-ore rhodonite and the syn-ore quartz range from −81.7 to −68.8‰ and −76.6 to −56.3‰ respectively; whilst the calculated δ18OH2O values of the rhodonite, syn-ore calcite, and quartz are of +5.4 to +6.1‰ +1.4 to +3.8‰ and −5.3 to −2.0‰ respectively. This indicates that the ore-forming fluids were sourced from both magmatic and meteoric waters. δ34S values of the syn-ore sulfides (+8.9 to +12.0‰) are slightly higher than those of typical crustal-derived granites (δ34S = −4.0 to +9.0‰), but are significantly lower than those of Cambrian seawater sulfates. This indicates that the source of S is correlated with both granite and seawater sulfates. We propose that the Luziyuan Zn-Pb-Fe(-Cu) polymetallic mineralization occurred in a distal skarn system, and was genetically linked to concealed Early Cretaceous granite intrusions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","154","Ores","Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper compounds - Deposits - Granite - Iron alloys - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Magnetite - Marble - Mineralogy - Ore deposit geology - Ore deposits - Quartz - Seawater - Silicate minerals - Sulfur compounds - Uranium alloys - Zinc - Zinc alloys - Zinc sulfide","Baoshan Block (SW China) - Distal skarn - Fluid sources - Luziyuan - Polymetallic - S isotopes","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 41363001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013HA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Leading Talents Program of Guangdong Province; Number: 2015CB452605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China ( 41363001 and 41762009 ), the State Key Fundamental Research Development Program ( 2015CB452605 and 2014CB440905 ), and the Science and Technology leading talent training program of Yunnan Province ( 2013HA001 ).

However, in contrast to high-grade nickel sulphide ore, low-grade nickel laterite ore cannot be as easily upgraded by current technologies due to its complicated mineral structure and nickel distribution. This study investigated the mineralogical characteristics, occurrence state and dissemination characteristics of nickel within Yunnan nickel laterite ore in China. Nickel laterite ore had a complex internal structure and mainly consisted of limonite (10 wt.%) and serpentine (87 wt.%). Sulphides were not a significant part of this laterite ore and were rarely observed. Furthermore, the nickel was mainly hosted in serpentine by substitution for Mg or by adsorption. Serpentine had a mean grade of approximately 0.77 wt.% Ni and represented approximately 81.49 wt.% of the total laterite resource. A portion of the laterite ore had a pore structure that was formed by destruction of the original protolith during and after its formation, with a specific surface area of 70.042 m2/g. The actual temperature for the reduction of metal oxides within the ore was analysed by H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), which indicated that it was higher than the reduction temperature of the pure metal oxides.

Precise age constraints of supergene Mn-oxides may provide valuable information on the climatic, tectonic, and geomorphic conditions prevailing in the geological past.40Ar/39Ar laser incremental heating analysis of cryptomelane from the Baye manganese deposit, western Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, SW China, was conducted to provide numerical constraints on the ages of supergene Mn enrichment and growth rates of Mn-oxide veins. In this study, two Mn-oxide veins of 3-6 cm thickness, termed as Vein A and B, respectively, were collected for40Ar/39Ar dating. Vein A is subhorizontal and present in fractures parallel to schistosity of the Proterozoic spessartine schists, whereas Vein B is filled in nearly vertical fractures penetrating the schistosity. A combination of optical microscopy, XRD, SEM, and EMP analyses demonstrate that mineral grains extracted from both veins consist of pure, well-crystallized cryptomlane, which has acicular crystal forms and contains 0.96%-4.70% K2O. Fourteen cryptomelane subsamples extracted from different growth bands of Vein A yield well-defined plateau ages ranging from 1.35 ± 0.05 to 1.16 ± 0.04 Ma (2σ), whereas seven subsamples obtained from Vein B have plateau ages ranging from 1.23 ± 0.05 to 1.01 ± 0.04 Ma (2σ). The age results permit estimation for the growth rates of both veins at ca. 115-153 and 34-67 mm Ma-1, respectively. Distinct growth rates between Veins A and B are likely reflective of different fluid pressures during their formation governed by the orientation of the fractures hosting the veins. The growth rates calculated for both veins are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the values (-1) estimated for Mn-oxide nodules in supergene Mn deposits elsewhere. The high growth rates obtained for the Baye samples are consistent with direct precipitation of tetravalent Mn-oxides from weathering solution in open cavities or fractures, characterized by incremental growth of Mn-oxide bands from the margin to the center of the cavities or fractures. In contrast, Mn-oxide nodules with low growth rates from other deposits formed through self-oxidation and self-catalization, and grow outwards from the nuclei. In addition, prevalence of warm and humid climate and prolonged tectonic uplift in the Yunnan Plateau may have also partly contributed to the rapid growth of Mn-oxides in the Baye deposit. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","38","Indium compounds","Barium compounds - Deposits - Fracture - Growth rate - Manganese deposits - Structural geology - Tectonics - Weathering","Cryptomelane - Direct precipitation - Geomorphic conditions - Growth mechanisms - Guizhou - Numerical constraints - Warm and humid climates - Weathering profiles","481.1 Geology - 504.1 Light Metal Mines - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 101017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation; Number: NCET-05-0665, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 41202053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40573021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: CUG120102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41202053 & 40573021), Fok Ying Tong Education Fund (Grant No. 101017), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. CUG120102), and Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (Grant No. NCET-05-0665).

The granulite xenoliths range 3-5 cm in diameters, featured with aligned formation and blastic texture. Equilibrium temperature and pressure estimates for the felsic granulite xenoliths and two-pyroxene granulite xenoliths are 869-969 °C, 0.94-1.00 GPa and 841-972 °C respectively, indicating that they are high temperature granulites. The crystallization temperature and pressure of trachyandesite phenocryst is 1 008-1 059 °C, 1.26-1.33 GPa, indicating that they were formed in and originated from the lower crust to the top of the upper mantle. Electron backscatter diffraction(EBSD) analyses of two-pyroxene granulite xenoliths show that orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene have obvious lattice preferred orientation (LPO), and the main slip systems are: (010) [001] and (100) [001], (010) [001] respectively. The deformation mechanism is dislocation creep, which indicates that granulite xenoliths experienced a strong plastic deformation and metamorphism. The discovery of high temperature granulite in Cenozoic volcanic rocks suggests that Tengchong Cenozoic magmatic activity may be related with volcanic magamatism and high temperature metamorphism in the lower crustal caused by post-collisional extensional collapse, delamination and slab break-off after subduction and collision of the Indian Plate and the Tengchong block.","57","Volcanic rocks","Backscattering - Electron diffraction - Petrology - Silicate minerals - Structural geology - Volcanoes","Cenozoic - Electron back scatter diffraction - Equilibrium temperatures - High temperature - Micro fabric - Tengchong block","481.1 Geology - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The enrichment of Li, Rb, Cs, W is the most significant, with the values of Li, Rb, Cs and W in hot springs averaged at 2895.1 μg/L, 839.8 μg/L, 417.9 μg/L and 61.74 μg/L, respectively, which are generally higher than those of Cu, Pb, Zn (13.6 μg/L, 0.24 μg/L and 6.83 μg/L respectively). The contents of precious metals and rare earth elements such as Au, Ag are very low, which are basically below the detection limit. In addition, the content of rare metals in spring water with higher temperature also increases, and helium isotope data show that there is not only the supply of mantle-derived materials in hot springs, but also the content of rare metals increases with the contribution of mantle-derived components. Therefore, hot spring activity can lead to the enrichment and mineralization of rare metals. In view of the extensive and intense hydrothermal activity in Tengchong area and the relatively stable content of Li in hot springs in recent 20 years, it can be concluded that hot springs can not only form rare metal deposits, but also have a relatively fast speed. The amount of lithium that comes out of hydrothermal activity can reach more than 500 tons a year. The ore-forming effect of rare metals by hot spring is better than that of precious metals, rare earth, copper, lead and zinc. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the metallogenic mechanism of hot spring rare metals in the search for hydrothermal alteration or hot spring sedimentary rare metal deposits in Sanjiang area of southwest China. © 2019, Science Press.

It was shown that the Emeishan basalts erupted and upwelled because of mantle uplifting during Late Caledonian to Early Hercynian. They carried significant Cu and Au, which not only formed Cu-Au mineralization in basalts and tuffs, but also provided important source for post-volcanism stratabound Cu-Au deposits. Copper and gold leached by hydrothermal fluids in the volcanic protores would migrate along faults and fractures, which were driven by structural-thermal driven effects in Indosinian and Yanshanian. They would subsequently precipitate in favorable locations where were abrupt changes of structure and chemical potential. Cu and Au enriched in it, and finally ore bodies formed.","11","Gold deposits","Basalt - Binary alloys - Copper deposits - Deposits - Geology - Gold alloys","Emeishan basalts - Geological characteristics - Geological features - Guizhou - Hydrothermal fluids - Metallogenic models - Spatial temporals - Thermal driven","481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 547.1 Precious Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the 'tectonic-metamorphic' study of the medium-low glacial facies metamorphic rocks and the high-pressure metamorphic rocks exposed in the Shuangjiang-Huimin area, this paper presents the following findings on the metamorphic rocks in the Lancang Group: (1) the Fold cleavage S2 under the extrusion system is the regional foliation. The facies S1 represented by the quartz veins in the metamorphic rocks are consistent with the S0, and S1 is nearly parallel with S2 after the second stage. (2) The tectonic pattern and the metamorphic deformation period are basically the same in the resarch area, showing two-stage middle and deep tectonic stratigraphy in Permian-Triassic, which is shallow-surface deformation superposition of the Jurassic-Cenozoic. (3) The high-pressure metamorphic rocks record two periods of deep tectonic deformation, and the tourmaline and garnet have a distinct two-stage growth pattern. The core (M1aD1a) may represent the peak eclogite facies metamorphism, The edge represents the blue lithofacies (M1bD1b) stage during the exhumation process. The high-pressure metamorphic rocks are consistent with the tectonic level and deformation pattern of the second stage (M2D2) of the metamorphic rocks, which represents the process of the compressive stress after the exhumation process. Both shear-type cleavages S2 indicate that the upper disk shear sliding toward to cleavages. Combined with the Cenozoic Sanjiang area occurred near the 90° block rotation, the recovery of the second phase of the disk against the thrust of the role of E. By the 40Ar-39Ar dating of quartz sandstone muscovite in Xingfu area, phengite and blue amphibole in Xiaoheijiang, and reinterpreting the 40Ar-39Ar age of the blue amphibole in Xiaoheijiang, it is concluded that Lancang Group has 4 tectonic stages: (1) Metamorphism of blueschist facies in the first stage (D1b) of high-pressure metamorphic rocks, ~250 Ma. (2) The second phase (M2D2) is extrusion in the middle level, 215-214 Ma. (3) The shallow metamorphic rocks N-S to the longitudinal folds belong to the third stage (D3a): 111.9-103.7 Ma with the late (D3b) thrust, ~82.28 Ma. (4) The fourth period near the E-W to the vertical fold: the new generation (probably later than 59.18 Ma). © 2018, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

Results show that the earthquakes predominantly have strike-slip mechanisms, with occasional normal and very few thrust-faulting events. Most earthquakes occur in the upper crust above 16 km depth. We then derive the regional distribution of the stress field through a damped linear inversion using the focal mechanisms obtained in this study and augmented by the solutions in the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) catalog and in Xu et al. (2010). Inversion results suggest that the entire region is predominantly under a strike-slip faulting regime. Orientations of both maximum and minimum principle axes exhibit a clockwise rotational pattern. The axes of maximum compression are oriented roughly north-south, with a gradual change across the region from trending northwest-southeast in the South China block to trending northeast-southwest in the Indo-China block. This pattern is consistent with the surface horizontal velocity derived from geodetic observations.

It is located on the northeast side of the collision belt between the Indian and Euroasian plates. It is a part of Myanmar Arc seismic structure, belonging to the Himalayan strong-earthquake belt. There are 68 volcanoes distributed in the region of 90 km long in the north-south direction and 50 km wide in the east-west direction. Among them are 4 Holocene (Q4) volcanoes, 18 Late-Pleistocene (Q3) volcanoes, and 38 Early-Pleistocene (Q1) volcanoes. To study the geologic evolution and volcanic activity of the Tengchong Volcano Area, we need to investigate the variation of crustal thickness and the distribution of the Poisson's ratio in the area, as well as the detailed thickness and topography of the lithosphere. We use the seismic data observed by 9 digital broadband stations of Tengchong Earthquake-Monitoring Net from July 2007 through December 2011. The P receiver functions are used to study the crustal thickness and the Poisson's ratio in the region, while the converted phases at the Moho and the LAB in the S receiver functions are utilized to get the depths of the Moho and the LAB. To reduce the noises and remove the effect of the heterogeneity, we stack the P and S receiver functions beneath each station, respectively, to get an averaged trace of P receiver functions and an average trace of S receiver functions. Before the stacking of the weak converted phases from the Moho and the LAB, each seismic event is moveout corrected to the reference epicentral distance of 67 degree (corresponding to the ray parameter of 6.40 s/deg). Based on the IAS91 model, the receiver functions are transformed from the time domain to the depth domain. 1) The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km. 2) The Poisson's ratio of the area mainly varies from 0.26 to 0.32. The ratio beneath 6 stations is over 0.29, which is attributed to the increase of mafic component in the crust. There may exist two magma chambers. 3) The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km. The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km, with a feature of being thick at the north and south ends but thin in the middle (or the Moho is uplifted in the middle part). The Poisson's ratio is between 0.262 and 0.322. Six stations present high Poisson's ratio, and the crust may be partially melted in some local areas. There probably exist two magma chambers on the east side of Mazhang and the area of Tengchong-Shaba, but their scopes need further determination. The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km, being thinner than that of the surrounding area. In the center of the volcano area (i.e., the convergence between the Tengchong volcanic fault and the Yingjiang-Longchuan fault), both the crust and the lithosphere are uplifted. The lithosphere presents a dome shape obviously, caused by the extension and thinning of the lithosphere by the upwelling of the asthenosphere (or the uplift of mantle hot materials). ©, 2015, Science Press.

Starting with the salt-forming setting of the restricted sea formed in Neo-Tethys and the specific and complex geological and structural conditions of southwestern Yunnan and based on considerable ground geological surveys and sedimentary facies, salt structure and hydrochemical studies, the authors infer that the horsetail potash beds in the Mengyejing Formation of Mengyejing area were squeezed up and flowed in the plastic form through faults from the deep Jurassic potassic rocks onto the surface. In this study, light, portable and practical geophysical means such as the low-frequency magnetotelluric method (EH4) and high-precision method for detecting the electromagnetic spectrum (MES) were used; in addition, the previously-used gravity survey (1:100, 000) was also employed. An integrated analysis indicates that there exist several salt beds at the depth. For the purpose of verifying the above-mentioned new idea of potash search, two potash intermediately deep boreholes were drilled, and the drilling results are consistent with this idea. Of the two boreholes, one (MK-1) has been completed and encountered a 70 m thick potash-bearing halite bed in the central part of the Middle Jurassic Huakaizuo Formation, and the other (MK-2) has intersected a gypsum-bearing sequence in the upper part of the Huakaizuo Formation. Meanwhile, Sr isotope study, inclusion thermometry and analyses of the structure and sedimentary features of the salt body were carried out. In summary, the authors demonstrate the formation mechanism of the Mengyejing potash deposit and put forward a 'two-storey potash-forming model', i.e., Jurassic salt body lies in the deep part and diapirism in the shallow part. Guided by this model, the authors deployed regional, high-precision gravity survey (1:50, 000), MES spectrum and shallow drilling engineering, thus expanding prospects of potash exploration in the deep and shallow parts of the Lanping-Simao salt-forming belt.","46","Potash","Boreholes - Geological surveys - Isotopes - Potash deposits - Precision engineering - Salt tectonics - Sedimentary rocks - Sedimentology - Strontium","Diapirism - Electromagnetic spectra - Formation mechanism - Hydrochemical study - Integrated analysis - Magnetotelluric methods - Structural condition - Tethys","804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 761 Nanotechnology - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 511.1 Oil Field Production Operations - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 482.2 Minerals - 481.1 Geology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Results show that: (1) GRACE data is able to reflect TWSA dynamics in the study region, as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture, precipitation, and groundwater anomalies; (2) GRACE-based TWSA shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly, seasonal, annual and multi-year scales, with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months; (3) precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of TWSA, and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation-concentration degree (PCD) than precipitation magnitude; (4) the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in TWSA, and the correlations between TWSA with Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were 0.88 (a = 0.01) and −0.58 (a = 0.01).

Water retention in the soil zone and shallow fractured rock zone (subcutaneous) is a key factor for plant growth. Distinction of water sources taken by karst plants is a challenging task for botanists and hydrologists but is needed for ecosystem management. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to investigate water sources for Quercus variabilis secondary forests at Shilin Geopark in Bajiang vally, central Yunnan of China. Proportions of water sources for plant uptake were determined by the δD and δ18O values of plant stem water, and water taken from soil layers and the subcutaneous zone. The analysis reveals that water was mainly taken from the soil layers and to less degree the subcutaneous zone as well. In dry seasons with scarce precipitation, plants in the secondary forest were prone to take more water from subcutaneous zone and upper layer of soil. Different species had different water use strategies, Quercus variabilis and Pistacia weinmannifolia took a larger proportional water from the upper layer of soil and subcutaneous water, suggesting its deeper roots and wider range of shallower roots. However, Neolitsea homilantha extracted more percentage of water from the upper soil water because of its shallower roots. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","12","Forestry","Ecosystems - Isotopes - Landforms - Soil moisture","Ecosystem management - Infiltration capacity - Secondary forests - Stable isotopes - Stable-isotope analysis - Water retention - Water uptake - Water use strategies","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.0 Woodlands and Forestry",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is one of the largest gold deposits in China, with significant amounts of silver and base metals. To the end of 2014, the estimated resources are 125 million tonnes (Mt) of ore, grading 2.42 g/t Au, 0.48 wt % Cu, 25.5 wt % Fe, 38.85 g/t Ag, 1.24 wt % Pb, and 0.53 wt % Zn. Skarn alteration and mineralization are related to shoshonitic quartz monzonite porphyries that were emplaced in Triassic carbonates (Beiya Formation). Re-Os dating on molybdenite from a skarn orebody indicates an ore-forming age of 36.82 ± 0.48 Ma, which is consistent with previous dating results of the quartz monzonite porphyries. At least two paragenetic stages of skarn minerals and associated sulfides were recognized, with the early stage typified by garnet ± pyroxene, magnetite, and calcite, and the late stage characterized by epidote, amphibole, chlorite, quartz, and calcite, containing up to 70% sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor pyrrhotite). The early skarn is dominated by anhydrous minerals, which were replaced by hydrous minerals formed during the late stage. The garnet in the Beiya deposit is andradite rich (Ad36-97Gr3-61), and pyroxene is relatively diopside rich (Di8-91Hd7-89). This mineral assemblage indicates an oxidized skarn system, similar to other Au-Cu, Fe-bearing skarn deposits around the world. Fluid inclusions from pyroxene indicate precipitation from high-temperature and high-to moderate-salinity fluids (420°-530°C, 11.1-43.3 wt % NaCl equiv), which probably results from boiling of a moderately saline magmatic fluid. Cooler (180°-365°C) and moderate-to low-salinity fluids (1.6-16.5 wt % NaCl equiv) were trapped in garnet and quartz and are interpreted to be responsible for gold deposition. Chlorite chemistry indicates ore-forming temperatures between 300° and 340°C, in agreement with fluid inclusion data. It appears that gold was transported as chloride complexes under oxidized conditions and was deposited at temperatures of about 300°C, when transport of chloride complexes as gold carriers was less efficient. © 2015 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.","67","Gold deposits","Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper alloys - Copper compounds - Deposits - Garnets - Gold alloys - Gold compounds - Grading - Iron alloys - Magnetite - Mineral exploration - Mineralogy - Osmium alloys - Pyrites - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Salinity measurement - Silicate minerals - Silver deposits - Sodium chloride - Sulfur compounds","Anhydrous minerals - Chloride complexes - Fluid inclusion data - Gold deposition - High temperature - Mineral assemblage - Salinity fluids - Southwest China","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper employs visual interpretation, overlay analysis, pollution footprint model and principal component analysis to analyze water quality changes as well as the pollution footprint and humanities driving force of the pollutants in the lake and rivers based on water quality data, statistical data on the society and economy, as well as remote sensing images. The results show that the water quality at Lake Xingyun is best in March and worst in September. During the period from 2005 to 2015, the water quality was best in 2008 but worst in 2014. From 2008 to 2014, the water quality got worsening and then reversed since 2015. In 2015, the pollution footprint of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution occupied 583.26, 705.88 and 494.11 km2, respectively. The top four rivers with the most pollution footprint for the pollutants in the lake and river are listed as Dajie River, Eastern River, Yucun River and Western River, accounted for 66.21% of the total pollution footprint in Lake Xingyun. The land use in the four rivers with the highest degree of pollution can be classified as the paddy field, dry land or village. The first principal component (total population, planting area, rural population, fertilizer use amount, plastic sheeting use amount, large livestock stock amount) influencing the water quality of Lake Xingyun is related to the rural life and agricultural pollution. The second principal component (per capita GDP, firstly industry output value, secondary industry output value, tertiary industry output value) is connected with the social and economic development. Hence, the humanities driving force for water quality changes in Lake Xingyun can be classified as the rural life and agricultural pollution or social and economic development. The first principal component has a contribution rate of 84.389%, which means that it is the major driving force for water quality changes. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","39","River pollution","Agriculture - Economic and social effects - Eutrophication - Lake pollution - Lakes - Land use - Principal component analysis - Quality control - Remote sensing - Rivers - Rural areas - Water quality","Agricultural pollution - First principal components - Footprint - Inflow - Nitrogen and phosphorus - Non-point source pollution - Social and economic development - Social economic factors","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 445.2 Water Analysis - 453 Water Pollution - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In recent years, residents in the mining areas have been paying increased attention to their rights in the mining process, but the failure to properly handle corporate-community relations has resulted in conflict between mining enterprises and local communities. In severe situations, this may even trigger mass disturbances that cause disorders in their normal operations. Considering these potential circumstances, some Chinese mining enterprises started to emphasize corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially the construction of a sound corporate-community relationship, rather than simply making superficial efforts. As a model in such endeavors, the paper takes Kunyang Phosphate of Yunnan Phosphate Chemical Group as a case study; firstly, the development of relations between Kunyang Phosphate and the local community (Hanying Village) is divided into different periods, and each stage is analyzed from the aspect of corporate social responsibility performance of the mine. In addition, this paper makes a summary of “Hanying model”, and analyzes the mine's strategy of community engagement through its practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","70","Chemical analysis","Mining - Public relations","Chemical group - China - Community engagement - Corporate community - Corporate social responsibilities (CSR) - Local community - Mining enterprise - Normal operations","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To investigate the effects of debris flows on channel morphology, we chose 10 cross-sections to monitor periodic series of multiple debris flows triggered by summer rainstorms at Jiangjia ravine, Yunnan province, southwestern China. The 10 sections were distributed in the upper, middle, and lower sections of the trunk drainage to record erosion and deposition. Based on the observation data from 1999 to 2006, the effects of debris flows on channel morphology in the upper, middle and lower channel were analyzed respectively. It can be found that the channel morphology evolvement in upper, middle and lower channel were not uniform, as the erosion or deposition of a specific section depends on the local conditions of the section and scale of the debris flow. The analysis shows sediment discharge, maximum velocity of debris flow and channel gradient are three key factors in erosion/deposition volume calculation in channel. Based on the erosion/deposition characters of Jiangjia ravine, a simple computational model is presented to calculate the erosion or deposition of the debris flow channel. © 2011 Casa Editrice Universita La Sapienza.","17","Debris","Channel flow - Deposition - Erosion - Hazards - Morphology - Sediments - Storms","Channel morphology - Computational model - Debris flows - Erosion and deposition - Erosion/deposition - Sediment discharge - Sediment transportation - Volume calculation","443.3 Precipitation - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is believed that infiltration of surface water into aquifer in the middle of the mining area greatly increases mixing effect of surface water and deep karst water, with hydraulic activity of the middle karst aquifer expanding unceasingly. Compared with the isotope distribution pattern of the Yangtze River basin, rainfall in the mining area contains much heavy isotope. Due to significant effect of burial depth on the deep karst water, seasonal influence is not obvious.

The inverted result shows that the scalar seismic moment is 5.51×1018Nm, which corresponds to a moment magnitude of MW6.4. The correspondent best double couple solution results in two nodal planes of strike 152°/dip 54°/rake 166°, and strike 250°/dip 79°/rake 37°, respectively. Considering the isoseismals and geological structures in the meizoseismal region, the first nodal plane (strike 152°/dip 54°/rake 166°) is preferred to be the seismogenic fault. Thus, the Ms6.4 earthquake occurred mainly along a right-lateral fault striking 152°. The source time function shows that the duration time of the earthquake is about 14 s. The most of the energy releases within the first 11 s and in 11-14 s the rupture is weak. The snapshots of the slip-rate indicate that the rupture process has 3 more detailed stages. In the first stage of the first 4 s after rupture initiation, the rupture propagates simultaneously toward both strike and dip directions; in the second stage of the following 3 s, the rupture extends to down-dip direction; and in the third stage, the rupture looks to be scattering on the fault. In general, this earthquake is of bilateral rupture, and the rupture mainly takes place in strike-dip direction. The major ruptured area is in the shape of a diamond with a dimension of 19 km. On the whole fault plane, the maximum slip is about 1.2 m, the average slip is about 0.1 m, the maximum slip-rate is 0.4 m/s and the average slip-rate is 0.1 m/s. The features of the co-seismic theoretical displacement field of the Ning'er earthquake fault, calculated based on the inverted fault parameters, are consistent with those of the observed isoseismals. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","18","Earthquakes","Faulting - Waveform analysis","Broadband waveform data - Displacement field - Geological structures - Moment tensor solutions - Seismogenic faults - Source process - Source time functions - Spatial temporals","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis",,"Number: 2004CB418404-4, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2001CB711005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 40574025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40474018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Received December 12, 2007; accepted April 8, 2008; published online January 5, 2009 doi: 10.1007/s11430-009-0016-0 †Corresponding author (email: xuls@cea-igp.ac.cn) Supported by National Basic Research Program of China (Grant Nos. 2004CB418404-4 and 2001CB711005) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40574025 and 40474018).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This indicated that vanadium mainly presented in the form of residual fraction. Furthermore, the clay and silt in sediments had a great influence on the reducible and residual fractions of vanadium. The vertical distribution of vanadium also varied greatly, and the concentration of vanadium in bottom sediments was higher than that in surface layer. In addition, the concentrations of vanadium were affected by clay and silt in some areas of Jianhu Lake. The degree of vanadium pollution was mild in sediments from Jianhu Lake, and the potential ecological risks of vanadium were low in most areas.

The mineralisation-related metaluminous and weak peraluminous granite is characterised by high Si, Al and K and low Mg, Fe and Ca, with an average A/CNK of 1.02. The granite is enriched in LILEs (K and Rb), LREEs and HFSEs (Zr, Hf, Th, U and Ce) and depleted in Ba, Nb, Sr, P, and Ti, with zircon ΕHf(t) = -10.8 to -7.5 (TDM2= 1.61-1.82 Ga). These characteristics indicate that the magma was generated by the partial melting of a thickened ancient crust. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of igneous zircon and hydrothermal cassiterite yield ages of 71.4 ± 0.4 Ma and 71.6 ± 4.8 Ma, respectively. The igneous biotite and hydrothermal muscovite samples show Ar-Ar plateau ages of 72.3 ± 0.4 Ma and 70.6 ± 0.2 Ma, respectively. The close temporal relationship between the igneous emplacement and hydrothermal activity suggests that the tin mineralisation was closely linked to the igneous emplacement. The δ18O and δD values for the deposit range from +3.11‰ to -4.5‰ and from -127.3‰ to -94.7‰, respectively. The hydrothermal calcite C and O isotopic data show a wide range of δ13CPDBvalues from -5.7‰ to -4.4‰, and the δ18OSMOWvalues range from +1.4‰ to +11.2‰. The δ34SV-CDTdata range from +4.8‰ to +8.9‰ for pyrite, and the206Pb/204Pb,207Pb/204Pb and208Pb/204Pb ratios range from 18.708 to 18.760, from 15.728 to 15.754 and from 39.237 to 39.341, respectively. The stable isotopic (C-H-O-S-Pb) compositions are all similar to those of magmatic and mantle-derived fluids, which indicate that the ore-forming fluids and materials were mainly derived from magmatic sources that were accompanied by meteoric water. The tin mineralisation in the Xiaolonghe district was closely associated with the Late Cretaceous crustal-melting S-type granites that formed during the subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere. Combined with the tin deposits in the Southeast Asian tin belt, Tengchong block and Central Lhasa, we interpreted that a giant intermittent tin mineralisation belt should be present along the Asian Neo-Tethys margin. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","137","Lead alloys","Binary alloys - Calcite - Deposits - Economic geology - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Granite - Hafnium alloys - Isotopes - Melting - Mica - Mineralogy - Pyrites - Silicate minerals - Structural geology - Tin deposits - Tin mines - Zircon","Hydrothermal activity - Hydrothermal calcites - Isotopic composition - Ore-forming fluid - Temporal relationships - Tethys oceanic lithospheres - U-Pb ages - Zircon U-Pb age","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: 2011BAB04B06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BGS, Sponsor: British Geological Survey; Number: 1212011220925, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; ","We are grateful to the reviewers and Editor-in-Chief for their constructive comments and to Doctors Zhang, R.Q., Liu, R.P., Yang, L.B., and Lin, B. for their assistance and helpful discussions.

The palynological data of the three locations are analyzed to reconstruct the climatic parameters of these areas at that time by using the Coexistence Approach. The Late Pliocene climatic parameters of Eryuan are estimated, i.e., the mean annual temperature ranged from 13.3 to 18.6°C, the mean temperature of the warmest month from 24.6 to 27.5°C, the mean temperature of the coldest month from 1.9 to 12.1°C, the difference in temperatures of coldest and warmest month from 14.2 to 16.6°C, the mean annual precipitation from 619.9 to 1484.3 mm, the mean maximum monthly precipitation from 143.8 to 245.6 mm, and the mean minimum monthly precipitation from 12.7 to 16.4 mm. Both paleovegetation and paleoclimate of the three localities are compared with the modern data at each location. The present study suggests a MAT decrease accompanied by a doubling of the MAP in the Longling area between the Late Pliocene and the present.

With the seismic records, we assess the site conditions and develop a ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE) for this region. The strong-motion duration is also calculated to further understand the potential seismic hazard to nearby structures. The dataset includes 504 events with Mw 1.5-3.9 and 2956 threecomponent records at hypocentral distances S30) for seismographic stations is estimated using fundamental frequencies associated with peak H/V ratios. GMPE is obtained using the entire dataset. The values of the geometrical spreading coefficient for the pseudoabsolute response spectral acceleration (PSA) at a frequency of 10 Hz suggest higher decay than those for the peak ground velocity, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and PSA at other frequencies. The significant duration (Ds) of strong ground motion systematically decreases with PGA but increases with hypocentral distance. However, no strong correlation is observed for Ds and magnitude or for Ds and VS30. The results of this study are compared with analogous research (Babaie Mahani and Kao, 2018) on induced earthquakes with the same distance-magnitude range. The comparison indicates that the decay of ground-motion amplitudes with hypocentral distance in our case is generally lower than that in the other study. The Ds trends are consistent in the two studies, although the longest strong-motion duration in the two cases apparently differs. © 2019 Seismological Society of America.

The Yao'an gold mineralization may be divided into two ore stages: the stage I (sulfide stage) fine-grained pyrite-chalcopyrite-galena stringer veins and the stage II (oxide plus sulfide) tectonic breccias and banded ore. The stage I ores occur in the zones of pervasive potassic alteration. The laser ablation ICP-MS technique was used to analyse REE in primary perthites and altered K-feldspars of potassic alteration zone, related to mineralization in the Yao'an gold deposit. The primary perthites from Yao'an syenite porphyry all have similar REE features with light REE enrichment, large positive Eu anomalies and small but significant negative Ce anomalies. The REE patterns of altered K-feldspars have broadly similar features, but compared to the primary perthite have much higher REE concentrations and smaller positive Eu anomalies. These characteristics show that the hydrothermal fluids responsible for alteration were REE-rich, due to high levels of complex-forming anions, but had large negative Eu anomalies and other features best ascribed to magmatic crystal fractionation. These fluids were derived essentially from the magmatic system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the use of optical images is often restricted by the saturation of spectral reflectance for forests that have multilayered and complex canopy structures and high AGB values and by the effect of spectral reflectance from underlayer shrub, grass, and bare soil for young stands. This usually leads to overestimations and underestimations for smaller and larger values, respectively, and makes it very challenging to improve the estimation accuracy of forest AGB. In this study, a novel methodology was proposed by incorporating stand age as a dummy variable into four models to improve the estimation accuracy of the Pinus densata forest AGB in Yunnan of Southwestern China. A total of eight models, including two parametric models (LM: linear regression model and LMC: LM with combined variables), two nonparametric models (RF: random forest and ANN: artificial neural network) without the age dummy variable, and four corresponding models with the age dummy variable (DLM, DLMC, DRF, and DANN), were compared to estimate AGB. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and 147 sample plots were acquired and utilized. The results showed that (1) compared with the two parametric models, the two nonparametric algorithms resulted in significantly greater estimation accuracies of Pinus densata forest AGB, and the increases of accuracy varied from 8% to 32% for 100 modeling plots and from 12% to 35% for 47 test plots based on root mean square error (RMSE); (2) compared with the models without the age dummy variable, the models with the age dummy variable greatly reduced the overestimations for the plots with AGB values smaller than 70 Mg/ha and the underestimations for the plots with AGB values larger than 180 Mg/ha and, thus, significantly improved the overall estimation accuracy by 14% to 42% for the modeling plots and by 32% to 44% for the test plots based on RMSE; and (3) the texture measures derived from the Landsat 8 OLI images contributed more to improving the estimation accuracy than the original spectral bands and other transformations. This implied that two nonparametric models, coupled with the use of the age dummy variable and texture measures, offered a great potential for improving the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB. © 2019 by the authors.","92","Image enhancement","Biomass - Decision trees - Geometrical optics - Mean square error - Neural networks - Reflection - Regression analysis - Remote sensing - Textures","Above ground biomass - Dummy variables - LANDSAT - Linear regression models - Non-parametric algorithm - Operational land imager - Optical remote sensing data - Root mean square errors","741.1 Light/Optics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: 31660202, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31770677, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant numbers 31770677 and 31660202), the Research Project of Forestry Public Welfare Industry in China grant number 201404309), the ExpertWorkstation of Yunnan Province of China grant number 2018IC100), and the Ten-Thousand Talents Program of Yunnan Province, China.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It contains detailed long-term records of contemporaneous environment, climate, and subsequent modifications. However, in general, direct chronological information in coal has been sparse. The coal investigated in the present study is from the Mile intermontane basin, Yunnan Province, China, north of an arm of the Mesozoic Tethys Ocean. The coal contains marine geochemical signatures and syngenetic gypsum, common in coastal-marine sediments. The gypsum contains marine-derived Sr and, hence, has geochronological potential. The 87Sr/86Sr record (0.708350-0.708591) in the Mile coal agrees with time-calibrated 87Sr/86Sr records of marine planktonic foraminifera obtained from core DSDP 588C, 22.25-18.27 Ma (Early Miocene). The peat of the Mile coal was deposited over 4.6 Ma., which possibly is the longest deposition of a coal bed in the world to have been found today, although this duration should include the period of non-peat deposition or erosion if present during the time of the 4.6-Ma. During this period, the regional geological structures were determined by the India-Eurasia collision, which resulted in transform faults with extensive rift structures, including the Mile rhomb-shaped graben. This structural setting enabled the flow of seawater from the South China Sea to reach inland graben structures, including that of the Mile Basin, where peat was deposited. Subsequent deformation caused by the South China-Indochina collision changed the regional structural and geographical-hydrological patterns. This affected the hydrology of the Mile Basin and resulted in its uplift to its present-day elevation of 1350 m. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to use the marine-derived 87Sr/86Sr indicator and chronometer in coal. At present, marine-influenced peats generated in coastal salt marshes extend from the Arctic Ocean (Alaska and Siberia) in the north, to Patagonia and New Zealand in the south, while mangrove forests abound in equatorial and low-latitude coastal areas. The 87Sr/86Sr record of marine-influenced coal in this study area, provides a key for the determination of age-duration-rate of geological processes in the inland basin, associated with the closure of the Tethys Ocean. Results indicate that this method has potential for providing a temporal framework for geological events and processes in other areas. These may be found near marine shore lines across the globe dating back to the Devonian. Moreover, the 87Sr/86Sr signal in marine-influenced coal can be used for correlation with the well-established 87Sr/86Sr chronology of marine planktonic foraminifera. In turn, the 87Sr/86Sr signal provides a basis for correlating terrestrial records of climate and environment contained in this type of coal and associated sediments, with those of marine sediments, such as those based on δ18O in planktonic foraminifera. © 2019 The Authors","51","Coal","Coal deposits - Deposition - Geochronology - Gypsum - Peat - Sediments - Submarine geology - Transform faults","China-Indochina collision - Coastal marine environment - Coastal marine sediments - Equatorial and low latitudes - Geochemical signatures - Palaeoenvironment - Planktonic foraminifera - Strontium isotopes","471.1 Oceanography, General - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 524 Solid Fuels - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for Jilin University Science and Technology Innovative Research Team; Number: 41902164, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41420104001 and 41902164 ), the "111" Project ( B17042 ), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (No. IRT_17R104 ).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the study of source rock, reservoir and cover combination of the target area together with research on their structural features and preservation condition, this paper made analysis of the area’s reservoir forming condition and its main controlling factors. Results shows that two types of effective source rock exist in this area---Long maxi Formation, Wufeng Formation and Qiongzhusi Formation, their thickness being relatively high, with organic carbon amount to 0.1~5.91%. Ranked the III pattern kerogen and being in the post mature thermal evolution stage, they form the material basis of the area’s natural gas reservoir forming. While other stones and formations provide favorable reservoir and cover combinations for the area’s natural gas concentration. They include Dolomite of the Upper Sinian Dengying Formation, The lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi formation mudstone, Jinding Hill mudstone, The sandstone of Lower Cambrian Ming Temple Group, Ming Si mudstone, Gypsum rocks of Lower Cambrian Gaotai formation, The Qingxudong top limestone, Its middle mudstone, The lower Ordovician Meitan formation mudstone, the upper Cambrian dolomite of Loushanguan group, The lower Cambrian mudstone, Hanjiadian group mudstone, Silurian shiniulan formation limestone and The Longmaxi formation shale. The multiperiod structured superposition sets the entrapment condition and motive for the concentration of natural gas. But the fault development is detrimental to its preservation. Despite of this, the fine cap rock is important for the gas’ reservoir forming. And areas of well-preserved Dolomite of the Upper Sinian Dengying Formation and combined trap of Shiniulan group of limestone are advantageous for future exploration. © 2014 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

Their SiO2contents range from 43.63 wt.% to 48.23 wt.%. The basalts belong to the weakly alkaline (average total alkalis Na2O+K2O=3.59 wt.%), high-Ti (3.21 wt.% to 4.32 wt.%) magma series. The basalts are characterized by OIB-like trace elements patterns, which are enriched in large ion lithosphile elements (LILE) including Rb and Ba, and display negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies as shown on the spider diagrams. The Tabai basalts display light rare-earth elements (LREE) enrichment and are depleted in heavy rare-earth elements (HREE) on the REE pattern. Those dates indicate that the parental magma of the Tabai basalts was derived from low-degree (1%-5%) partial melting of garnet peridotite. The magma underwent olivine fractional crystallization and minor crustal contamination during their ascent. The Tabai basalts were related to a relaxation event which had triggered the Emeishan fossil plume head re-melting in the Middle Triassic. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","40","Basalt","Exploratory geochemistry - Melting - Petrology - Rare earth elements - Rare earths - Silica - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Titanium compounds - Trace analysis - Trace elements","Crustal contamination - Fractional crystallization - Heavy rare earth elements - Light rare earth elements - Major and trace elements - Petrogenesis - SW China - Tabai","481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: SKLODG-ZY125-02, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2008186, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41073032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This study is financially supported jointly by the Crisis Mines Continued Resources Exploration Project of the China Geological Survey (No. 2008186); the 12th Five-Year Plan Project of the State Key Laboratory of Ore-deposit Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SKLODG-ZY125-02) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41073032).

The new discovery confirm that the pH of the Late Permian coals range from 1.86 to 8.62, with an average of 5.70 (n=83) and the proportions of acidic coal (pH≤5.6) and normal coal (pH>5.6) take account for 41% and 59% respectively, and 97.1% of coal is outcrop coal. The pH of outcrop coals range from 1.86 to 8.62, with an average of 4.86 (n=55), and the pH of acidic outcrop coal reaches 3.39(1.82-5.50, n=33). The pH of coals in mine range from 4.45 to 7.94, with an average of 7.36. The average pH of domestic coal ranges from 6.71 to 7.81, which shows that the acidity of outcrop is stronger than that of mine coal and domestic coal. The measured average value of total sulfate is 249-64706 μg/g with an average value of 7070 μg/g (n=83). The fluorine content in coal is 44-382 μg/g, with an average of 120 μg/g (n=83), which is close to the background value of fluorine content in Chinese coal (130 μg/g). The pH and p(SO42-) of coal is positively correlated (correlation coefficient: 0.62), which could conclude that the form of acid may be acidic sulfate such as KHSO4or NaHSO4. When the clay with high fluorine content coexists with acidic coal in the study area, under certain circumstances, such as heating or burning, they would lead to a chemical reaction producing volatile fluoride (HF). The acid and the high content of sulfate in coals may be derived from the oxidation of pyrite. © 2016, China Coal Society.

Taking the plateau mountainous city-the urban agglomeration in the central Yunnan as an example, and selecting the land use data in 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2015 and DEM data as the basic data source, from the aspects of quantitative structure and spatial layout to analyze the characteristics of territory space pattern change of the urban agglomeration in the central Yunnan at four time points., revealing the spatio-temporal evolution and differentiation of the territory space pattern. The results showed that the topographical features of the plateau mountainous areas affected the distribution of the territory space pattern of the urban agglomerations in central Yunnan, and the vertical differences characteristics were significant. The ecological space was the absolute main body of the territory space type in the urban agglomeration, and the production and living space were mainly distributed in the east of the central part of the study area. In the past 15 years, the spatial change of the production-living-ecological space was accelerated and the regional differences were obvious. The production and living space area were gradually increased, and the ecological space continued to be decreased, showing an overall situation of 'break the pale'. The mutual transformation of ecological and production space area constituted the main type of evolution of the territory space pattern. The territory space use degree was increased year by year, and the hotspots of territory space use degree were mainly concentrated in some areas in the central and eastern parts of the study area. At four time points, the territory space pattern in the study area was generally distributed along the northeast-southwest direction. The distribution of production and living space in the northeast was the most concentrated, and the ecological space pattern was more random. The spatial distribution characteristics of kernel density in production and living space were characterized by high density in the central, western and northeastern regions, and low in the south, southwest and northwest, and multi-nuclear diffusion and fragmentation. The spatial distribution characteristics of the calculated values of the kernel density of the ecological space were relatively dense in the east of the central part of the urban agglomeration, and disturbed by human activities, with severe fragmentation and uneven distribution.

To clarify the relationship between EAM and IM subsystems during the mid-Holocene, a 2085-year (6,270–4,185 a BP) high-resolution record from stalagmite (FL4) in Yunnan, China was reconstructed using ICP-MS-230Th series dating and carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (δ13C and δ18O). In the study period, successive positive δ18O trends revealed a generally weakening Asian monsoon, with the monsoon climate tending toward gradual drying, especially during three centennial-scale drought events in 6,270–6,126 a BP, 5,347–5,140 a BP, and 4,810–4,620 a BP. On the other hand, the uninterrupted negative trend in δ13C signified natural improvements in vegetation overlying the cave, and a serious deficit (~2.5 ‰) in δ13C during 5,519–5,345 a BP implied a heavy rainfall event, in precise phase with δ18O, demonstrating an enhanced Indian Monsoon subsystem. The dense sawtooth-shaped pattern of the carbon and oxygen isotope records indicates that a series of decadal-scale abrupt climate changes were superimposed on the centennial-scale monsoon climate changes. FL4 stalagmite records in the mid-Holocene reflect a gradually weakening monsoon climate with superimposed decadal–centennial events, but natural improvements in local vegetation through self-adjustment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","28","Climate change","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Carbon - Caves - Drought - Isotopes - Oxygen - Rain - Vegetation","Abrupt climate change - Carbon and oxygen isotopes - East Asian monsoon - High resolution - Holocene climate - Indian monsoon - Monsoon climate - Self adjustment","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

(3) In terms of the correlation between element concentration and ash yield, all the elements were accordingly divided into five groups. In addition, three coal samples (No. KM50, KM64 and LM61) were found to have relatively high Cr concentration as 1055, 1072, and 1152, respectively. Analysis of these three coal samples shows an M-type REE enrichment pattern (UCC normalized), with positive Eu abnormlies of 2.96, 2.52, and 3.96, respectively.

Based on the results of bench flotation tests, it has been suggested that traditional flotation with the target of only metallic values in the ore was not available and profitable due to the fact that it was inevitable of the deteriorated dilution of serpentines in the flotation concentration using common various kinds of flocculants or depressants, in which the content of MgO in the concentrate was around 20.0%, while leaching tests by waste acids from producing TiO2 indicated that this may be a promising method to extract MgO andα-Fe2O3 from the ore sample, since it can weaken the disturbance of serpentines significantly and lead a satisfied results of the Cu-Ni sulfide flotation. In this study, a harmonious flow-sheet, which involves leaching by waste acids and traditional flotation process, had been designed with the objective of extracting the metallic values and two non-metallic products, which includesα-Fe2O3 and MgO, from the ore sample. It is worthy noticed that the acidic waste liquids from a TiO2 company in Panzihua was used as leaching agent, which can dissolve 98.81% Mg2+ and 78.43% Fen+ with little Ni2+ and Cu2+. By the comparison of the flotation results and benefits between traditional flotation alone and harmonious design, besides the two more qualified non-metallic products, α-Fe2O3 and MgO, a better concentrate containing a grade of only 2.64% MgO at the grades of 2.58% Cu, 2.97% Ni and 81.02 g/t Pt+Pd with the recoveries of 93.79% Cu, 83.14% Ni and 79.19% Pt+Pd respectively, were harvested from the harmonious design. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","19","Ore treatment","Flocculation - Flotation - Leaching - Metallurgical engineering - Nickel deposits - Ores - Palladium - Platinum - Product design - Profitability - Serpentine - Testing - Titanium dioxide","Acidic leaching - Acidic waste - Flotation process - Flotation tests - Harmonious design - Leaching agents - Leaching test - MgO - Non-metallic products - Sulfide flotation - TiO - Waste acids","911.2 Industrial Economics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 548.1 Nickel - 913.1 Production Engineering - 547.1 Precious Metals - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 482.2 Minerals - 423.2 Non Mechanical Properties of Building Materials: Test Methods - 533.1 Ore Treatment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges (low = 1,000-1,400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1,400-1,800 masl, and high = 1,800-2,200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of 27 plots. We calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges, employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","51","Analysis of variance (ANOVA)","Biodiversity - Conservation - Farms - Multivariant analysis - Reforestation - Sea level - Soil moisture - Sustainable development - Vegetation","Abandoned farmland - Assessment - Eucalyptus plantations - Evergreen forests - Plant diversity - Understory","454 Environmental Engineering - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 922 Statistical Methods",,"Number: KZCX2-YW-422, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CRF, Sponsor: Cancer Research Foundation; Number: 2006CB403400, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 164375, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: -, Acronym: TRU, Sponsor: Thompson Rivers University; ","Acknowledgements This study was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 program, 2006CB403400) and the Knowledge Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-422).

The results showed that the variations of δD and δ18O values in precipitation exhibited remarkable seasonal variability. The stable isotopic values in precipitation were higher during dry season than those during wet season. The relations between δ18O in precipitation and air temperature, δ18O in precipitation and amount indicated significant negative correlations. However, it exhibited significant positive correlation between precipitation δ18O and wind speed at different pressure levels (300 hPa, 500 hPa, 700 hPa, and 800 hPa), and this result indicated that the wind speed was an important influencing factor for the variations of precipitation δ18O. With the increasing rainfall levels, the intercept and slope of meteoric water line also increased, and this phenomenon suggested that there was a secondary evaporation effect under sub-cloud in stable isotopes of precipitation. The backward trajectory model showed that the main moisture sources during dry season came from the westerly and the inland. However, during wet season, the remote ocean vapor was the main moisture source in Mengzi, and the δ18O values in precipitation were much lower during typhoon period. © 2016, Science Press.

We counted individual numbers of Little Grebe (Podiceps ruficollis), Common Coot (Fulica atra), Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) and collected water samples synchronously in February 2015. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the population densities of both Common Coot and Little Grebe were significantly correlated to the total nitrogen concentration and the total phosphorus concentration. While the population density of Common Moorhen was not correlated to either the total nitrogen concentration or the total phosphorus concentration. The results suggested that waterbirds could respond to nutrient changes in littoral zone of Lake Erhai in a species-specific way, and a thorough knowledge of the ecology of a given species is required to properly choose a waterbird bio-indicator species.

Zn-Pb mineralization appears to have occurred during the early Tertiary compressional phase of this continental basin. The Jinding orebody is hosted in the nonmarine Paleocene Yunlong Formation which may be divided into local depositional facies consisting of proximal rock slides, mid fan streamflow-dominated debris flows, fan delta and distal fan facies. High energy influx of coarse clastics and carbonate boulders adjacent to the Pijiang growth fault characterizes the Jinding host rock depositional environment. However, major orebodies are hosted in the fan delta fine sandstones and the underlying mid-fan fragment-bearing sandstone facies. Two hydrologic systems probably were involved in the Jinding ore-forming process according to the constraints provided by fluid inclusions, O, C, Sr, S, and Pb isotopes and biomarker geochemistry. A meteoric water system was resident in the shallow part of the alluvial fan and fan-delta complex. These pore waters mixed with hydrothermal brines that developed in the deeper part of the basin and ascended to the Jinding alluvial fan along the Pijiang fault. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the hydrothermal fluids were basinal brines with temperatures near 150$\sp\circ$C and 17 to 23 eq. wt % NaCl. These fluids are characterized by an average $\rm\delta\sp{18}O\sb{water}$ value of 9.3$\perthous$ (SMOW), depleted $\rm\delta\sp{13}C\sb{calcite}$ values ranging from $-$18.6 to $-$25.2$\perthous$ with a mean of $-$22.2$\perthous$ (PDB), elevated $\rm\sp{87}Sr/\sp{86}Sr$ values ($>$0.7102) and homogeneous Pb isotope compositions (average $\rm\sp{206}Pb/\sp{204}Pb=18.449,\ \sp{207}Pb/\sp{204}Pb=15.649,\ \sp{208}Pb/\sp{204}Pb=38.663).$ The pristane/phytane, $\rm C\sp{35}/C\sp{34}C\sb{27}$-C$\sb{28}$-C$\sb{29}$ gammacerane/hopane and sterane/hopane indices of the Jinding organic compounds suggest an anoxic, hypersaline and probably marine carbonate source rock. Pb isotopic data suggest that the ore fluid was well mixed during transportation without Pb contribution from the basement. Organic geochemical data suggest the source of Jinding petroleum was marine carbonate sediments. However the elevated homogeneous Sr isotope data indicate the involvement of clastic sources. The other end member pore fluids are characterized by lower temperatures $({\le}70\sp\circ$C) that allowed sulfate-reducing bacteria to produce H2S that was fixed as sulfide minerals with depleted S isotope values ($-$32.0 to $-$11.1$\perthous,$ CDT). This type of fluid is isotopically lighter in O ($\rm\delta\sp{18}O\sb{H2O}=1.3$ to 4.8$\perthous,$ SMOW) and heavier in C ($\rm\delta\sp{13}C={-}3$ to ${-}16.8\perthous$ PDB). Mixing of the high temperature and high salinity metal-bearing ore fluid with lower temperature, reduced S-rich fluid resulted in sulfide precipitation in the Jinding alluvial fan/fan delta complex.

The Qiongzhusi shale of study area is characterized by high organic content with TOC over 2%. The black shale was all high-over mature because of the old Qiongzhusi Formation. The major mineralogical compositions of shale are detrital minerals, carbonatite minerals and clay minerals. The black shale has a high brittleness mineral content and the brittleness index averages at 0.62. Clay minerals are mainly composed of illite, followed by the I/S layers and chlorite, and the kaolinite content is low. Qiongzhusi shale is characterized by low porosity and permeability and various pore types dominated by inkbottle-shaped pores, plate-like pores and slit-shaped pores. Nanoscale mesopores in shale play an important role. The specific surface area and total pore volume are low with an average of 9.18 m2/g and 10.38×10-3cm3/g, respectively. The fissures of shale reservoir are mainly of high angle crack. Carbonaceous shale in the upper part of target layer is characterized by well-developed fissures and silty shale in the lower part of target layer possesses undeveloped fissures. TOC and brittle minerals contents promote the development of fissures. Compared with typical marine shale from home and abroad, the shale from Qiongzhusi Formation in the Malong block of eastern Yunnan Province is mainly composed of silty shale with some thin carbonaceous shale. Barnett shale from Fort Worth, Longmaxi shale from Jiaoshiba area and Niutitang shale from Cen'gong block are mainly carbonaceous and siliceous shale. So the lithofacies of Qiongzhusi shale is poorer than that of the other three kinds of marine shale. The TOC content of Qiongzhusi shale is moderate, lower than that of the other three kinds of marine shale. The brittleness minerals content of Qiongzhusi shale is similar to that of Longmaxi shale and slightly lower than that of Niutitang shale. Qiongzhusi shale is characterized by good brittleness. The reservoir property and development of organic matter pores of Barnett shale and Longmaxi shale are better than those of Qiongzhusi shale and Niutitang shale. The organic matter pores in Qiongzhusi shale mainly develop in the mixture of organic matter and clay. The fissure development of Qiongzhusi shale is poorer than that of Barnett shale, Longmaxi shale and Niutitang shale. In addition, the gas content of Qiongzhusi shale is lower than that of other three kinds of marine shale, and Qiongzhusi shale has a strong adsorption ability. © 2016, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

In Raman spectrum, the main strong vibration bands at 463 and 355 cm-1were attributed to bending vibration of Si-O-Si.

Average Pb contents are 7.87 × 10-6 and 7.13 × 10-6, Th contents are 5.27 × 10-6 and 6.27 × 10-6, U contents are 1.16 × 10-6 and 0.97 × 10-6 respectively.

Sheared hornblende rocks at middle crustal level have typical mylonitic microstructures, shown by coarse porphyroclasts and fine matrix grains. Different mineral phases in the rocks show distinct deformation characteristics. Hornblende and feldspar grains are intensely deformed with obvious grainsize reduction, but quartz grains are recrystallized dominantly by grain growth. Hornblende grains show typical brittle-ductile transition nature. Initial crystallographic orientations of porphyroclasts have strong effects on the behavior of grains during deformation. There are mainly two types of porphyroclasts, type I 'hard' porphyroclasts and type II 'soft' porphyroclasts, with [001] perpendicular and parallel to external shear stresses respectively. 'Hard' porphyroclasts generally occur as competent grains that are rarely deformed or sometimes deformed by fracturing and dislocation tangling. 'Soft' porphyroclasts are highly deformed primarily by dislocation tangling (as shown in the cores of the porphyroclasts), but twinning, dislocation glide and climb probably due to hydrolytic weakening also contribute to dynamic recrystallization of the porphyroclasts into fine grains in the matrix. The micro-and submicrostructures of the two types of porphyroclasts and fine-grained matrix provide powerful evidence for the behavior of brittle-ductile transition of hornblende grains. It is concluded that twinning nucleation is one of the most important processes that operate during dynamic recrystallization of hornblende crystals at the brittle-ductile transition. (100) [001] twin gliding and dislocation creep (dislocation glide and climb) are mutually enhanced during twinning nucleation. As a newly discovered mechanism of dynamic recrystallization, it may have played more important roles than ever recognized during dynamic recrystallization of crystals with twins in the brittle-ductile transition. © Science in China press 2007.","39","Mineralogy","Brittleness - Deformation - Ductility - Dynamic recrystallization - Microstructure - Minerals - Nucleation - Rocks - Twinning","Brittle-ductile transition deformation - High-grade mylonites - Hornblende rocks","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth - 951 Materials Science","Theoretical (THR)","Number: 2006BAB01A03, Acronym: MEST, Sponsor: Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; Number: 1212010661311, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 2002CB412607, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: GPMR200637, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Received November 22, 2006; accepted March 8, 2007 doi: 10.1007/s11430-007-0063-3 †Corresponding author (email: jliu@cugb.edu.cn; shuyuncao@163.com) Supported by the State Key Research "973" Plan of China (Grant No. 2002CB412607), Geological Survey of China Project (Grant No. 1212010661311) and the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (Grant No. GPMR200637), and the Project of Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2006BAB01A03)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The displaced landslide material traveled a horizontal distance of ∼800 m with a vertical drop of ∼280 m and stopped at 1520 m a.s.l. To examine the possible mechanism and behavior of the landslide from initiation to runout, the shear behavior of soil samples collected from the sliding surface and runout path was examined by means of ring shear tests. The test results show that the shear strength of sample from the sliding surface is less affected by shear rate while the shear rate has a negative effect on the shear strength of runout path material. It is suggested that the source and runout path materials follow the frictional and Voellmy rheology, respectively. Post-failure behavior of the landslide was modeled by using a DAN-W model, and the numerical results show that the selected rheological relationships and parameters based on the results of ring shear tests may provide good performance in modeling the Zhenxiong landslide. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","34","Shear flow","Landslides - Numerical models - Shear deformation","Failure behaviors - Long run outs - Ring shear tests - Shear behavior - W model","631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2012BAK10B01, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 41372332, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41272382, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (No. 2012BAK10B01) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41272382 and 41372332).

However its mechanism along faults in the southeastern margin of the plateau remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we carry out a palaeomagnetic investigation of Cretaceous red beds in the Sanchahe area on the eastern Yupaojiang Fault in the western Sichuan-Yunnan Block in order to determine the range of rotation along the fault. The area is divided into two segments by Sanchahe town, and the bedding attitudes are defined by two plunging fold axes. The mean direction of the High Temperature Component (HTC) from the southern segment of the Sanchahe area is Ds=29.3°, Is=45.7°, ks=54.3, α95=6.6° after tilt correction, and Ds=30.6°, Is=46.6°, κ=69.3, α95=5.8° after tilt correction using an inclined fold axis. The HTC direction for the northern segment is Ds=350.4°, Is=42.1°, κ=69.4, α95=9.2° after tilt correction, and Ds=347.4°, Is=41.9°, ks= 96.6, α95=7.8° after tilt correction using an inclined fold axis. The southern segment experienced 20.5°±4.8° of clockwise rotation, whereas the northern segment experienced 22.7°±6.6° of anticlockwise rotation with respect to East Asia. Compared with previous palaeomagnetic results in this area, our results suggest that the Sichuan-Yunnan Block experienced ~20° of clockwise rotation, and ~20° of anticlockwise rotation in the northern segment of the Sanchahe area relative to the South China Block. This indicates a ~40° range of anticlockwise rotation in the northern segment of the Sanchahe area relative to the southern segment of the Sanchahe area, and that intense local deformation occurred along the Yupaojiang Fault which induced the formation of detachments in the upper crust. © 2019, Science Press.

Rainfall-triggered debris flows are frequent in the JJG. In order to model and predict these debris flow occurrences, we analyzed precipitation parameters (including intensity-duration thresholds and rainfall event-duration thresholds) that triggered past debris flow events in the JJG. Since the JJG is unique, any model used for predicting debris flows in this gully must be developed using data from only this gully. Furthermore, the effects of normalized precipitation and antecedent precipitation on debris flows in the JJG were considered. Debris flow data and precipitation data were compiled from 47 debris flow events in 1993, 1994, 1998-2001, 2004 and 2006 in JJG. All of these debris flows were triggered following a precipitation event with a duration of 6. h or less, with most of the precipitation events exhibiting a duration of 3 to 6. h. Only three rainfall events with a duration of less than 1. h and average intensity between 1.0 and 42.0. mm/h produced debris flows. The 90%, 70% and 50% probability curves for debris flow events were then constructed. Intensity-duration (I-D) and rainfall event-duration (RE-D) thresholds were then used for debris flow modeling based on preliminary tests and comparisons. Antecedent precipitation was found not to be a significant factor in triggering debris flows in the JJG; however, intraday precipitation played a significant role. Normalized precipitation threshold curves from adjacent areas were not well-correlated with the patterns observed in the JJG. Determination of unique thresholds for each gully is necessary for developing an effective prediction system. © 2015.","68","Debris","Forecasting - Landforms - Rain","Debris flow occurrences - Debris flows - Jiangjia Gully - Precipitation data - Precipitation events - Precipitation threshold - Probability curves - Rainfall thresholds","443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology",,"Number: 973, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB744703, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: PolyU, Acronym: IMHE, Sponsor: Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment; Number: 41202244, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are thankful to Prof. Hong Yong and Hu Kaiheng at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS for their valuable suggestions and assistance with this study.

Using these methods, a high-yield fibrinolytic enzyme-producing strain Bacillus subtilis LC-2-1 was successfully isolated, which secreted a kind of douchi fibrinolytic enzyme. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 27.4 kDa that contained 275 amino acids encoded by 825 bp. Compared to other douchi fibrinolytic enzymes and nattokinase, the enzyme produced by B. subtilis LC-2-1 showed significant differences, and the amino acid sequence homology was 85.1%. Additionally, the enzyme had high fibrinolytic activity, which was up to 79.84 U/mL. Thus, these results could provide a bacterial reference strain and theoretical basis to develop a new version of fermented douchi with thrombolytic activity.","17","Enzyme activity","Algae - Amino acids - Bacteriology - Cloning - Encoding (symbols) - Fermented milk - Gene encoding - Polysaccharides","Amino acid sequence - Bacterial strains - Dou-chi - Fibrinolytic activity - Fibrinolytic enzymes - Genetic analysis - Reference strains - Two-step screening","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on detailed site engineering geological survey and laboratory tests, combining the regional geological background and historical literatures analysis, it is presented that the main reason for the inclination of the two towers is earthquake rather than the nonuniformity of ground soils according to foundation settlement calculation and seismic simulation. The whipping effect derived from seismic action of the pagodas is significant which has caused several times top destruction in history. The vertical compressive forces at bottom layer fluctuate greatly during earthquake but it is safe comparing with the ultimate strengthen of brick masonry. Tension forces take place obviously at the middle part which cause fractures in case of high seismic magnitude. It is considerably reduced by the silt clay under the pagodas foundation that the propagation of earthquake wave from ground and the effect of the seismic vibration.","8","Earthquakes","Geology - Towers","Compressive forces - Dali Three Pagodas - Foundation settlement - Geological background - Inclination - Laboratory test - Seismic simulation - Seismic vibrations","402.4 Towers - 481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

More recent studies demonstrated that the lung cancer risk was associated with nanoquartz embedded in the soot emissions from coal combustion. However, there were few reports related to mineralogy of the fine quartz particles from the local coal samples. In order to investigate mineralogical characterization of quartz particles in the Permian coal deposited in Xuanwei City, 15 coal samples were collected from Laibin Town (higher lung incidence area) and its adjacent areas. Mineral composition in the samples was determined by optical microscope, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Results showed that the coal in Xuanwei is bituminous which contained volatile and vitrinite. Minerals in the coal are mainly consisted with quartz, chamosite, calcite and kaolinite. Crystalline degrees of minerals are different among coal samples. Statistical analysis results of individual mineral particles showed that the percentage of quartz particles was 37.9% among the measured 775 particles. Diameters of quartz grains mostly ranged from 1-2 μm in the coal. The irregular fine quartz particles coexisting with chamosite could be found in the fractions of coal samples. This result demonstrated that the quartz in Xuanwei coal was deposited from a siliceous hydrothermal fluid which contained a large amount of iron and aluminum, and not originated from deposition of clastic rock. In addition, the percentage of minerals containing rich silicon and iron could be found in the coal samples collected in the areas with high risk of lung cancer such as Laibin Town. With these data, we will further focus on the biological activity of quartz grains with the participation of iron, and try to produce new valuable data for the research on lung cancer in Xuanwei City.","30","Coal","Aluminum coatings - Bioactivity - Biological organs - Coal combustion - Diseases - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Iron - Iron research - Kaolinite - Minerals - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Quartz - X ray diffraction","Crystalline degree - Hydrothermal fluids - Lung Cancer - Mineral composition - Mineralogical characterization - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) - Scanning electronic microscopy - Xuanwei","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 482.2 Minerals - 524 Solid Fuels - 545.1 Iron - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The boron isotope ratios for brachiopods in Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Triassic calcites are in the ranges 8.9‰-14.0‰, 8.8‰-13.8‰, 10.3‰-16.3‰, and 6.7‰-12.4‰, respectively.

The δ11B values for both brachiopods and corals are significantly lower than those for modern biogenic carbonates, indicating that the Paleozoic oceans were depleted of δ11B by up to 10‰. Our results are consistent with previous published studies. The boron isotope compositions of corals and brachiopods show the consistent trends.

This internal process regulates the fluctuations of N concentration, especially for lakes with high nutrients concentrations and long residence time. Lakes in Yunnan plateau (southwestern China) provide typical cases, while studies in this region have been rare. Therefore, we studied denitrification of two lakes (Lake Dianchi in hypereutrophic state and Lake Erhai in mesotrophic) in this region. We used acetylene inhibition technique to quantify potential denitrification rate (PDR) of these lakes in April and August, 2015 and 2016. PDR of the sediments ranged 0–1.21 μmol/(N·m2·hr), and that of overlying water ranged 0–0.24 μmol/(N·L·hr). Then, we used Least Angle Regression to determine the controlling factors for denitrification. Nutrients controlled PDR from two aspects: providing essential nitrogen sources; and affecting the richness and metabolism of denitrifying bacteria. In April, both aspects limited PDR; while only nitrogen sources limited PDR in August, due to depleted nitrate and enhanced denitrifying bacteria activity. Ammonia was most significant to denitrification, indicating that nitrate from nitrification transported to the bottom of well-mixed lake provide major N source by denitrification. The high PDR and low nitrate concentrate in August were evidence of an enhanced internal N cycling by algal blooms. © 2018","75","Denitrification","Bacteria - Lakes - Nitrates - Nitrogen - Nitrogen removal - Nutrients","Algal blooms - Controlling factors - Denitrifying bacteria - Freshwater ecosystem - Internal cycling - Least angle regressions - Nitrogen sources - Potential denitrification",,,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Cornell University; Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51779002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Basic Research Program (973) of China (No. 2015CB458900 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51779002 ).

The Ludian earthquake triggered a collapse in Chapingzi, right bank of the Niulanjiang River, and a landslide in Hongshiyan at the left bank on the same location. These events occurred 1.5 km downstream of the Hongshiyan hydropower station. Debris deposits from the collapse and the landslide blocked the river channel and formed a landslide dam. In this study, the Hongshiyan landslide dam induced by the Ludian earthquake was chosen as the study case to discuss integrated landslide dam management and its potential hydropower uses. After emergency management measures are carried out, further analysis shows the outflow through the Hongshiyan landslide dam is manageable, which indicate safety issues are controllable. Two management schemes are discussed in this paper: one that uses the Hongshiyan landslide dam for power generation and one that removes the debris deposit. The result shows that using the strengthened landslide dam for power generation is feasible and economically sound.
