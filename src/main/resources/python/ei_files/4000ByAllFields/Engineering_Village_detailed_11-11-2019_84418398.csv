The influence of micro emitter type on soil water distribution was studied in this paper. Two different irrigation systems (surface drip irrigation and root micro irrigation), two different irrigation emitter types (flow adjustable irrigation emitter and drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch) and three different irrigation times (5, 15 and 30 minutes) were applied on the Yunnan red loam and the yellow sand soils. Soil moisture was determined. The results showed that there was a very significant interaction between the emitter type and the soil type, the emitter type and the irrigation time (P 0.05). The flow adjustable irrigation emitter has 8 horizontal drainage holes. The horizontal width of the irrigation water in the 2 soils was both wide (about 25 cm). The drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch has a downward single hole. The horizontal width of the irrigation water in the 2 soils was both narrow (about 16 cm). Therefore, for the wide root extension of crops, the application of the flow adjustable irrigation emitter should be more suitable, on the contrary, the drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch are used instead. In the Yunnan red loam, the areas with higher water content for the root micro-irrigation using belt embedded with inner patch were more close to those of crop roots, the areas with higher water content for the surface drip irrigation basically concentrated on the upper part of the soil of the flower pot. Therefore, compared to the surface drip irrigation, water loss due to evaporation in root irrigation greatly reduced. In the Yunnan red loam, the matric potential to the movement of irrigation water played the main role and water was easy to sink; In yellow sand soil, the gravitational potential to the movement of irrigation water played a main role which could cause the deep percolation of water. In the Yunnan red loam, the soil moisture areas corresponding to 70% of the total area mostly had the narrow and low water content when the irrigation time was short. And each section was continuous. The range of the soil moisture section corresponding to 70% of the total area was the widest in the 3 irrigation times. And the uniformity of soil water distribution was also the highest; in the yellow sand soil, with the increase of irrigation time, the range of the soil moisture content section corresponding to 70% of the total area was larger than that in Yunnan red loam. This showed that sections with low and high soil moisture content were in the majority with uneven distribution in Yunnan red loam. And the sections with middle soil moisture content were in the majority with even distribution in yellow sand soil.

To understand the potential impact of N and P from atmospheric depositions on the eutrophication of Lake Yangzonghai, this research investigated the temporal variation and estimated the fluxes of N and P from atmospheric depositions in the lake catchment. The sources and impact factors of the N and P depositions were analyzed by monitoring data from May 2012 to April 2014. Since Lake Yangzonghai is a P-limited lake, this study especially compared the P fluxes from N and P atmospheric deposition with that from non-point sources, and assessed the potential P-impact from atmospheric deposition on the eutrophication lake. The results showed that the average annual deposition flux of total nitrogen was 248 mg/m2, and seasonal deposition fluxes in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 200, 306, 274 and 214 mg/m2, respectively. The peak of N flux occurred in summer because of the increased rainfall. The annual average P deposition flux was 24 mg/m2, and seasonal deposition fluxes in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 18, 31, 19 and 27 mg/m2, respectively. Compared with the non-point P-load source, P-input from atmospheric deposition seemed very small, and would have little effect on the eutrophication of the lake. © 2017 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","48","Deposition","Atmospheric chemistry - Catchments - Eutrophication - Lakes - Meteorological problems - Nitrogen - Phosphorus","Annual average - Atmospheric depositions - Deposition fluxes - Non-point source - Potential impacts - Temporal variation - Total nitrogen - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through the study on the spectral feature of OH-and Fe2+and Fe3+related to alteration, specific image processing methods were improved and the related operation flow was developed. As interferential factors to alteration, vegetation influence was lessened by the criterion in which the ratios 5/4 more than 1 mean wholly vegetated then were masked in the process, whereas the ratios 5/4 less than or equal to 1 mean semi-vegetated and useful information-bearing then were taken into data process; snow and shadow were lessened by the criterion in which the ratios 7/1 less than 0.8 mean snow and shadow fully covered then were masked also. With interferential factors masked, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with ETM bands 1, 4, 5 and 7 for alteration related to OH- was conducted, which is on the basis of the principle that OH-has high reflectance in band 5 but high absorption in band 3. Similarly, PCA with bands 1, 3, 4 and 5 for alteration related to Fe2+, Fe3+was conducted, which is on the basis of the fact that Fe2+Fe3+has high reflectance in band 3 but high absorption in bands 1,4 and 5 as well. As the result of PCA, alteration abnormality component was ascertained by the contribution of characteristic bands. Meanwhile, alteration grades were delineated by the standard deviation δ of pixel value of abnormality component. Furthermore, through rational abnormity explanations and alteration type analyses from the view of regional geographic and geological characters, information was obtained that OH--related alteration mainly designates K-feldspar alteration, phyllic alteration and prophilized alteration which is closely related to porphyry type copper deposit. Meanwhile, Fe2+,Fe3+-related alteration designates pyritization which is commonly distributed and mainly related to hydrothermal type or skarn type multi-mineral deposit. Accordingly, the remote sensing alteration models for porphyry type copper deposit and skarn type multi-mineral deposit were set up, by which more potential mineral areas were delineated. By drill verifications conducted in target areas, new mine areas were found. By this way, the study not only reveals that original alteration-related information could be directly extracted from ETM, but also shows that the alteration extraction flow and remote sensing alteration application developed in this study is practical in mineral application, especially with ETM data which are so commonly used and readily available.","9","Principal component analysis","Copper deposits - Data mining - Deposits - Feldspar - Feldspar deposits - Gait analysis - Geographic information systems - Geology - Hazards - Image enhancement - Reflection - Remote sensing - Snow","Characteristic bands - Geological character - Image processing - methods - Northwest Yunnan - Operation flow - Spectral feature - Standard deviation - Western yunnan","443.3 Precipitation - 461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The IsoSource model was applied to compute the probable contribution of multiple potential water sources to total plant. The results show that in the ecosystem of Pinus Yunnanensis plantations, there exists significant evaporative isotopic fractionation during the process of hydraulic infiltration from precipitation to ground water and soil water and that of hydraulic redistribution in the soil profile. Water utilization positions and proportions of Pinus Yunnanensis and its accompanying trees and bushes vary from season to season, and they are evident competitors for water. During dry seasons, mature Pinus Yunnanensis uses 68.6% of 0-55cm soil water while the contribution of 30-110cm soil water and groundwater to the young Pinus Yunnanensis reaches 55.8% and 31.7% respectively.

In this study, regional land cover type maps were drawn using the MODIS products from 2001 and 2010 based on the modified classification scheme embodied by the characteristics of land cover in Yunnan. Dynamic change in each type of land cover was investigated by classification statistics, dynamic transfer matrices, and landscape pattern metrics. In addition, the driving factors of LUCC were discussed. The results showed that the land cover types of the Yunnan province, especially woodland (WL), cropland (CL) and grassland (GL), had experienced noticeable changes with an area of about 30% of land during the study period. And there was an obvious vertical distribution pattern for land cover types. The average altitude of different land cover types from the highest to the lowest were unused land (UUT), WL, GL, water (WT), urban and built-up areas (UB) and CL. The average slope for most of the land-cover types did not vary over the past 10 years. Stabilization and homogenization will be the direction of land cover in the future according to landscape metrics analysis. The regional differences of land use structure in the area are strongly influenced by such factors as the geographical position, level of economic development and land use policy.

Yunnan's exploitable hydropower resources rank third in China, second only to Tibet and Sichuan Province. Yunnan has experienced soaring growth in installed hydropower capacity in the past several decades. The fast development of hydropower makes the province one of the main producers and exporters of hydroelectricity. However, with inconsistencies between hydropower development and various related resources, more and more hydropower generation has been curtailed in recent years. The increasing curtailment of hydropower generation not only caused large-scale waste of sustainable energy, but also impaired the potential higher contribution of hydropower for GHG emission reduction. This paper provides an overview of the hydropower resources and their development in Yunnan and systematically analyzes the constraints causing the curtailment of hydropower generation. We argue that there are several constraining factors such as slowdown of economic growth, inadequate transmission capacity due to a weak grid structure, inconsistency between power grid companies and local government, and uneven distribution of precipitation seasonally and annually.

In order to accelerate the transformation of extensive regional water resources utilization and achieve sustainable regional economy development, this paper establishes a Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE) incorporating water resources elements of Yunnan Province, and simulates the water price changes.

These alkali-rich magmatic rocks include granites and syenites. The former includes granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry, and the later consists of syenite porphyry and trachyte. In this paper, we report major and trace elemental composition, zircon U-Pb geochronology and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition of these alkali-rich magmatic rocks. The zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the granites and syenites formed at 35. 1 - 36. 1Ma and 35.7 - 35. 8Ma, respectively, consistent with the Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatic rocks in western Yunnan. Geochemical results showed that the granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry belong to high-K calc-alkalic series, with SiO2 contents of 67. 92% ∼69. 93% and K2O/Na2O ratios of 0. 86 ∼ 1. 22. The syenite porphyry and trachyte belong to shoshonite series, with SiO2 contents of 53. 94% ∼63. 51% and K2O/Na2O ratios of I. 20 ∼ 2. 68. They are both enriched in alkali, K2O, light rare-earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), but depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs) relatively. The granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry geochemically show adakitic affinity, characterized by high Sr contents and high ratios of Sr/Y, La/Yb, but low Y and Yb contents. These geochemical signatures, along with Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions, reveal that the granites were product of partial melting of thickened mafic lower crust and the syenites were derived from direct partial melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle with various degree of fractionation. These alkali-rich magmatic rocks in the Jianchuan area formed during the late stage of collision between Indian and Eurasian continents. The Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatism is the response to asthenospheric upwelling, following the thinning of mantle lithosphere in western Yunnan. © 2019 Eco-Vector LLC.

Geologic evidence suggests that controls on the deposit are both stratigraphic and structural. The Luziyuan Pb-Zn deposit, hosted by marble and marbleization-limestone of the Shahechang Group, is the largest in this area. Mineralization consists of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and magnetite. Alteration consists of skarnization, chloritization, silicification, pyritization, and marbleization. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the mineralization has two main stages: the lower-middle temperature stage (homogenization temperatures of 160°C to 280°C) and the upper-middle temperature stage (homogenization temperatures of 280°C to 420°C). Sulfide has a very uniform S, Pb isotope composition, with δ(34S)=(9.23-10.17)×10-3, ω(206Pb)/ω(204Pb)=18.224-18.338, ω(207Pb)/ω(204Pb)=15.715-15.849, and ω(204Pb)=38.381-38.874. Both the S and Pb isotopes of ore indicate the partial role of magma hydrothermal fluid in mineralization. The carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in the Zhenkang area are considered to be strata-bound hydrothermal deposits that formed in favorable tectonic areas in the basis of ore source beds, are associated with magma activities, and have the features of multi-epochs and multi-stages as well as multi-sources in mineralization.","17","Lead zinc deposits","Geochemistry - Isotopes - Limestone - Marble - Mineralogy","Baoshan-Zhenkang Paleozoic sedimentary basin - Fluid inclusion - Mineralization - Yunnan province of southwestern China","414 Masonry Materials - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys","Applications (APP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For zinc smelting industry, the coefficient of the producing pollution (count by zinc) is 570.43 kg/t, and the coefficient of discharging pollution is 8.46-19.54 kg/t.

The feldspathoid syenite contains many feldspathoid minerals including nepheline, sodalite and alkaline dark minerals. In this paper, we further divide the feldspathoid syenite into four categories according to its mineral composition and characteristics: melanite nepheline sodalite, nepheline sodalite, nepheline and sodalite nepheline syenites. Geochemical analysis revealed peralkaline characteristics with very high K2O+Na2O content. The rocks also show potassium characteristics. The high rock differentiation index (DI) indicates high degree evolutionary differentiation of magma at its origin. The rare earth element (REE) patterns show enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) and depletion in heavy rare earth elements (HREE). The rocks are generally enriched in high field strength elements (HFSE) Zr and Hf but depleted in Ta and Ti; they are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) Th and U but depleted in Ba and Sr, and P. They have low Cr, Co and Ni contents and moderate negative Eu and weak negative Ce anomalies. These petrographic and geochemical features are obvious indication that feldspathoid syenite underwent fractional crystallization during the magmatic evolution. The temperature of the magma origin was about 835 and the origin laid relatively deep. The rock subtype is A1 of the A type suites. We suggest that the Gejiu feldspathoid syenite may be the product of high fractional crystallization from enriched mantle of amphibole or phlogopite facies at high temperatures and that it was formed in the late Yanshanian extensional tectonic setting with the mixing of continental crust components. © 2019, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

Thus, the S-wave velocity structure and distribution characteristics of Poisson's ratio in crust of Yunnan are obtained by inversion. The results show that the crustal thickness is gradually thinned from north to south. The crustal thickness in Zhongdian of northwest reaches as many as 62.0 km and the one in Jinghong of further south end is only 30.2 km. What should be especially noted is that there exists a Moho upheaval running in NS in the Chuxiong region and a Moho concave is generally parallel to it in Dongchuan. In addition, there exists an obvious transversal inhomogeneity for the S-wave velocity structure in upper mantle and crust in the Yunnan region. The low velocity layer exists not only in 10.0-15.0 km in upper crust in some regions, but also in 30.0-40.0 km in lower crust. Generally, the Poisson's ratio is on the high side, however it has a better corresponding relation to the crustal velocity structure. An obvious block distribution feature is still shown on such a high background of Poisson's ratio. It is discovered by synthetically analyzing the velocity structure and Poisson's ratio distribution that there are high Poisson's ratio and complicated crust-mantle velocity structure feature in the Sichuan-Yunnan Diamond Block with Xiaojiang fault to be the east boundary and Yulong Snow Mountain fault to be the west boundary besides the frequent seismicity. This feature differs obviously from that of surrounding areas, which would provide geophysical evidence to deeply study the eastwardly flowage of lithospheric substances in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

The research found that the formation of ore deposits closely corresponded to the tectonic evolution, and different deposits were formed in different developmental stages. The regional NW-trending main faults corresponding to the tectonic evolution controlled the rock belts distribution, and the secondary faults and fold controlled morphology and occurrence of the rock mass. Porphyry deposit is mainly distributed in the core of the anticline and the emplacement depth of mineralized porphyry is shallow; skarn copper deposit was mainly produced in the core of the syncline and the emplacement depth of the porphyry was relatively deep. Most mineralized porphyries were composite pluton and often had a volcanic rock cover on the top of the composite pluton, which indicated that volcanic magmatic activity had the inherited characteristics. The formation of the Pulang super-large sized porphyry copper deposit was strictly controlled by the intersection of NW trending structure and NEE structure, it formed a “trinity” porphyry mineralization system which included porphyry copper deposit inside rock mass, skarn copper deposit of the contact zone and the large vein copper ore bodies in surrounding rocks, and also include the lead-zinc deposit and epithermal gold (silver) deposit in the outer contact zone. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

In this work, the physicochemical property of three honeys (Viciacracca honey, Hevea brasiliensis honey and Punica granatum honey) from Yunnan was studied. The results showed that in different honeys the moisture content, electrical conductivity and dynamic viscosity were different. The sugar contents of each honey were determined with HPLC-RI. The results showed that P. granatum honey had the most abundant glucose [35.62 g·(100 g)-1], and H. brasiliensis honey had the most abundant fructose [41.03 g·(100 g)-1]. Thirteen different mineral elements in three honey species were determined with FAAS. It was found that the mineral level was from 167.24 mg·kg-1in P. granatum honey to 437.34 mg·kg-1in H. brasiliensis. Based on the mineral content the three honey species were classified following the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The result showed that Cu, Zn and Na could act as the elemental markers for V. cracca honey, while Mg, K, Ca, As and Cd act as the elemental markers for H. brasiliensis honey, and Fe, Mn, Ni, and Cr act as the elemental markers for P. granatum honey.

Here we characterize the bauxite deposit in Yunnan area, China, through mineralogical and textural characteristics using XRD, SEM-EDX, and micro-Raman analyses. The Al-oxyhydroxide polymorphs (AlO(OH)) such as diaspore and boehmite are the dominant phases in most of the samples. Gibbsite (Al(OH)3) is the main mineral in two samples from Quaternary bauxite, and these three Al-rich minerals mixed with goethite, hematite, kaolinite, and small amounts of TiO2polymorphs (anatase and rutile). Considering the textural characteristics and the stratigraphy of the bauxite deposit, some of the Al-oxyhydroxides and Ti-oxides are inferred to be products of the bauxitization in the lateritic soil during late Permian weathering. In the subsequent transgression stage, the earlier formed (Al-rich minerals and anatase) phases were transformed to diaspore or boehmite as spherulitic form and to rutile, respectively, with the processes of diagenesis, burial metamorphism, tectonic movements and magmatic activity. Following crustal uplift in the Yunnan Province after the late Triassic, diaspore was transformed into boehmite and the bauxite deposit formed earlier was exposed again to weathering resulting in the formation of gibbsite, hematite, goethite, kaolinite, and anatase, with diaspore, boehmite, and rutile remaining as relics. Our study provides insights into phase transformation during bauxitization and subsequent processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","63","Bauxite deposits","Aluminum coatings - Aluminum hydroxide - Corundum - Deposits - Hematite - Kaolinite - Oxide minerals - Phase transitions - Refractory materials - Stratigraphy - Titanium dioxide - Titanium oxides - Weathering","Bauxite - Bauxitization - Micro-Raman analysis - Oxyhydroxides - Phase transformation process - Tectonic movements - Textural characteristic - Yunnan province","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 504.1 Light Metal Mines - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.2 Refractories - 813.2 Coating Materials",,"Number: KMIPA 2015-7110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We are grateful to Prof. Maria Boni and anonymous reviewers for the valuable and constructive comments on the manuscript.

The present study examined the physical causes of this extreme drought event in terms of persistent anomalies of intraseasonal oscillation in the tropical atmosphere (the Madden-Julian Oscillation hereafter the MJO). The results show that the occurrence of severe drought in Yunnan was caused directly by deficient rainfall lasting from the summer of 2009 to the spring of 2010. Further exploration reveals a persistent positive variation of MJO index 1 from June to October. Accordingly, the convective activity over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) weakened continuously, and then an anomalous descending airflow was induced over the tropical Indian Ocean, resulted in the anomalous weakening of vertical Asian monsoon circulation in South Asia. Consequently, the transport of water vapor from the tropical Indian Ocean to Yunnan decreased abnormally, leading to persistent below-normal rainfall over Yunnan from summer to autumn in 2009. As a result, a severe drought began to appear in autumn. In the winter of 2009-2010, MJO index 1 remained persistently positive, indicating the continuous weakening of convective activity over the BOB. The atmospheric circulation associated with the persistent positive anomalies in the MJO also demonstrated anomalous patterns. Specifically, there was an anomalous high-pressure ridge stretching from South Asia through the Tibetan Plateau and into the western part of southwestern China. This indicates that the atmospheric circulation over Yunnan was dominated by vertical descending airflow in the high-pressure ridge. Simultaneously, the India-Burma trough was weakened, which resulted in unfavorable conditions for the transport of water vapor from the BOB to Yunnan, causing the observed persistent deficient precipitation in winter and the subsequently intensified drought. Therefore, the persistent anomalies in MJO activity in the tropical atmosphere played an important role in the occurrence of the extreme drought event in Yunnan in 2009-2010. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","23","Climatology","Barium compounds - Drought - Rain - Tropical engineering - Tropics - Water vapor - Wind effects","Atmospheric circulation - Intraseasonal oscillations - Madden-Julian oscillation - persistent anomalies - Persistent positive anomalies - Tropical atmospheres - Tropical Indian ocean - Yunnan","443 Meteorology",,"Number: U0833602, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2010Z001, Acronym: CAMS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences; Number: 2009CA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 40905043, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40805036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40705026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: GYHY200906017, Acronym: CMA, Sponsor: China Meteorological Administration; ","We are grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

It already rivals the world's largest hydro-producing nations. However, five of Yunnan's six basins are international and therefore its hydropower development is of great academic and geopolitical interest. While the implementation of large projects on Yunnan's three large rivers (Jinsha, Mekong and Nu) is relatively well studied, hydropower development outside these three main streams is hardly known. Here, we identified 128 large hydropower projects (≥50 MW) having a capacity of 16.5 GW, along with another 16.4 GW of other types of power generation, neither of which has been discussed in the academic literature yet. The paper utilizes a powershed approach to study the rapid hydropower development underway in Yunnan, both in its implication and challenges (at basin and administrative level) as well as in its trade-offs within the broader electricity context. Yunnan's power generation and consumption patterns are characterized by diverging interests of local/provincial usage and export utilization. Within the province, the largest (hydro-) power users are energy/electricity intensive industries, which themselves have strong impacts on land use changes. Yunnan is also evolving as a major power exporter, already in 2013 exporting about one-third of its generated electricity mainly to Guangdong's Pearl River Delta. We see a need for a critical revision of those existing generation and consumption paradigms, which includes a rethinking of major development modes, both in terms of future hydropower generation and utilization projects as well as export obligations. © 2016 by the authors.","79","Hydroelectric power","Economic and social effects - Environmental impact - Land use - Rivers - Transmissions","China - Hydropower - Large dams - Powershed approach - River basins - Social and environmental impact - Yunnan","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 602.2 Mechanical Transmissions - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Known as the 'kingdom of nonferrous metals' and located in Southwest China, Yunnan Province developed mining-induced geo-hazards well with characteristics of multiple types, widespread distribution and serious damage. Landslides and debris flows are two common sub-types of geohazards causing most serious damage in Yunnan, and some of them were very representative in the world. Two landslides and two debris flows were chosen to analyze deeply. Both Laojinshan Landslide and Sunjiaqing Landslide possess the characteristic of rock avalanches. The high sliding speed and long distance made the landslides translate into clastic flows with impact force and caused enormous destruction. Rainstorm and mining waste rock were two main factors to induce debris flows in Yunnan mines. Heishan valley debris flow of Dongchuan copper mine was a super large rainstorm type viscose debris flow with very low frequency, which brought a good caution to utilize valleys which looked an unlikely debris flow. Nandagou Valley of Jinding lead-zinc mine in Lanping County was a rainstorm stimulating, gully-type, high frequency and large scale debris flow, which was induced by mining activities. Many countermeasures have been used for Yunnan mines, including engineering treatment technology and ecological remediation, monitoring and forecasting, relocation and public administration.","19","Structural geology","Copper mines - Debris - Hazards - Landforms - Landslides - Public administration - Storms - Tectonics - Zinc mines","Ecological remediation - Engineering treatment - High frequency HF - High sliding speed - Mining activities - Southwest China - Very low frequency - Yunnan province","443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Yunnan Power Grid is taken as a study example, where ultra-low frequency oscillations occurred after asynchronously connected to China Southern Power Grid. Firstly, Yunnan Grid is represented with a uniform-frequency model to catch dynamics of ultra-low frequency oscillations. Value set of the system characteristic polynomial within frequency range is then calculated so that the system robust stability is analyzed by observing distances between the value sets and origin. Effects of uncertain parameters on system stability are analyzed and improvement measures are suggested. Results show that excessive large proportion of hydropower during asynchronous interconnection is a culprit contributing to the ultra-low frequency oscillations in Yunnan Grid. Moreover, turbine parameter coefficients are proved to play an important part in system stability, and should not be overlooked in system modelling. By optimizing parameters of hydropower governors, the stability is improved. © 2017, Power System Technology Press.

In this paper, the impacts of urbanization on the spatial patterns of alien plants in Yunnan were investigated. The results indicated that urban population, transportation mileage and their density all significantly correlated with spatial pattern of species diversity of alien plants. There were significant correlations between proportions of alien plants among all plant species and transportation density, urban population density. Step-wised regression analysis showed that transportation density played stronger roles in the spreading of alien species. Urbanization may not only shape the spatial patterns of alien plant diversity but also that of local plant composition. With the explosive development of urbanization in the study area, we should premeditate the potential of spreading or invasion of alien plants. © 2011 IEEE.","57","Urban transportation","Population statistics - Regression analysis - Transportation","Alien plants - Alien species - Impacts of urbanization - Plant composition - Plant species - Spatial patterns - Urban population - Yunnan","432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Rainfall erosivity (R) is an important parameter for forecasting soil erosion by using the USLE/RUSLE. However, there were few studies focusing on the suitability of simple R calculation models for Yunnan Province. Using the daily rainfall data from 1951 to 2010 in Kunming, a suitable calculation model of R for Yunnan Province were selected according to suitability analysis on five models which were commonly used in the southern parts of China, and the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of rainfall and rainfall erosivity were also analyzed according to rainfall data collected by 36 meteorological stations distributed evenly in Yunnan Province. Through the suitability analysis, in the five kinds of rainfall erosivity calculation models, model B was the most suitable ones for Yunnan Province because of its better stability, the largest effective coefficient (Ef) and the smallest relative deviation (Er). Yunnan Province recorded an average annual rainfall of 1 106.84 mm, and the average annual rainfall of seven regions changed between 745.8 mm and 1 533.3 mm. The distribution of rainfall in different seasons was not uniform, and the rainfall was mainly concentrated in summer which accounted for 53.97% of annual rainfall. Rainfall was unevenly distributed in different regions, which showed a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast in Yunnan Province. The average annual rainfall erosivity of Yunnan Province was 2 719.31 MJ·mm/(hm2·h), and the average annual rainfall erosivity of seven regions ranged between 1 837.23 MJ·mm/(hm2·h) and 3 949.12 MJ·mm/(hm2·h). The seasonal distribution of rainfall erosivity was uneven. Rainfall erosivity was concentrated in summer which accounted for 67.06% of annual rainfall erosivity. There was also a significant difference in the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity, and it also showed a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast. The trend index of rainfall erosivity varied from-0.34 to-0.02, which showed a decreasing tendency in nearly 60 years in different regions.

The components of bio-oil obtained were analyzed by GC-MS, while the functional group, crystal structure and micro morphology of bio-char by FTIR, XRD, and SEM respectively. The ultimate analysis and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-char and bio-oil were also determined. The results indicated that low pyrolysis temperatures resulted in more char, while high pyrolysis temperatures inclined to yield more gaseous products. The higher pyrolysis temperature made the contents of the esters and alcohols higher but ketones and acids lower in the bio-oil. The increase of temperature led to significant decrease of carbon and hydrogen as well as prominent increase of oxygen. Moreover, higher temperature led to the reduction of HHV of bio-oil simultaneously. High pyrolysis temperature contributed to the decline and disappearance of -OH, -C = C-, and -C-O- in bio-char. When the pyrolysis temperature exceeded 400°C, a structure resembling graphite crystallite developed. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the contents of oxygen and hydrogen dramatically decreased in bio-char.

The deposit, one of several in the province, exhibits field and petrographic features suggestive of post-magmatic modification. The mafic-ultramafic intrusions that host the Baimazhai sulphide ores show near-pervasive to pervasive hydrothermal alteration, with the sulphides being spatially associated with hydrothermal minerals such as biotite, amphibole and chlorite. This intimate association suggests that the sulphide ores were subjected to deformational and hydrothermal redistribution and textural changes resulting in disseminated and brecciated ores. Geochemically the Baimazhai sulphide ores are enriched in Cu, Pd and Au which, according to published studies, reflects the action of hydrothermal fluids. Interestingly, Ar-Ar age data yielded plateau ages of about 160-170 Ma, which also supports the modification features of the sulfide ores.","28","Geochronology","Analysis - Argon - Copper deposits - Nickel deposits - Ore deposits - Sulfide minerals","Ar Ar dating - Baimazhai Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulphide deposit - Hydrothermal minerals - Hydrothermal redistribution - Mafic ultramafic intrusions - Pervasive hydrothermal alteration - Platinum group elements (PGE) - Post magmatic modification - Southeast Yunnan Province - Sulphide ores - Textural changes","804 Chemical Products Generally - 548.1 Nickel - 544.1 Copper - 504 Mines and Mining, Metal - 482.2 Minerals - 481.3 Geophysics - 481.1 Geology","Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Base on the analysis of iron and steel industry of Yunnan, we choose two steel plants (marked plant A and plant B) as the typical factories to confirm the emission factor of SO2. The emission factor of SO2 was achieved by mass balance method. In steel plant A, the emission factor is 9.684 (kg-SO2/t-steel), after flue gas desulfurization, the factor dropped to 1.476 (kg-SO2/t-steel). It indicates that desulfuration of sinter flue gas is important to reduce SO2 emission. In steel plant B, the emission factor is 5.4(kg-SO2/t-steel) without desulfurization. However, according to Discharge Coefficients of Industrial Pollutants in the First National General Survey of Pollution Sources(Survey Handbook), the SO2 emission factor of plant B is 4.15(kg-SO 2/t-steel). We can see the differences exist between Yunnan's discharges of pollutants with national Survey Handbook. Because the national Survey Handbook represents the national average level and manufacturing technique and raw materials of various factories vary greatly within the country. So it's necessary to confirm the emission factor for Yunnan province.","12","Iron and steel industry","Desulfurization - Flue gases - Handbooks - Iron - Iron analysis - Iron and steel plants - Materials - Pollution - Sintering - Steelmaking - Surveys","Desulfuration - Discharge coefficients - Emission factors - Flue gas desulfurization - Industrial pollutants - Iron and steel - Manufacturing techniques - Mass-balance method - Material balance - Pollution sources - Present status - Steel plant - Yunnan province","901.2 Education - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 545 Iron and Steel - 951 Materials Science - 536.1 Powder Metallurgy Operations - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 405.3 Surveying - 521 Fuel Combustion and Flame Research",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
