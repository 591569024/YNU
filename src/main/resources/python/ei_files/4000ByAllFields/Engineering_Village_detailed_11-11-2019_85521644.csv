This paper proposes a novel reversible watermarking scheme based on the difference expansion and difference shifting. Since the 'path data' in SVG files includes a sequence of line segments and Be´zier segments, we embed the watermark into the vertex coordinates of 'path data' by modifying the differences between the adjacent vertex coordinates. The scheme can keep the Be´zier segments C° continuous by unchanging their start points and end points, and need record neither the location map nor the original least significant bit (LSB) of difference.

A mathematical model of tumor-immune interaction, subject to a periodic immunotherapy treatment (imitated by a periodic signal), correlative and bounded stochastic fluctuations and time delays, is investigated by numerical simulations for its signal power amplification (SPA). Within the tailored parameter regime, the synchronous response of tumor growth to the immunotherapy, stochastic resonance (SR), versus both the noises and delays is obtained. The details are as follows (i) the peak values of SPA versus the noise intensity (A) in the proliferation term of tumor cells decrease as the frequency of periodic signal increases, i.e. an increase of the frequency restrains the SR; (ii) an increase of the amplitude of periodic signal restrains the SR versus A, but boosts up the SR versus the noise intensity B in the immune term; (iii) there is an optimum cross-correlated degree between the two bounded noises, at which the system exhibits the strongest SR versus the delay timeτα(the reaction time of tumor cell population to their surrounding environment constraints); (iv) upon increasing the delay timeτα, double SR versus the delay timeτβ(the time taken by both the tumor antigen identification and tumor-stimulated proliferation of effectors) emerges.

The results show that zinc oxide dust dielectric constant and dielectric loss are proportional to the apparent density. Meanwhile, apparent density of zinc oxide dust exhibits a linear function relationship with dielectric parameters and the microwave penetration depth. Zinc oxide dust has a strong microwave absorbing ability, and can reach 800 in 6 min under microwave heating.

First of all, we introduce a fast multithreaded processor simulator. The simulator is applied to emulate the basic IP forwarding using Intel IXP1200 with the addition of caching. Our simulation results indicate that overall, caching can be an effective means to improve packet processing performance. However, we also note that, for large cache miss rates (e.g., 27.2%), caching can be ineffective, especially under stringent delay/loss constraints, and/or high time locality for cache misses. Our simulation results also indicate that the effectiveness of caching is sensitive to the actual delay/loss constraint. We also analyzed the reasons for these results in details. These observations provide significant insight as to how many threads should be configured in a processor where caching is employed to hide the memory access latency. © 2009 IEEE.","","14","Buffer storage","Mobile computing","Caching technique - Large caches - Memory access latency - Multithreaded processors - Packet processing - Performance analysis - Real-time packets - Simulation studies","722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We also consider the stability of error bounds for infinite constraint systems determined by infinitely many uniformly quasi-subsmooth functions. In particular, we extend the main results of Ngai, Kruger, and Th´era to the infinite dimensional and nonconvex setting. © 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","","44","Error analysis","Banach spaces - Functions - Site selection","Error bound - Error bounds for inequalities - Infinite constraint systems - Infinite dimensional - Lower semicontinuous - Perturbation Analysis - Subdifferentials - Subsmoothness","921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Shallow parts of the Curie surface are located in uplifted zones of the basin and correspond well to high values of heat flow. In contrast, deep parts of the Curie surface, having low values of heat flow, are distributed along the depression zones of the basin.

A transparent capillary filled with liquid is used as a cylindrical positive lens; subsequently, the focal length of the lens is derived through the base of paraxial approximation, which is recorded as a function of the RIs of the liquid and capillary wall. With the RI of a capillary wall known, the RI of the liquid can be obtained by measuring the focal length of the lens, which is characterized by a microquantity liquid, spatial resolution, and easy operation. The RI of the capillary wall can be calculated without ruining the capillary if the capillary is filled with a standard liquid (RI is known), the deviation of which is less than 0.003 RIU. The factors affecting accuracy of the measurement, for instance, the depth of a field (DOF) in a reading microscope system and the outer and inner diameters of a capillary are analyzed, while illustrating that the effective DOF plays an essential role in accurate measurement. © 2013 Optical Society of America.","","29","Refractive index","Liquids","Accurate measurement - Capillary wall - Inner diameters - Micro-quantity liquid - Paraxial approximations - Reading microscope - Spatial resolution - Standard liquids","741.1 Light/Optics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The solution is then employed to estimate the thickness of the boundary layer inside the media. The results reveal that when conduit radius is large, the Beavers-Joseph condition has only a minor effect on the velocity of conduit flow (such that the nonslip condition on the conduit wall still works pretty well), and the boundary layer is so thin that the wall can still be treated as the interface between fast water in the conduit and slow water in the media. The solution indicates that the velocity of conduit flow is the superposition of the velocity profile in the nonslip situation onto the slip velocity on the wall. Our study theoretically shows that the coupled continuum pipe flow model in MODFLOW-2005 constructed by the U.S. Geological Survey is reasonable in that there is no need to consider the Beavers-Joseph condition when simulating flow in karst conduits.

Based on this, a quick method to measure the liquid diffusion coefficient is proposed, i.e. using a specially designed asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens as both diffusive pool and imaging element. By means of this system with the liquid-core cylindrical lens to measure the diffusion coefficient, we can eliminate the spherical aberration and improve the accuracy in refractive index measurement. Based on the spatially resolving ability of the cylindrical lens in measuring the refractive index, only one instantaneous diffusive picture is required. Depending on the correspondence between the image width and the refractive index, we thus can quickly calculate the diffusion coefficient D by the Fick's second law. Then the diffusive process of ethylene glycol in water at 25 is investigated by this method. We calculate the diffusion coefficient between 660-3000 s with the method to analyse an instantaneous diffusion picture. At the beginning, injection will cause the liquid turbulent, and thus create a larger diffusion coefficient. In the course of diffusion, the influence of turbulence on the diffusion coefficient gradually decreases, but the image narrowing can make inaccurate results. Therefore, this method is required to be used at an appropriate time and an appropriate position to reduce experimental errors. After repeated experiments we can conclude that, between 1500-2700 s we may select the appropriate measurement of location for measuring liquid diffusion coefficient by the method to analyze an instantaneous diffusive picture. This not only can avoid the effect of turbulence but also avoid the effect of fewer sampling points. Compared with other methods reported in the literature, the results show that this method is characterized by short time (~20 ms) in data acquisition, faster measurement ( ©, 2015, Chinese Physical Society.

And, finally the sensor with the higher energy (has more suitable position as compared with the neighbouring nodes ) for chosen as the leader.

A common assumption for joint models is that random effects are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as multivariate normal distribution. The fully parametric distribution assumption of random effects is relaxed by specifying a centered Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (CDPMM) for a general distribution of random effects because of some good properties of CDPMM such as inducing zero mean and continuous probability distribution of random effects. A computationally feasible Bayesian case-deletion diagnostic based on the divergence is proposed to identify the potential influential cases in the joint models.

Aiming at the existing problems that the selection of neighborhood radius parameter Eps depends on manual experiment, judgment intervention or calculation estimation, the accuracy of clustering results is sensitive to Eps value, using uniform global parameters in non-uniform density data sets makes the clustering effect unsatisfactory. An adaptive Eps parameter estimation method based on Gauss kernel density is proposed. The kernel probability density of the point is calculated by the Gauss kernel density estimation, and then the positive correlation between the estimated kernel probability density and Eps value is found. It adaptively matches the appropriate Eps value for the current point, rather than setting a globally unified Eps parameter. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the method has good clustering effect on non-uniform data sets, and the algorithm is also effective for uniform data sets. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","","21","Clustering algorithms","Artificial intelligence - Cluster analysis - Gaussian distribution - Parameter estimation - Statistics","DBSCAN - Density-based clustering algorithms - Gauss kernels - Non-uniform Density - Parameter - Parameter estimation method - Positive correlations - Probability densities","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"","The authors thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Comparing different periods of K curves, we can explore the characteristics of different types of vegetations distributing along the road network. The results of the Kernel and network K-function analyses showed that populations of three types of vegetations were tending to cluster by road networks. The broad-leaved forests were not randomly distributed within road networks in three periods at all distance. In contrast, the coniferous forests is peculiar, with significant small-scale clustering of at distances up to 120 km and significant large-scale repulsion of clusters of populations >120 km.

Saponins are believed to be the major bioactive ingredients in P. notoginseng. Two different processes, steaming and biotransformation, were used to study the transformations of saponins in P. notoginseng. During an 8-h steaming process, the ginsenosides Rb1, Rd, Rg1, Re and notoginsenoside R1, decreased to 1.07 mg/g dry weight (DW), 0.91, 0.64, 0 and 0 mg/g DW, respectively. Meanwhile, ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3, 20(S)-Rh1, F2 and compound K significantly increased to 5.85, 6.10, 0.81 and 6.62 mg/g DW, respectively. On the other hand, one fungus was isolated from the root of P. notoginseng, which could transform ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside Rd specifically. The fungus was identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum species based on sequence analysis of the rRNA internal transcribed spacers region. The results implied a prospective feasibility for setting up different processing techniques to improve the quality of P. notoginseng and add its value. © 2015 The Author(s).

The method is based on the rapid reaction of silver(I) with QADMAP and the solid phase extraction of the colored chelate using a C18 cartridge. The QADMAP reacts with Ag(I) in the presence of a citric acid-sodium hydroxide buffer solution (pH 5.0) and a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) medium to form a violet chelate of molar ratio 1:2 (silver to QADMAP). This chelate was enriched by solid phase extraction with C18 cartridge, and the retained chelate was eluted from the cartridge using ethanol (with 1% acetic acid). In the ethanol medium (with 1% acetic acid), the molar absorptivity of the chelate was 1.25 × 105 L mol-1 cm-1 at 584 nm. Beer's law was obeyed in the range 0.01-0.6 μg/mL. The relative standard deviation for eleven replicate samples of 0.01 μg/mL was 1.86%. The detection limit is 0.02 μg/L in the original samples.

The inhibition efficiency increases with increasing tween 60 concentration at the same temperature, but decreases with increasing temperature studied. A synergistic effect exists when tween 60 and chloride ions are used together to prevent cold rolled steel corrosion in 0.5 M sulfuric acid at every experimental temperature. The polarization curves show that tween 60 is a cathodic inhibitor, while the complex of tween 60 and NaCl is a mixed-type inhibitor. The experimental results suggest that the presence of chloride ions in the solution stabilizes the adsorption of tween 60 molecules on the metal surface and improves the inhibition efficiency of tween 60. The adsorption of single tween 60 follows the Temkin adsorption isotherm, but the complex accords with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Some thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption heat, adsorption entropy and adsorption free energy has been calculated by employing thermodynamic equations. Kinetic parameters such as apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor have been calculated and discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Hassin, A. Levin, An efficient polynomial time approximation scheme for the constrained minimum spanning tree problem using matroid intersection, SIAM Journal on Computing 33 (2) (2004) 261-268], we study a new combinatorial optimization problem in this paper, called the general subdivision-constrained spanning tree problem (GSCST): given a graph G = (V, E ; w, c) with two nonnegative integers w (e) and c (e) for each edge e ∈ E, two positive integers B and d, the GSCST problem is to first find a spanning tree T = (V, ET) of G with weight ∑e ∈ ETw (e) ≤ B and then to insert some new vertices on some suitable edges in T such that each edge in the subdivision tree T′of T has its weight not beyond d. The objective is to minimize the cost ∑e ∈ ETi n s e r t (e) c (e) of such new vertices inserted on the suitable edges among all spanning trees of G subject to the two preceding constraints, where a subdivision tree T′of T is constructed by inserting some new vertices on the suitable edges in T, the value i n s e r t (e) = ⌈ frac(w (e), d) ⌉ - 1 is the least number of vertices inserted and c (e) is the cost of each vertex inserted on the edge e. We obtain the following main results: (1) the GSCST problem and its variant are still NP-hard, by a reduction from the 0-1 knapsack problem, respectively; (2) the GSCST problem as well as its variant is polynomially equivalent to the CST problem, which implies the existence of a polynomial time approximation scheme to solve the GSCST problem and its variant; (3) we finally design three strongly polynomial time algorithms to solve the special versions of the GSCST problem and its variant, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ISA has become the main urban landscape. Although ISA rate just occupy no-iced surface about 0.2%-2.7%, the impacts on human and nature are extremely significant. Intensive research demonstrated that the relationship between urbanization and water quality was nonlinear. The foreigner researchers revealed that the deterioration of water environment could not be reversed when the ISA rate exceeded 25%. But the threshold influenced by natural and human conditions of research area, different areas have different threshold. To date analyzing the changing characteristic and correlation between water quality parameters and ISA are lees carried out. In this paper, the Dianchi lake watershed of Kunming, Yunnan province was studied, and improved normalized difference build-up index (INDBI) and linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) algorithm were used to analyze the characteristics of Dianchi Lake watershed impervious surface expansion in the context of rapid urbanization in the past 30 years. Secondly, the distance decay function and gravity model was used to quantitatively analyze the impervious surface area impact on water quality. Thirdly, Morlet wavelet analysis method was used to reveal water parameters periodicity. Results showed that the impervious surface area of Dianchi Lake Watershed expanded fast around Dianchi Lake (α = 0.001), nearly half of the land use/land cover has been changed. The natural surface area in 2017 was approximately 59%, the percent of high-intensity urban area was increased from 0.06% to 12.05%. Under the national strategy background of 'One Road, One Belt', 'One lake, four core urban area' and 'Build the Urban Area on the hill', the number of main district (high-intensity urban areas) changes from 1 in 2001 to 4 in 2017 (Kunming main district, Airport main district, Chenggong main district and Jinning main district), cities are surrounding the Dianchi Lake. 35% of natural surface area was transferred into impervious surface. In the last 30 years, the growth rate of impervious surface area in the Dianchi watershed has been exceeded 21 km2per year, and the growth rate reached 38 km2per year from 2004 to 2017. There is a significant correlation between the spatial influence of impervious surfaces and water quality of lakes. The correlation coefficients between water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chla), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (PI), potential of hydrogen (pH) and transparency (Trans)) and the spatial influence of impervious surfaces were all passed the significance test, which shows that the high speed urbanization is the main cause of frequent eutrophication and blue-green algae bloom in Dianchi Lake Watershed. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.
