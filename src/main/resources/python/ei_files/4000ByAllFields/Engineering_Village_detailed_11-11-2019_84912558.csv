This paper adopts the spatial autocorrelation research methods such as global spatial autocorrelation, local indicator of spatial association, taking the land use as the research object. In particular, this research takes the provincial region (Yunnan Province) as the scope scale and the county level as the analytical scale. Moreover, based on the land use survey data of Yunnan Province in 2015, this paper analyzes the spatial autocorrelation pattern of land use, and explores the human impact on the pattern formation. The results show that: (1) The spatial correlation of land use types in Yunnan Province showed positive spatial correlation. (2) There are obvious regional differences in the spatial aggregation of various land use types in Yunnan Province. (3) There are two trends of spatial pattern and spatial overlap in the high value aggregation pattern of land use types in Yunnan Province. (4) Human impact factors have different effects on the specific distribution of land use types in Yunnan Province, and there are significant spatial positive correlation for urban industrial and mining land, transportation land and cultivated land, and the distribution of forest land has significant negative correlation. This study shows that Yunnan Province, as an underdeveloped Frontier Province in China, shows significant accumulation of construction land in land use and great influence on ecological land. © 2018 IEEE.","27","Land use","Autocorrelation - Surveys - Urban transportation","Human impact - Negative correlation - Positive correlations - Regional differences - Spatial associations - Spatial autocorrelations - Specific distribution - Yunnan province","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2018T111003ˈNo, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 71764036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is partial funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71764036, No.41671148), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (No. 2018T111003ˈNo. 2017M623080).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The high incidence factors of lung cancer in Xuanwei area were studied in epidemiology, atmospheric science and molecular biology. We believed that the high incidence of lung cancer was not a single factor but the result of the interaction of many high risk factors, such as the use of coal and indoor air pollution may be a cause of high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei. However, the risk factors of stove type, life habits and so on need to be further studied. This paper mainly analyzed the causes of high incidence of lung cancer from two aspects: fine particles produced by coal combustion and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Xuanwei area. We concluded that the form of Fe+ in the bituminous coal was helpful for the emission of PAHs, and the PAHs on the surface of fine particles bring lung health risks. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","35","Coal combustion","Biological organs - Bituminous coal - Bridge decks - Composite materials - Diseases - Health risks - Hydrocarbons - Indoor air pollution - Manufacture - Mineral oils - Molecular biology - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Atmospheric science - Fine particles - High incidence - Lung Cancer - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) - Risk factors - Yunnan province","401.1 Bridges - 451 Air Pollution - 461 Bioengineering and Biology - 513.3 Petroleum Products - 524 Solid Fuels - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 41663013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (41663013) fund.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Inspired from image spectrums of creatures' gene, this paper discussed the digitization, visualization and quantitative analysis of ore deposits information through coding technique based on GIS. In fact, the geological dictionary and rules are key circles of mineralization coding. The first, a complete geological dictionary, as one of bases, must be set up before coding. The second, coding of ore deposit must stand all through to the rules as follows: (a) unique of code, (b) structure of code, (c) class of code, (d) enlargement of code, (e) model recognition of code, and (f) the standards of nation and industry. One of the features of mineralization coding is able to turn the important information of each ore deposit into a piece of special numbers, so that translate the qualitative description to digital codes and image spectrums. In this way, take it easy to comparing, statistical analyzing, and visual showing of the main characteristics of ore deposits, as well as digitization of geological and mineral basal information.

It not only considers the error of observation (displacement or velocity field), but also the error effects from the coefficient matrix, generally composed of monitoring points coordinates. When taking the special structure of the coefficient matrix in the geodetic inversion model into account, we insure that the repeated coordinates have the same residual and that the constants are not allocated any correction. The method usedin this paper can meet these requirements as it separates the random elements from the constant elements taking advantage of the partial errors-in-variables model. All calculation formulae for crust strain (rate) parameters inversion based on partial errors-in-variables using monitoring point displacement or velocity fields are deduced. In addition, the derivate correction of weighted least squares (WLS) is used to analyze the effect of the random coefficient. The discrepancy between the weighted least squares solution and WTLS solution was also investigated. Because of the complexity of the WTLS solution, we propose a formulation to relate the WLS\and WTLS solutions based on Xu (J Geod 86:661-675, 2012). A simulation using data from the Sichuan-Yunnan region permits a comparison and analysis of the effect of the random design matrix. The experimental results reveal that the effect of the random coefficient matrix on adjustment of the inversion of crustal strain (rate) parameters model is mainly depend on the order of value of the GPS coordinates and the crustal strain parameters themselves. © 2017, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

The intrinsic dipole moments of polyhedra and the total intrinsic dipole moment of the unit cell were calculated. By comparing the intrinsic electric dipole moments of the X, Y, Z, T, and B site polyhedra, it is found that the T site polyhedron makes the greatest contribution to the total intrinsic dipole moment. The pyroelectric coefficients of four Fe-Mg tourmalines were experimentally determined, and the influence of intrinsic dipole moments on their pyroelectric properties was investigated. The experimental results show that, compared with the case at room temperature, the intrinsic dipole moments change with the total Fe content at -100°C in a completely different way. With the decrease of temperature, the total intrinsic dipole moments of tourmaline decrease. Over the same temperature interval, the pyroelectric coefficients increase with the increase in intrinsic dipole moment. © University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","21","Dipole moment","Binary alloys - Crystallography - Electric dipole moments - Geometry - Iron - Magnesium alloys - Pyroelectricity - Silicate minerals - Single crystals - X ray diffraction","Intrinsic dipole moment - Polyhedra - Pyroelectric coefficients - Pyroelectric properties - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Temperature intervals - Tourmaline - Yunnan province","482.2 Minerals - 542.2 Magnesium and Alloys - 545.1 Iron - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids",,"Number: 40672031, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40672031), and the authors would like to thank Mr. Guo-wu Li and Mrs. Ming Xiong for their contribution to crystal structure analysis.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For this purpose, the Yunnan heavy color painting is chosen as the target style to carry out the research of the style transfer of paintings with fine texture and figure paintings. Aimed at the aesthetic feeling of slender body of heavy color painting, the human body image restoring is put forward to reshaping the character in the image. To keep body structure and fine texture of the heavy color paintings, the technique of combining style transfer based on semantics and image analogy is proposed, and the regularization term of structure maintaining is added into loss function. For the distinct line in the heavy color painting, the image smoothing method via L0 gradient minimization, the anisotropic DoG (difference of Gaussians) filter and the gap detection are combined to extract the smooth and coherent line drawing from content images to enhance the line sense. This paper uses this algorithm to transfer the style of heavy color painting, the result shows the aesthetic of character body slender and the fine texture features and the sharp lines of heavy color painting. © 2019, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

In order to evaluate the damage of the earthquake, we investigated on lots of seismo-geological hazards induced by the earthquakes and conducted the field investigation of geological structural section about the fractures near the epicenter. Those two earthquakes successively occurring at the adjacent position led to the intensity of this earthquake higher than that of the same magnitude. The maximum intensity of the 5.9 earthquake is VIII degree and the perceptible area is relatively large. The macroseismic epicenter is about 5.1 km from the 5.1 microseismic epicenter is roughly located at the middle of the two microseismic epicenter (28.20°N, 99.36°E). The isoseismic line is shaped as an anomalous ellipse and the orientation of its long axis is NW-SE orientation along the Deqin-Zhongdian fault. According to the field investigation of geological structural section about the fractures near the epicenter, the focal mechanism solution data and the special distribution characteristics of the aftershocks, we preliminary infer that the seismogenic structure is Deqin-Zhongdian fault and the Deqing-Derong 5.9 earthquake is a normal fault type earthquake characterized by strike-slip. ©, 2015, China University of Geosciences.

The technology is capable of extracting modal characteristics, especially the least damping mode from a large-scale power system. Regarding the inter-area model damp ratio as an objective of optimization, the PSS controller can be designed in a limited parameter space. In order to find optimal settings of PSS parameters, the simplex method is employed to complete the optimization procedure. Identified PSS parameters are designated as the initial center of simplex, which can effectively improve the convergence of the computation. In contrast to traditional eigenvalue methods, it is not necessary for the Prony method to compute the eigenvalue but it is suitable for a large-scale interconnected power system and complex models. To illustrate the parameter optimizing technology proposed, a practical case study of Yunnan Power Grid under multiple operating conditions is presented. The simulation results show that the method proposed has proved valid and robust in damping inter-area oscillations.","14","Electric power system interconnection","Calculations - Circuit oscillations - Damping - Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Identification (control systems) - Large scale systems - Mathematical models - Optimization - Robustness (control systems)","Low frequency oscillation - Parameter identification - Power system stabilizer (PSS) - Prony analysis - Yunnan Power Grid","703.1.2 Electric Network Synthesis - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 731.1 Control Systems - 921.5 Optimization Techniques","Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In disaggregated form assessment, work area is firstly divided into same shape grid units and then the mineralization favorableness unit and the mineral resources of unknown units are predicted analogically with known ore bearing units data, but potential resources number of known ore bearing units can not be obtained.

The biomass and low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) secreted by the roots of these plants, Cd and lead (Pb) contents and their accumulation in a S. asper monoculture, V. faba monoculture and S. asper/V. faba intercrop were investigated in a field experiment at 35, 80 and 180 d after planting. The results showed that (1) intercropping had no notable influences on plant biomass and grain yields of V. faba but led to a significant increase in the amount of stem and leaf biomass of S. asper at 180 d after planting. (2) The major LMWOAs secreted by the roots of both V. faba and S. asper were oxalic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid. Intercropping resulted in an increase and decrease in the LMWOA contents secreted by V. faba and S. asper roots, respectively. (3) Along with plant growth, the available Cd content decreased and the available Pb contents did not exhibit obvious changes in the soil samples of a V. faba monoculture. The amount of available Cd and Pb both increased in the soil of the S. asper monoculture, but decreased in that of the S. asper/V. faba intercrop. (4) Intercropping resulted in a decrease in the contents and accumulation of Cd and Pb in V. faba plants, but an increase in both the contents and accumulation of Cd and Pb in S. asper plants. Moreover, intercropping enhanced the enrichment and translation coefficients of Cd for S. asper. The remediation efficiency was the highest at 180 d after planting. (5) There were significant negative correlations between the contents of citric acid, malic acid (secreted by V. faba roots), oxalic acid and tartaric acid (secreted by S. asper roots) and the available Cd content in the soil samples. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the available Cd content in the soil and the Cd contents in the roots and grains of V. faba. Intercropping reduced the Cd contents in the plants and grains of V. faba and was closely related to the decrease in the available Cd content in the soil samples, which was mediated by plant roots that secreted LMWOAs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.","50","Oxalic acid","Bioaccumulation - Biomass - Cadmium - Citric acid - Molecular weight - Soil surveys - Soils","Cadmium and leads - Field experiment - Lead-zinc mining - Low molecular weight organic acid - Negative correlation - Positive correlations - Remediation efficiency - Yunnan province","461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,"Number: 41261096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1202236, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31560163, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41461093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1202236, 41461093, 41261096 and 31560163).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A typical project case is discussed. The slope has been treated twice with many conventional methods, such as cutting slope, prestressed anchor rope, vertical anchor, combined bolting and shotcreting to the slope surface and slope surface drainage (for the first treatment), and grouting and anchoring (for the second treatment). However, due to the requirements of project schedule, a detailed investigation is not conducted, resulting in the failure of the slope in the following rainfall seasons, and the slope is found to crack in the top, slope surface, shoulder, and upheaval in discharge ditch and asphalt pavement. In order to find incipient fault and ensure safety of slope, the employer decided to give an overall investigation, design, and treatment for the slope. Based on a more detailed investigation, more thorough understanding of landslide, the causes for landslide, slope calculation for checking reliability, and effective schemes are proposed including cutting slope, anti-slide piles, drainage, and slope protection measures. The treatment has been verified to be satisfactory through three rainy seasons. Practice shows that the groundwater is the main factor. So the treatments to the crack at the back of landslide mass and installation of drainage system are very important. Landslide treatment is a comprehensive process, and a satisfactory result could not be expected with single technical measure, and the prerequisite of treatment is a general and accurate understanding of landslide. The failure of treatment in the first and second time, and success in the third time could function as a valuable reference to other similar landslide treatment projects.","11","Slope protection","Accident prevention - Construction - Drainage - Failure (mechanical) - Groundwater - Highway engineering - Landslides - Rain","Failures treatment - Highway slope - Yunnan province","406 Highway Engineering - 443.3 Precipitation - 444.2 Groundwater - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics","Applications (APP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The T.A could grow at temperatures of 40°C to 80°C, with 65°C being the favorable, and at pH values of 1.5 to 4.0, with pH 2.0 the best. The bioleaching experiments of the chalcopyrite ore were conducted with both laboratory batch bioreactors and leaching columns. The results obtained in bioreactor experiments showed that the T.a bioleaching rate of copper reached 97% for a 12-day leaching time, while only 32.43% for a Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (T.f) leaching for the same leaching time. In the case of column leaching, tests of a two-phase leaching, i.e. a two-month (actually, 56 days) T.f leaching in the first phase, followed by a 140-day T.a leaching in the second phase were performed. An average leaching rate of copper for the 140-day T.A leaching achieved 195mg/l.d, while that was as low as 78mg /l.d for the T.f leaching only, indicating that the T.A possesses a more powerful oxidizing ability to the chalcopyrite than T.f. Therefore, the two-phase leaching process is suggested to apply for the heap leaching operations where the T.a can be used in the second phase when the temperature inside the heap has gotten higher, and the primary copper sulfide minerals have already been partially oxidized with T.f beforehand in the first phase.","5","Copper compounds","Bioleaching - Biological water treatment - Bioreactors - Minerals - Sulfur compounds","Batch bioreactors - Column leaching - High temperature - Leaching rates - Oxidizing ability - Thiobacillus ferrooxidans - Water samples - Yunnan province","445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 461.8 Biotechnology - 482.2 Minerals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Solid materials from a certain mine in Yunnan Province were used for verification test. The results show that, at constraint conditions, i.e. yield stress of 175-225 Pa and mass fraction of paste slurry with diameter of less than 20 μm, reasonable segregation rate of coarse aggregate filling slurry is from 11.65% to 14.53%.

The controller guarantees the boundedness of all variables in the close-loop systems and convergence of the plant output to a given reference signal. To design the controller, we show that the implicit function - the composite function of system nonlinearities and hysteresis, has a unique solution which yields the convergence of the tracking error to the zero. Therefore, instead of necessarily constructing or approximating a hysteresis inverse as done in the inverse compensation, the proposed controller is constructed to approximate the unique solution of the implicit function. Finally, simulation example is presented to demonstrate the electiveness of the proposed approach.","12","Controllers","Fuzzy control - Hysteresis - Navigation","Composite functions - Fuzzy controllers - Hysteresis non linearities - Inverse compensation - Novel control scheme - System nonlinearities - Tracking controls - Variable universe fuzzy controls","731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 732.1 Control Equipment - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The painted panel at the site of Mt. Huashan is probably the largest known rock art panel in the world, consisting of approximately 1900 identifiable figures and occupying an area of approximately 8000 m2. To determine a precise age on the rock art at Mt. Huashan, 56 secondary carbonate layers above and below the paintings were studied for their mineralogy, oxygen, and carbon isotopic compositions and dated by the230Th/U method. The230Th/U dating results demonstrate that ages of the rock paintings can be bracketed between 1856 ±16 and 1728±41 yrBP corresponding to the middle to the end of the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25 to 220). The results imply that the rock painting practices at Mt. Huashan probably lasted more than a century, and the Zuojiang rock art is younger than that at Baiyunwan and Cangyuan in Yunnan Province by 1 to 10 centuries. © Copyright University of Washington.

The task of seismic hazard analysis is to estimate the potential level of ground motion parameters that would be produced by future earthquakes. In this paper, a novel method for seismic hazard analysis is proposed based on the fuzzy probabilistic approach. The earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance are defined as fuzzy-random variables. Further, Cornell model is applied to evaluate the ground motion and the fuzzy-probability of exceedance of the peak ground acceleration level. The advantage of the fuzzy probabilistic seismic hazard analysis model over the traditional deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard models is that it considers two types of uncertainties, aleatory and epistemic.

Different feature subsets can provide sufficient diversity among base classifiers, which is known as a necessary condition for improvement in ensemble performance. Compared with those methods of Majority Voting ensemble and Support Vector Machine, our ensemble scheme can achieve the highest performance. On the other hand, we investigate the possible reasons why ensemble systems can provide potential performance, in terms of diversity analysis.

The algorithm takes the initial feasible solution from heuristics search as the basis, and the progressive optimality algorithm(POA) is adopted to improve it. At the same time, the strategies for system operating capacity equalization and single station operating peak combination are adopted to move the target solution from the boundary constraints along the target isopleths into the feasible solution's interior to provide search space for iterative loop and overcome the disadvantage of POA that is apt to fall into local optimum. In the process of algorithm implementation, the local verifying tactics are adopted to simply judge the constraints of peak and valley duration of unit commitment capacity to reduce the calculation cost.

To manage the genetic resources of this economically and ecologically important species efficiently, greater knowledge of the distribution of its genetic diversity is needed. In this study, the genetic diversity of 20 natural populations representing most of the P. yunnanensis range was examined using seven simple sequence repeats. No loci showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Most genetic diversity was found within populations, and overall genetic differentiation was low (FST=0.045). There was no sign of isolation by distance. Clustering of populations using both neighbor joining pair groups and principal coordinates analysis based on Nei’s genetic distance showed the presence of two major clusters. This result was reinforced using the Bayesian software STRUCTURE, which identified two southern populations as clearly separate from the others. There were no signs of genetic erosion, but some populations should be a focus of conservation efforts because of their higher level of genetic diversity and the presence of private alleles. These results will inform conservation and management of P. yunnanensis and will guide future studies of population genetics and breeding programs. © 2016 Society of American Foresters.","67","Biodiversity","DNA sequences - Reforestation","Genetic differentiation - Genetic diversity - Genetic structure - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium - Micro satellite - Principal coordinates analysis - Simple sequence-repeat markers - Yunnan pine","454 Environmental Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper proposes a new way for disaster insurance, which is the micro-insurance plan based on risk degree of debris flow. The micro-insurance plan, which can overcome some disadvantages such as adverse selection, moral hazard and high expenses for insurance management, is quite suitable for residents to participate in disaster insurance of debris flow in small cities or towns of China. Based on the risk assessment, this paper takes Dongchuan city in Shengou basin of Yunnan province as a case study to show the feasibility and risk countermeasures of the micro-insurance plan. When the property in different risk zones is insured, the micro-insurance plan based on risk degree of debris flow is made with some additional conditions, which can reflect the disaster features in specific regions and embody the principle of fairness. What's more, the micro-insurance plan will provide a new way for the development of disaster insurance in risk regions of debris flows. ©2009 IEEE.","12","Insurance","Debris - Disasters - Risk assessment - Risk management","Adverse selection - Debris flows - Disaster insurance - Dongchuan city - Insurance companies - Insurance plans - Moral hazard - Yunnan province","914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Source and optical composition of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in oligotrophic and deep lakes can display distinct properties, because of deep light penetration and long water residence time in these lakes. In this study, the optical properties and spatiotemporal distributions of CDOM were analyzed through monthly field investigation in 2017 in Lake Fuxian, an oligotrophic deep lake in Yunnan Province, China. The results showed that the average value of a(254) was 3.47±0.57 m-1, with the range of 1.82-5.22 m-1, indicating that CDOM abundance in the lake was relatively low compared with other mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Moreover, parallel factor analysis was performed to assess CDOM composition from excitation-emission matrix spectra and four components were identified: two tyrosine-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2) and one humic-like component (C4). The percentage of fluorescent intensity of C1+C3 was 65.81%±15.38%, and the proportion of C2+C4 was 34.19%±15.38%. The fluorescence index (FI), humification index (HIX) and biological/autochthonous index (BIX) was 1.73±0.14, 1.02±0.37 and 1.23±0.27, respectively. These results demonstrated that the CDOM was primarily originated from endogenous microbes in this lake. The average values of a(254) in spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November) and winter (January, February and December) were 3.20±0.47, 3.76±0.64, 3.67±0.50 and 3.23±0.38 m-1 respectively, with significantly higher values in summer and autumn than those in winter and spring. The abundance and spatial distributions of autochthonous and allochthonous CDOM exhibited seasonal heterogeneity, which might be correlated with land-use pattern, input of terrestrial materials, rainfall, water temperature and irradiance. © 2019 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","48","Lakes","Amino acids - Biogeochemistry - Dissolution - Factor analysis - Fluorescence - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Land use - Multivariant analysis - Optical properties - Organic compounds - Residence time distribution - Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy","Chromophoric dissolved organic matter - Lake Fuxian - Parallel factor analysis - UV visible spectroscopy - Yunnan Plateau","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 481.2 Geochemistry - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

According to the supervise data of the mining blasting, the dynamic response of the slope in blasting was studied by continuum large deformation Lagrange element method, and some suggestions were proposed for following mining blasting. The research results show that the slope was in the stable status before blasting vibration.

However, the derivations of the composing elements are not clear. In order to provide constraints on the tectonic evolutions of the area, Paleozoic paleomagnetic samples were collected from eastern and western Yunnan, southwest China, which represent the South China Block (SCB) and the Shan Thai-Malay Block (STM) respectively. Though a majority of the samples appear to have been strongly overprinted by the recent Earth's field and some yield aberrant results, characteristic remanent components have been obtained from well-behaved samples and these are interpreted as primary or near primary magnetizations. The paleopoles from eastern Yunnan fall at 9(Formula Presented)N, 10(Formula Presented)E (for the Devonian), 23(Formula Presented)N, 205(Formula Presented)E (for the Middle and Late Silurian), 35(Formula Presented)N, 227(Formula Presented)E (for the Early and Middle Ordovician), and 69(Formula Presented)N, 271(Formula Presented)E (for the Cambrian). The paleopoles from western Yunnan fall at 66(Formula Presented)N, 134(Formula Presented)E (for the Devonian), 7(Formula Presented)N, 194(Formula Presented)E (for the Middle and Late Silurian), and 21(Formula Presented)N, 191(Formula Presented)E (for the Middle Ordovician). The results of this study indicate that during the early Paleozoic the SCB and the STM were located in an equatorial area; possibly they were adjacent to each other and on the periphery of Gondwana. The SCB remained near the equator for the entire Paleozoic but may have left the STM and Gondwana in the Silurian. The STM moved together with Gondwana to a higher paleolatitude of 42(Formula Presented) in the Devonian.

The task of seismic hazard analysis is to estimate the potential level of ground motion parameters that would be produced by future earthquakes. In this paper, a novel method for seismic hazard analysis is proposed based on the fuzzy probabilistic approach. The earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance are defined as fuzzy-random variables. Further, Cornell model is applied to evaluate the ground motion and the fuzzy-probability of exceedance of the peak ground acceleration level. The advantage of the fuzzy probabilistic seismic hazard analysis model over the traditional deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard models is that it considers two types of uncertainties, aleatory and epistemic.

The verification experiment carried out in Yunnan Province, China, showed that the predicted result is in good agreement with observed data. The critical grain size is 5-6 mm.

We reconstruct the paleoelevation history for three Cenozoic sedimentary basins from SE Tibet and Yunnan, China, to provide more constraints on the tectonic processes for raising the SE margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The results presented here, together with those of previous studies, indicate that (1) the plateau margin of NW Yunnan was near its elevation (~2.6 km) by the latest middle Eocene (~40 Ma); (2) the plateau margin of SE Yunnan reached its current elevation (~1.6 km) by the middle Miocene (~13 Ma). Interpretations of the tectonic processes responsible for this inferred surface uplift of the region are made in the context of well-documented surface geology. We conclude that high landscape (~2.6 km elevation) in NW Yunnan may represent the remnants of the Eocene Tibetan plateau that originally formed in the northeastern Qiangtang Block by crustal thickening associated with the India-Asia continental collision. The near-modern elevation of SE Yunnan since ~13 Ma probably reflects the initiation of lower crustal flow in this area by at least that time. Collectively, our paleoaltimetric interpretations disagree with previously proposed models of middle Miocene to Pliocene crustal flow acting as a sole tectonic process for raising the SE margin of the plateau, but support a protracted history of surface uplift that most likely involved crustal thickening during the Eocene, southeastward extrusion of a portion of Eocene Tibetan plateau during the Oligocene to early Miocene, and lower crustal flow beneath this region since at least the early Miocene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","103","Tectonics","Geology - Mathematical models","Crustal flow - Oxygen isotopes - Paleoelevation - Tibetan Plateau - Yunnan","481.1 Geology",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Chicago; Number: EAR-1111274, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: EAR-0609756, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: EAR-0609782, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Harvard University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Miami; ","We are grateful to Gerry Olack and Albert Colman at the University of Chicago and Daniel Schrag at Harvard University for stable isotope analyses reported in this paper.

The rich organic shale formed in deep shelf sedimentary environment is taken of the main factor as the material basis. The time and style of tectonic uplift are the key factors of shale gas accumulation and preservation. Three types of shale gas tectonic styles are determined, including intact type, residual type and destructive type. Overpressure of formation is a necessary condition of high shale gas production.

Set in a parkland environment, it is a modern campus with a rich architectural style based on local Naxi houses with gray tiles and white painted walls. Because it is very large for a virtual campus, the scale and complexity of models have been simplified. They have also been reduced for ease of loading the computer program by three means: Object-Oriented Modeling (OOM), textures and portal-connectors, and many easy-to-use tools have been created which support different input hardware and avatars to help the user tour the campus from different perspectives.

The results show that among adults, F0, F1, and spectral tilt combine to create the tense/lax contrast in Bai. While these three cues tend to be correlated, individual speakers differ in their use, particularly spectral tilt. The patterns in this study suggest that as Bai infants acquire tones in the second and third years of life, their utterances are likely to become structured around these three acoustic cues in previously unattested ways that exemplify the complex interaction between universal physiological and developmental tendencies and the ambient phonological tone system of Bai.","33","Speech",,"Acoustic cues - Baseline data - Language acquisition - Laryngeal constriction - Spectral tilt - Tone - Tone languages - Yunnan , China","751.5 Speech",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, four Wolfiporia cocos samples (FC-DM, RC-DM, FC-YN and SC-YN) of three cultivation methods harvest from Dabie Mountain area and Yunnan province were discriminated and identified by a multi-step IR macro-fingerprinting technique. The correlation coefficient of the three cultivation methods of Wolfiporia cocos are higher than 0.98 in the range of 450–2600 cm−1. According to retrieving the spectrum in Sadtler database, the main compositions of Wolfiporia cocos are laminarin polysaccharide. While Correlation coefficients of synchronous 2D-IR spectra of FC-DM and other Wolfiporia cocos samples were furtherly calculated, acquiring a quantitative discrimination result. The thermal sensitivity of polysaccharides of SC-YN is different from other samples in the range of 850–1370 cm−1. The difference in thermal sensitivity of C–H (1402 and 1474 cm−1) and amino acid (1666 or 1651 cm−1) could also be considered as the key factors to discriminate them.

However, spatiotemporal filtering based on traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for regional GNSS position time series does not take these formal errors into account. This paper developed a PCA-based approach to extract Common Mode Error (CME) from the position time series of a regional GNSS station network, where formal errors were applied to construct a weight factor. Because coordinate components with larger errors have smaller weight factors in extracting CME, the performance of our proposed approach was anticipated to be better than the traditional PCA approach. The position time series of 25 stations in the Yunnan Province, China, were analyzed using our approach, as well as the traditional PCA approach. The average errors of the residual time series after removing the CMEs with our approach were 1.30 mm, 1.72 mm, and 4.62 mm for North, East and Up components, and the reductions with respect to those of the original time series were 18.23%, 15.42%, and 18.25%, respectively. If CMEs were removed from the traditional PCA approach, the corresponding average errors were 1.34 mm, 1.81 mm, and 4.84 mm, with reductions of 15.84%, 10.86%, and 14.32%, respectively. Compared to the traditional PCA approach, the average errors of our approach were reduced by about 2.39%, 4.56%, and 3.93% in the North, East and Up components, respectively. Analysis of CME indicated that it mainly contained white and flicker noise. In the synthetic position time series with 500 repeated simulations, the CME extracted by our approach was closer to the true simulated values than those extracted by the traditional PCA approach, regardless of whether local effects were considered or not. Specifically, the mean root mean square (RMS) reduction of our approach, relative to PCA, ranged from 1.35% to 3.93%. Our simulations illustrated that the RMS reductions depended not only on the magnitude, but also the variation of the formal error series, which further highlights the necessity of considering formal errors in spatiotemporal filtering. © 2018 by the authors.","34","Principal component analysis","Errors - Global positioning system - Time series - Time series analysis","Average errors - Common mode - Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Root Mean Square - Spatio temporal filtering - Station network - Weight factor - Yunnan province","922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 41474017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41731069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: ZR201702210134, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was predominantly sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of China (41731069 and 41474017).

The results showed that, except Cys, the amino acids contents were all different in the samples from different places. Especifically, all the amino acids contents besides Ala and Pro were the highest in the samples from Luoping area, while Ala and Met were the highest amino acid in those from Shilin area. And the content of Pro was the highest in those from Lijiang area and Kunming area. The Kunming and Longling samples had lower amino acids contents than the other samples, and these samples from the two sources showed significant differences (P<0.05) in Glu, Phe, Lys, Arg and Pro contents..

A weak damping oscillation mode exists in western Yunnan power grid, where large-scale small hydropower is delivered in concentration. And this is the major constraint limiting transmission capacity of this area. To avoid weak damping oscillations of whole gridtriggered bylarge-scale small hydropower, VSC-HVDC systemscan be used to connect smallhydropower concentrated grids to backbone grid asynchronously to electrically isolate machine groups with largest participation factor from machine groups in backbone grid. This paper designed a VSC-HVDC back-to-back asynchronous interconnection scheme forenhancing economy and reducing DC system faultprobability. Besides, from perspective of optimizing power flow distribution of smallhydropower concentrated grids, a VSC-MTDC asynchronous interconnection scheme was designed. Effects of the two schemes on system small-signal stability and transmission capacity of small-hydropower concentrated grids were compared.

However on the side of the sending-end, the loss of DC links causes high frequency, of which the frequency deviation peak is an important index in the study of the power grid frequency stability. In this study, the method to calculate the peak value of frequency deviation based on the change rate of the frequency deviation is obtained by analysing a single-machine system. Then, the application of method is extended to the actual power system to study HVDC additional control and generator tripping. Finally, the single-machine power grid and Yunnan Power Grid are simulated, respectively, to verify the accuracy and the feasibility of the method. The simulation results show that the method is accurate and applicable to the actual power grid, which has practical value of engineering. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.All right reserved.","11","Electric power transmission networks","Electric power system stability - HVDC power transmission","Additional control - Frequency deviation - Generator-tripping - High frequency HF - High voltage direct current - Interconnected power grid - Power grid frequencies - Yunnan power grid","706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Besides, the PMV index does not include the effect of horizontal solar radiation on the indoor thermal environment. In order to obtain simple and applicable correlations with consideration of solar radiation, a one-year measurement has been conducted in a naturally ventilated residential room in Qujing Normal University of Yunnan province, China. Based on collected data, PMV indices are calculated by using Newton's iterative method. The relationships of the PMV and the environmental parameters - outdoor air temperature, indoor mean air temperature, mean radiant temperature, wind velocity, relative humidity, and hourly horizontal solar radiation - have been studied by the multivariable regression techniques. Large numbers of correlations with high correlativity have been developed in the present paper.

Like most studies in the past, the target is always modeling the dependence structure between different wind farms geographically. In view of the situation in Yunnan power grid where a large wind farm power grid is often composed of a number of wind turbine groups scattered on different hilltops, it is no way to simply use one equivalent wind turbine to model the whole wind farm any more. Based on the theory that the Copula function is able to describe different tail characteristics, the mixed Copula function, often abbreviated to M-Copula, is proposed to model the wind farm's output.As one of the generator nodes in the western Yunnan power grid, a certain wind farm is chosen for empirical analysis. The result shows that the M-Copula function can play almost the same role in wind farm power modeling as the actual turbines' output on the platform of PSD-BPA, which single Copulas cannot. © 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press","14","Electric power transmission networks","Electric load flow - Electric power system interconnection - Electric utilities - Wind - Wind power - Wind turbines","Copula functions - Dependence structures - Empirical analysis - Goodness of fit - Large-scale wind farms - Power flows - Wind speed - Yunnan power grid","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
