Here we report on the paleomagnetism of the outcrops close to the Gaoligong dextral shear zone. Fifty paleomagnetic sites (503 samples) were sampled at variable distances (up to ~25 km) from mylonites exposed along the fault. Eighteen Jurassic-Cretaceous red bed sites yield systematic CW rotations with respect to Eurasia that peak at maximum (176°) close to the fault, and progressively decrease moving eastward, up to be virtually annulled ~20 km east of mylonite contact. West of the fault, 15 Pliocene-Holocene sites from the Tengchong volcanic field do not rotate. Thus, our data show that Gaoligong shear zone activity yielded significant CW rotations that were likely coeval to the main Oligo-Miocene episodes of dextral fault shear. The Gaoligong zone rotation pattern conforms to a quasi-continuous crust kinematic model and shows blocks of ≤1 km size close to the fault that enlarge moving eastward. Rotation values and width of the rotated-deformed zone translate to a 230–290 km Gaoligong shear zone dextral offset. Our work shows that fault shear plays a significant role for Indochina CW rotation occurrence. However, significant rotations at distances >30 km from main faults were also documented, so that additional tectonics—whose relative relevance has not been elucidated yet—must contribute as well to the rotation pattern. ©2018.

A comprehensive analysis of all the data obtained revealed significant differences in the petrological and geochemical composition of the two lignite types. The pale lignites are characterized by a higher abundance of the liptinite group compared with the dark lignites. The composition of liptinites is dominated by bituminite (mineral-bituminous groundmass) and sporinite, along with a relatively low abundance of the huminite group. This indicates a higher degree of oxidation in the drier, more elevated peatland environments during deposition of the pale lignites. The low values of the tissue preservation index (TPI), vegetation index (VI), and gelification index (GI) in the pale lignites suggest a relatively high decomposition rate of plant materials under dry/aerobic conditions. In contrast, the dark lignites have a very high proportion of huminite dominated by ulminite, along with a low content of liptinite and inertinite macerals, which suggests the prevalence of wet/anaerobic conditions in the peat-forming mire. The high values of TPI, VI, and GI in the dark layers suggest better preservation of organic matter during deposition under anaerobic conditions, and more wet/humid climatic conditions, when compared with the pale lignites. With respect to the biomarker composition, the high concentrations of long-chain (C27-C31) n-alkanes in both pale and dark lignites are typical characteristics for the predominance of higher terrestrial plants. Significant concentrations of mid-chain n-alkanes (n-C21-C25) were detected preferentially in the dark lignites, suggesting that aquatic plants might also have contributed to the plant community during the formation of the dark layers. The content of diterpenoids, and the average ratio of diterpenoids to the sum of diterpenoids and triterpenoids (Di-/(Di- + Tri-terpenoids)) are higher in the pale lignites than in the dark lignites. This indicates that gymnosperms made a crucial contribution to the plant community during the formation of the pale lignites. In the dark lignites, triterpenoids are generally far more abundant than diterpenoids, which suggests that the dark layers were overwhelmingly formed by angiosperm plants. This is consistent with lower C/N ratios in the dark lignite layers (av. 40.8) compared with the pale lignite layers (av. 60.6). Higher microbial activities in the pale lignites than in the dark lignites are reflected by the higher concentration of hopanoids and 17α,21β-homohopane (22R) in the pale lignites. © 2018","137","Lignite","Analytical geochemistry - Aquatic organisms - Biomarkers - Chains - Coal deposits - Deposition - Lipids - Paraffins - Petrography - Petrology - Rocks - Vegetation","Comprehensive analysis - Depositional environment - Diterpenoids - Geochemical composition - Pliocene - Preservation of organic matters - Triterpenoids - Yunnan province","471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 524 Solid Fuels - 602.1 Mechanical Drives - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: 201708080005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Goethe-Universit&auml;t Frankfurt am Main; Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; ","Financial support for Bangjun Liu was provided by the China Scholarship Council to carry out his PhD project at Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main (No. 201708080005 ).

Regional earthquake catalogue down to ML3.0 from 1970 to 2007 was used. The 'target magnitude' for the forecast test was MS 5.5. Fifteen-year long 'sliding time window' was used in the PI calculation, with 'anomaly training time window' being 5 years and 'forecast time window' being 5 years, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test was conducted for the evaluation of the forecast result, showing that the PI forecast outperforms not only random guess but also the simple number counting approach based on the clustering hypothesis of earthquakes (the RI forecast). If the 'forecast time window' was shortened to 3 years and 1 year, respectively, the forecast capability of the PI model decreased significantly, albeit outperformed random forecast. For the one year 'forecast time window', the PI result was almost comparable to the RI result, indicating that clustering properties play a more important role at this time scale. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","29","Forecasting","Earthquakes - Statistical mechanics - Statistical Physics - Testing","Clustering properties - Earthquake forecast - Earthquake physics - Predictive models - Receiver operating characteristics - Regional earthquakes - Sichuan-Yunnan region - Sliding time windows","484 Seismology - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 2004CB418406, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); ","Received July 4, 2007; accepted February 18, 2008 doi: 10.1007/s11430-008-0112-6 †Corresponding author (email: wuzhl@gucas.ac.cn) Supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No.2004CB418406)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Geological conditions and reservoir pore structure of the Longmaxi shale gas were clearly studied based on our researches. In the study area, the thickness of Longmaxi black shale gradually increases from southeast to northwest and the maximum is more than 120 m. For 46 shale samples from measured profiles, the total organic carbon (TOC) content and mineral composition of the shale gas reservoir were investigated. The TOC content increases from south to north, with an average content of 0.96% and higher TOC content in the lower segment of the Longmaxi Formation. The main minerals are clays and quartz, with an average content of 45.67% and 27.08% respectively. High pressure mercury intrusion (HPMI), low pressure nitrogen gas adsorption (N2-GA), carbon dioxide gas adsorption (CO2-GA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods were used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the pore structure of the shale gas reservoir. The openness and connectivity of macropores and mesopores gradually decrease from bottom to top in the Longmaxi Formation, and macropores and a few mesopores contribute to the dominant pore volume. Micropores with 0.30-0.40 nm and 0.45-0.60 nm diameters and mesopores of approximately 4 nm in diameter are strongly developed. Interparticle pores (Interp P), intercrystal pores (Interc P), intraparticle pores (Intra P) and organic matter pores (OMP) were observed. The shale porosity is in the range of 1.35-7.49%, with a mean of 3.98%. Porosity generally increases with increasing TOC and clays contents and decreases with increasing carbonate contents. More pore volume and surface area are always developed in shales with high TOC and clays contents and low carbonate contents. The micropore surface area is more developed in shales with high illite/smecnite mixed layers and kaolinite contents, whereas it is less developed in shales with high illite and chlorite contents.

The geochemical exploration at two survey scales was applied in telescoping ore targets for the first time in Eastern Yunnan Pt geochemical province that was delineated using Pt data from flood plain sediments with extra-low sampling density. Our study was based on the delineations and assessments of both regional and local Pt anomalies using the Pt data by analyzing with C-OES the composite samples with two sampling densities. The composite samples were obtained by recomposing at two sampling densities the original stream sediment samples collected by the National Geochemical Mapping Project. Semi-variograms were used to quantitatively describe the variability of Pt anomalies and further analyze the factors controlling the variability. Pt resource potentials of both the regional Pt anomalies and the local Pt anomalies in the study area were estimated based on the geochemical block methods, respectively. It comes to the conclusions as follows. (1) From the regional to local Pt anomaly, the factors controlling their variability from the deep seated faults-basalts turn into the basalts-branch faults, which suggest that Semi-variograms could identify the geological factors controlling the variability of the Pt anomalies identified by the Pt data from the stream sediments with different sampling densities. (2) There exist two types of Pt anomalies in the study area. One is those displaying at sampling densities, and its average Pt concentration significantly increases with sampling density increasing. The other is getting weaker and/or disappears with sampling density increasing. This shows that TOTGEMS could gradually eliminate non-ore anomalies and keep ore anomalies. (3) The average Pt concentration of the local Pt anomaly blocks delineated using Pt data from stream sediments with sampling density of one composite per 16 km2 is twice as much as that of the regional Pt anomaly blocks delineated using Pt data from stream sediments with sampling density of one composite per 64 km2. The Pt resource amount of the local Pt anomaly blocks is 60% of the regional anomaly blocks, but the area of the former is just 35% of the latter, which suggests that the Pt resource amount is mainly concentrated in its local anomalies, and that TOTGEMS has a good exploration function that efficiently approaches ore targets. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","40","Ore sampling","Basalt - Exploratory geochemistry - Geochemical surveys - Mineral exploration - Mineral resources - Ores - Sediments","Eastern Yunnan - Geochemical exploration - Geochemical mapping - Geological factors - Resource potentials - Sampling densities - Semivariograms - Southwestern China","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 533.1 Ore Treatment",,"Number: 2006AA06Z113, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National High-tech Research and Development Program; Number: 40772197, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Received August 5, 2008; accepted February 18, 2009 doi: 10.1007/s11430-009-0051-x †Corresponding author (email: yqchen@cugb.edu.cn) Supported by National High-Tech Research & Development Program of China (863 Program) (Grant No. 2006AA06Z113) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 40772197)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that minerals in the Changxing coals include mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S), quartz, kaolinite, dolomite, Mg-bearing siderite, anatase, ammonium illite, K-illite, calcite, and chamosite, as well as minor amounts of hematite, paragonite, K-feldspar, and an Al-hydroxide mineral (gibbsite?). The Changxing coals are typically rich in mixed-layer I/S, accounting for an average of 47.2% in their low temperature ashes. Mixed-layer I/S occurs mainly in two types: (1) lentoid as thin beds, and (2) fractures- or cells-fillings.

In combination with the characteristics, it is indicated that lamprophyres in the orefield and those in the Sanjiang ARIR are similar in tectonic setting, mineral assemblage and geochemistry. It is considered that lamprophyres in the orefield are the important component of the Sanjiang ARIR, and the lamprophyres and ore-hosted complex in the orefield represent the products of two times of different magmatic activity from different mantle sources. On the other hand, the age of lamprophyres in the orefield is older than that of the strike-slip shearing of the Ailaoshan-Honghe fault belt, suggesting that the strike-slip shearing of the Ailaoshan-Honghe fault belt is not the factor leading to magmatic activity of lamprophyres in the orefield, while it is more possible that magmatic activity of the Sanjiang ARIR promoted strike-slip shearing of the fault belt. © Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","32","Igneous rocks","Deposits - Mica - Nickel - Nickel deposits - Ores - Shearing - Strike-slip faults","Amprophyre - Baimazhainickel deposit - Geological significance - Yunnan province - ^40Ar-^39Ar dating","482.2 Minerals - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 548.1 Nickel - 604.1 Metal Cutting",,"Number: G1999042303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Key Research Program of Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; Number: KZCX2-YW-111-3, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 40573036, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This research project was supported jointly by the Innovational Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-111-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.40573036), and the State Key Fundamental Research Program (G1999042303).

The recent and continuous drought in China has led to detrimental effects on the local environment and societies in Yunnan Province, thus there is an urgent need to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of the drought. The characteristics of the spatial distribution of drought processes and the impact of droughts on soil moisture and water storage remains unclear. In this study, the direction, magnitude, start time, and duration of droughts were investigated, based on TotalWater Storage Anomalies (TWSA) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (CCI SM), and observed precipitation data. The spatial patterns of TWSA trends at each time duration segment suggest that the evolution of drought processes is very complex, and can be clustered into three zones. The spatial distribution of TWSA revealed that the drought status lasted more than one year longer in the north and east parts compared to other parts of Yunnan Province. Water losses occurred in the south part, while water gains were found in the central, north, and east parts of Yunnan Province, from 2002 to 2014, indicating a higher possibility of droughts in the south part in the future. Both de-seasonalized TWSA and CCI SM effectively captured the serious drought from 2009 to 2010 in Yunnan, and their spatial patterns were found to be consistent. The drought detected from CCI SMA had a one-month lag and TWSA had a two-month lag, in comparison to the meteorological drought from precipitation data, which indicates that the drought data derived from CCI SMA and TWSA are better able to represent the impact of droughts, particularly on agriculture. The contribution of surface SM changes in TWSA was determined to be about 41.94%, suggesting that variations in soil moisture only explain less than half of the total water storage change. GRACE observations and CCI SM can be used as important indicators of the spatial distribution of the drought process and its impact on the environment and local communities, which will improve the management of water resources and early detection and monitoring of droughts. © 2017 by the authors.","46","Soil surveys","Climate change - Digital storage - Disasters - Drought - Soil moisture - Spatial distribution - Water management","GRACE - Gravity recovery and climate experiments - Impact on the environment - Local environments - Meteorological drought - Precipitation data - Temporal evolution - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2012CA021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: UTS, Sponsor: University of Technology Sydney; Number: 201401026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41730751, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: We wish to thank Zunyi Xie (University of Technology Sydney, Australia) for helpful suggestions on dealing with GRACE TWSA.

Adverse natural environment in this region has delayed studies on Late Cretaceous tectono-magmatic activities in Late Yanshan, with focuses mainly on geochronology, petrogenesis, geodynamic background, fluid characteristics and source of ore-forming materials related to the Late Cretaceous alkali-rich granite, etc. However, discussion on structural stress field and dynamic mechanism is still rare. In this paper, we investigated in detail the structures and alteration-lithofacies of key sections and gallery in the east and west districts, Xiuwacu W-Mo deposits. Taking into account the zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf and O isotopic characteristics, we believe that the Xiuwacu granitic pluton is a two phase complex pluton divided into east and west ore districts with a near S-N F4 fault as the boundary. The east district is dominated by Late Triassic (212-201 Ma) porphyritic biotite granite, while mainly Late Cretaceou porphyritic quartz monzogranite and monzogranitic porphyry are in the west district. The situ-zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf and O isotopic analysis on the porphyritic quartz monzogranite suggests that the monzogranite formation age is 80.18±0.80 Ma (LA-ICP-MC U-Pb) (negative zircon ΕHf(t)=-4.49--8.07, variable δ18O ranged 5.98‰-7.45‰). Hf isotopic TDM2 model age is 1432-1239 Ma. Together with known geochemical characteristics, they show that the magmatic-mineralization material source of Late Cretaceous porphyritic quartz monzogranite was derived from the partial melting of thickened lower crust. Furthermore, Late Cretaceous regional tectonic stress field is characterized by NE-SW extension in the Yidun-Geza Area by regional structural analysis on 135 typical Late Cretaceous quartz monzogranite dykes and scheelite-molybdenite quartz veins. In summary, we believe that Late Cretaceous magmatic metallogenesis in this region is formed by the NW-SE extension of Neo-Tethys oceanic subduction resulting in partial melting of pre-existing thickened crust decompression. © 2019, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

However, commercial CBM production in this region has not been achieved. Reservoir properties are the prerequisites in determining the possibility of CBM exploration and its development potential. Thus, to help to select the most favorable block and to prioritize CBM development in the study area, a comprehensive program of experimental work has been carried out to study the physical properties of coal reservoirs in different blocks. Experimental results show that the properties of coal reservoir change significantly with respect to coal rank, and the coal rank in the study area is very uneven, with the vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of coal samples ranging from 0.68% to 3.31%. In detail, low rank coals have well developed seepage pores but undeveloped adsorption pores, resulting in the low adsorption capacity and high porosity and permeability. With burial depth increase, the metamorphic degree and compaction degree of coals grow accordingly, as a result pores and fractures are gradually closed under stress, leading to a sharp reduction of porosity and permeability in medium rank coals. However, most of the high rank coals in the study area have experienced a large number of tectonic thermal events, which not only increased the metamorphism degree and adsorption capacity, but also improved the porosity and permeability of the coal reservoirs. Based on experimental results, the CBM potentials of coal reservoirs in different blocks in the study area were evaluated using multi-objective and multi-level fuzzy optimization model, and the most prospective zones for CBM production were suggested. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The studies of sulfur isotopes indicate that the δ34S values of hydrothermal sulfides (pyrite and arsenopyrite) range from 8.3‰ to 11.3‰, which is generally similar to that of diagenetic pyrite and Permian marine sulfates, suggesting the sulfur was mainly derived from strata. Sulfur dynamic fractionation was mainly controlled by organic thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The research of lead isotope shows that206Pb/204Pb values have a relatively wide variation range, while207Pb/204Pb and208Pb/204Pb values have little change. The calculated model ages of lead have a great varying range (-62 Ma to 389 Ma), and even contain negative age, showing that there was an addition of radiogenic lead to common lead. The lead of ore and ore-bearing strata was mainly provided by upper crust, with a little mixed source of magma. In brief, both sulfur and lead isotopic data show an inheritance between ore and ore-bearing strata, that is, ore-forming materials mainly came from strata.","17","Gold deposits","Deposits - Isotopes - Pyrites - Sedimentary rocks - Sulfur compounds","Carlin-type gold deposit, Funing County of Yunnan - Dynamic fractionations - Isotopic composition - Lead isotope - Metallogenic belt - Ore forming material - Radiogenic leads - Thermochemical sulfate reduction","482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The peaks appeared in the latter half of 2002 and 2007.

The OLR anomalies in 2002 and 2007 can be thought as precursors for earthquakes in 2003 and 2008, respectively. The anomalies are mainly occurred on half a year to one year before earthquakes. And the anomalous points in twenty-five studied points are near the epicenters. It indicates that there are relationship between earthquakes and OLR anomalies which can be detected by this method.

High-resolution pollen and conifer stoma data are presented from a sediment core (Tiancai Lake), located just below treeline in the Hengduan Mountains, northwestern Yunnan Province of China. These data record changes in vegetation and climate for the latest Pleistocene and Holocene (c. the last 12,230cal.yrBP), and by comparing these results with the pollen records from the nearby Erhai Lake and Lugu Lake, a regional climate history in Yunnan Province can be inferred. During the period of 12,230-11,510cal.yrBP, open alpine meadow around Tiancai Lake indicates a relatively cold and dry climate, corresponding to the Younger Dryas cold event (YD). Between 11,510 and~10,000cal.yrBP, the vegetation types around Tiancai Lake changed into Picea and Abies forest and alpine Rhododendron shrubland, reflecting increases in the temperature and humidity. From ~10,000 to 6100cal.yrBP, Tsuga forest expanded persistently toward Tiancai Lake, indicating further climate changed towards warmer and wetter conditions. Between 6100 and 3410cal.yrBP, Tsuga forest was the dominant vegetation type nearest to Tiancai Lake, denoting warm and humid climatic conditions, corresponding to the Holocene climatic optimum in the northwestern Yunnan Province. Tsuga forest in mountains around Lugu Lake shrank quickly at 3410cal.yrBP, reflecting significant decline of humidity. Since 2930cal.yrBP, Tsuga forest around Tiancai Lake shrank gradually, indicating a fluctuating decrease of temperature. These climatic changes reflect changes of the southwest monsoon, namely, warm and humid climate indicating strong southwest monsoon, cold and dry climate denoting weak southwest monsoon. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","64","Climate change","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Forestry - Lakes - Vegetation","Alpine lakes - Climatic changes - Holocenes - Pollen analysis - Southwest monsoon - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties",,"Number: 2010CB950201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NIGLAS2011KXJ02, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: XDA05120102, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41072132, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41075012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41272188, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2010CB950201 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41072132 , 41272188 , 41075012 ), Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology , CAS ( NIGLAS2011KXJ02 ), and the "Strategic Priority Research Program - Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ，Grant No. XDA05120102 .

The aim is to get regular pairs of the pronunciation variation by statistics. Then, on the basis of this, we can construct the preliminary scheme of mandarin multi-pronunciation dictionary for minority accent in Yunnan. The combined method consists of the following steps. Firstly, baseline hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained by using the project 863 standard Mandarin corpus. Secondly, the non-native speech data from Dai area, Lisu area and Naxi area in Yunnan was transcribed with the baseline HMMs. In addition, the transcribed result was aligned with the reference transcription through dynamic programming. After calculating of the confusion matrix, we analyze the error pairs due to substitute error at the level of base syllables, initials and finals. Next, we consider the regular mandarin pronunciation variation of national language in Yunnan. Many interesting and useful linguistic phenomena which are necessary for the advancement of nonnative Mandarin speech recognition technology were observed in our experiments.","7","Speech recognition","Dynamic programming - Hidden Markov models - Speech","Automatic speech recognition - Challenge questions - Linguistic phenomena - Mandarin speech recognition - Mandarin speech recognition system - National language - Pronunciation dictionaries - Pronunciation variation","751.5 Speech - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In recent years, with the introduction of new national policies and people's increasing awareness of environmental protection, haze has received widespread social attention. Haze pollution in China has always been a prominent environmental problem. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of haze pollution is PM2.5, which not only occurs in cities with high degree of industrialization or urbanization, but also often appear in regions with good air quality. This paper selects eight main cities in Yunnan Province as the research area, and uses the measured PM2.5 data from eight main cities in January 2015 to February 2018 in Yunnan Province as the basic data, using the eight urban meteorological data as the basic data, using the MK trend test and Correlation coefficient method to carry out research on the spatial-temporal variation and correlation of PM2.5 in the last three years in Yunnan Province. The space-time analysis shows that the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Lijiang City is the lowest, the monthly average concentration in Baoshan City is the highest, and the daily average concentration in Puer City is in a gentle trend; Except for Lijiang, the other seven cities all experienced different levels of pollution from March 17 to March 26, 2015; The concentration of PM2.5 in each city showed a seasonal pattern of 'U' and a pulse-like diurnal variation pattern in winter and spring, summer and autumn; cities with higher annual average concentrations in the province are concentrated in the northeast and southwest. Correlation analysis showed that PM2.5 concentration was significantly negatively correlated with precipitation and wind speed, and negatively correlated with daily average humidity and temperature. © 2018 IEEE.","22","Environmental protection","Air quality - Climate change - Correlation methods - Wind","Annual average concentration - Correlation coefficient method - Ecological environments - Haze pollutions - Humidity and temperatures - PM2.5 - Temporal and spatial variation - Trend tests","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41761084), China High Technology Research and Development Program 863 (2012AA121402), and Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China (2016FD020).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Di-ethyl ether, n-butanol, and ethanol/water (70:30, v/v) covering low-to-high polarity ranges were chosen as the extraction solvent, respectively. The results clearly showed that, compared with conventional single extraction solvent, collaboratively using extraction solvents with different polarities can effectively increase the number of detected peaks and enrich the product ions information in multistage mass spectra analysis. By further matching diagnostic ions and fragmental pathways, a total of 34 components were successfully identified. Our work clearly demonstrates that integrating polarity-directed extraction and diagnostic ion filtering techniques is a powerful and reliable strategy for global detection and identification of complex chemicalome from herbal prescriptions, and may open new avenues for chemical analysis in other complex mixtures. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In order to reveal why the enhanced governors of hydroelectric units affect the frequency of Yunnan power grid of China, the theoretic calculation and time-domain simulation are conducted on dynamic behaviors when the system frequency difference across the dead zone of primary frequency regulation from different directions. It is demonstrated that the enhanced governor does not have a stable equilibrium point near the dead zone of primary frequency regulation of hydroelectric generator, and when the system frequency difference slowly passes back to the dead zone, a phase lag of about 90 degrees is introduced in ultra-low frequency band, thus reducing the safe and stable margin of the system frequency. Finally, the eigenvalues of a single-machine system including hydro turbine, governor and generator models are calculated with the aid of small disturbance analysis tools. Through the comparative simulation, it is shown that the enhanced governor not only has similar negative damping effect with the water hammer in ultra-low band, but also is the one of the disturbance sources of ultra-low frequency oscillation, which keeps ultra-low frequency oscillation continuous and unable to attenuate. © 2019 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","25","Electric power transmission networks","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Frequency stability - Governors - Hydroelectric generators - Time domain analysis","Asynchronous interconnections - Comparative simulation - Hydroelectric units - Primary frequency regulation - Small disturbance analysis - Time-domain simulations - Ultra low frequencies - Yunnan power grid","602.1 Mechanical Drives - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 921 Mathematics - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The author noted that SLHF anomaly in some special tectonic position is not only associated with the strong earthquakes nearby but also with the strong earthquakes far away in the same tectonic belt. The dynamic variation rule of SLHF anomaly in the special tectonic position prior to earthquakes might reveal some trend of regional seismic activity and contribute to the research of mechanism of SLHF anomaly prior to earthquakes. Tengchong area in Yunnan Province is such a special tectonic position located in the south of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and is one of the youngest volcanic regions on the Chinese mainland with frequent magmatic activity and strong hydrothermal activity. The earthquakes (MS≥6.4) since 2000 in Sichuan-Yunnan region(including the Yao'an MS6.5 earthquake in 2000, the Ning'er MS6.4 earthquake in 2007, the Wenchuan MS8.0 earthquake in 2008, the MS7.0 Myanmar earthquake in 2011 and the Lushan MS7.0 earthquake in 2013)are selected as cases to study the variation characteristics of the SLHF in Tengchong region before and after the above earthquakes. It is found that significant SLHF anomalies occurred in Tengchong area not only before earthquakes happening in the vicinity but also earthquakes far away in the surroundings. The SLHF anomalies occurred mostly within one and half months before the earthquakes, except Wenchuan MS8.0 earthquake. The SLHF anomalies occurred two months before Wenchuan earthquake, the earlier occurrence of the anomalies might be due to the relatively long distance between Wenchuan earthquake and Tengchong area. It is also found that the amplitude of anomaly is related to earthquake magnitude, the larger the magnitude of earthquake, the larger the amplitude of the anomalies. For example, the SLHF anomalies in Tengchong region prior to Burma MS7 earthquake and Wenchuan MS8.0 earthquake are very strong, far more than the reference maximum values, but the SLHF anomalies prior to Yao'an MS6.5 earthquake and Ning'er MS6.4 earthquake are relatively small. The sensitive response of SLHF in Tengchong region to the surrounding earthquakes on the one hand is related to the development of active faults and the present-day intensive crustal deformation; on the other hand, there are strong volcanic activities in Tengchong area, with springs widely developed and water heat exchanging quickly. So as a result, the SLHF of this region is sensitive to surrounding tectonic movement.","20","Earthquakes","Faulting - Heat flux - Latent heat - Remote sensing - Volcanoes","Crustal deformations - Earthquake magnitudes - Hydrothermal activity - Sichuan-Yunnan region - Surface latent heat fluxes - Thermal anomalies - Variation characteristics - Volcanic activities","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Soil conservation of restored forest was 78.17% of retained forest while net primary production (NPP) already reached 88.65%, which suggested different recovery rates of NPP and soil conservation. Increasing extent of GFGP implementation improved soil conservation but decreased NPP and water yield at sub-watershed scale, which revealed trade-offs between ecosystem services under ecological restoration.

The results indicate that porosity and permeability of the coal is controlled by the metamorphic grade of coal, and show the clear regional distribution characteristics as well. The pores are dominanted by transition pores and micropores. The development of macropores and mesopores is relatively bad. The BET surface area and BJH total pore volume is relatively high, which indicates the good adsorption capacity in the coal reservoir. Then the pore system in the study area is divided into four mercury-injection curves types and three liquid nitrogen isotherm types. As a result, it is proved that the ability of accumulation and deliverability of the coal reservoir is best in Panguan syncline, followed by Zhina coalfield. The Gemudi syncline and eastern Yunnan is good at accumulation but does badly in deliverability. The adsorption and desorption capacity is best in Zhina coalfield, while it is weak in the rest of areas owing to the adverse pore structure or pore types, which brings about 'bottleneck problem' for the recovery of coalbed methane.","15","Methane","Coal - Coal bed methane - Coal deposits - Firedamp - Gas adsorption - Low temperature testing - Mercury (metal) - Metal recovery - Petroleum reservoir engineering - Porosity - Recovery - Temperature","Adsorption and desorptions - Adsorption capacities - Coal reservoirs - Coalbed methane reservoir - Low-temperature nitrogen - Pore system - Regional distribution - Western guizhou and eastern yunnan","503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 522 Gas Fuels - 524 Solid Fuels - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The impacts of pore-water pressure, pore-water pressure increment, water content, and the factor of safety are investigated by numerical models for an actual slope in Yunnan, China. The results indicate that antecedent rainfall plays an important role in the stability of the slope. The model reasonably explains the time lag between the occurrences of rainfall and landslides. Pore-water pressures significantly change at the upper layer of red-clay slope; the occurrence of cracks at the top of the slope agrees with the field observations before landslide. The saturated zone of the slope gradually expands from the top to bottom of the slope; the major reason for landslide is that the surface stagnant water, after rainfall, gradually infiltrates into the weathered gneiss rock, resulting in decrease in the strength of weathered gneiss rock. Then, the weight of the later rainfall leads to landslide of the slope. The factor of safety of the slope is evaluated by the modified limit equilibrium methods. It is shown that the actual failure occurs when the calculated factor of safety approaches its minimum, i.e., 0.97.

In this study, we used automated mineral identification and characterization system (AMICS)-the most up-to-date mineral automatic analysis system in mineralogy and geology in the world, combined with scanning electron microscope and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) microstructural in-situ analysis technique, to complete quantitative mineral identification in the Yinachang Fe-Cu-REE deposit, an undertaking unattainable by conventional means of rock-mineral identification. The results demonstrate that the deposit contains large quantities of parisites and bastnaesites and small quantities of monazites, allanites, columbites, fergusonites, yttrialites and Nb-bearing rutiles. Bastnaesites, monazites, columbite and fergusonite are mainly concentrated in the banded ores and closely associated with iron oxide minerals (magnetites), siderites, apatites, flourite and early sulfides such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, etc, while parisites, allanite, yttrialite and Nb-bearing rutile are enriched in vein ores coexisting mainly with chlorites, calcite, quartz and late sulfides such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, etc. Plainly, both iron oxide and copper sulfide mineralization stages are associated with REE mineralization. We identified two main mineralization stages, i.e., iron oxide-apatite-REE (-1) and Cu sulfides(-Au)-REE (-2) mineralization stages, both were apparently related to the deep (mantle) magmatic activities: bastnaesites, monazites, columbite and fergusonite primarily formed in the -1 stage, likely during the breakup of the Columbia supercontinent; and parisites, allanite, yttrialite and Nb-bearing rutile mainly formed in the -2 stage, possibly during the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. Through comparative studies, we found that the Yinachang Fe-Cu-REE and giant Bayan Obo Nb-Fe-REE deposits are comparable in tectonic settings, metallogenic element assembles, ore-hosting rock series, mineral compositions, ore-forming ages and material sources. Therefore, we propose, preliminarily, that the Yinachang Fe-Cu-REE deposit is a 'Bayan Obo-type' deposit. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

In this province, the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate play prominent roles and significantly influence the rice water requirement (ETc) and irrigation quota (IQ), while the research about the influence mechanism and results is lacking. We estimated the rice ETc and IQ of different hydrological years based on the experimental data from six areas of mid-season rice and the single crop efficient approach recommended by FAO-56. The contour maps were drawn with GIS, and the spatial distribution of the rice ETc and IQ under the influence of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate were analyzed. The results showed that high water ETc and IQ of rice were distributed in the hot, dry river valley area. The rice ETc was the smallest in northwestern Yunnan, and the IQ was the smallest in southern Yunnan. The ETc and IQ of rice were divided into several intervals by mountains and valleys, and varied largely among different channels and little within one channel. The three-dimensional climate results in the abrupt changes of ETc and IQ, The leading meteorological factors causing the abrupt changes were different, and there were also complex correlations between these meteorological factors. Taken together, temperature and rainfall were the most critical elements in the three-dimensional climate. The results of this study illustrated the regularity and inherent mechanism of the rice ETc and IQ under the influences of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate, providing certain references for the analyses and calculation of the rice ETc and IQ in similar circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","32","Water resources","Crops - Geographic information systems - Irrigation - Landforms","Complex correlation - Crop coefficient - Influence mechanism - Meteorological factors - Northwestern Yunnan - Spatial variability - Water balance equation - Water requirements","444 Water Resources - 481.1 Geology - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use",,"Number: 2015BB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2016NSK01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NSFC 51579184, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 51579184 ), the Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science ( 2016NSK01 ) and the Yunnan Provincial Science Technology Department ( 2015BB019 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By detailed study of the geochemical anomalies, concealed ore-bodies have been successfully found within the MEAHFZ, leading to a 2. million. ton (Mt) increase in the Zn-Pb metal reserves. The successful exploration in the Huize district demonstrates that the MEAHFZ prospecting method has the potential to increase metal reserves in the brown field and to find new deposits in green field or new ore-bodies surrounding areas of the mine area. Variations of gradient value for primary anomalies, controlled by structures, may predict the dipping direction and the extension of the concealed ore-bodies. Also, the shifting direction of anomalies at different levels reflects the dip direction of concealed ore-bodies at depth. Thus, this method can not only find concealed ore-bodies, but also provide important information about deposit genesis. The method is low cost and its operation is simple, and can be used in exploration for concealed ore-bodies at depth in areas such as the Zn-Pb deposits in Northeastern Yunnan, the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Triangular area of poly-metallic Zn-Pb mineralization and the other similar areas over the world where the ores are obviously controlled by structures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","52","Ores","Binary alloys - Deposits - Geochemistry - Germanium compounds - Lead zinc deposits - Metals - Mineralogy - Natural resources exploration - Ore analysis - Silver compounds","Fault zone - Geochemical exploration - Huize mine district - Northeastern Yunnan, southwestern China - Ore bodies","481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 801 Chemistry",,"Number: 2010CC005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: U1133602, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572060, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20089943, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1212011220725, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Sydney; ","This research project was jointly funded by the Funds for the program of the National Natural Science Foundation (NOs.

The model is based on known fault geometry, and constrained by a GPS-derived horizontal velocity field. Our results support a model attributing the eastward extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau driven mainly by the north-northeastward indentation of the Indian plate into Tibet and the gravitational collapse of the plateau. Resisted by a relatively stable south China block, materials of the Sichuan-Yunnan region rotate clockwise around the eastern Himalayan tectonic syntaxis. During the process the Garze´-Yushu, Xianshuihe, Anninghe, Zemuhe, Daliangshan, and Xiaojiang faults, the southwest extension of the Xiaojiang fault, and the Daluo-Jinghong and Mae Chan faults constitute the northeast and east boundaries of the eastward extrusion, with their left slip rates being 0.3-14.7, 8.9-17.1, 5.1 ± 2.5, 2.8 ± 2.3, 7.1 ± 2.1, 9.4 ± 1.2, 10.1 ± 2.0, 7.3 ± 2.6, and 4.9 ± 3.0 mm/a respectively. The southwestern boundary consists of a widely distributed dextral transpressional zone other than a single fault. Right slip rates of 4.2 ± 1.3, 4.3 ± 1.1, and 8.5 ± 1.7 mm/a are detected across the Nanhua-Chuxiong-Jianshui, Wuliangshan, and Longling-Lancang faults. Crustal deformation across the Longmenshan fault is weak, with shortening rates of 1.4 ± 1.0 and 1.6 ± 1.3 mm/a across the Baoxing-Beichuan and Beichuan-Qingchuan segments. Northwest of the Longmenshan fault lies an active deformation zone (the Longriba fault) with 5.1 ± 1.2 mm/a right slip across. Relatively large slip rates are detected across a few faults within the Sichuan-Yunnan block: 4.4 ±1.3 mm/a left slip and 2.7 ±1.1 mm/a shortening across the Litang fault, and 2.7 ±2.3 mm/a right-lateral shearing and 6.7 ±2.3 mm/a shortening across the Yunongxi fault and its surrounding regions. In conclusion, we find that the Sichuan-Yunnan region is divided into more than a dozen active micro-blocks by a large number of faults with relatively slow slip rates. The eastward extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau is absorbed and adjusted in the region mainly by these faults, other than a small number of large strike-slip faults with fast slip rates. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","62","Fault slips","Deformation - Extrusion - Global positioning system - Least squares approximations - Strike-slip faults - Velocity","Constrained inversions - Crustal deformations - Gravitational collapse - Horizontal velocity - Least squares methods - Linked-fault-element - Sichuan-Yunnan region - Slip rates","484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,"Number: 200708002, Acronym: CEA, Sponsor: China Earthquake Administration; Number: 2004CB418403, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 40334042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Public Library Association; Number: -, Acronym: CEA, Sponsor: China Earthquake Administration; ","Received September 1, 2007; accepted June 10, 2008 doi: 10.1007/s11430-008-0106-4 †Corresponding author (email: zshen@ies.ac.cn) Supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2004CB418403), the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 40334042), and the China Earthquake Administration Research Fund (Grant No. 200708002)GPS data used in this study are mainly from the Crustal Motion Observation Network of China (CMONOC) project observed in 1999, 2001, and 2004 in the Sichuan-Yunnan region.

Ore bodies in the Luziyuan deposit occurred as stratiform-like, veined and lenticular in the interlayer fracture zone of skarn and marble in the Late Cambrian carbonate formation. The ores are mainly characterized by banded, disseminated and veined-stockwork structures. The wallrocks are marked by intense hydrothermal alteration with a complexed and prominent zonation pattern in the sequence from bottom to top: garnet-diopside-tremolite-actinolite to chlorite-epidote-actinolite-rhodonite, and to carbonate-marbleization. The ore-forming fluids have undergone a significant evolution from early to late stages. The present paper concentrates on a systematic study of fluid inclusions involving various gangue minerals and sphalerite from the early and late skarn stages, quartz-sulfide mineral and quartz-carbonate stages. CO2-bearing liquid-rich fluid inclusions and liquid inclusions are common in the early skarn stage. These inclusions contain a large amount of K+, Na+, Ca+, F-, Cl-, and a little SO2-4 in the liquid phase, and H2O- and CO2-dominant and a small amount of CH4 and N2 in the vapor phase. Their homogenization temperatures range from 233. 6 to 315. 6°C and salinities from 10. 6% to 17. 6% NaCleqv. The late skarn stage is characterized by CO2-rich and NaCl-bearing fluid inclusions, with homogenization temperature ranging from 214.9 to 388. o°C and salinity from 5. 9% to 16.4% NaCleqv. The quartz-sulfide stage is dominated by CO2-bearing fluid inclusions, whose vapor phase mainly consists of H2O, CH4, and a small amount of CO2. The homogenization temperature ranges from 150. 0 to 285. 0°C and salinity from 2. 5% to 13. 8% NaCleqv. In the quartz-carbonate stage the inclusion fluid with a single composition has homogenization temperatures of 105. 0 ∼ 187. 5°C and salinity of 0. 5% to 12. 3% NaCleqv. Fluid inclusion characteristics combined with the H-0 isotope results suggest that the Luziyuan ore-forming fluid is sourced from deep magmatic hydrothermal solution with medium-high temperature and salinity, high K and Na contents, and rich in CO2, Cl, F in the early stage, but in the quartz-sulfide stage, is characterized by medium-low temperature, low salinity, and poor in CO2 due to being mixed with meteoric water that becomes dominant in the late stage. Therefore, the change in ore-forming environment, mixing of different fluids and possible fluid boiling may be the important mechanisms for precipitation and enrichment of metallic elements in the Luziyuan deposit. In the light of ore geology, fluid inclusions and H-0 isotopes, we propose that the Luziyuan Pb-Zn-Fe (-Cu) poly-metallic deposit is a distal skarn type mineralization system which is related to the deep-hidden granite and the continental collision orogeny. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

A 70-m-wide syenite porphyry and molybdenite-pyrite vein with high Cu-Mo abnormal pyritization was firstly discovered in the deep part of the deposits (3# vein of 2073 level). It is believed that obvious alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Mo superimposed mineralization occurs at depth of the deposit. This study conducted Re-Os isotopic analysis for molybdenite-pyrite samples from molybdenite-pyrite veins, pyrite-galena veins and high Cu-Mo syenite porphyry from deep adits in the Laojiezi Pb-Ag deposits. An isochron age of 33.71± 0.29Ma and a weighted average age of 33.99±0.22Ma were obtained for molybdenite, indicating that the mineralization of the Pb-Ag polymetallic deposit took place in Oligocene, which is consistent with the diagenetic age of the syenite porphyry. The initial Os value of 0.3049~1.5549 and the γOs value of 140.5~1126 suggest that the metallogenic material was derived from partial melting of the crust-mantle transition layer. The metallogenic age of the Laojiezi porphyry Pb-Ag polymetallic deposit is roughly the same as that (30~40 Ma) of regional alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic hydrothermal polymetallic deposits. It shows that, after the collision between the India plate and Eurasia plate, the change of tectonic stress field resulted in large-scale strike-slip faulting system, which induced partial melting of crust-mantle transition zone within the stable cratons, forming alkali-rich intrusive rocks and metallogenic fluids, and the fluid formed alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic-hydrothermal polymetallic deposits along the weak structures. © 2018, Science Press.

However, the degree of price fluctuation differs among sectors in this industry. These differences would mislead policy makers on formulating policy about the long-term development of economic and industry. Existing studies do not present the whole feature picture regarding the effects of price changes in the non-ferrous metal industry. This paper analyzes the segmented effects of prices in the non-ferrous metal industry chain on economic development in Yunnan province, China. The effects caused by price changes in the mining, smelting, and processing sectors were studied using a static computable general equilibrium model with a looping algorithm to avoid omitting the key point of price. Furthermore, the relationships between sectors are discussed by categorizing the effects into crowding-out and pulling effects. Considering the situation of non-ferrous industry in China, the scenarios of price change between −30% and 30% in different sectors of the non-ferrous metal industry were developed. The results show that decreases in the smelting price benefit regional economic development and international trade. Price changes in the mid-stream smelting sector generate more pulling effects than changes in other sectors. This suggests that regional economic development can be promoted by adjusting the smelting price of non-ferrous metals in regions with abundant non-ferrous metal resources. Moreover, as price changes bring different crowding-out and pulling effects among sectors, new price-related policies should consider the effects on other sectors of the industry. © 2019","49","Economic and social effects","International trade - Metallurgy - Nonferrous metals - Regional planning - Smelting","Computable general equilibrium model - Economic development - Industry chain - Long-term development - Non-ferrous metal industry - Price fluctuation - Regional economic development - Yunnan province","403.2 Regional Planning and Development - 531.1 Metallurgy - 533.2 Metal Refining - 971 Social Sciences",,"","We gratefully acknowledge the support from the Strategic Priority Research Program, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20010202).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The porphyry consists of biotite granodiorite porphyry (BGDP) and granodiorite porphyry (GDP). They are enriched in alkali (the average K2O+Na2O values of BGDP and GDP are 8.22% and 8.13%, respectively) and potassium (the average K2O/Na2O ratios for BGDP and GDP are 1.08 and 1.2, respectively), and metaluminous (the average A/CNK values for BGDP and GDP are 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). These results show they belong to the metaluminous and high-k calc-alkaline porphyry, and the products of the same magma. BGDP and GDP are enriched in LILE (Rb, Ba, Pb, Sr), Th, U and LREE, and depleted in HFSE (Ta, Nb and Ti), with insignificant Eu anomalies (δEu=0.85-1.12). These features of the Fenshuiling porphyry are similar to those of A-type granite. LA-ICP-MS dating of zircon grains from GDP yields a U-Pb age of 34.5±0.3 Ma.

The porphyries in the belt were likely derived from partial melting of the over-thickened lower crust and the upper mantle under post-collisional setting subsequent to the India-Eurasian plate collision, and are closely related to the activity of the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan strike-slip fault. © 2016, Science Press.

The two coals are characterized by high ash yields and low sulfur contents. Three factors, including sediment-source region, multi-stage volcanic ash generation, and multi-stage hydrothermal fluid injections, were responsible for variations in the geochemical and mineralogical compositions of the Xinde coals.Trace elements, including V, Sc, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta, are enriched in the coals and were mainly derived from the sediment-source Kangdian Upland region. Major minerals in the samples of coal, roof, floor and non-coal sediment partings include quartz, kaolinite, and chamosite, as well as interstratified illite/smectite and anatase. Chamosite in the coal was derived from reactions between kaolinite and Fe-Mg-rich hydrothermal fluids. However, chamosite in the roof strata was directly precipitated from Fe-Mg-rich hydrothermal fluids or was derived from the alteration of precursor minerals (e.g., biotite) by hydrothermal fluids. Quartz in some samples is very high, especially in the roof strata of the C2 and C3 coal. Such high quartz, along with minor minerals including pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, calcite, celestite, vanadinite, barite, clausthalite and silicorhabdophane, were derived from multi-stage hydrothermal fluids.The floors of both the C2 and C3 coal seams are fully-argillized fine-grained tuffaceous claystone and the immediate roof of the C2 coal is argillized coarse-grained tuff. The original materials of the floors and roofs of these coal seams were high-Ti alkali basaltic volcanic ashes, as indicated by high TiO2, Nb, and siderophile elements, and the distribution patterns of rare earth elements.Two intra-seam tonstein layers in the C3 coal were identified based on their lateral persistence, mineralogical mode of occurrence and composition, as well as their elemental composition. The tonsteins are dominated by kaolinite, with minor quartz and possibly mixed-layer illite/smectite. Both tonsteins were derived from dacitic magma. The ratios of Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, and U/Th are much lower in tonsteins than in the adjacent coal benches, which is attributed to the hydrothermal leaching. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","97","Coal mines","Barite - Bituminous coal - Calcite - Chlorite minerals - Coal deposits - Concrete aggregates - Copper compounds - Exploratory geochemistry - Floors - Kaolinite - Mica - Mine roof control - Pyrites - Quartz - Rare earths - Roofs - Sediments - Titanium dioxide - Vanadate minerals - Volcanoes - Zinc sulfide","Eastern Yunnan - Elemental compositions - Elements in coals - Geochemical composition - Late permian coal - Mineralogical compositions - Minerals in coals - Volcanic ash generations","402 Buildings and Towers - 412 Concrete - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 484 Seismology - 502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 503.1 Coal Mines - 524 Solid Fuels - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: IRT13099, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41272182, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40930420, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China ( No. 2014CB238902 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41272182 and 40930420 ), and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (No. IRT13099 ).

The results show that minerals in the coals include quartz, kaolinite, calcite, chamosite, pyrite, mixed-layer I/S and minor marcasite, siderite, anatase, ankerite, and dolomite. Modes of occurrences of authigenic quartz and chamosite suggest that they were mainly precipitated from Fe-Mg-rich siliceous solution derived from the weathering of Emeishan basalt, which was induced by mantle plume eruption during late Middle Permian and covers most places of southwest China. Kaolinite and mixed layer I/S are mainly of detrital origin. Correspondingly, the elevated trace elements, including V, Cr, Co, and Ni, in the coals are closely related to Emeishan basalt. Trace amounts of detrital calcite, ankerite and siderite in the coals probably originated from the Maokou limestone. The frequent presence of high temperature quartz indicates that felsic volcanic eruption took place through the entire Late Permian Epoch. Mineral matter in the coals was not only derived from Emeishan basalt in the Kangdian Oldland, but also felsic volcanic ashes, mafic volcanic ashes, and limestone of the Maokou Formation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","54","Coal","Basalt - Calcite - Chlorite minerals - Geochemistry - Kaolinite - Lime - Limestone - Minerals - Pyrites - Quartz - Sulfide minerals - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Volcanoes","Chamosite - Emeishan basalts - High temperature - Late permian coal - Longtan Formation - Modes of occurrences - Volcanic eruptions - Yunnan province","481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 524 Solid Fuels - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 800015U4, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 40725008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40930420, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 40930420 and 40725008 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China ( 800015U4 ).

The structure and kinematics show that the shear zone comprises mainly of mylonitic gneiss-migmatite and schist with a dextral-dominated strike-slip motion in an N-S trending northern segment, and a sinistral strike-slip shear in NW-SE trending middle and southern segments. Both were developed under a bulk, regional-scale sinistral transpression. SHRIMP and LA-ICPMS U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar dating reveal two Tertiary magmatic events along the zone, followed by younger sinistral strike-slip shear. The Eocene magmatic event (c. 55-38Ma), followed by metamorphism at c. 36Ma, happened before the strike-slip motion. The strike-slip shear along the zone began c. 32Ma, which generated shear heating from 32 to 22Ma. The 40Ar/39Ar ages of syn-kinematic micas, range from 19 to 14Ma, and indicate that the strike-slip shear continued to this time with coeval transpressional exhumation and uplift of the metamorphic rocks along the Biluoxueshan-Chongshan chain. The Chongshan zone is thus a Cenozoic shear zone, which was contemporaneous with motion on the left-lateral Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone and the right-lateral Gaoligong shear zone, and should be important in accommodating the northwards movement of India during collision. During Oligocene to Miocene times, the continental block that was extruded between the Ailao Shan-Red River and Gaoligong shear zones was dismembered into at least two major fragments by the Chongshan shear zone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","89","Kinematics","Geochronology - Lead alloys - Metamorphic rocks - Mica - Structural geology","Continental blocks - Granitic plutons - Red River Shear Zone - Shear zone - Strain partitioning - Strike-slip motion - Transpression - Western yunnan","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: 20070420065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 40802050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are specifically grateful to Prof. Philippe H.

At a baking temperature of 230, the coffee was sampled at different baking times. Two analysis methods were used. Specifically, method one involved the simultaneous distillation and extraction of volatile components, and utilized gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze volatile components in Yunnan Arabica coffee. Method two involved headspace direct sampling with GC-MS analysis. The data in this study were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, and by cluster analysis. In the first method, a total of 160 kinds of volatile compounds were analyzed, and in the second method, 15 volatile compounds were analyzed. The data revealed that after baking for 6 min at 230, volatile components such as 2-methyl pyrazine, furfuryl alcohol, 5-methyl-furan-aldehyde, and 2-ethyl-5-methyl-pyrazine were produced. Changes in the identity of the volatile components and their content in coffee were significant with increased baking time. According to the cluster analysis, coffee roasting time could be divided into four categories, and it could be used as a way to identify degree of coffee roasting. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

Firstly, a CSDWHS with double water tanks installed in Yuxi, Yunnan Province was tested from 0:00 on 31 October 2015 to 8:00 on 1 November 2015 and from 0:00 on 3 November 2015 to 8:00 on 4 November 2015. Then, thermal performance indices (i.e., energy collected, daily useful energy gain, solar fraction, collector efficiency, system efficiency, system heat-loss factor, and average heat-loss factor) were analyzed to compare the thermal performance according to field-testing data. The results show that the system heatloss factor of the CSDWHS with a single water tank is lower than that with double water tanks, but the average heat-loss factor is higher, so it is difficult to conclude which system exhibits better thermal performance. Still, if real-estate developers do not emphasize cost and if there is enough roof space to place two water tanks, a CSDWHS with double water tanks is a feasible choice because it can store more heat to supply hot water for rainy or cloudy days. The results obtained in this study are useful for designers to optimize the design of a CSDWHS. © 2016 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.","20","Water tanks","Collector efficiency - Heat losses - Heating equipment - Hot water distribution systems - Water","Domestic water heating - Loss factor - Performance analysis - Solar fraction - Solar hot water systems - System efficiency - Thermal Performance - Yunnan province","446.1 Water Supply Systems - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 702.3 Solar Cells",,"Number: 2011FZ024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51268020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51268020 and the Applied Basic Research Program Foundation of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2011FZ024",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Zircon U-Pb dating of two samples yield the ages of 214Ma and 212Ma, indicating that the volcanic rocks were the productions of Late Triassic magmatic activity.

It has been widely concerned by the geologists because it hosts a large amount of Pb-Ag-Au polymetallic deposits and is special intraplate tectonic location. Although the previous researchers mainly concentrated on the mineral deposits with main study of metal state and material sources, petrology and geochemistry etc., there are few studies on the volcanic edifice. This study carried out an investigation over the alkali-rich volcanic rocks in Yao'an using petrography and profile measurement. One complete volcanic edifice is divided: subvolcanic facies (orthophyre contained agglomerates), volcanic-sedimentary facies (tuffaceous conglomerate and sandstone), and volcanic eruption facies. Among them, the volcanic eruption facies are subdivided into the effusion subfacies (ignimbrite and pseudoleucite trachyte) and the explosive subfacies (trachytic ignimbrite contained breccia and agglomerates). Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb dating was also conducted for the Laojiezi rich alkali trachytic tuff and ignimbrite, yielding two206Pb/238U weighted average ages of 33.63±0.50Ma and 33.27±0.38Ma.

The Zhaotong large-size Pb-Zn deposit is one of the representatives of these deposits. The major minerals of the Huize-type lead-zinc deposits are commonly characterized by zonation, i.e., coarse-grained pyrite+a little puce sphalerite→brown sphalerite+galena+ferrodol¬omite→galena+sandy beige and faint yellow sphalerite+quartz+calcite → fine-grained pyrite+dolomite+calcite from the floor to the roof of the ore bodies. The ore-forming mechanism of the pattern is one of the key scientific issues in the study of the evolution process of the ore-forming fluid driven by structure. This paper, demonstrating the Zhaotong Pb-Zn deposit as a case study, has studied the controlling mechanism of oxygen-sulfur fugacity for the main metal sulfide assemblages and mineral zoning. It will contribute to understand the forming mechanism of paragenesis and separation of lead and zinc. logfo2-logfs2phase diagrams for the lead, zinc, iron sulfides and oxides under equilibrium in the relevant hydrothermal system have been re-constructed on the basis of the test results of fluid inclusions and the results of rock and ore appraisal. The calculated results and the phase diagrams indicated that the fo2and fs2conditions of the transport and precipitation in which the various kinds of minerals and their assemblages formed, and the processes and mechanism of the metallic mineral zoning have been discussed. Taking the 473 K phase diagram as example, the stable logfo2-logfs2ranges of the 16 kinds of minerals and their assemblages and the block distribution are analyzed. It is shown that metallic mineral zoning and the lead-zinc paragenesis and separation of the deposit was resulted from the variation of fo2and fs2. With the decrease of the temperature, the values of fo2and fs2required for mineral precipitation also decreased. The results of the theoretic calculation and the phase diagrams are consistent with both macro-geological and micro-geological characteristics of the lead-zinc mineralization. ©, 2014, Science Press.

And also, the shale gas reservoirs were investigated by XRD, high pressure mercury intrusion, gas absorption and scanning electron microscope. Besides the above methods, isothermal absorption is also used to evaluate the favorable area in the study area. The results show that: (1)the black shales are distributed in the lower segment of Longmaxi Formation, and the average thickness is more than 30 m and it gradually increases from southeast to northwest in the study area. With Yanjin and Daguan counties as the center, the burial depth of strata increases outward. (2)Regionally, TOC of shale increases from south to north, and it is more than 2% in the northwest of Yanjin and the north of Weixin. Vertically, TOC of shale is more than 2% in lower segment of Longmaxi Formation, but less than 1% in the upper segment of Longmaxi Formation. The measured average vitrinite reflectance of shales is 3.6%, showing that the shales are at the over-mature stage. (3)The shales have more brittle minerals in the study area, so the reservoirs are easy to be artificially fractured. Compared with the major gas shales in the north American, clay mineral contents are higher but brittle minerals (quartz, et al.) and carbonate minerals (calcite, et al.) are less in the study area. (4)Mercury injection experiments show that the pores are mainly transition pores and micro pores, but the pore opening degree decreases from the bottom to top in the Longmaxi Formation. Liquid nitrogen adsorption experiments indicate that pores with diameters less than 20nm are better developed in the transition pores and micro pores. Moreover, the two ends of pores are open, with the shapes of cylinders, cones, parallel plates, and a certain amount of flask pores. Measured pore specific surface area is 6.479-17.329cm2/g, with the mean of 11. 425cm2/g. The pore volume is 0.006-0.016cm3/g. The pore average size is 3.256-4.367nm. (5)Isothermal adsorption experiments show that maximum absorbed gas content of the shales in Longmaxi Formation can attain 3.21cm3/g.

The arc suffered Jurassic to Cretaceous arc-continental orogenic collision and Cenozoic intracontinental strike-slip shearing. The Hongshan Cu (-Mo-Pb-Zn) deposit is potentially a large deposit and contains two ore types: 1) predominant layered skarn Cu-(Pb-Zn) ores along marble-hornfels contacts; and 2) minor crosscutting vein-type Cu-Mo mineralization. Previous research forwards a two-stage genetic model without sufficient dating evidence, supposing the skarn mineralization is related to the Triassic calc-alkalic intrusions and the vein-type mineralization related to Cretaceous quartz monzonite porphyries. Re-Os dating of molybdenite from vein-type ores and quartz monzonite porphyries and that of pyrrhotite from skarn ores are presented here to constrain the mineralization age and rebuild the genetic model. Analyses of eight molybdenite samples yield an isochron age of 79.7±3.1Ma (MSWD=9.2) for the vein-type mineralization and a model age of 81.9±1.1Ma for the quartz monzonite porphyries. Isotope data on seven pyrrhotite samples from the skarn ores yield an isochron age of 79±16Ma z(MSWD=8.4). The Re-Os ages for the two ore types are concordant within analytical errors, indicating that the Hongshan deposit was formed in the Late Cretaceous. Elevated Re contents in molybdenite (13.65 to 63.91μg/g) and extremely radiogenic initial187Os/188Os ratios in pyrrhotite (0.7673 to 0.8184; weighted average 0.796±0.038), together with elevated γOsvalues in pyrrhotite (507 to 547; average 528) imply a significant crustal component in the ore-forming materials that was likely derived from a lower crustal reservoir. Combined with the tectonic evolution of the Zhongdian area and geochemical characteristics of corresponding intrusions, the ages of mineralization obtained in this study indicate that the Hongshan deposit was formed in a post-collision setting with a genetic relationship to the emplacement of the quartz monzonite porphyry. These results provide significant new information for the study and exploration of the Late Cretaceous metallogeny in the Zhongdian area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","80","Mineralogy","Binary alloys - Copper - Copper alloys - Copper deposits - Deposits - Iron ores - Molybdenum alloys - Osmium alloys - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Tungsten alloys","Collisional - Genetic relationships - Geochemical characteristic - Metallogeny - Ore forming material - Polymetallic - Tectonic evolution - Yunnan , China","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 543.5 Tungsten and Alloys - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,"Number: 40772061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40930423, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41072069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is jointly funded by the Chinese National Natural Science Fund (41072069, 40930423 and 40772061) and the National Key Basic Research Development Program (973 Program) (2009CB421005)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Well logging data (especially natural gamma-ray), geochemical data (high concentrations of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, REE, and Ga) and mineralogical compositions (Nb(Ta)-, Zr(Hf)-, or REE-bearing minerals rarely observed), together with the volcanic lithological characteristics indicate that there are thick (1-10m, mostly 2-5m) ore beds in the lower Xuanwei Formation (late Permian) in eastern Yunann of southwestern China. The ore beds are highly enriched in (Nb,Ta)2O5(302-627ppm), (Zr,Hf)O2(3805-8468ppm), REE (oxides of La-Lu+Y) (1216-1358ppm), and Ga (52.4-81.3ppm). The ore beds are mainly composed of quartz, mixed-layer illite-smectite, kaolinite, berthierine, and albite. Four types of ore beds in the study area were identified, namely, clay altered volcanic ash, tuffaceous clay, tuff, and volcanic breccia. Preliminary studies suggest that the high concentrations of otherwise rare metals were mainly derived from the alkalic pyroclastic rocks.

Because of higher acid consumption (H2SO4250 kg/t for sandstone ore and 450 kg/t for limestone ore) and lower efficiency of liquid-solid separation, the process to handle these two types of ores has been a challenge. Although wet metallurgy can be considered, the high cost and low revenue limit this technology to be put into practice in large-scale. In order to solve this problem, a new technology combining mineral processing method with metallurgy technique is studied, which is used to process this refractory ore that consists of sandstone ore with 5.84 per cent Zn, 0.95 per cent Pb and limestone ore with 6.50 per cent Zn, 0.92 per cent Pb. The results of flotation closed-circuit tests showed that zinc and lead can effectively be recovered from two types of the ores by using the reasonable process flowsheet of flotation technology, and high-efficiency regulators and collectors simultaneously. For sandstone sample, totally 82.48 per cent Zn and 41.19 per cent Pb were recovered from the feed material.

One merit of this process flow sheet is that the zinc and lead sulfides and oxides can be recovered in the flotation cells at the different stage and make sure the concentrate products as a good feed for hydrometallurgical technology.

It was formed by the westward subduction of the Jinshajiang oceanic basin and collisional orogeny during the Mid-Late Triassic. Ore bodies are typically layered or bedded and controlled by interlayer fracture zones in the wall rocks. Based on the study of fluid inclusions, the present paper is to discuss characteristics and evolution of ore-forming fluids and to evaluate the relationship between fluid immiscibility and mineralization. According to the petrographic study, various types of fluid inclusions including predominant vapor or liquid-rich aqueous inclusions and daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions, and subordinately mono-phase liquid and organic vapor inclusions, are present in anhydrous skarn stage (I), hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II), quartz-sulfide stage (III) and calcite-sulfide stage (IV). Daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions are abundant in garnet (I), epidote (II) and especially in quartz (III). Ore-forming fluids of stage I and II have high homogenization temperatures (413-593°C and 336-498°C, respectively) and high salinities (19.1%-49.7% NaCleqand 15.7%-53.3% NaCleq, respectively). Stage III ore-forming fluid has a wide homogenization temperature range (148-398°C) and is characterized by existence of both high-salinity (35.5%-65.3% NaCleq) and low-salinity (2.1%-9.6% NaCleq) end members. Stage IV ore-forming fluid is characterized by low temperature (132-179°C) and low salinity (3.4%-10.4% NaCleq). Based on the characteristics of fluid inclusions together with geological features, fluid immiscibility (boiling) is suggested to be the main mechanism for metal precipitations in this deposit.","42","Ores","Calcite - Copper deposits - Deposits - Magnetite - Mineralogy - Organic minerals - Quartz - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Sulfur compounds - Temperature","Aqueous inclusions - Fluid inclusion - Geological features - Homogenization temperatures - Metal precipitation - Mineralization process - Petrographic studies - Yunnan","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 641.1 Thermodynamics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

There has long been controversy about the sources of ore-forming fluid in these ore deposits. Calcite is one of the gangue minerals in the ores of these ore deposits. Their δ13 (PDB) values vary from -2.1 × 10-3 to -3.5 × 10-3, and their δ18O (SMOW) values are 16.7 × 10-3 to 18.6 × 10-3. There are no obvious difference in the δ13C (PDB) values and the δ18O (SMOW) values of calcites from different ore-bodies, different occurrences and different elevations. Besides pure liquid inclusions (L) and gas-liquid inclusions with rich liquid (L+V), three-phase inclusions containing a daughter (S+L-V) and immiscible three-phase CO2 inclusions (VCO2 + LCO2 + LH2O) occur in the minerals. The homogenization temperatures of all these inclusions vary from 110°C to 400°C, and have two peaks. (87Sr/86Sr)0 ratios of these ore deposits (0.713676-0.717012) are obviously higher than those of the mantle (0.704 ± 0.002) and Emeishan basalt (0.703932-0.707818; 85 samples), and slightly higher than those of the Baizuo Formation of Huize lead-zinc ore deposits (0.70868-0.70931; 3 samples). But all these ratios are lower than the ones of the basement rocks (0.7243-0.7288; 5 samples). The (87Sr/86Sr)0 ratios of these ore deposits also show that the isotopic fractionation of Sr does not occur in the ore-forming fluid during the precipitation of minerals. So, the ore-forming fluid is homogeneous and a product of different fluid mixing. Gas-liquid inclusions can be obviously separated into two groups in the range of 300-400°C according to their salinities: a group with the salinity of 5%-6% (w(NaCl)) and the other group with the salinity of 12%-16% (w(NaCl)). However, the salinities of inclusions vary from 7% to 23% (w(NaCl)) in the range of 100-300°C, especially the range of 150-250°C. The pressures of faulted zones are 50 × 105-320 × 105 Pa and the pressures of overlying rocks on the ore bodies are 574 × 10-640 × 105 Pa, and those of the ore-forming processes vary from 145 × 105 to 754 × 105 Pa. When the ore-forming fluid flows into the faulted zones, its pressure sharply reduces. Then boiling occurs in the ore-forming processes. As a result of fluids mixing and boiling, the ore-forming fluid is highly concentrated. When the fluid is saturated or oversaturated, metallic minerals begin to precipitate on a great scale. So, the grade of lead-zinc ores is very high.","29","Ore deposits","Fractionation - Inclusions - Mixing - Rocks - Salinity measurement - Saturation (materials composition)","Basement rocks - Emeishan basalt - Faulted zones - Fluid mixing - Homogenization - Huize lead zinc deposits - Lead zinc ores - Ore forming fluid","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 504 Mines and Mining, Metal - 505 Mines and Mining, Nonmetallic - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Applications (APP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This study mainly investigates the how the zonal vegetation evergreen broad-leaved forests as well as widely distributed vegetation Pinus yunnanensis forest and shrubland in the Central Yunnan Plateau adapt to fire, and addresses the role of fire in the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem to determine whether this ecosystem is fire-dependent. Re-sprouting trees and shrubs composed about 90.6% of the dominant taxa. In re-sprouting species, 41 species (77.4% of all re-sprouting species) were observed re-sprout from underground basal burls after a fire. After a fire, 100% of all trees and tall shrubs, 93.6% of all shrubs and 73.9% of all herbs recovered. Two serotinous tree taxa were found, including two varieties of P. yunnanensis (var. pygmaea and var. yunnanensis) which is a dominant and the most common tree species in this region. All these were identified here as weakly serotinous species. The degree of serotiny was 50.4% for P. yunnanensis var. yunnanensis and 74.7% for var. pygmaea. Heat shock resulted in higher seed germination rates for both varieties of P. yunnanensis. Dominant and common taxa in these two typical forest types had typical traits of species known to be adapted to fire; forest fire did not significantly reduce number of species. Based on the above results, the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem is a fire-dependent system. Wildfire plays an important role in the community assembly for the semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests, P. yunnanensis forest and shrub communities. Wildfire should not be viewed as a totally catastrophic event in forests of the Central Yunnan Plateau. In theory this region appropriates to carry out prescribed burning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","63","Fires","Biodiversity - Deforestation - Ecosystems - Fire hazards - Reforestation - Seed - Value engineering - Vegetation","Evergreen broad-leaved forests - Heat-shock - Post fire regeneration - Serotiny - Wildfire","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 911.5 Value Engineering - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection",,"Number: 31160092, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The National Natural Science Foundation ( 31160092 ) supported this research.

To discuss the seismogenic structure and distribution of sequences of Jinggu Ms6.6 earthquake, 7 October 2014, we relocated the mainshock by using the 3D velocity model of Yunnan and Sichuan province (Loc3dSB), and then relocated the sequences during 7th to 31th October 2014 using the double-difference relocation algorithm, by using and phase data from seismic network of Yunnan province. Furthermore the focal mechanism solutions are derived by using P-wave polarity first-motion and amplitude ratio method. The sequences appear to be strike-slip type mostly, with the principal compressive stress axis trends both NNE and NE directions. And the sequences are distributed dominantly linearly shaped in the NW direction with its southeast endpoint appears deeper than northwest. Both of which indicate that the early major rupture plane is the NW nodal plan, appears to be a right-lateral strike-slip faulting with a small normal component. Meanwhile the linearly shaped distribution and focal mechanisms varies with locations on different segments, with clear end-points and transform segment. Furthermore, aftershocks at SE end-point expand gradually to new geometrically unclear segment, which may indicate another rupture. ©, 2015, China University of Geosciences.

Results from the analysis indicate that the interannual variability of May precipitation in Yunnan is significantly modulated by the BOB-TP thermal configuration. Model runs with a linear baroclinic model suggest physical consistency. The thermal conditions over the BOB mainly impact the May precipitation anomaly in Yunnan via changes in water vapor transport from the eastern BOB northeastward to southwestern Yunnan. The second factor influencing precipitation anomalies relates to the characteristics and variability of cold air transport from the TP to northeastern Yunnan. When the BOB (the TP) is occupied by positive (negative) diabatic heating, a thermal gradient with a warmer (colder) center over the BOB and a colder (warmer) center over the TP is established, and more-than-normal (less than normal) precipitation in Yunnan will occur in May. This relationship can persist from April to the following May to some extent; therefore, the BOB-TP thermal configuration in April could be used to forecast May precipitation in Yunnan. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","62","Climate change","Climate models - Climatology - Feedback","Asia - Climate variability - Indian ocean - Interannual variability - Large scale motion","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 731.1 Control Systems",,"Number: 41565002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Prof. M.

Based on the data of the above focal mechanism solutions, we adopt the method of damped regional-scale stress inversion to calculate the best-fitting tectonic stress tensor of every grid in Yunnan; and adopt the method of maximum principal stress to calculate the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress in Yunnan. The result shows that: (1) the strike-slip type is the most principal type of the earthquake focus in the study area and the second is the normal faulting type; while, the reverse-fault type is relatively small. The spatial distribution of focal mechanism is obvious. This reflects that the dynamic source and acting force are different in different parts of the study area. (2) The direction of the stress field in Yunnan shows a certain spatial continuity. Maximum horizontal principal compressive stress is mainly clockwise from north to south and counterclockwise from the west to the east. The direction of stress field shows inhomogeneity in space. There exist two stress conversion zones respectively in EW and NS direction. The inversion result of stress field shows that the stress field in Yunnan is complex and the principal stress direction changes greatly; and there are obvious differences in different regions. © 2017, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.
