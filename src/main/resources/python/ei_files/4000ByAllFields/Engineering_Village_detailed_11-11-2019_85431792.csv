However, the long calculation time can not satisfy the real-time performance. In this paper, an improved algorithm is proposed firstly. Then, the GPU parallel computing is adopted to accelerate our algorithm. Finally, some experiments were carried to validate the improved algorithm. Through the experiments, it shows that the improved algorithm is up to 13 times faster than the original algorithm on average when the triangles' number increases to 2 million and the acceleration times will also increase when much more triangles are detected at the same time and however the algorithm is also stable. © 2015 IEEE.","","14","Computation theory","Automation","Calculation time - Collision detection - GPU parallel computing - Intersection test - Original algorithms - Projection theory - Real time performance - Two-dimensional tests","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The uncompensated system is affected by disturbances appearing at the input voltage as well as in the load current. To mitigate the effect of these disturbances some sort of control scheme is necessary to be added to the system for stable operation and robustness of the system. The introduction of control scheme into the feedback path of the converter system enables it to cope with the issue of disturbances. The frequency domain performance measure parameters i.e. gain margin, phase margin and crossover frequency give fair idea about the stability and overall performance of the system. But the analysis of the system only via simulation is not sufficient for most applications. In many cases the actual circuit is affected by parasitic elements and electromagnetic interference. Therefore measurement of the loop gain of the system is necessary to ensure the system's stable operation. In this work modeling of DC-DC buck converter system is done in Matlab. The results for uncompensated system, controller and compensated system are obtained. Before the implementation of prototype Saber is used for schematic simulation of the system. The simulation in Saber gives a fair idea about the performance of the actual system. Finally based on the system modeled, a prototype is implemented and frequency response measurements are done using network analyzer. The measurement results agree with simulation results and system is able to achieve the targeted values of phase margin and crossover frequency. © 2015 IEEE.","","6","DC-DC converters","Automation - Electric inverters - Electromagnetic pulse - Frequency response - MATLAB - Shape memory effect - Standby power systems - Switched mode power supplies","Cross-over frequencies - DC-DC buck converter - Frequency response measurement - Loop gains - Performance measure - Phase margins - Schematic simulation - Uncompensated systems","701 Electricity and Magnetism - 703.1 Electric Networks - 704.1 Electric Components - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Its implementation requires a separate Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with the necessary hardware, and there is still a constant offset in the reference tracking. In previous work, authors proposed a controller 'matrix' based on Internal Model Principle to achieve synchronization control for three-phase inverters with balanced loads; and the proposed system does not need PLL, including its corresponding hardware. This paper presents the design and performance analysis of the proposed controller for voltage tracking, considering different plant models with unbalanced loads. Furthermore, robust stability analysis is performed to define robustness boundary, and robust performance analysis is conducted to specify performance limit of the controller with respect to unstructured uncertainty in the plant. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in assuring robust, offset-free, voltage vector tracking for distributed three-phase inverters. © 2015 IEEE.","","16","Electric inverters","Automation - Controllers - Hardware - Locks (fasteners) - Phase locked loops - Robust control - Synchronization - Uncertainty analysis","Internal model principle - Optimal controls - Robust controller design - Robust performance analysis - Robust stability analysis - Synchronization control - Unstructured uncertainty - Voltage tracking","605 Small Tools and Hardware - 713.5 Electronic Circuits Other Than Amplifiers, Oscillators, Modulators, Limiters, Discriminators or Mixers - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 732.1 Control Equipment - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Autoencoder is a major branch of deep learning. It has been used in many applications as the method to exact features for its ability to represent the input data. Applying autoencoder to image denoising has been achieved good performance. Further research was deployed to find that autoencoder method is relatively robust compared with BM3D.

Most of these methods make use of several snapshots in the array to provide an accurate result but their performance is commonly degraded when only a single snapshot is available. An improved ESPRIT algorithm to the problem of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation from single temporal observation of a uniform linear array is proposed. Since the spatial samplings of an incident signal can be considered as the temporal samplings of an exponential signal, the autocorrelation lags of spatial samplings can be estimated using the inverse-DFT of 'power density spectrum'. We use narrow-band approximation around the peaks of the spectrum to decrease the influence of noise.

In the real communication network, continuous transmission may lead some transmission lines of this original network to be damaged such that communication network cannot be used. The problem that we consider is how to add other transmission lines to construct a more survivable communication network to service well. In details, we consider the constrained arborescence augmentation problem (CAA, for short) as follows. For a given weighted digraph (or network) D = (V, A; w;Tr), where w:A → R+, is a weighted function and Tr (V, Ar) is an arborescence rooted at r in D, we are asked to find an arc-subset A′ from A-Ar such that there exists still an arborescence in the new digraph D′ = (V, Ar ∪ A′-{a}) for each arc a Ar, the objective is to minimize the total weight w(A′) = ∼eA′ w(e). In this paper, we prove that the CAA problem still remains NP-hard, whose proof follows from a reduction from the 3-dimensional matching. In addition, we present an optimal combinatorial algorithm in O(m + n log n) time to solve this problem for special version where an arborescence in digraph D′ = (V, Ar ∪ A′-{a}) still has its fixed root r, for each arc a Ar. © 2017 IEEE.","","10","Problem solving","Argon - Directed graphs - Electric lines - Graph theory - Optimization","3-dimensional - arbores-cence - Augmentation problems - Combinatorial algorithm - Minimum weight - NP-hard - Weighted digraph - Weighted function","706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of diverse biologic processes, little is known about miRNAs and targets that underlie in the kidney and glomerular development. Here we define the miRNA and target expression pattern in glomerular development from embryonic stage to mature stage by using miRNA, mRNA array, bioinformatics, and molecular techniques. The results indicate that in comparison to developed glomeruli, miRNAs are differently expressed in developing glomeruli, and therefore, this could clearly separate subtype of immature and mature glomeruli. The targets predicted from miRNAs were further compared with genes that were analyzed from mRNA array data. A total of 1264 genes, whose function being relevant to cellular development, was shared in both miRNA and mRNA data. Finally, miR-222 and target gene NPM1 were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and western blotting (WB).

The results showed that the bilingual teaching could not significantly affect the learning of diagnostic specialized knowledge and most students should have a positive attitude to the learning of diagnostics with the bilingual teaching. It is believed that the bilingual teaching of diagnostics should be helpful in improving student’s practical ability in the specialized foreign language to make them adapt the need in teaching, scientific research, and foreign exchange in the future, paraphrasing the same knowledge in a different thinking way and raising student’s innovation ability.

The 3D binary map series (BMS) generated by PCNN effectively describes image feature information such as edges and regional distribution, so BMS can be treated as the basis of extracting 1D oscillation time series (OTS) for an image. However, the traditional methods using BMS did not consider the correlation of the binary sequence in BMS and the space structure for every map. By further processing for BMS, a novel facial feature extraction method is proposed. Firstly, consider the correlation among maps in BMS; a method is put forward to transform BMS into frequency map series (FMS), and the method lessens the influence of noncontinuous feature regions in binary images on OTS-BMS. Then, by computing the 2D entropy for every map in FMS, the 3D FMS is transformed into 1D OTS (OTS-FMS), which has good geometry invariance for the facial image, and contains the space structure information of the image. Finally, by analyzing the OTS-FMS, the standard Euclidean distance is used to measure the distances for OTS-FMS. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of OTS-FMS in facial recognition, and it shows better recognition performance than other feature extraction methods. © 2016 Rencan Nie et al.","","17","Binary images","Binary sequences - Extraction - Face recognition - Feature extraction - Neural networks - Space applications - Space platforms","Euclidean distance - Facial feature extraction - Facial recognition - Feature extraction methods - Image features - Pulse coupled neural network - Regional distribution - Space structure","655.1 Spacecraft, General - 656 Space Flight - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

OWL is applicable to the description and modeling on the semantic aspects of complex data, and it can establish a flexible semantic model when a lot of complicated structures and rich semantic data are often derived in the development process of software system. All software engineering data systems are managed in modes. OWL, as an ontology language, has been widely valued in the IT industry. However, the development of OWL has been seriously restricted because it is difficult to understand. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","","6","Ontology","Birds - Complex networks - Digital storage - Industrial applications - Models - Software engineering","Complicated structures - Development process - Ontology language - Semantic descriptions - Semantic Model - Semantic Web technology - Software engineering data - Web ontology language","903 Information Science - 902.1 Engineering Graphics - 822 Food Technology - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing - 723.1 Computer Programming - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 461 Bioengineering and Biology - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Water development infrastructures are increasingly being constructed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, which is a major concern considering its potential impact on Tonle Sap Lake. This study aimed to investigate variations in the area of the lake and discuss their possible linkage to runoff alterations in the Lancang River (Upper Mekong) by comparing runoff at the Yunjinghong hydrological station before and after significant changes in runoff trends that occurred in 2008. First, four commonly used water body extraction methods (MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, and EVI) were compared and MNDWI was found to provide a better and more stable performance. Based on MOD09A1 data, MNDWI was used to extract the water area of the lake from 2000 to 2014, and characteristics of variations in the area before and after 2008 were analyzed. The water area of Tonle Sap Lake displayed an overall decreasing trend, and specifically decreased by 8.3% during the flood season and by 1.5% on average during the dry season after 2008. Seasonal variations in the water area of Tonle Sap Lake were dominantly influenced by runoff from the Mekong River. Compared with the period 2000-2007, runoff at Yunjinghong station were increased during the dry season (20.74%) and decreased during the flood season (34.25%) between 2008 and 2014. Changes in upstream runoff contributed to runoff at the Stung Treng station in the lower Mekong River by 6.17% (dry season) and -2.41% (flood season). Evidently, the operation of dams in the Lancang River does not primarily account for the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake during the flood season. In contrast, runoff increase during the dry season mitigates the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake to a certain extent. © 2018 by the authors.","","62","Extraction","Drought - Floods - Lakes - Rivers - Runoff","Mekong River - Mekong river basins - MODIS - Seasonal variation - Stable performance - Tonle saps - Water index - Water-body extractions","444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: 41661099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFA0601601) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41661099).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is well known that the resulting Bayesian estimations and tests may be sensitive to these assumptions and observations. To this end, a Bayesian local influence procedure is proposed to assess the effect of various perturbations to the individual observations, priors, estimating equations (EEs) and missing data mechanism in general EEs with nonignorable missing data. A perturbation model is introduced to simultaneously characterize various perturbations, and a Bayesian perturbation manifold is constructed to characterize the intrinsic structure of these perturbations. The first- and second-order adjusted local influence measures are developed to quantify the effect of various perturbations. The proposed methods are adopted to systematically investigate the tenability of nonignorable missing mechanism assumption, the sensitivity of the choice of the nonresponse instrumental variable and the sensitivity of EEs assumption, and goodness-of-fit statistics are presented to assess the plausibility of the posited EEs.

Pumping the microfluid by a continuous wave laser with a wavelength of 532 nm along the fiber axis, the fluorescent spectra from the channel filled with lower refractive index (RI) dye solution are obtained. Due to the fact that the evanescent field of the pump beam is homogeneous around fiber, the fluorescent emission from the rim of fiber is uniform. It is found experimentally that the fluorescent emission intensity decreases with the axial distance of fiber, and the intensity is very sensitive to the RI of the dye solution and the dye concentration. For the dye solution with a large RI, the emitted fluorescent intensity attenuates along the fiber axis more obviously than that of the dye solution with a small RI. For the high dye concentration solution, the emitted fluorescent intensity attenuates along the fiber axis also more significantly than that of the low dye concentration solution. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a uniform fluorescence radiation along the fiber axis by selecting a suitably smaller RI and a lower dye concentration solution. The observed experimental phenomena are well explained based on the mechanism of evanescent wave pumping fluorescent radiation. Based on the features of fluorescent emission in the microfluidic chip, a PDMS chip with three micro-channels is designed and fabricated. After injecting ethanol solutions of rhodamine 640, rhodamine B and rhodamine 6 G separately into the three channels and pumpingthese solutions by evanescent wave along the optical fiber axis, three fluorescence emissions with different wavelength ranges are successfully observed in a single PDMS chip. © 2017 Chinese Physical Society.","","26","Fluorescence","Continuous wave lasers - Dies - Electromagnetic wave reflection - Evanescent fields - Fluidic devices - Microchannels - Microfluidics - Optical fiber fabrication - Optical fibers - Polydimethylsiloxane - Pumping (laser) - Refractive index - Silicones","Evanescent wave - Fluorescence emission - Fluorescence radiations - Fluorescent intensity - Fluorescent light sources - Fluorescent radiation - Microfluidic chip - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates","534.1 Foundries - 632.2 Hydraulic Equipment and Machinery - 632.5.1 Microfluidics - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 744.1 Lasers, General - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers",,"Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 11404282, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61465014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11404282, 61465014), the Chinese Academy of Sciences "Light of West China" Program, and the Young Backbone Teachers Training Program of Yunnan University, China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To increase the life of WSN, each sensor node has to transmit the queuing data efficiently and conserve its energy, how to share the query of transmission for the collected information of sensor nodes becomes a new problem. Based on polling scheme with the unique characteristics of contention-free of access, this paper presents an efficient strategy of priority polling scheme which consists of a key node and N common nodes, provided with exhaustive service and limited-1 service in discrete time respectively. By the embedded Markov chain theory and the probability generation function method, we give closed form expressions for obtaining the mean queue length and the mean waiting time characteristics of the sensor nodes, and the analytical results are verified through extensive computer simulations. The performance results reveal that this new scheme can be enrolled in design of MAC protocols to improve the efficiency of data transmission and reduce unnecessary energy consumption for sensor nodes, and it can be used for differentiating priority service to guarantee better QoS in WSN.","","15","Sensor nodes","Energy efficiency - Energy utilization - Markov processes - Medium access control - Queueing theory - Wireless sensor networks","Exhaustive service - Limited-1 service - Mean queue lengths - Mean waiting time - Polling schemes","525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the existing design procedure of the CNF control for multivariable systems, the nonlinear function is given by an m dimensional matrix in a diagonal form, where m is the number of system inputs. However, the inputs and the outputs of the system are coupled heavily in many cases. Thus, it is very difficult to tune the nonlinear functions of the diagonal matrix in the design of the CNF control. This paper proposes a more efficient design procedure for the CNF control by using the structure information of the system in a special coordinate basis (SCB) form. The proposed design procedure gives a clear map on how to select the structure of the nonlinear feedback gain, and how to tune the nonlinear functions in the CNF control.","","15","Nonlinear feedback","Functions - Linear systems - Matrix algebra - Multivariable systems - Structural design - Surface discharges","Composite nonlinear feedback control - Design of composites - Diagonal matrices - Input saturation - Multivariable linear systems - Nonlinear fedback - Nonlinear functions - Structure information","408.1 Structural Design, General - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Secondly, with the purpose of relaxing and even overcoming the restriction of initial conditions of the agents owing to collision avoidance, we introduce the inter-agent potential functions into the design. Finally, convergence guarantees are provided by using tools from LaSalle's invariance principle.

The algorithm defines an appropriate replica distribution with the objective to decrease the number of object access operations over excessive distances, balance the load of popular web servers, and then minimize the network traffic of the object. Object deletion in a distributed web-server environment is one of the possible solutions to extend available memory and reduce the load of the server.
