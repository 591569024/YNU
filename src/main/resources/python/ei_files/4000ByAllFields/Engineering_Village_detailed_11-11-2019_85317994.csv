Through the accelerated corrosion test of AerMet100 steel, the corrosion morphology under different corrosion ages was obtained. Based on MATLAB software, median image filtering, grayscale transformation and fuzzy enhancement are used to preprocess the corrosion image. Then the fractal theory was used to determine the optimal grayscale threshold for the corrosion image of AerMet100 steel. Then the binary image processing technology was used to extract the features and calculate the corresponding degree of corrosion damage. In the accelerated corrosion of 3a and 6a, the corrosion morphology of AerMet100 steel was pitting corrosion, and the corrosion damage was lighter; thereafter, it gradually developed into uniform corrosion, and the corrosion damage was aggravated. For the specimens with different corrosion ages, the fractal theory can be used to obtain the corresponding optimal grayscale threshold and the corresponding fractal dimension. In the initial stage of corrosion, the corrosion damage degree of the specimen increases rapidly with the increase of the corrosion time. In the later period of corrosion, the increase of the corrosion damage tends to be gentle. Based on image analysis technology, it can provide reference for corrosion damage characterization and evaluation of AerMet100 steel. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","19","Steel corrosion","Binary images - Bridge decks - Composite materials - Damage detection - Fractal dimension - Image analysis - Image enhancement - MATLAB - Median filters - Pitting","Accelerated corrosion - Accelerated corrosion tests - Corrosion damage - Corrosion morphology - Degree of corrosion - Fuzzy enhancement - Matlab- software - Uniform corrosion","401.1 Bridges - 539.1 Metals Corrosion - 703.2 Electric Filters - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The test results show that the liquid metal mercury is rapidly deformed by the electromagnetic field. The greater the magnetic induction intensity is, the stronger the deformation is. The greater the pulse discharge current is, the more obvious the mercury deformation is. The deformation measurement result conforms to the basic theory of the electromagnetic field.

Firstly, the handwritten new Tai Lue characters are preprocessed, and then the features of these characters are extracted. Furthermore, the feature set is optimized by Sequential floating backward selection to get a new feature set with small size. Finally, SVM is used to train and test the handwritten new Tai Lue characters with the optimal parameters which obtained by Cross-Validation method.

In the study of specific target landmarks, the most appropriate scale for images can be attained by scale conversion, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of feature identification and classification. In this paper, the authors carried out experiments on multi-scale classification by taking the Shangri-la area in the north-western Yunnan province as the research area and the images from SPOT5 HRG and GF-1 Satellite as date sources. Firstly, the authors upscaled the two images by cubic convolution, and calculated the optimal scale for different objects on the earth shown in images by variation functions. Then the authors conducted multi-scale superposition classification on it by Maximum Likelyhood, and evaluated the classification accuracy. The results indicates that: (1) for most of the object on the earth, the optimal scale appears in the bigger scale instead of the original one. To be specific, water has the biggest optimal scale, i.e. around 25-30m; farmland, grassland, brushwood, roads, settlement places and woodland follows with 20-24m. The optimal scale for shades and flood land is basically as the same as the original one, i.e. 8m and 10m respectively. (2) Regarding the classification of the multi-scale superposed images, the overall accuracy of the ones from SPOT5 HRG and GF-1 Satellite is 12.84% and 14.76% higher than that of the original multi-spectral images, respectively, and Kappa coefficient is 0.1306 and 0.1419 higher, respectively. Hence, the multi-scale superposition classification which was applied in the research area can enhance the classification accuracy of remote sensing images. © 2017 SPIE.","","13","Image enhancement","Image classification - Remote sensing - Spectroscopy","Classification accuracy - Feature identification - High resolution image - High resolution remote sensing images - Multi-scale - Optimal scale - Remote sensing classification - Remote sensing images",,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is therefore crucial to evaluate new-YRD's sustainability by studying industrial CO2 emission efficiency (ICEE) at city level. To this end, we employ a parametric distance function approach to evaluate the ICEE of 26 cities in YRD and analyze its space-time evoluation during 2006-2015 based on the GIS visualization method.

In our model, we divided the type of coal and gas outbursts into four grades regarded as four normal populations. We then obtained the corresponding discriminant functions through training a set of data from engineering examples as learning samples and evaluated their criteria by a back substitution method to verify the optimal properties of the model. Finally, we applied the model to the prediction of coal and gas outbursts in the Yunnan Enhong Mine. Our results coincided completely with the actual situation.

At home level, the annual per-capita electric energy consumption ranges between 0 and 150 kWh in rural areas, where 83% of the population reside. This is well below the 250 kWh recommended by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as the threshold for exiting rural 'Energy Poverty'. Some governments have tried to extend the grid to such areas but these efforts have not yielded much. The approaches of rural electrification - as is being done now have therefore failed - and they may not be able to electrify every home in the countries concerned. An alternative approach promoting stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) and other solar powered heat and mass transfer systems at home level is proposed. An example of the approach in a village home in rural Uganda, East Africa is given. It is estimated that the combined unit energy cost over the systems' lifespan would be just about US 3 cents. Health, Education, and Sustainability in all its forms would be greatly improved. The main recommendation is for policy makers to adopt this approach for rural homes while sparing grid supply only for commercial and industrial activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","60","Rural areas","Electric utilities - Energy utilization - Mass transfer - Solar energy - Solar power generation","Combined unit - Electric energy consumption - Energy poverties - Heat and mass transfer - Industrial activities - International energy agency - Policy makers - Rural electrification","525.3 Energy Utilization - 615.2 Solar Power - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Cape Peninsula University of Technology; ","Most of this research and development work was funded by the Cape Peninsula University of Technology over a period of about 5 years through its URF mechanism.

Turbidity and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements demonstrated that the dendron showed a reversible temperature-dependent phase-transition behavior in aqueous solution and its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was lower than that of the corresponding second-generation dendron, indicating the dependence of LCSTs on the generation of dendrons. Fluorescent spectroscopy and TEM studies revealed that the dendron would self-assemble into nanospherical micelles with a very low critical micelle concentration (CMC) in water. The core-shell structure of the micelles was proved by1H NMR analyses of the micelles in D2O. The drug-loading capacity of the dendron micelles is about 29 wt % for podophyllotoxin (POD) used as a model drug, and in vitro release tests showed a desired thermoresponsive drug-release behavior.

A Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system has a quantum random number generator to protect data streams in quantum communication environments. From a cryptanalysis viewpoint, it is necessary to use statistical probability, stochastic processes and time series to evaluate quality of stationary randomness in quantum cryptographic sequrences. In this paper, a testing model is proposed to use statistical probability to illustrate multiple visual distributions on three maps for a selected random sequence. Under a shift operation to transfer the sequence into a shifted sequence, multiple segments are divided on the shifted sequence as three measuring sets to form three maps. For a given map, its maximal value is extracted from the distribution and three maximal values for the testing. Three 2D maps represent stationary random properties for the sequence under different shift operations. Conditions of station/stationary random sequences are investigated. Testing data sets are from two quantum cryptographic resources: Australian National University (ANU) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), two quantum cryptographic sequences are selected. Multiple results are created on three maps, and measurements of stationary randomness are illustrated. Using the testing system, measurements of stationary randomness are compared. There are only 0.07 ? 0.27% variation differences identified among ANU and USTC samples for testing stationary randomness. Both samples show excellent stationary properties. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","","45","Big data","Number theory - Probability distributions - Quality control - Quantum communication - Quantum cryptography - Random number generation - Random processes - Stochastic systems - Testing","Big data streams - Maximal - Ordered measures - Quantum cryptographic sequence - Segment - Shift - Stationary randomness","716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: -, Acronym: USTC, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 61362014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Thanks to National Science Foundation of China (61362014) and High Level Overseas Professional Project of Yunnan Province for financial supports to this project.

Combining the modifying backstepping approach with the pointwise integral mechanism, a differential-difference mixed-type adaptive law and an adaptive repetitive learning control one are constructed to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error in the sense of square error norm. Also, a sufficient condition of the convergence of the method is given. A simulation example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","12","Adaptive control systems","Backstepping - Learning algorithms - Lyapunov functions - Nonlinear systems","Adaptive Control - Asymptotic convergence - Back-stepping approaches - High-order nonlinear system - Lyapunov functionals - Periodically time-varying - Repetitive learning control - Time varying parameter","731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We implement an autonomous shaping reinforcement learning method by making agent can discover autonomously critical states from prior experience and use them to shape later learning. The critical state is a state that has high probability to exist in all these acyclic state trajectories that from the start state to the goal state, that means, if agent wants to reach the goal state, then it would have high likelihood to pass the critical states. So the critical states can be used to shape agent for reaching the goal state faster. The experiments on Maze problem show our method can significant improve agent's performance.

In object classification task, there are still some problems. For example, similar categories are difficult to be distinguished in images. In addition, with the increasing number of object categories, the background of scene has become another crucial issue in object classification. This paper focuses on image object recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues. Firstly, we propose a semantic refinement method that analyzes the relationship among similar categories in images from the perspective of semantic knowledge. The knowledge of the relationship between semantics comes from a wide range of open knowledge. Secondly, we utilize the knowledge graph method to create the image knowledge graph with multiple categories in images. Our method exploits the knowledge from the adjacency matrix computed on train data to merge relevant classes into graph. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale image datasets (ImageNet), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

For the fusion of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography), a novel algorithm is proposed in this paper based on LatentLRR (Latent Low Rank Representation) and gradient transfer. LatentLRR is a meaningful tool for separating out detailed information and saliency information. In order to produce saliency information fused result, image statics is used through the corresponding detailed information. For detailed information, it is separated into high frequency parts and low frequency parts by NSCT (Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform), the former are fused by the method of scale based, and the latter are merged by local energy maxima. To obtain the reconstructed image, it needs to integrate high frequency fused parts and low frequency fused parts into one image by inverse NSCT. Finally, the final image can be given by combining the reconstructed images and saliency information fused result into one image, and for a better visual effect, optimize the final result by gradient transfer. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the experiments of ten pair clinical medical images MRI/CT, the proposed algorithm receives a comprehensive advantage in preserving the detailed and gradient information, not only in visual effects but also in objective evaluation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","","37","Image fusion","Computerized tomography - Diagnosis - Image reconstruction - Inverse problems - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging","CT (computed tomography) - Image statics - LatentLRR - Low-rank representations - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Scale based - State-of-the-art methods","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 746 Imaging Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, the LUCC model was built based on GIS technology, CA (cellular automata) and Agent technology. Firstly, Landsat TM data of 2000 and 2010 are used to obtain the land use map. Based on the maps, land use change patterns can be determined as references for the LUCC model. GIS is used to obtain the spatial variables. ANN (Artificial neural network) instead of complex transformation rules is used to obtain the parameters. This method significantly simplifies the structure of the CA model and the definition of transformation rules. Cellular interactions are entirely based on spatial proximity, which cannot move. However, ABM (Agent Based Modeling) has great advantages for complex 'human-land relationship analog' and therefore, it is applied in this study. Land use change of each grid cell is determined and marked by CA model, and Agent makes the change of land use type according to the marks. The model is realized by Repast and Matlab. The LUCC model uses the land use type of 2002 initially to simulate land use type of 2010 and evaluates the accuracy of the simulation results by the Lee-Sallee index. After repeated debug processes and parameter adjustments, the optimal dynamic LUCC evolution model is determined. Based on initial land use of 2010, future land use types in 2020 of the Erhai region are predicted. © 2013 IEEE.","","4","Land use","Autonomous agents - Cellular automata - Complex networks - Computational methods - Forestry - Geographic information systems - Large scale systems - MATLAB - Neural networks","Agent-based model - ANN (artificial neural network) - Cellular interaction - Complex transformations - Land use/cover change - Land-use change - Parameter adjustments - Transformation rules","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921 Mathematics - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Sharp near band-gap luminescence is observed around 530 nm and was ascribed to radiative annihilation of free and bound excitons; the phonon replica of exciton luminescence are found between 533 and 540 nm at low temperatures. TRPL experiment reveals that near band-gap luminescence comprises fast and slow decay components and shows the different relaxation processes between free and bound exciton annihilation. Luminescence of bound excitons steeply lowers with increasing temperature and disappears about 40 K. A luminescence tail band is observed around 540 nm that is ascribed to defects in the anion sublattice. The temporal behavior of the tail band is described by rate equations very well. A broad luminescent band appears at 630 nm. The decay curves suggest that the luminescence is ascribed to the radiative recombination of donor-acceptor pairs and there are two kinds of mechanisms to control the decay. At room temperature, a luminescent band appears at the band-gap region, which shows the band-gap at room temperature is about 2.125 eV. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","","34","Mercury compounds","Excitons - Low temperature effects - Negative ions - Photoluminescence - Relaxation processes - Single crystals","Radiative annihilation","644.4 Cryogenics - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Theoretical (THR); Experimental (EXP)","Number: -, Acronym: MEXT, Sponsor: Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Sydney; ","One of the authors (X.M.

There are risks in cloud banking as a commercial bank even though cloud bank deals with intangible property. Both Cloud Bank Resource Providers (CBRP) and Cloud Bank Resource Consumers (CBRC) are concerned about liquidity. CBRP desire liquidity because they want to supply according to demands and provide uninterrupted services even though some resource pools bridge the contract and plug off the computers from the main resource reservoir. CBRC also desire liquidity because they want to customise or upgrade their requirements according to their business needs. This paper tried to identify liquidity risk and offer a dynamic solution to the liquidity risk which will help to create liquidity and lower resource fragility. © 2017 IEEE.","","14","Forecasting","Risks","Cloud bank models - Commercial bank - Dynamic solutions - Hybrid Cloud computing - Liquidity - Resource - Resource providers - Virtual infrastructures","914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Two types of unprecedented skeletons of obscurolide dimer and an obscurolide-type compound with an aromatic polyketide of pentanone substituted at the benzene ring were determined by spectral data analysis. Compound 11 was the first evidence of two nitrogens in streptazolin-type structures. Compound 1 indicated an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production in LPS-activated macrophages with an inhibition ratio of 51.7% at 50 μM, and on anticoagulant activity on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation with an inhibition ratio of 26.0 ± 9.1% at 200 μg mL-1. 11 had anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with an inhibition ratio of 27.2% at a concentration of 50 μM. Mechanistic aspects of the non-enzymatic reaction as well as a more detailed picture of the biosynthetic relationships of the streptazolin- and obscurolide-type metabolites are described. Acidic and basic conditions can inhibit the growth of Streptomyces, and γ-butyrolactones were found to be hormones controlling antibiotic production in Streptomyces. In the pH fermentation tests, acylation of γ-butyrolactones was successfully used to explain the mechanism of influence on the growth of Streptomyces. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","26","Bacteria","Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Ketones - Metabolites - Musculoskeletal system - Nitric oxide - Phospholipids - Platelets","Acetylcholinesterase activity - Activated macrophages - Antibiotic production - Anticoagulant activities - Mechanistic aspects - Platelet aggregation - Platelet-activating factors - Spectral data analysis","461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 81660582, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560571, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21562045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31660532, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research work was nancially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81560571, 21562045, 81660582, 31660532), and a project of Yunling Scholars of Yunnan Province.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To protect groundwater environmental quality and safety, the city chose tap water as recharge water, however, the high cost makes it not conducive to the optimal allocation of water resources and not suitable to popularize widely. To solve this, the city selects two major surface water of River A and B as the proposed recharge water, to explore its feasibility. According to a comprehensive analysis of the cost of recharge, the distance of the water transport, the quality of recharge water and others. Entropy weight Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method is used to prefer tap water and water of River A and B. Evaluation results show that water of River B is the optimal recharge water, if used; recharge cost will be from $0.4724/m3to $0.3696/m3. Using Entropy weight Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method to confirm water of River B as optimal water is scientific and reasonable.

The validity and accuracy of the function presented herein are demonstrated through experiments and FEM simulation. Based on the studies mentioned above, a new cable parameter estimation method which does not need FEM model of the cable is developed. The key parameters of cables such as tension, density, length and rigidity could be determined accurately by the proposed method, and the reliability and accuracy of the dynamic characteristics analysis of cables could be notably enhanced.

However, it is problematic that the geographic distributed resources owned by different institutions with their different price models, usage policies and changing load. The resource providers and resource consumers have different objects, strategies, and requirement. Meanwhile, the availability of resources and the load on them dynamically varies with time. Hence, resource management in Clouds is a complicated task. An economic-based method is presented to allocate Cloud resources, which is based on Pareto optimality theory and realizes the optimal allocation of Cloud resources. And this method can largely avoid a waste of resources and achieve equilibrium between maximizing resource providers' incomes and minimizing consumers' paying.

However, the presence of correlation (i.e. spatial correlation across several sites and time correlation within each site) poses difficulties to accurate forecasting. In this paper, a tensor-based method for geosensor data forecasting is proposed. Specifically, a tensor pattern is first introduced into modelling the geosensor data, which can take advantage of geosensor spatial-temporal information and preserve the multi-way nature of geosensor data, and then a tensor decomposition based algorithm is developed to forecast future values of time series. The proposed approach not only combines and utilizes the multi-mode correlations, but also well extracts the underlying factors in each mode of tensor and mines the multi-dimensional structures of geosensor data. Experimental evaluations on real world geosensor data validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","","18","Big data","Forecasting - Information management - Tensors","Experimental evaluation - Multi-dimensional structure - Real-world - Spatial correlations - Spatial temporals - Tensor decomposition - Time correlations - Underlying factors","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.1 Algebra",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61662086, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762090, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgement.

Due to its intensive calculation instinct, in texture-synthesis based video coding scheme, more emphases should be put on its ability of bit-rate saving, and the reduction of computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a scalable strategy for texture-synthesis based video coding methodology, which mainly focus on bit-rate and computation scalability.

The chief aim of the present work is to find a cost-effective way for residential space heating in Shanghai, one of the biggest city in south China. Economic and energy efficiency of three residential space heating ways, including ground source heat pump (GSHP), air source heat pump (ASHP) and wall-hung gas boiler (WHGB), are assessed based on Long-term measured data. The results show that the heat consumption of the building is 120 kWh/m2/y during the heating season, and the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of the GSHP, ASHP and WHGB systems are 3.27, 2.30, 0.88 respectively. Compared to ASHP and WHGB, energy savings of GSHP during the heating season are 6.2 kgce/(m2.y) and 2.2 kgce/(m2.y), and the payback period of GSHP are 13.3 and 7.6 years respectively. The sensitivity analysis of various factors that affect the payback period is carried out, and the results suggest that SEER is the most critical factor affecting the feasibility of ground source heat pump application, followed by building load factor and energy price factor. These findings of the research have led the author to the conclusion that ground source heat pump for residential space heating in Shanghai is a good alternative, which can achieve significant energy saving benefits, and a good system design and operation management are key factors that can shorten the payback period. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","8","Geothermal heat pumps","Air source heat pumps - Cost effectiveness - Energy conservation - Energy efficiency - Heating - Housing - Investments - Pumps - Sensitivity analysis - Space heating","Critical factors - Design and operations - Energy-saving benefits - Groundsource heat pump (GSHP) - Heat consumption - Payback periods - Post evaluations - Seasonal energy efficiency ratios","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 618.2 Pumps - 643.1 Space Heating - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2010DFA72740-05, Acronym: CERC, Sponsor: Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada; ","Financial support of this study by the research fund of the China-U.S. Clean Energy Research Center (CERC) under grant No. 2010DFA72740-05 is gratefully acknowledged.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Building detection results are also used for subsequent evaluation of UNB pansharpening algorithm. The building detection utilizes shadow context, color tone, size, edge features, structural and geometric features, and prior knowledge in a multi-level segmentation based building detection. It first finds shadows using both pixels based and shadow region based analysis. In the next step, multi-resolution segmentation is performed using eCognition software with Sobel edge gradient image and principal component image as additional layers. Then, shadow geometry, according to Sun's azimuth angle, is utilized to detect the positions of buildings. Finally, spurious buildings are eliminated based on prior knowledge of objects which surround the buildings e.g., bare lands and roads. The performance is evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The detection results are promising but still need modifications for real applications. Further, it also shows that UNB pansharpening performs well in applications utilizing spectral and spatial features. © 2011 IEEE.","","19","Satellite imagery","Aerial photography - Antennas - Buildings - Image fusion - Image segmentation - Principal component analysis","Automatic building detection - Building detection - High resolution satellite imagery - Multiresolution segmentation - Qualitative and quantitative analysis - shadow context - Very high spatial resolutions - VHR images","402 Buildings and Towers - 655.2 Satellites - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 742.1 Photography - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The sulfide-rich geothermal water samples were collected and immediately treated via rapid freezing technique in-situ and then detertnine the arsenic species in the lab, which is superior to the traditional methods of pretreatment and measurement of aqueous arsenic. The traditional acidification treatment of arsenic-bearing, sulfide-rich water sample inevitably results in the precipitation of tri-thioarsenate as the form of amorphous S-As compounds. Furthermore, the common use of anion-exchange column is not capable of fully collecting thioarsenic species and separating them from arsenate in-situ. Under the control of magmatic fluid input and intense fluid-rock interactions at high reservoir temperatures, the neutral to slightly alkaline hot springs discharged from the Rehai hydrothermal system are rich in sulfide and arsenic, facilitating the formation of thioarsenic species. Mono-thioarsenate, di-thioarsenate and tri-thioarsenate were detected in the Rehai hot springs with ratios to total arsenic up to 26.7%, 43.3% and 33.7%, respectively. In two sub-hydrothermal areas of Rehai, i. e. the Liuhuangtang area and the Zaotanghe area, the hot springs are distributed along the main N-S stretching faults and the secondary E-W stretching faults, respectively, and therefore the geothermal waters went through different cooling processes (adiabatic cooling and mixing with shallow cold groundwaters, respectively) prior to their discharge to the surface. Thus the hot springs from Liuhuangtang have relatively higher concentrations of sulfide and arsenic as well as various thioarsenic species. © 2017, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

The results show that concentrations of PAA and test temperatures can affect the corrosion rate obviously. The corrosion rate increases with increase of the concentration of PAA at each temperature, but the maximum corrosion rate appears at 20 °C at each same concentration of PAA.
