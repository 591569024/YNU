Optimal tracking and disturbance rejection can be designed separately. The original system is transformed into an augmented system without disturbances, thus the optimal rejection of disturbances can be treated by using the internal model principle (IMP) to secure asymptotic decay to zero of steady-state error. The nonlinear optimal output tracking control (OOTC) problem is solved by applying a successive approximating method. This reduces the nonlinear problem to a sequence of nonhomogeneous linear two-point boundary value (TPBV) problems which converge in the limit to the augmented systems considered. A simulation is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the tracking controller.","","14","Discrete time control systems","Digital control systems - Disturbance rejection - Navigation - Nonlinear systems","Discrete - time systems - Disturbance rejection problem - Internal modeling - Nonlinear discrete-time systems - Optimal tracking - Optimal tracking control - Sinusoidal disturbances - Two point boundary value problems","731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, due to the different chemical composition of biomass, the compression mechanism of biomass particles is different from other particles of coal, ceramics, metals and other materials. A comprehensive study on the compression mechanism of densified biomass fuel was carried out in this paper.

First, by using Modified Rodrigues Parameter(MRP), the kinematic and dynamic models of the rigid spacecraft are introduced. A class of sinusoidal disturbances with known frequencies but unknown amplitudes and phase angles are considered. Second, by combining a nonlinear proportional-derivative(PD) control, an adaptive control part and hyperbolic tangent function part are proposed to guarantee the globally asymptotic convergence of attitude tracking despite the presence of control input constraint, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The internal model control is utilized to identify the harmonic disturbances. The parameter uncertainty caused by the unknown inertia matrix is handled by combining the semi-tensor product and adaptive control method. In particular, the nonlinear PD control term is designed to achieve better tracking performance with shorter settling time and smaller/no overshoot. A detailed stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system is included. Finally, numerical simulation results for the rigid spacecraft show good performances, which validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed schemes. © 2015 IEEE.","","15","Navigation","Adaptive control systems - Automation - Closed loop control systems - Closed loop systems - Discrete time control systems - Disturbance rejection - Dynamic models - Harmonic analysis - Hyperbolic functions - Model predictive control - Spacecraft - Tensors - Tracking (position)","Adaptive Control - Attitude tracking - Control input constraints - Hyperbolic tangent function - Modified rodrigues parameter(MRP) - Proportional-derivative control - Semi-tensor product - Transient performance","655.1 Spacecraft, General - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In a view of the inter relationship of wavelet transform and fractal theory, the whole and local fractal exponents obtained from WT coefficients as features are presented for extracting fault signals. The effectiveness of the new algorithm used to extract the characteristic signal is described, which can be realized by the value of the fractal dimensions of those types of short-circuit fault. In accordance with the threshold value of each type of short-circuit fault in each frequency band, the correlation between the type of short-circuit and the fractal dimensions can be figured to perform extraction. This model incorporates the advantages of morphological filter and multi-scale WT to extract the feature of faults meanwhile restraining various noises. Besides, it can be implemented in real time using the available hardware.

In China, we identified a flock of sheep with black traits. In the present study, the complete coding sequences of three genes, PSPH, SNRPA1 and TPM1, of Black-boned sheep (Ovis aries) were amplified using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, according to the conserved sequence information for cattle and other mammals and known highly homologous sheep ESTs. The results showed that the Black-bonedsheep PSPH gene encodes a protein of 225 amino acids, which has high homology with the PSPH proteins of seven species: cattle (99 %), humans (94 %), rat (93 %), mouse (93 %), African clawed frog (77 %), Atlantic salmon (70 %) and zebrafish (68 %). The Black-boned sheep SNRPA1 gene encodes a protein of 255 amino acids, which has high identity with the SNRPA1 proteins of four species: cattle (99 %), humans (99 %), mouse (97 %) and chicken (91 %). The Black-boned sheep TPM1 gene encodes a protein of 284 amino acids, which has high homology with the TPM1 proteins of four species: cattle (82 %), rabbit (82 %), mouse (82 %) and humans (81 %). Using phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that the Black-boned sheep PSPH,SNRPA1 and TPM1 proteins are closely related to their cattle counterparts. The tissue expression analyses revealed that the Black-boned sheep PSPH, SNRPA1 and TPM1 genes were expressed in a range of tissues, including leg muscles, the kidneys, the skin, the longissimus dorsi muscle, the spleen, the heart and the liver.

In order to understand the formation mechanism of sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring and provide a better insight into the sulfur isotope geochemistry of the associated Rehai hydrothermal system, we investigated the spring water hydrochemistry, mineralogy and major-element geochemistry of sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring together with the sulfur-oxygen isotope geochemistry of sulfur-containing materials at the Rehai geothermal field and compared the isotope results with those in other steam-heated environments. Subaerial minerals include a wide variety of sulfate minerals (gypsum, alunogen, pickeringite, tamarugite, magnesiovoltaite and a minor Mg-S-O phase) and amorphous SiO2. The δ34S values of the subaerial sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring varied subtly from-0.33 to 1.88‰ and were almost consistent with the δ34S values of local H2S (-2.6 to 0.6‰) and dissolved SO42- (-0.2 to 5.8‰), while the δ18O values (-8.94 to 20.1‰) were between that of the spring waters (-10.19 to-6.7‰) and atmospheric O2 (~23.88‰). The results suggest that most of the sulfate minerals are derived from the oxidation of H2S, similar to many sulfate minerals from modern steam-heated environments. However, the rapid environmental change (different ratio of atmospheric and water oxygen) at the Zhenzhu Spring accounts for the large variation of δ18O. The formation of subaerial sulfate minerals around the Zhenzhu Spring is related to acid aerosols (vapour and acid water droplets). The intense activity of spring water around vents supply the aerosol with H2SO4 (H2S oxidation and acid water droplets formed by bubble bursting) and few cations. Deposition of the acid sulfate aerosol forms the acid condensate, which attacks the underlying rocks and releases many cations and anions to form subaerial sulfate minerals at the Zhenzhu Spring. © 2019 Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","","79","Sulfate minerals","Aerosols - Drops - Exploratory geochemistry - Geothermal fields - Groundwater - Hot springs - Hydrochemistry - Isotopes - Magnesium compounds - Oxygen - Positive ions - Silica - Sulfur","Acid aerosols - Almost consistent - Environmental change - Formation mechanism - Hydrothermal system - Rehai geothermal fields - subaerial environment - Tengchong","444.2 Groundwater - 481.2 Geochemistry - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The risk measurement can provide the decision-making data for the risk management and control. The traditional risk measurement method usually assesses in terms of the occurrence probability and the loss of the risk factors, which usually are assessed by experts subjectively. Therefore, they are greatly influenced by artificial factors. In this way, it is difficult to realize the objective and effective measurement. This paper proposes one risk measurement method of software development project based on information entropy, which makes up for the shortcomings of the former studies. This method makes use of information entropy to measure the amount of information so as to measure the software development project risk. In this paper, a new risk checklist is given. First of all, it obtains the risk information through the checklist. Then it obtains the information amount of risk factors by aid of information entropy. This paper concludes that the larger the information amount of the risk factors is, the larger the removed uncertainty is, the smaller the information entropy is and the smaller the risk is. In short, there is a positive correlation between risk and entropy. This paper demonstrates the scientificity and rationality of the method theoretically. Compared with other risk measurement methods, this method manifests certain advantage. The case analysis prove the rationality and feasibility of this method.","","38","Risk assessment","Behavioral research - Decision making - Information use - Risk management - Software design","Amount of information - Information entropy - Management and controls - Measurement methods - Occurrence probability - Positive correlations - Risk measurement - Software development projects","723.1 Computer Programming - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Gauging preservational bias is crucial in providing an assessment of the completeness of this biota and thereby elucidating whether it represents a comprehensive depiction of Early Cambrian life. We here present a model to explain the nature of the exceptional preservation of the Chengjiang biota and details of the decay process. This study indicates that Chengjiang fossils were preserved through two taphonomic pathways that may have captured tissues of distinct compositions, and this finding should provide a foundation for the interpretation of Chengjiang fossils. Many Chengjiang fossils are preserved by pyrite (later pseudomorphed by iron oxides); the clay-rich host sediment was deficient in organic carbon but replete in available Fe, and this composition ensured that a decaying carcass acted as a local substrate for Fe- and S-reducing bacteria. Pyrite morphology probably reflects contrasts in the decay rate, and hence the H2S production rate, of different tissues in a carcass. Reactive, rapidly decaying tissues would have quickly supplied H2S, producing many pyrite nuclei, resulting in framboidal habits. More recalcitrant tissues would have produced H2S more slowly, so that crystal growth operated on fewer nuclei, resulting in larger euhedral pyrite crystals. Reflective films, especially common on Chengjiang arthropods, represent the remains of degraded carbon. © 2004 Geological Society of America.","","26","Biodiversity","Bacteria - Iron oxides - Pyrites - Radioactivation analysis - Sediments - Tissue","Cambrian animals - Chengjiang biota","804.1 Organic Compounds - 622.4 Radioactivity Measurements - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 482.2 Minerals - 461.9 Biology - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 454 Environmental Engineering","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, according to the cost b of each Steiner point and the different costs of some specific materials with the different lengths, we study two variants of the Steiner tree problem in the Euclidean plane as follows: (1) If a specific material to construct all edges in such a Steiner tree has its infinite length and the cost of per unit length of such a specific material used is c1, the objective is to minimize the total cost of the Steiner points and such a specific material used to construct all edges in T, i.e.; min{b k1+ c1 ∑e∑ T w(e)}, where T is a Steiner tree constructed, k1is the number of Steiner points and w(e) is the length of part cut from such a specific material to construct edge e in T, and we call this version as the minimum-cost Steiner points and edges problem (MCSPE, for short). (2) If a specific material to construct all edges in such a Steiner tree has its finite length L (l ≤ L) and the cost of per piece of such a specific material used is c2, the objective is to minimize the total cost of the Steiner points and the pieces of such a specific material used to construct all edges in T, i.e.; min b k2+ c2 k3, where T is a Steiner tree constructed, k2is the number of Steiner points in T and k3is the number of pieces of such a specific material used, and we call this version as the minimum-cost Steiner points and pieces of specific material problem (MCSPPSM, for short). These two variants of the Steiner tree problem are NP-hard with some applications in VLSI design, WDM optical networks and wireless communications.

It essentially focuses on extracting or learning feature representations followed by a matching model using a distance metric. In fact, person reidentification is a difficult task because, first, no universal feature representation can perfectly identify the amount of pedestrians in the gallery obtained by a multicamera system. Although different features can be fused into a composite representation, the fusion still does not fully explore the difference, complementarity, and importance between different features. Second, a matching model always has a limited amount of training samples to learn a distance metric for matching probe images against a gallery, which certainly results in an unstable learning process and poor matching result. In this paper, we address the issues of person reidentification by the ensemble theory, which explores the importance of different feature representations, and reconcile several matching models on different feature representations to an optimal one via our proposed weighting scheme.

The presence of complex relations amongst individual series poses difficulties with respect to traditional modelling, computation and statistical theory. In this paper, we propose a method for clustering multivariate time series by using multi-relational community detection in complex networks. Firstly, a set of multivariate time series is transformed into a multi-relational network. Then, an algorithm for multi-relational community detection based on multiple nonnegative matrices factorization (MNMF) is proposed and is applied to identify time series clusters. The transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain benefits from the ability of networks to characterize both local and global relationship amongst nodes (representing data samples), while the use of MNMF can give full play to complex relations amongst individual series and preserve the multi-way nature of multivariate information.

And, how much is the holistic risk of a project? Balanced the profit gained from the project and the risk, whether is worth to develop it or not? The questions are always scabrous for the corporations and scholars researched in software engineering field. In this paper, we made creatively a definition of risk fusion, and demonstrated the rationality of risk fusion measurement by using information entropy, and developed a model of risk fusion measurement of software development based on information entropy, and answered the former problems, and also provided a model case. The model can be used to measure the risk fusion, which have been proved in practice, and can be used as basis for risk decision-making.","","14","Risk assessment","Behavioral research - Decision making - Software design - Software engineering - Systems science","In-process - Information entropy - Risk decision making - Risk factors - Risk measurement","723.1 Computer Programming - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 961 Systems Science - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that with the number of the layer increased, the band-gap shows a decreasing trend, whereas the absorption edge shows a trend of red-shift. When we put different in-layer biaxial strain from −10% compressive strain (a/a0 = 90%) to 10% tensile strain (a/a0 = 110%) on all few-layer BP layers, the electronic, optical and structural properties change. In terms of electronic property, few-layer BP shows an increasing trend of the band-gap, and at the same time, a distinct change of chemical bond has been observed. As for the optical property, an anisotropic variation of the absorption and reflectivity occurs. And for the structural property, there is a noticeable regular anisotropic change of the stacking order. In our opinion, the increasing number of layers affects band splitting around the Γ point and entire BZ, which leads to the decrease of the gap. The changing of the layer from 5 L to 1L and the strain from −10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain affect the stacking order and the change of near-band-states of few-layer BP, which further impacts the band-gap, chemical bond and its transition from metal to semiconductor of BP. Besides, the strain effect leads to the anisotropic change of the structure, which further results in the anisotropic change in the optical properties of the few-layer BP. This study implies that we can alter the function of the few-layer material by setting up the suitable strain and the number of the layer in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","33","Tensile strain","Anisotropy - Calculations - Chemical bonds - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Phosphorus - Red Shift - Structural properties","Absorption edges - Biaxial strains - Compressive strain - Computational studies - Electronic and optical properties - First-principles calculation - Number of layers - Stacking patterns","408 Structural Design - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61751405, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2018ZE023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

Our data shows that Bai speakers use prosody by lengthening the duration, expanding the pitch span, and raising the pitch maximum and minimum of the sentence-middle constituents to distinguish declarative questions from statements, regardless of focus condition. However, they vary the use of pitch span and pitch minimum with different lexical tones. These results thus suggest that sentence-medial prosody is different between statements and declarative questions in Bai. Furthermore, the modification of prosodic cues for encoding interrogativity appears to be sensitive to lexical tones in Bai. © 2018, International Speech Communications Association.

Thanks to the orthogonality, in MOP3SC, absorption of the sunlight and collection of the photocarriers can be simultaneously and independently optimized with no trade-off. Furthermore, by exploiting the degree of freedom along the photon propagation and using multi-semiconductor stripes in which the incoming photons first encounter the widest gap semiconductor, and the narrowest at last, we can convert the whole solar spectrum into electricity resulting in the high conversion efficiency. For processing MOP3SC, we have developed Clean Unit System Platform (CUSP), which turns out to be able to serve as clean versatile environment having low power-consumption and high cost-performance.

A service composition is usually implemented in either a centralized or decentralized manner. Compared with the centralized service composition, the decentralized composition has no central control component, and components interact with each other directly, thereby achieving better performance. Process partitioning is a technique to divide a process into multiple parts and has been shown that it can be successfully applied to decentralizing process-driven service compositions. This paper proposes a new process partitioning technique for constructing decentralized service compositions. The proposed technique, which is based on typed digraphs and a graph transformation technique, is used for exploring available process partitioning solutions. For applications, this paper discusses the topology and interaction features about the partitioning solutions and summarizes a ranking method for them. Three experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can be applied in constructing decentralized service compositions effectively. In addition, the results also show that the decentralized compositions can have lower average response times and higher throughputs than the corresponding centralized compositions in the experiments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","31","Web services","Graph theory - Quality of service - Websites","Central control - Decentralized compositions - Graph transformation techniques - Interaction features - Partitioning techniques - Ranking methods - Service compositions - Web service composition","921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,"Number: 2015SE101, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant 2015SE101.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

How to allocate limited channel resources reasonably and reliably to each competing user is a problem that the access protocol of the MAC (Multiple Access Control) layer needs to solve. As an important way of random access, NP-CSMA (Non Persistent Carrier Sense Multiple Access) has a higher network throughput rate when the arrival rate is higher. This paper analyzes and improves the implemented NP-CSMA model, and obtains a three-slot NP-CSMA model. The mathematical tool MATLAB is used to analyze the network throughput, delay and energy efficiency of the model, and compare several random multiple access protocols adheres to the network throughput, they are NP-CSMA, Three-slot NP-CSMA, 1-persistent CSMA, P-persistent CSMA, and concludes that the three-slot NP-CSMA is significantly letter than several other multiple access protocols. Finally, using Quartus to design the three-slot NP-CSMA circuit, the statistical value of the circuit system is compared with the theoretical value of the model, and the error is less than 0.01, which proves that the system is reasonable in design and can be applied to wireless communication networks.
