The main advantage of this method is it uses a direct mathematical approach to find system's size based on daily load consumption and average irradiation data. The keys of system design are to satisfy a pre-determined load requirement and maintain hydrogen storage's state of charge during low solar irradiation period. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study is conducted using Kuala Lumpur's generated meteorological data and rural area's typical daily load profile of 2.215 kWh. In addition, an economic analysis is performed to appraise the proposed system feasibility. The finding shows that the levelized cost of energy for proposed system is RM 1.98 kWh. However, based on sizing results obtained using a published method with AGM battery as back-up supply, the system cost is lower and more economically viable. The feasibility of PV system with hydrogen storage can be improved if the efficiency of hydrogen storage technologies significantly increases in the future. Hence, a sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the effect of electrolyzer and fuel cell efficiencies towards levelized cost of energy. Efficiencies of electrolyzer and fuel cell available in current market are validated using laboratory's experimental data. This finding is needed to envisage the applicability of photovoltaic system with hydrogen storage as a future power supply source in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","33","Hydrogen storage","Charging (batteries) - Cost benefit analysis - Costs - Digital storage - Economic analysis - Electrolytic cells - Fuel cells - Irradiation - Meteorology - Photovoltaic cells - Sensitivity analysis - Solar power generation","Economically viable - Fuel cell efficiency - Hydrogen storage technologies - Levelized cost of energies - Mathematical approach - Meteorological data - Photovoltaic systems - Stand alone photovoltaic system","522 Gas Fuels - 615.2 Solar Power - 702.1.2 Secondary Batteries - 702.2 Fuel Cells - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: -, Acronym: MOHE, Sponsor: Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia; Number: Q.J130000.2523.14H02, Acronym: UTM, Sponsor: Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Number: -, Acronym: MOHE, Sponsor: Ministry of Higher Education; ","The authors wish to acknowledge the supports for this research paper received from Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia leading to this article under the Tier 1 grant (vote no: Q.J130000.2523.14H02).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, a rated power 38 kW DS-CSP system was developed (installed in Xiangtan Electric Manufacturing Group). The heat engine adopted the alpha-type four cylinders double-acting Stirling engine (Stirling Biopower Flexgen S260). The absorber flux distribution simulation was conducted using ray tracing method and then the 204 m2parabolic dish concentrator system (diameter is 17.70 m and focal length is 9.49 m) with single concentrator plus single pillar supporting has been designed and built. A water-cooled disc target and an absorber imitation device were adopted to test the tracking performance of the dish concentrator system, homogeneity of the focal spot and flux distribution of the absorber. Finally, the S260 Stirling engine was installed on the focal position of the dish concentrator and then the net output power date of the 38 kW DS-CSP system was tested. The absorber overheating problem on the DS-CSP system performance was discussed when the DS-CSP system was installed in different locations. The testing result shows that this system achieved the net output power of 38 kW and solar-to-electricity efficiency (SEE) of 25.3% with the direct normal irradiation (DNI) at 750 W/m2. The net output power can further increase to 40.5 kW with the SEE of 26.6% when the DNI reaches up to the maximum of 761 W/m2. The net output power of the 38 kW DS-CSP system has a linear function relationship with the DNI. The fitting function is Net power output=0.1003 DNI36.129, where DNI is at the range of 460∼761 W/m2.

In the experiment, the same shape aluminum block was kept under the same heating rate and heated by the resistance furnace. The experimental results show that the melting point of metal aluminum is between 650°C and 660°C, and after the melting point, the metal aluminum began to melt when it maintained for a long period of time, however, when the temperature is higher than the melting point, the aluminum will melt very quickly. In addition, in ANSYS simulation, the solid aluminum melted completely at 670°C in 5430 seconds, much longer than the actual experiment, it due to the heating rate was faster, not in an ideal experimental environment and there is heat exchange with the outside world and convection, at the same time, the aluminum block may contain impurities, so the actual melting time could be shorter than the simulation.

Recent year magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used imaging technique to assess brain tumors. However manual segmentation and artificial extracting features block MRI's practice when facing with the huge amount of data produced by MRI. An efficient and automatic image segmentation of brain tumor is still needed. In this paper, a novel automatic segmentation framework of brain tumors, which have 5 parts and resnet-50 use as a backbone, is proposed based on convolutional neural network. A dilated convolution refine (DCR) structure is introduced to extract the local features and global features. After investigating different parameters of our framework, it is proved that DCR is an efficient and robust method in Brain Tumor Segmentation. The experiments are evaluated by Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS 2015) dataset. The results show that our framework in complete tumor segmentation achieved excellent results with a DEC score of 0.87 and a PPV score of 0.92.

The difference between the two power characteristics and efficiency characteristics is compared by simulating the SS (series-series) and SP (series-parallel) type wireless charging systems. With the same parameters of circuit components, the SS structure is usually suitable for small load resistance.

The influences of oil price fluctuations on socio-economic development are obvious, and it draws more attention from scholars. However, the distribution of oil is highly centralized, which leads to the vast majority of oil trading through foreign trade. As a result, exchange rate plays an important role in the oil business. Study on the relationship between exchange rate and crude oil gradually becomes a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we use copula and CARR model to study correlation structure and relationship between crude oil price and exchange rate. We establish CARR models as marginal models and use five copulas which are Gaussian Copula, Student-t Copula, Gumbel Copula, Clayton Copula and Frank Copula to study the correlation structure between NYMEX crude oil price range and U. S. Dollar Index range. Furthermore, we use Copula-CARR model with structural breaks to detect the change points in the correlation structure between NYMEX crude oil price range and U. S.

Although most researchers have developed high-temperature membranes that do not need humidifiers, a lot of time is necessary for the development of these membranes, and these membranes drive up costs. Therefore, we propose a new cathode separator design that can recycle water generated by power generation in the same cell and a stack structure that can redistribute water collected in the cathode outlet manifold to drying cells. Because the new cathode separator has a bypass channel from the gas outlet to the gas inlet to transport excess water, a dry part in the gas inlet is supplied with excess water in the gas outlet through the bypass channel even if the PEFC is operated under dry conditions. Excess water in the PEFC stack can be transported from the cell with excess water to the drying cell through the cathode outlet manifold with a porous wall. Therefore, we confirm the influence of the plugging phenomenon in the cathode gas outlet manifold on the cell performance of each cell in the stack. As a result, the cell performance of the new cathode separator design is better than that of the standard separator under the low humidity conditions. We confirm that the plugging phenomenon in the cathode outlet manifold affects the cell performance of each cell in the stack. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","18","Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","Auxiliary equipment - Cathodes - Drying - Gases - Polyelectrolytes - Separators","Cathode separator - Cell performance - Electric energies - High temperature membranes - Low humidity conditions - Management issues - Polymer electrolyte fuel cells - System efficiency","702.2 Fuel Cells - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 901 Engineering Profession",,"","We wish to express our gratitude to the late Dr. MakotoYamauchi who promoted this research.

Thus, we must adopt new technologies, new equipment, and new grid structure to satisfy future requirements in energy patterns. Accordingly, the multiterminal direct current (MTDC) transmission system is receiving increasing attention. This paper starts with a brief description of current developments in MTDC worldwide. The MTDC project, which has been placed into practical operation, is introduced by the Italian-Corsica-Sardinian three-terminal high-voltage DC (HVDC) project. We then describe the basic characteristics and regulations of multiterminal DC transmission. The current mainstream of several control methods are described. In the third chapter, the key to the development of MTDC system or hardware and software technology that restricts the development of multiterminal DC transmission is discussed. This chapter focuses on the comparison of double-ended HVDC and multiterminal HVDC in most aspects and subsequently elaborates the key and difficult point of MTDC development. Finally, this paper summarizes the prospect of a DC power grid. In a few decades, China can build a strong cross-strait AC-DC hybrid power grid. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","9","HVDC power transmission","Electric power measurement - Electric power transmission networks - Software engineering","Basic characteristics - Hardware and software - High voltage DC (HVDC) - Multi-terminal dc - Multi-terminal direct currents - Multi-terminal HVDC - Renewable energies - Transmission systems","706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 723.1 Computer Programming - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Two important hemp cultivars in China, Yunma 5 (YM5, fiber hemp) and Bamahuoma (BM, seed hemp), were germinated under the conditions with four kinds of salts (NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaHCO3) at 0–300 mM for seven days to test the seed germination responses to salt stress. The germination indexes decreased with the increase of salt concentration for each salt, especially in 300 mM Na2CO3, showing the most toxic effect on germination. However, a low concentration (50 mM) of neutral salt stimulated seed germination, showing a higher germination rate and longer radicles and hypocotyls than the control. The growth of radical and hypocotyl was more salt-sensitive than seed germination. Upon transfer to distilled water, the non-germinated seeds restored germination ability and the recovery percentage increased with the increase of salt concentration. YM5 showed stronger salt tolerance than BM, with higher threshold salinity of 150 mM NaCl and Na2SO4(100 mM NaCl and 50 mM Na2SO4for BM), and higher critical salinity of 150 mM Na2CO3and 250 mM NaHCO3(100 mM Na2CO3and 200 mM NaHCO3for BM) for germination rate. In conclusion, the inhibition of salt stress to hemp seed germination varied with the salt type, salt concentration, and tested cultivars, and both hemp cultivars were more sensitive to alkaline salt stress. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","26","Seed","Cultivation - Hemp - Sodium bicarbonate - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium chloride - Sodium sulfate","Cannabis sativa - Germination - Germination rates - Low concentrations - Recovery percentages - Salt concentration - Salt tolerance - Seed germination","804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,"Number: CARS-16-E15, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the project " Mechanism of salt-tolerance in industrial hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.)

However, compared to the fixed-array systems, the use of the single-axis and dual-axis sun-tracking systems is usually impeded by increased cost, decreased reliability, and cumbersome maintenance. In this paper, we compare the performance of fixed-array, single-axis, and dual-axis rooftop photovoltaic systems in California using the data envelopment analysis method. For each system, an efficiency score is computed based on capacity, electricity generation, system cost, module use, solar irradiance and ambient temperature. We find the single-axis systems perform significantly better than the fixed-array and dual-axis systems. The fixed-array systems are more efficient than the dual-axis systems but the difference is not significant. The results imply the policymakers and solar installers should promote the single-axis sun-tracking and be cautious of using the dual-axis systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","17","Solar power generation","Data envelopment analysis - Electric power generation - Photovoltaic cells - Photovoltaic effects - Solar radiation","Array systems - Electricity generation - Photovoltaic systems - Policy makers - Rooftop photovoltaic systems - Solar irradiances - Sun tracking systems - Sun-tracking","615.2 Solar Power - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

On the other hand, it can be used to remove core decay heat out of containment passively in case of a severe accident circumstance. Thus, research on the performance of fins in air-cooled heat exchangers can benefit the optimal design and operation of cooling systems in nuclear power plants. In this study, a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method is implemented to investigate the effects of inlet velocity, fin spacing and tube pitch on the flow and the heat transfer characteristics of flat fins constructed of various materials (316L stainless steel, copper-nickel alloy and aluminium). A three dimensional geometric model of flat finned tube bundles with fixed longitudinal tube pitch and transverse tube pitch is established. Results for the variation of the average convective heat transfer coefficient with respect to cooling air inlet velocity, fin spacing, tube pitch and fin material are obtained, as well as for the pressure drop of the cooling air passing through finned tube. It is shown that the increase of cooling air inlet velocity results in enhanced average convective heat transfer coefficient and decreasing pressure drop. Both fin spacing and tube pitch engender positive effects on pressure drop and have negative effects on heat transfer characteristics. Concerning the fin material, the heat transfer performance of copper-nickel alloy is superior to 316L stainless steel and inferior to aluminium. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","11","Heat convection","Air - Air intakes - Aluminum - Austenitic stainless steel - Computational fluid dynamics - Cooling - Cooling systems - Copper alloys - Drops - Fins (heat exchange) - Heat transfer coefficients - Inlet flow - Nickel alloys - Nuclear fuels - Nuclear power plants - Pressure drop - Thermoelectric power plants - Tubes (components)","316 L stainless steel - Air-cooled heat exchanger - Convective heat transfer Coefficient - Heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics - Heat transfer characteristics - Heat transfer performance - Thermal power plants - Transverse tube pitch","541.1 Aluminum - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 545.3 Steel - 548.2 Nickel Alloys - 613 Nuclear Power Plants - 615.4 Thermoelectric Energy - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 723.5 Computer Applications - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,"Number: 2015ZX06004004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications; ","This work is supported by the National Key Science and Technology Project (2015ZX06004004).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the membrane filtration for protein concentration will be conducted and compared with the recent protein concentration technology. The analysis of operating factors for protein concentration process using filter membrane was discussed. The separation mechanism of membrane filtration was developed according to the size difference between the pore of membrane and the particle of filter material. The Darcy's Law was applied to discuss the interaction on flux, TMP (transmembrane pressure) and resistance in this study. The effect of membrane pore size, pH value and TMP on the steady-state flux (Jst) and protein rejection (R) were studied. It is observed that the Jstincreases with decreasing membrane pore size, the Jstincreases with increasing TMP, and R increased with decreasing solution pH value.

To solve this issue, this research proposes a new drive system design that combines the engine and a linear switched reluctance generator (LSRG). When the engine is operating, the LSRG can simultaneously assist the engine's mechanical output or can generate power to charge the battery. In this research, three research steps are executed. In the first step, the LSRG is designed according to the size of normal engine.

In this paper, we aim to preserve the desirable efficiency of collaborative representation based SDP method and further improve its prediction effect. We propose a cost-sensitive local collaborative representation (CLCR) approach for SDP. CLCR firstly efficiently finds the neighboring modules of a given test (query) module using CRC. Then CLCR represents the test module as a linear combination of its neighbors and uses the representation error for prediction. To solve the class-imbalance problem, CLCR further incorporates the cost-sensitive factor into the representation coefficients in the prediction phase. Experiments on five projects of the NASA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared with several related SDP methods. © 2016 IEEE.","32","Software testing","Costs - Forecasting - NASA","Class imbalance problems - Collaborative representation classifications - Collaborative representations - Computational costs - Dictionary learning - Linear combinations - Software defect prediction - Sparse representation","723.5 Computer Applications - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the data from one 1000 MW coal-fired unit, two modes of operation are contrasted and analyzed. One is to fix exhaust gas temperature and the other one is to take into account both of the average temperature difference and the exhaust gas temperature. Meanwhile, the cause of energy saving effect change is explored. Result shows that: in mode 1, the amount of decrease in coal consumption reduces from 1.11 g/kWh (under full load) to 0.54 g/kWh (under half load), and in mode 2, when the load decreases from 90% to 50%, the decrease in coal consumption reduces from 1.29 g/kWh to 0.84 g/kWh. From the result, under high load, the energy saving effect is superior, and under lower work load, energy saving effect declines rapidly when load is reduced. When load changes, the temperature difference of heat transfer, gas flow, the flue gas heat rejection and the waste heat recovery change. The energy saving effect corresponding changes result in that the energy saving effect under high load is superior and more stable. However, rational adjustment to the temperature of outlet gas can alleviate the decline of the energy saving effect under low load. The result provides theoretical analysis data for the optimal design and operation of low temperature economizer system of power plant. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","20","Temperature","Coal - Economizers - Energy conservation - Flow of gases - Gases - Heat transfer - Optimal systems - Waste heat - Waste heat utilization","Coal fired units - Economizer system - Energy-saving effect - Exhaust gas temperatures - Low temperatures - Modes of operation - Temperature differences - Thermodynamics analysis","524 Solid Fuels - 525 Energy Management and Conversion - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The experiment of three kinds of solar photovoltaic system has been set up for the purpose of analyzing the relationship between conversion efficiency and environmental parameters. This paper fits the relationship between conversion efficiency and solar radiation intensity. This method takes into account the amount of solar radiation that is effectively generated and drives away the weak values. With the spatial analysis function of geographic information system (GIS) platform, frequency distribution of solar radiation intensity and PV potential in China can be derived. Furthermore, analytical results show that monocrystalline-silicon PV generation in the north-western and northern areas have reached a level of more than 200 kWh/(m2.a), making those areas be suitable for the development of PV system. However, the potential for southwest areas reaches a level of only 130 kWh/(m2.a).

The record between the Late Neoproterozoic (the Jingeryu Formation) and the Cambrian (the Fujunshan Formation) in North China is a stratigraphic hiatus due to the tectonic uplift and erosion. A typical paleo-regolith widely occurs and is supposed to have recorded paleoclimate changes during the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian. According to the compositions of major elements, enrichment in elemental migrations and coefficient of weathering distribution of paleo-regolith on the topmost Jingeryu Formation in the Fangshan area, North China, this study suggests that: (1) The major element compositions of the paleo-regolith on the topmost Jingeryu Formation are dominated by the elements of SiO2, Al2O3, TFe2O3, CaO. And the elements of Al2O3, TFe2O3, TiO2, K2O are relatively concentrated in the middle-to-upper parts of the regolith while the SiO2 is slightly lost. (2) The vertical variations of geochemical proxies such as SiO2/Al2O3, SiO2/(Al2O3+TFe2O3), chemical index of alteration (CIA), residual coefficient and BA value indicate that the paleo-regolith should have been formed under a warm and humid condition with moderate chemical weathering. The chemical weathering might have gone through an evolution from weak to strong and again to weak in degree. (3) Compared to the element geochemical characteristics of modern regolith on the topmost carbonate settings from Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan, it is inferred that the paleo-regolith on the topmost Jingeryu Formation has relatively lower deficiency in Si and enrichment in Fe and Al. Consequently, by comprehensive analysis of the geochemical characteristics of paleo-regolith on the topmost Jingeryu Formation and changes in paleo-latitude of the North China block from the Late Neoproterozoic to the Cambria, it is proposed that the paleo-regolith on the topmost Jingeryu Formation might have been formed under conditions of a warm and humid tropical to subtropical climate siallite-clay regolith. © 2018, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

However, its depositional tectonic setting is little understood. The main purpose of this article is to analyze its provenance and depositional tectonic background by using molecular organic geochemistry and inorganic geochemistry. The carbon number distribution of the normal paraffin in the siliceous rock is relatively wide, C14-C36, with two peaks, which implies that this organic matter is derived from both higher terrigenous plants and marine autochthonous organisms. The features of the steroid and terpenoid hydrocarbons suggest that the organic is mainly originated from marine sources mixed with terrigenous sources. The REE characteristics of the siliceous rock are as followed: total w(REE) ranges from 83.56×10-6 to 124.1×10-6, w(Ce)/w(Ce*) between 0.76 and 0.99, w(La)n/w(Yb)n from 0.77 to 1.98. These characteristics show that the basin was apparently influenced by terrigenous sources. In addition, w(MnO)/w(TiO2) ratio and w(La)n/w(Ce)n vs. w(Al2O3)/w(Al2O3 + Fe2O3) plot consistently show that the chert was influenced by land sources during its depositional process. While the incorporating characteristics of the organic and inorganic in the siliceous rocks suggest that the studied area was a limited deep-water basin and was strongly influenced by terrigenous matter and that molecular organic geochemistry can provide more information about the provenance and sedimentary environment of siliceous rocks.",,,,,,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Eutrophication is not just the result of natural process, but the aggregated result of the interaction and mutual influences between natural process and human process. As the 'eyes' of water protection and management, water quality monitoring is the premise for the forecast of cyanobacteria outbreak and the assessment of bloom intensity. As technology advances, the monitoring tools and measuring indicators become increasingly diverse. In the meantime, the measurement accuracy is also constantly improving. In the domain of water quality monitoring, the combination of position sensors and wireless sensor networks makes the observations with high density, high precision and continuity possible. In addition, such methods can simultaneously collect both water quality data and surrounding environmental data, which can be used to simulate the interaction between the internal and external factors of water pollution as well as the mechanism of pollution process. The cyanobacteria bloom of inland lake has the characteristics of suddenness, randomness, and regionalism, the paper proposed a cyanobacteria bloom dynamic monitoring and spatial-temporal process simulation method based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and geographic information system (GIS). Firstly, multi-parameter sensor array is designed using water quality sensors in order to acquire real-time water quality data, and the monitoring node is composed of 4-layer architecture, including monitoring layer, data storage layer, model layer, and application layer; secondly, the improved grey model and back propagation (BP) artificial neural network are combined to forecast the cyan bacteria bloom in 24 h. This model incorporates both environmental factors (precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction) and the internal water environment factors (nitrogen, phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, permanganate, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen, pH value, and temperature). Thirdly, with the advantage of spatial analysis, GIS is used to describe the spatial-temporal processing of cyan bacteria. Finally, the simulation experiment results showed that the correlation coefficient achieved up to 0.995. Moreover, we conducted the empirical experiment in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China using the proposed method, and the correlation coefficient was 0.86 and the predicting error was 9.74. The field experiment results show that the method discussed in the paper has certain universality and can provide theoretical basis and data support for protecting and controlling the lake environment. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This study presented a geostatistical downscaling-calibration procedure to derive the high spatial resolution maps of precipitation over a mountainous watershed affected by a monsoon climate. Based on the relationships between precipitation and other environmental variables, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM), a regression model with a residual correction method was applied to downscale the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product from coarse resolution (25 km) to fine resolution (1 km). Two methods, geographical difference analysis (GDA) and geographical ratio analysis (GRA), were used to calibrate the downscaled TRMM precipitation data. Monthly 1 km precipitation data were obtained by disaggregating 1 km annual downscaled and calibrated precipitation data using monthly fractions derived from original TRMM data. The downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against ground observations measured by rain gauges. According to the comparison of different regression models and residual interpolation methods, a geographically-weighted regression kriging (GWRK) method was accepted to conduct the downscaling of TRMM data. The downscaled TRMM precipitation data obtained using GWRK described the spatial patterns of precipitation reasonably well at a spatial resolution of 1 km with more detailed information when compared with the original TRMM precipitation. The results of validation indicated that the GRA method provided results with higher accuracy than that of the GDA method. The final annual and monthly downscaled precipitation not only had significant improvement in spatial resolution, but also agreed well with data from the validation rain gauge stations (i.e., R2= 0.72, RMSE = 161.0 mm, MAE = 127.5 mm, and Bias = 0.050 for annual downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015; and R2= 0.91, RMSE = 22.2 mm, MAE = 13.5 mm, and Bias = 0.048 for monthly downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015). In general, the downscaling-calibration procedure is useful for complex mountainous areas with insufficient ground gauges.","92","Rain","Calibration - Image resolution - Interpolation - Precipitation (chemical) - Rain gages - Regression analysis - Surveying - Watersheds","China - Complex mountainous areas - Down-scaling - Geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK) - Normalized difference vegetation index - Red River basin - TRMM 3B43 - Tropical rainfall measuring missions","405.3 Surveying - 443.2 Meteorological Instrumentation - 443.3 Precipitation - 444.1 Surface Water - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 2017FB071, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgments: This work was funded by the National Key R & D Program of China (grant 2016YFA0601601) and Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (grant 2017FB071).

Here, responses of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seedlings of the cultivars YM5 and BM to the stress of different concentrations of NaCl and Na2CO3 were investigated to explore the salt tolerance of hemp. Results showed that the plant height, dry weight and root length of YM5 and BM seedlings gradually decreased as the concentration of NaCl or Na2CO3 increased. Although physiological indices such as EC (Electrical conductivity), SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and Pro (Proline) increased as the salt concentration increased, the increase extent was significantly greater in YM5 than in BM. Under the conditions of 100 and 200 mM NaCl, BM had greater dry weight and root length, and lower Pro content than YM5. However, under the stress of 100 and 200 mM Na2CO3 the opposite results were recorded, with the exception for lower chlorophyll content and higher SOD activity in BM than in YM5. These findings indicated that BM had a stronger NaCl tolerance than YM5. Moreover, morphological indices of the two cultivars under Na2CO3 stress were stunted more than under NaCl stress, and the seedlings died when Na2CO3 concentration increased up to 300 mM. Some up-regulation of salt-tolerant genes were observed in the two hemp cultivars, a higher expression under NaCl stress than under Na2CO3 stress, and a higher expression in YM5 than in BM were recorded. Findings from the study indicated that hemp seedling is more sensitive to Na2CO3 stress, and the tolerance of hemp to salt stress varies with salt type and salt concentration, although both cultivars can withstand moderate doses of NaCl and Na2CO3. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","33","Hemp","Enzymes - Gene expression - Gene expression regulation - Physiological models - Physiology - Plants (botany) - Seed - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium chloride","Cannabis sativa - Chlorophyll contents - Electrical conductivity - Physiological indices - Physiological response - Salt concentration - Seedling growth - Super oxide dismutase","461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,"Number: CARS-16-E15, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; Number: 31871671, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31371678, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China "Mechanism of salt-tolerant in industrial hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.)

So that a series of flexible electrodes with different resistance value were manufactured. The experiment showed that same carbon powder under different mesh had different resistance value, and resistance value changed without regularity; resistance value changed irregularly with the increasing carbon powder mesh; with the increasing quantity of carbon powder, resistance value presented a tendency of decreasing, until the mixture was too dry to lose function; flexible electrode resistance value increased over time, because of the volatilization of electrode materials. © 2015 IEEE.","11","Electrodes","Automation - Carbon - Conducting polymers - Mesh generation","Electro-active polymers - Electrode material - Experimental research - Flexible electrodes - influence factor - Internal resistance - Internal resistance measurements - Resistance values","708.2 Conducting Materials - 723.5 Computer Applications - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this control algorithm, an adjusting factor and an integral term are added based on the conventional fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to improve the control accuracy and the transient performance. The fuzzy rules of this algorithm can be modified on-line by the adjusting factor on the current error. The experiment results show that the new method can overcome strong nonlinear and large lag features of the refrigeration systems. © 2015 IEEE.","13","Fuzzy logic","Automation - Computer circuits - Controllers - Environmental chambers - Environmental testing - Fuzzy control - Fuzzy inference - Refrigeration","Control accuracy - Electronic expansion valves - Environmental test chamber - Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) - Fuzzy logic controllers - Refrigeration system - Self-adjusting - Transient performance","644.1 Refrigeration Methods - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 721.3 Computer Circuits - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 732.1 Control Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Obstacle avoidance technologies are divided into two kinds, one is based on the global map and another is based on sensors respectively. This paper mainly aims at the local obstacle avoidance method based on sensors. The study of obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance are two inseparable parts in the research of obstacle avoidance ability. This paper proposes an efficient obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance algorithm based on 2-D lidar. A method is proposed to get the information of obstacles by filtering and clustering the laser-point cloud data. Also, this method generates the forward angle and velocity of robot based on the principle of minimum cost function. The obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance algorithm has advantages of a simple mathematical model and good real-time performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on MATLAB simulation platform. © 2015 IEEE.","15","Information filtering","Automation - Collision avoidance - Cost functions - MATLAB - Mobile robots - Obstacle detectors - Optical radar","Avoidance technology - Local obstacle avoidances - Matlab simulations - Minimum cost - Obstacle avoidance algorithms - obstacle clustering - Obstacle detection - Real time performance","716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.5 Robotics - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
