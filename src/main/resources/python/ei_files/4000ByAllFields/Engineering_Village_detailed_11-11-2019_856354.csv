Many techniques and tools have been developed to support code recommendation in different ways. However, it is not clear how these techniques and tools can be used in Android development and whether Android development can be well supported by them. In this paper, we present a qualitative review on code recommendation techniques and tools with the focus of support for Android development. We first categorize code recommendation techniques and tools reported in literatures and then evaluate them towards the requirements of Android development. The evaluation results enable us to draw a comprehensive image of how code recommendation benefits Android development and also the deficiencies of state-of-the-art code recommendation techniques in meeting specific requirements of Android development.

The synthesized mesoporous titania samples were characterized using a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as N2adsorption/desorption measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV - vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results of physicochemical characterizations showed that the as-synthesized sample was a composite of highly crystalline mesoporous anatase titania and graphitic carbon (gc-MTiO2), which implies the dual function of hypocrellins as template and 'dopant'. The in situ doped graphitic carbon significantly increased the visible-light absorbance of TiO2. The gc-MTiO2exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity under visible-light for photodegradation of acetaldehyde, a common indoor air pollutant. The photophysics and electron dynamics in this photocatalytic process were studied by time-resolved FT-IR spectra, in particular on the nano- to milli-second time scale. It is observed that electrons were injected into the conduction band of gc-MTiO2and they were decayed to deep traps caused by graphitic carbon. The reported strategies could open up new uses for mesoporous titania self-doped with carbon in applications such as solar cells, photocatalysts, photoelectrical devices, and photo-induced sensors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A new problem especially for the creation of an Asian city in 3D is how to systematically deal with traditional houses that have various roof shapes from the viewpoint of maintaining this large database economically. In this paper, I propose a better method for creating urban 3D GIS through means of a parametric method and Boolian operation on basic shapes (3D templates). There should exist a significant relationship between house roof shapes (i.e. form by scientific visualization) and the human and natural environments in Asian urban living (i.e. function by information visualization).

V-type string will swing with the wind and suffer large buckling deformation under strong wind. Thus, it is particularly important to study its mechanical properties under gale circumstance. We studied the V-string for a 500 kV compact transmission line of Yunnan. Firstly, using the method of static equilibrium, we calculated the maximum buckling stress of insulator under steady wind and pulsating wind. Then the dynamic buckling response of the V-type insulators was obtained by simulating the wind swinging response of compact transmission line under pulsating wind and impulse wind load after using the three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mechanical software developed by Tsinghua University. The extreme buckling stress of the V-type insulator under the action of steady wind, pulsating wind and impulse wind was respectively compared, and amplification factors under the latter two wind loads were obtained as 1.2 and 1.6~2.6. Moreover, in consideration of the effect of impulse wind, the buckling response of insulator was obtained when insulators of different V-angle and different diameters were adopted. The results show that it is safe to use V-type strings with angle of 100° and insulators with 24-mm diameter. Moreover, we put forward a design scheme of 24 mm-diameter rod double V-type string for anti-buckling-fracture. Finally, the software ANSYS is used to discuss the influence of the connection degree of freedom of the connection of the high voltage end on the buckling stress distribution of the insulator, and the stress value amplification factor of 1.0~1.3 is obtained. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Potentiodynamic polarization studies showed that neutral red mainly acted as a mixed-type inhibitor for steel in 1.0 M hydrochloric acid. Thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption heat, adsorption entropy and adsorption free energy were obtained from experimental data of the temperature studies of the inhibition process at four temperatures ranging from 30 to 45 °C. The most suitable range of inhibitor concentration was discussed. The kinetic data such as apparent activation energies and pre-exponential factors at different concentrations of the inhibitor were calculated, the effect of the apparent activation energies and pre-exponential factors on the corrosion rates of cold rolled steel was discussed. The inhibitive action was satisfactorily explained by using both thermodynamic and kinetic models. Synergism between chloride ion and neutral red was proposed.

In this paper, a new algorithm for the reconstruction of 3D temperature field is proposed based on Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF). A 3D temperature field is a space distribution profile evolving over time which is infinite dimensional in nature, the proposed GRBF-based approach can approximate the temperature field as a finite summation of space-dependent basis functions and time-dependent coefficients. According to the acoustic pyrometry principle, these Gaussian functions are integrated along a number of paths which are determined by the number and distribution of sensors. This inversion problem to estimate the unknown parameters of the Gaussian functions can be solved with the measured times-of-flight (TOF) of acoustic waves and the length of propagation paths using the recursive least square method (RLS). Compared with polynomial interpolation and functions parameterization, GRBF provides better approximation capability for most nonlinear functions over irregular regions. It is also superior in scalability and more efficient when extended to higher dimensional space. The simulation result shows an error less than 2% between the reconstructed temperature field and the ideal one. It demonstrates the availability and efficiency of GRBF framework for temperature field reconstruction. © 2015 IEEE.","17","Image reconstruction","Acoustic wave propagation - Automation - Functions - Gaussian distribution - Least squares approximations - Polynomial approximation - Radial basis function networks - Real time control - Temperature - Wave effects","approximation - Approximation capabilities - Gaussian radial basis functions - inversion - Radial basis functions - Recursive least square methods - Temperature field reconstruction - Time-dependent coefficients","641.1 Thermodynamics - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, these numerical scales cannot fully describe some desired properties, such as asymmetry, consistency, variability, and diminishing utility, in accordance with the preference relations. To address this issue, we first develop a generalized sigmoid function and define a continuous preference set, on the basis of which we propose the generalized sigmoid scale. Then, we introduce the optimal discrete fitting and risk preference selection approaches to solve the risk appetite parameters in the generalized sigmoid scale. Using these new methods, we further propose the asymmetric fuzzy preference relation (AFPR), examine its additive transitivity property and some weak transitivity properties, and design an approximate consistency test. The corresponding five-step modeling process under an asymmetric fuzzy preference environment is constructed, which can be applied in decision making involving different risk appetites. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the properties and advantages of these new methods. The first example is simple and shows the differences between the traditional fuzzy preference relations and the AFPRs, while the second is a practical case and is used to illustrate the feasibility and reasonability of the AFPRs. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","60","Decision making","Artificial intelligence - Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy preference relations - generalized sigmoid scale - optimal discrete fitting (ODF) - Risk preference - Sigmoid function","723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The experimental results show as follows: (1) Affected by the underground mining, the stress distribution of the top, lumbar and bottom of open pit slope has readjusted; with the expanding of mining range, it presents a dynamic change trend that being in compression, then the compressive stress increases, finally being in tension in whole. Because of the supporting protective effect of boundary pillar, the vertical sink of open pit slope is very small after underground mining. (2) After the extraction of underground phosphate, a abutment pressure zone in a certain area of roof which is behind and in front of the underground goaf is formed; but in the area of roof which is close to upper side of underground goaf, a roof stress-relaxation zone appears. And at the same time, in the area of floor which is close to lower part of underground goaf, a floor stress-relaxation zone appears. The stress-relaxation zone expands gradually and the roof abutment pressure zone moves forward dynamically with the advance of extracting along the inclination extension of phosphate layer. (3) Due to the influence of mining, the roof and floor surrounding rocks near the goaf both have different degrees of deformation, the roof strata have different degrees of subsidence and the roof strata have different degrees of rising. The maximum subsidence point of roof and the maximum rising point of floor are located in the centre of underground goaf which is a little close to the lower part, and they moves forward dynamically with the advance of extraction. And the integral shapes of subsidence curve and rising curve of rock stratum are both tend to be bowl shape when the underground mining of phosphate reaches fully mining. Taking the goaf as center, with the increase in the distance from it along vertical and horizontal direction, the deformation of roof and floor strata are both monotone decreasing. (4) When the mining advances to the fault fracture zone and its influence region, the fault fracture zone is activated, it appears slipping and shear fracture along faulted interface.

Results indicate that the total area of soil erosion is larger, accounting for 90% of the total catchment area; annual average erosion modulus of 1989 is 19.996 (t/(km2· a)), and 17.364 (t/(km2· a)) in 1999; soil erosion load is about 1.53 × 107t and 1.33 × 107t in 1989 and 1999 respectively; According to the Standards for classification and gradation of soil erosion in China, slight and light erosions occupy most area of the basin and increase by 193.99 km2and 0.22×106t from 1989 to 1999. During the period, On the contrary, the other classifications (i.e. medium, strong, extremely strong and acute) of erosion reduce by 193.99 km2and 2.24×106t respectively. Generally, the situation of soil erosion in this tributary basin was becoming better due to effective contemporaneous the soil and water conservation measures. © 2011 IEEE.","18","Soil conservation","Catchments - Erosion - Geographic information systems - Remote sensing - Sediment transport - Soils - Water conservation - Watersheds","River basins - RS/GIS - RUSLE - Soil erosion - Upper Mekong","444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The occurrence mechanism of algal blooms is revealed by analyzing the local stability of the proposed model system at the interior equilibrium. Furthermore, the instability mechanism of the proposed model system due to the variation of economic interest of harvesting is studied. With the purpose of eliminating the algal blooms and maintaining the economic interest of harvesting at an ideal level, a biological control strategy corresponding to a state feedback controller in the proposed model system is designed.

A popular Chinese network breakthrough technique is to jam malicious characters in key words, and /or replace the Chinese characters in key words with homonyms or homophones, or complicated Chinese characters. With this method some malicious web pages make themselves escape from the network filtering and intrusion detection. While most existing pattern matching algorithms in Chinese strings cannot detect this kind of attacks. In this paper we give a formulized definition of flexible pattern matching in Chinese strings, and compare the classical algorithms for pattern matching in strings, and choose the prefix searching strategy to realize the flexible algorithms for pattern matching in single-pattern string and multi-pattern string. Our algorithm can match the Chinese strings jammed with malicious characters, and partially resolve the Chinese network breakthrough problem that other classical matching algorithms in string cannot solve.","12","String searching algorithms","Intrusion detection - Jamming - Pattern matching - Websites","Chinese characters - Chinese strings - Flexible patterns - Malicious web pages - Matching algorithm - Pattern matching algorithms - Searching strategy - Security content","711 Electromagnetic Waves - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, since the target and airborne ISAR are all moving objects, some points may disappear from the radar antenna beams, which will affect imaging results. In order to improve image qualities, it is very important to track the target range by virtue of the collected information and accurately control the antennas of ISAR to face the target. Because of the relative motion between the radar and target, their relative distances are usually nonlinearly variable with time. In this paper, a nonlinear model of range-only system is constructed by using a method of chord length approximation, based on which, a particle filter algorithm is presented for real-time tracking to the relative range. Finally, a compare is made between the new algorithm and other filtering algorithms under the same system model. The simulation results show that the former have higher accuracy.","6","Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Approximation algorithms - Image enhancement - Inverse problems - Nonlinear filtering - Quality control - Radar antennas - Radar imaging","Filtering algorithm - ISAR - Non-linear model - Observation Period - Radar antenna beam - Real time tracking - Relative distances - Relative motion","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
