The following prominent results are found: (1) The calculated values of Hurst exponent for solar flare activity lie in between 0.8362 and 0.9420, exhibiting the persistent behavior of long-range correlation, (2) The values of fractal dimension reflect that solar flare activity in the northern hemisphere is more irregular than that in the southern hemisphere and in the whole solar disk, (3) The values of predictability indicator of solar flare activity are larger than 0.5, implying that solar flare activity is predictable and chaotic in nature, (4) The widths of singularity spectra indicate that solar flare activity has multi-fractal behavior and such multi-fractal nature is due to long-range correlation.

Until now, it has not been studied from the perspective of Engineering Phonetics. In this paper, for the above reason, by the adaptive variational mode decomposition (AVMD) we have investigated the dynamic formant characteristics of Wa language. Firstly, more precisely, use the synthetic dimension to split Wa language isolated words into voiceless and voiced segment, initials and finals. Secondly, use Linear Prediction Coding to estimate the first three formant frequencies and their bandwidths roughly. Thirdly, select the appropriate equilibrium constraint parameter and the number of decomposed layers so that Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition (AVMD) can decompose the signal into some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) without pattern aliasing. Fourthly, use the estimated formant frequencies and bandwidths to determine precisely the required IMFs. Fifthly, use the Hilbert transform to calculate the instantaneous frequency of the above determinate IMFs. Further, we implement the weight average operation on instantaneous frequencies to obtain the first three formant frequencies for each frame. Finally, comparing the first three formant frequencies obtained by the adaptive variance modal decomposition and by Praat software respectively, so we have drawn the conclusion that the relative correct rate of the former to the latter can reach 86% averagely in terms of the selected isolated words, which has shown that our method is effective on Wa language. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","19","Signal processing","Artificial intelligence - Bandwidth - Information systems - Information use - Mathematical transformations - Natural frequencies","Equilibrium constraint - Hilbert transform - Instantaneous frequency - Intrinsic Mode functions - Linear prediction coding - Minority languages - Modal decomposition - Mode decomposition","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,"Number: 2016YJS078, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: -, Acronym: IEEE, Sponsor: IEEE Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: PKU, Sponsor: Peking University; Number: 3019901, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Royal Society; ","This work is financially supported by Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Science Research Fund Project (2016YJS078), Yunnan Minzu University Overseas Master’s Program (3019901). 8.

However, because tunnel structure differs from building structure significantly, there are some difficulties in establishing an elaborate three-dimensional model of tunnel structure using BIM software such as Revit, and the model is difficult to be reused. To address this problem, this work first proposes a BIM model decomposition scheme for mountain tunnel structure, which is decomposed into basic components and divided into basic units along the axis. The unit length determination principle was given according to the characteristics of the components, and according to whether this model could be reused, the basic units were divided into standard and special units. Second, the model was divided into three levels of detail (LOD100, LOD200, LOD300) to meet the needs of different design stages. The multiscale parametric modeling method of standard units was proposed to provide a basis for tunnel structure modeling. It laid the foundation for improving the efficiency of BIM model visualization management. Finally, this work proposes an adaptive splicing method for the basic units of the model. According to the mileage of the tunnel axis and its corresponding three-dimensional coordinates and design section type, the models of standard units for different lengths and special units are automatically spliced according to the discretized axis, thus forming a complete tunnel model. Based on the Laoying Tunnel of Baolu Expressway in Yunnan Province, this study uses Revit to establish the parametric models of standard units and the special units of the tunnel structure. Through the Unity3D software and the splicing program, the adaptive splicing and multiscale loading of the model units were realized, and the complete BIM model of Laoying Tunnel was formed. The multiscale parametric modeling and adaptive splicing method improves the reusability and modeling efficiency of the 3D model of the tunnel structure, and provides a reference for the application of BIM technology in mountain tunnel engineering. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

However, if the cyanobacteria are contaminated by nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements, cyanobacteria will cause the phenomenon of 'water bloom' in the lake, which will seriously endanger the safety of humans, animals, fish and shrimps. To help lake management units to prevent and control the outbreak of cyanobacteria, this paper designed and developed a comprehensive management system for the prevention and control of cyanobacteria blooms and salvage treatment. The system consists of four subsystems: the operational reporting subsystem, the monitoring data management system, the algae environmental protection disposal process management system, and the real-time cyanobacteria monitoring system. The three-dimensional interaction between the WEB end and the mobile patrol handheld terminal makes the system more efficient and convenient. The neighborhood image is denoised by the neighborhood averaging method, and the K-means algorithm is used for clustering training, which makes the classification of the algae pictures taken. The realization of the system effectively prevented the large-scale outbreak of cyanobacteria, providing a new idea for monitoring and processing cyanobacteria blooms. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.","6","Information management","Algae - Fish - K-means clustering - Lakes - Monitoring","Comprehensive managements - Cyanobacteria blooms - Data management system - Hand-held terminals - Integrated management systems - Prevention and controls - Salvage treatment - Three-dimensional interaction",,,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, after a proper treatment on a graphite fiber a large number of small fragments of graphite are formed on the tip of the graphite fiber. Observed by a SEM these fragments are spheres and flakes with the size around 50nm. In this case each of these spheres and flakes can be an emission center in a field emission and some detectable emission current can be obtained with rather low applied voltage. Because there are a large number of fragments on the tip of a single graphite fiber the total emission current from the tip would be very large. Experimental results show that a single graphite fiber of 15μm diameter near 1mA emission current can be obtained with 4kV applied voltage and the stability have been measured to be leas than 10%.

This paper conducts a case study on the Blue Focus's M&A by using financial indicator method and gets the conclusion: M&A is able to help companies keep growing, broaden business scale and raise the level of the profit in short term. But as for the long term, only if corporations cope with the resource integration effectively can they gain the benefits. © 2016 IEEE.","11","Gems",,"Financial indicator - High tech - Resource integration - Short term","482.2.1 Gems",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To constrain rotations and translation east of the EHS, we present new palaeomagnetic data from meta-basalt layers-possibly sills- of the Baoshan Block in western Yunnan, southeastern Tibet Plateau; the meta-basalts were either emplaced or metamorphosed to greenschist facies at ~30 Ma (40Ar-39Ar whole rock ages). A detailed rock magnetic study-in combination with reflected and transmitted light microscopy-identifies magnetite and Ti-rich titanomagnetite as the main magnetic carriers. Using alternating field demagnetization, we separated well-clustered characteristic remanent magnetizations. A fold test indicates a syn-folding remanence acquisition, supporting an Oligocene magnetization due to evidence for regional Eocene-Oligocene shortening. The tilt corrected overall site mean direction at 30 per cent of unfolding yields declination/inclination= 042.2°/47.0°, corresponding to a clockwise rotation of 35.1°± 12.7° with respect to stable Eurasia. This denotes an average rotation rate of 1.17 ± 0.42° Myr-1since ~30 Ma, ranging at the lower limit of the present-day, GPS-derived rotation rates. We explain the clockwise rotation by tectonic escape of the Baoshan and the Lanping-Simao blocks along the Ailao Shan shear zone. With the onset of shearing along the Chong Shan and Gaoligong Shan shear zones, the Baoshan Block continued its southeastward escape, decoupled from the Lanping-Simao Block between these two major shear zones. Crustal flow could explain rotation and southward escape after ~20 Ma. © The Authors 2014.

At the optimal operating temperature of 130 °C, the response of the sensor (x = 1:4) to 1 ppm methanol is 41, and the response and recovery times are 40 s and 50 s, respectively.

Different from the other diffusion based method, a nonlocal diffusion tensor is introduced to consider both the diffusion strength and direction. Along with the principle direction, the diffusion should be suppressed to preserve the dissimilarity between the foreground and background, and in other directions, the diffusion should be boosted to combine the similar regions and highlight the saliency object as a whole. Through a two-stages diffusion, the final saliency map is obtained and quantitative and visual comparisons are executed on two large benchmark databases.

Furthermore, since the location of a relay plays an important role on the performance, the effect of different link power gains on the capacity is also evaluated.

A location-based fault tolerant routing algorithm(FTRA) for mobile ad hoc networks is proposed in the paper. The network is divided into grids according to geographical location information. In normal routing, a forwarding node only uses the position information of its destination and its own neighbors to determine the next hops that packet should be forwarded to, the proposed algorithm is thus very well suited for highly dynamic networks. When there is no usable node at a hop on the normal routing path, the proposed protocol can detour the fault region with only local information of its neighbor grids. The performance of the proposed algorithmis evaluated by means of simulation. © 2009 IEEE.","6","Mobile ad hoc networks","Fault slips - Fault tolerance - Location - Mobile computing - Network architecture - Routing algorithms","Fault tolerant routing - Fault-tolerant capability - Fault-tolerant routing algorithm - Forwarding nodes - Geographical location information - Grid - Local information - Position information","484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
