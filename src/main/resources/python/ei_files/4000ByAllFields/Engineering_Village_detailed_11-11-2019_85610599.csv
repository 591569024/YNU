Starting from the n-π* excited-state (S1) cyclobutanone, the three reactions can take place: decarbonylation (produce CO and cyclopropane or propylene), cycloelimination (produce ketene and ethylene), and ring expansion (produce oxacarbene). Our computation indicates that decarbonylation products CO and triplet trimethylene are formed on the triplet n-π* excited state (T1) in a stepwise way via a biradical intermediate after intersystem crossing (ISC) to T1 from S1. And, then, the triplet trimethylene undergoes a second ISC to the ground state (S0) to produce the singlet trimethylene from which cyclopropane can be produced rapidly only overcoming a 1 to 2-kcal/mol barrier while propylene can be formed as a secondary product. The cycloelimination products ketene and ethylene are formed on the S 0 in a concerted mechanism after internal conversion (IC) to S 0 from S1 via a biradical conical intersection. The reaction channels corresponding to ring expansion on the S0, T 1, and S1 states have also been discussed, and the likeliest reaction path is that oxacarbene is formed on the ground state following S1/S0 internal conversion. The surface topology of cyclobutanone on the S1 surface is characterized by a transition state separating the minimum from the S1/S0 conical intersection, which is consistent with the previous computations and can explain the wavelength dependence of the fluorescence emission yield. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","36","Ketones","Computational methods - Decomposition - Dissociation - Fluorescence - Photochemical reactions - Potential energy - Propylene - Surface treatment - Topology","Photodecomposition - Surface topology","741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 931.1 Mechanics","Theoretical (THR); Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, after a proper treatment on a graphite fiber a large number of small fragments of graphite are formed on the tip of the graphite fiber. Observed by a SEM these fragments are spheres and flakes with the size around 50nm. In this case each of these spheres and flakes can be an emission center in a field emission and some detectable emission and some detectable emission current can be obtained with rather low applied voltage. Because there are a large number of fragments on the tip of a single graphite fiber the total emission current from the tip would be very large. Experimental results show that a single graphite fiber of 20um diameter near 0.2mA emission current can be obtained with 4KV applied voltage and the stability have been measured to be leas than 10%.

Transport processes in the conduit are controlled by advection, mixing (dilution and dispersion), and retention-release. In this article, a karst transport model considering advection, spatially varying dispersion, and dilution (from matrix seepage) is developed. Two approximate Green's functions are obtained using transformation of variables, respectively, for the initial-value problem and for the boundary-value problem. A numerical example illustrates that mixing associated with strong spatially varying conduit dispersion can cause strong skewness and long tailing in spring breakthrough curves. Comparison of the predicted breakthrough curve against that measured from a dye-tracing experiment between Ames Sink and Indian Spring, Northwest Florida, shows that the conduit dispersivity can be as large as 400 m. Such a large number is believed to imply strong solute interaction between the conduit and the matrix and/or multiple flow paths in a conduit network. It is concluded that Taylor dispersion is not dominant in transport in a karst conduit, and the complicated retention-release process between mobile- and immobile waters may be described by strong spatially varying conduit dispersion. © 2010 The Author(s).

We find experimentally that the energy threshold is very sensitive to the RI of the dye solution and the fiber diameter, and the produced length of the lasing emission is dependent on the dye concentration and the RI of the dye solution. The optical gain of a circular microcavity in the evanescent-wave pumping scheme is analyzed by introducing a Gaussian distribution function of the pump light, and various energy losses related to the microcavity are considered, which leads to a threshold energy formula. The formula for determining the produced length of the lasing emission is derived by introducing an attenuated factor in the threshold energy formula.

The results reveal that both molybdate and tungstate are very good inhibitors with little concentration. The adsorption of inhibitors on the CRS surface basically obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of CRS was also studied at 25 °C and 35 °C, the thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption heat (ΔH0) and adsorption free energy (ΔG0) were calculated. In the same conditions, a comparative study of corrosion inhibition of molybdate and tungstate indicated that molybdate was the better inhibitor in 0.1 M HCl. However, the value of percentage inhibition efficiency (IE) was dependent on the concentration of inhibitors in 0.2-0.5 M HCl. It seemed that molybdate did not have the strong inhibitive effect compared to tungstate with relatively small concentration of inhibitors, but molybdate was a better inhibitor over a wide concentration range of inhibitors. A kinetic study of cold rolling steel in uninhibited and inhibited acid was also discussed. Various parameters such as rate constant k and the kinetic parameter B were calculated for the reactions of corrosion.

In this model, the dynamical and radiative evolution of a pulsar wind nebula in a nonradiative supernova remnant can be described self-consistently. Results. This model is applied to the three composite SNRs, G0.9+0.1, MSH 15-52, G338.3-0.0, and the multiband observed emission from the three PWNe is reproduced. Conclusions. Our studies on the three remnants provide evidence of a new spectrum of the particles, which are accelerated by the terminate shock and injected into a PWN. © ESO, 2010.","46","Atmospheric optics","Galaxies - Gamma rays - Pulsars - Supernovae","Collisionless shocks - Gamma rays: isms - High-energy particles - ISM: individual objects - ISM: individual objects:G0.9+0.1 - Multi-wavelength emissions - Nonthermal emission - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The pump light is longitudinally coupled into a bare optical fibre immersed in a dye solution of lower refractive index. The dye molecules around the bare fibre are excited by the evanescent waves of pump light when they propagate along the fibre in a total internal reflection. When the pump beam within the fibre is a meridian beam, the WGM lasing emission from the fibre laser is a linearly polarised transverse electric wave, while it is a mixed wave of the linearly polarised transverse electric and magnetic waves if the pump beam is a skew beam within the fibre. Because the excited molecules are located within the evanescent field of WGM, a good spatial overlap between the dye gain and the evanescent field leads to a high pumping efficiency and a longer gain distance along the fibre. Once the bare fibre is inserted into three glass capillaries filled with Rhodamine 6G, 610 and 640 dye solutions, respectively, WGM laser oscillations at the wavelengths of 567-575, 605-614 and 656-666 nm occur simultaneously, and a linearly polarised three-colour lasing emission is achieved in a single optical fibre. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","19","Pumping (laser)","Color - Dies - Electromagnetic wave reflection - Evanescent fields - Fiber lasers - Molecules - Optical fibers - Optical resonators - Polarization - Refractive index - Whispering gallery modes","Evanescent wave - Excited molecules - Glass capillaries - Laser oscillations - Pumping efficiency - Total internal reflections - Transverse electric waves - Transverse electrics","534.1 Foundries - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 714.3 Waveguides - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 744.1 Lasers, General - 744.4 Solid State Lasers - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that tween-60 was a good inhibitor in 1.0 mol&middotL-1 HCl. Inhibition efficiency increased with increasing inhibitor concentration and the maximum inhibition efficiency was 91.2% at 30°C even when inhibitor concentration is low. However, inhibition efficiency decreased with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration and temperature. Polarization curves showed that tween-60 was a mixed-type inhibitor in hydrochloric acid, and apparently inhibited iron's cathodic reaction. The experimental data were treated with adsorption theory and kinetic equations. Both the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters could be obtained. The thermodynamic results showed that the adsorption of tween-60 on the cold rolled steel surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. Furthermore, the adsorption process was a spontaneous and exothermic process accompanied by a decrease in entropy.

The stability of population reduces monotonically as the cross-correlated intensity λ increasing. The population of a species goes to extinction with increasing τ and increasing λ; (ii) inclusion of time delay in the propagation process, the increasing τ strengthens the stability of population and the increasing λ weakens it. The increasing τ slows down the growth process of a species while the increasing λ speeds it up. That is, the increasing delay time does not affect roughly the stability of population with short delay but strengthens it with long delay, and the population of species is restricted in the lower level by the larger delay time.

Cylindrical microcavity lasers based on the gain only in the evanescent field region of whispering gallery modes have been demonstrated in our recent works. The gain was excited by the evanescent wave of longitudinal optical pumping along the optical fiber. To well understand the obtained lasing spectra, the mode assignment is required. The explicit asymptotic formulas for the position and mode-interval of whispering gallery modes were obtained from the characteristic equation of whispering gallery modes in a cylindrical micro-cavity. The formulas were used to analyze the lasing spectra emitting from cylindrical microcavies which were evanescent-wave-gain pumped. The lasing spectra were found to be transverse magnetic modes (TM), and then the spectra were mode assigned with two integers, i.e., radial quantum numbers (l) and angular momentum numbers (n). Based on the explicit asymptotic formulas, all of the spectra from five optical fibers with a diameter ranging from 215 to 328 mm were well mode assigned. In the match between experimental spectral data and the asymptotic formula, only two matched parameters (l, n) were used, and the wavelength deviation in the match was less than 0.05 nm, which indicated that the mode assignment was reliable and precise. The spectral mode-assignment of cylindrical micro-cavity is important for computing the spatial distribution of mode intensity and is crucial for the applications of frequency-shift biosensor built in cylindrical micro-cavities. The method introduced in this paper can also be used to measure the diameters and refractive indexes of cylindrical micro-cavies precisely.","14","Whispering gallery modes","Dielectric devices - Electromagnetic wave reflection - Evanescent fields - Microcavities - Optical fibers - Optical pumping - Optical resonators - Q factor measurement - Quantum theory - Refractive index","Characteristic equation - Cylindrical dielectric resonators - Cylindrical micro-cavies - Cylindrical microcavities - Laser spectra - Longitudinal optical - Mode-assignment - Transverse magnetic modes","701 Electricity and Magnetism - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 714 Electronic Components and Tubes - 714.3 Waveguides - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Pumped by evanescent wave along the fiber axis, dye gain is confined in the evanescent field of whispering gallery mode (WGM) of the fiber, which leads to a low pumping threshold for lasing emission. The concentration effects in liquid dye lasing emission have been studied via a WGM fibre laser under the pumping energy of 50 μJ. The results show that with the increase of rhodamine 6G dye concentration in ethanol alcohol, lasing wavelength is red shifted and lasing wavelength range is widened. The experimental observations are well explained by the γ(λ) curve, a ratio of molecular density for the upper and total lasing energy levels, which is deduced from the four-energy level model of dye lasing from a WGM fibre laser.

The kinetic parameters such as apparent activation energy, pre-exponential factor, rate constant, and reaction constant were calculated for the reactions of corrosion. The inhibition effect is satisfactorily explained by both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Polarization curves show that tween-40 is a cathodic-type inhibitor in sulphuric acid.

In such a case, relativistic hadrons and leptons are produced; the hadrons consist of direct protons and the protons produced through neutron decay in nuclei disintegration process, the leptons consist of positrons accelerated in a realistic magneto-sonic lepton-heavy iron plasma shock, electrons from the neutron decay, direct electrons, and secondary electron/positron pairs in a proton-proton interaction. We calculate the photo-disintegration rate for a nucleus of atomic number A releasing ","46","Disintegration","Atoms - Gamma rays - Hadrons - Magnetosphere - Neutrons - Photons - Pulsars - Shellfish - Tellurium compounds","Gamma rays: theory - High energy neutrinos - ISM: individual objects: Crab Nebula - Non-thermal radiation - Photo-disintegration - Photon-emission properties - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal - Secondary electrons","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.9 Biology - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The first step of the study was to choose the method for collection of the weak SEMG signal. Then the ECG electrode position was chosen in order to record the ECG with a shape similar to that found in the noised SEMGs. At the end, spectrum of the denoised SEMG signal and the variance are analyzed.

The main difference between them is that software process meta-models define an abstract syntax of software process models, while software process modeling languages focus on a concrete syntax. However, they do not take into account a precise description of software process models. Since semantics is essential to describe the meaning of process models for process modelers, it plays a very important role in process model analysis, verification, validation and execution. This paper presents an algebraic method in specifying process models semantics at different levels in the context of a specific metal-model. It aims to precisely express the semantics of process models at meta-model level and completely support process models execution. This work is a first step towards effectively verifying process properties over process models. © 2010 IEEE.","7","Modeling languages","Algebra - Process engineering - Semantics - Software engineering - Syntactics - Visual languages","Algebraic method - Algebraic semantic - Model semantics - Process Modeling - Process properties - Software process - Software process modeling - Software process models","723.1 Computer Programming - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921.1 Algebra",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The present study revealed that cold rolled steel in phosphoric acid has been more efficiently inhibited by o-phenanthroline in the presence of NaCl than single o-phenanthroline, and inhibition efficiency increases with increasing concentration of NaCl in the presence of 0.0002M o-phenanthroline. At a relative higher concentration of NaCl, there is the synergistic effect between o-phenanthroline and NaCl. The adsorption of inhibitor accords with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Polarization studies show that the inhibitor mainly acts as a mixed type inhibitor for steel in 1.0M phosphoric acid. Thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption heat, adsorption entropy and adsorption free energy are obtained from experimental data of the temperature studies of the inhibition process at four temperatures ranging from 30 to 45°C. The kinetic data such as apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor at different concentrations of the inhibitor are calculated, and the effects of the apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor on the corrosion rate of cold rolled steel are discussed. At 40°C, in 1.5-4.0M phosphoric acid, the concentration pre-exponential factor and acid concentration constant are calculated, the synergistic effect has been observed too, and the inhibition efficiency of mixture slowly decreases with increasing concentration of phosphoric acid. A new equation has been used to explain the dependence of corrosion rate on acid concentration. The inhibition action is satisfactorily explained by using both thermodynamic and kinetic models. The results obtained from weight loss method and polarization method are in good agreement. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
