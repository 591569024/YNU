Compared with average trace elemental abundances of ordinary Chinese coals and worldwide hard coals, the Ganhe coal is remarkably rich in chromium (Cr, 389 μg/g) and vanadium (V, 554 μg/g) (on the whole coal basis), which show negative correlations with ash yield. The result from statistical analysis seems to imply predominately the organic association of Cr and V in the Ganhe coal. Furthermore, Cr and/or V were identified in association with Al-Si (muscovite, illite, and pyrophyllite), Fe (pyrite, jarosite, Fe-S-Cr particle, and Fe-Cr-Au particles), and Ti (Ti-oxides) nanominerals in maceral components through further nanoscale mineralogical examination using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Furthermore, compared with Fe-bearing nanominerals in two medium-organic sulfur coals from northeast India (Ribeiro et al., 2010), more types of nanominerals (Al-Si, Fe, Ti nanominerals) are found in the Ganhe SHOS coal. Additionally, in these nanominerals, nano Ti-oxides are associated with the largest proportions of Cr and V. The origin and association mechanism of Cr and/or V bearing nanominerals still need further investigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","","66","High resolution transmission electron microscopy","Aluminum compounds - Chromium - Clay minerals - Coal - Coal deposits - Coal mines - Gold alloys - Iron alloys - Mica - Pyrites - Scanning electron microscopy - Silicate minerals - Sulfur - Ternary alloys - Titanium oxides - Transmission electron microscopy - Vanadium","Elemental abundance - Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometries (EDS) - High organic - Late permian coal - Nanominerals - Negative correlation - Scanning transmission electron microscopy - Ultrafine particle","482.2 Minerals - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 503.1 Coal Mines - 524 Solid Fuels - 543.1 Chromium and Alloys - 543.6 Vanadium and Alloys - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 2014CB238900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41402137, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41602178, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572144, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238900) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41402137, 41602178, 41572144).

However, tl>e heat .source for tlie formation of tin mineralization is still on debate, which may be derived from the mantle material. The Gejiu complex, located in the Yunnan tin- ore belt, Ls mainly composed of granites, mafic and alkaline rocks. These rocks provide .significant information on generation of tin mineralization and magmatic processes. In this paper, we report new zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock major and trace elements and zircon Hf isotope data from the Gejiu complex. The results suggest that the granites ( 81. 43 ±0.46Ma and 82. 89 ±0. 58Ma), gabbrodiorites ( 81. 35 ±0. 22Ma) and alkaline rocks (80. 35 ±0. 72Ma ) emplaced contemporaneously at Late Cretaceous. Although the emplacement time of the three groups of rocks are nearly synchronous, the distinct zircon Hf Isotopes ( +0. 8 ∼ -4. 2 for gabbrodiorites, - 1. 9 ∼ -7.5 for alkaline rocks and +0. 4 ∼- 8. 4 for granites, respectively) indicate they were derived from different source regions. The Gejiu granites are weakly prealuminous and display negative correlation between SiO2and P205contents, arguing against S- Type granite. In addition, their negative anomalies in Zr, Nb, Sr and Eu were resulted from zircon, apatite and feldspar fractionation, the Gejiu granites show low FeOT/MgO ratios and low zircon saturation temperatures, suggesting they arc high fractionated I- Type granite rather than A- Type granite. The Gejiu complex was the production of the magmas from the mantle and crustal materials contemporary. Accordingly, partial melting of the continental crust induced by injection of hot mantle materials which also play an important role in tin mineralization for energy, probably metallogenic material.","","70","Mineralogy","Binary alloys - Feldspar - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Granite - Hafnium - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Ores - Phosphate minerals - Silicate minerals - Tin mines - Trace elements - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Alkaline rocks - Ceochronology - Gejiu complex - Mantle magmas - Tin mineralizations","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482 Mineralogy - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The measured dynamic stress attenuation velocity along the depth within the range of 0~1.2 m under the surface of the subgrade was faster than the calculation results of Boussinesq Theory. The attenuation curves of dynamic stress and acceleration in vertical direction are related to the excitation frequency. When the excitation frequency is less than 15 Hz, both show exponential decay.

The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) are used to extract the waterbodies. Compared with the visual interpretation (VI) of the lakes, the precision of the combined method is greater than 99.7%. A spatiotemporal analysis is also carried out for the lakes. The results show that the water areas of most of the plateau lakes have been stable over the last 16 years, although some years have shown significant changes. However, it should be noted that Lake Qilu and Lake Yilong shrunk significantly after 2011. Moreover, the orientation of the shrinkage is different. Limited evidence suggests that the differences in the area change of the nine plateau lakes are caused by both climate change and human activities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","47","Climate change","Lakes - Time series - Time series analysis","Annual variations - Environmental change - Human activities - Landsat time series - Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) - Object based image analysis (OBIA) - Spatiotemporal analysis - Visual interpretation","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: GCWD201406, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014NGCM05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1608085MD83, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; Number: 1308085MD52, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; Number: 41271443, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41501376, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501376]; [41271443]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1608085MD83]; [1308085MD52]; Open Research Fund Program of the Key Laboratory of Digital Mapping and Land Information Application Engineering, NASG [GCWD201406]; and the Key Laboratory for National Geographic Census and Monitoring, NASG [2014NGCM05].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Mineralization mainly occurs in skarn, which formed along the contacts between porphyry intrusions and limestone host rocks. The ore formation process is suggested to be closely related to the Himalayan age alkaline porphyries. U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons from the Beiya quartz syenite porphyry yields a weighted average206Pb/238U ages of 36.07±0.43Ma (n=25, MSWD=1.17). Calculated isochron age of five molybdenite samples from Beiya is 34.7±1.6Ma (MSWD=0.99, initial187Os of 0.21±0.16ppb), which indicates that mineralization is coeval with the intrusion of the Beiya alkaline porphyry. This age is also in agreement with the results of apatite fission track analysis in the porphyry. Magmatic zircon ΕHf(t) values range from -7.4 to +0.1, which correspond to the two-stage Hf model with ages between 1112Ma and 1588Ma. This finding suggests that the main source of porphyry was probably melting of thickened Mesoproterozoic lower crust triggered by partial melting of the lithospheric mantle. Zircon Ce (IV)/Ce (III) ratios of ore-related porphyry are high (given that all EuN/EuN* ratios are above 0.4), which demonstrates that the magma source of the porphyry was highly oxidized, which was favorable for Cu-Au mineralization. The medium Re concentrations in molybdenite (Re=2.08-20.54ppm) suggest that the ore-forming materials were characterized by mixed crustal-mantle sources. Mineralization in the Beiya deposit was one of the many metallogenic events related to the India-Eurasia collision that was responsible for the fertile deep-sourced magmatism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","68","Gold deposits","Binary alloys - Cerium compounds - Copper alloys - Deposits - Fission reactions - Geochronology - Gold alloys - Lead alloys - Lime - Melting - Mineralogy - Osmium alloys - Phosphate minerals - Silicate minerals - Tectonics - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Alkaline porphyry - Isotopic composition - Molybdenite Re-Os dating - Sanjiang area - Zircon U-Pb dating","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 932.2.1 Fission and Fusion Reactions",,"Number: 200805580031, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2009CB421006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452604-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2002CB412610, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1302233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40830425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41373012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40673045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1302233 , 40830425 , 40673045 , 41373012 ), the National Key Basic Research Program (Nos. 2015CB452604-03 , 2009CB421006 , 2002CB412610 ) from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China , Higher school specialized research fund for the doctoral program funding issue (No. 200805580031 ) and the Project Supported by Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme ( 2011 ).

The genesis of the deposit has long been debated and the sources of the ore-forming fluids and metals are controversial. This study presents rare earth element (REE) and noble gas isotope data that constrain the origins of the ore fluids and the heat source driving the hydrothermal circulation. The early-stage sulfides are enriched in light REEs and have high ∑REE values (30.8–94.8 ppm) and weakly negative Eu (δEu 0.85–0.89) and Ce anomalies (δCe 0.84–0.95), suggesting that the fluids were likely derived from dissolution of Upper Triassic marine carbonates with input of REEs from aluminosilicate rocks in the basin. In contrast, the late-stage sulfides have irregular REE patterns, generally low ∑REE values (0.24–10.8 ppm) and positive Eu (δEu 1.22–10.9) and weakly negative Ce anomalies (δCe 0.53–0.90), which suggest that the ore-forming fluids interacted with evaporite minerals. The3He/4He (0.01–0.04 Ra) and40Ar/36Ar values (301–340) of the ore-forming fluids indicate crustal and atmospheric origins for these noble gases. These findings are in agreement with the published fluid inclusion microthermometry data and the results of H, O, C, S, Pb and Sr isotope studies.

The deposit occurs within a felsic volcanic dome belonging to a mid-Silurian volcanic belt stretching for more than 100km from Dapingzhang to Sandashan. The mineralized volcanic rocks are predominantly keratophyre and quartz keratophyre with subordinate spilite. The Dapingzhang deposit is characterized by well-developed vertical zonation with stockwork ores in the bottom, disseminated sulfide ores in the middle, and massive sulfide ores in the top, overlain by a thin layer of chemical sedimentary exhalative rocks (chert and barite). The Re-Os age of the pyrites from the deposit is 417±23Ma, indistinguishable from the age of the associated felsic volcanic rocks. The associated felsic volcanic rocks are characterized by negative Nb-Ta anomalies and positive ΕNd(t) values (+4.4-+6.5), similar to the coeval calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in the region. This observation supports the interpretation that the felsic volcanic rocks associated with the Dapingzhang deposit are the derivatives of arc basaltic magma by extensive fractional crystallization. The δ34S values of the sulfides from the deposit vary from -1.24 to +4.32‰, indicating a predominantly magmatic source for the sulfur. The sulfides are also characterized by homogeneous and relatively low radiogenic Pb isotope compositions (206Pb/204Pb=18.310-18.656,207Pb/204Pb=15.489-15.643 and208Pb/204Pb=37.811-38.662), similar to the Pb isotopic compositions of the associated volcanic rocks. The Pb isotopic data indicate that mantle-derived Pb is more prevalent than crust-derived Pb in the deposit. The S-Pb isotopic data indicate that the important ore-forming materials were mainly derived from the associated volcanic rocks. The δ13CPDBand δ18OSMOWvalues of the associated hydrothermal calcite crystals vary from -2.3‰ to +0.27‰ and from +14.6 to +24.4‰, respectively. These values are between the mantle and marine carbonate values. The narrow range of the δ13CPDBvalues for the calcite indicates that carbon-bearing species in the hydrothermal fluids were primarily derived from marine carbonates. The δ18O values for the hydrothermal fluids, calculated from the measured values for quartz, are between -2.1‰ and +3.5‰. The corresponding δD values for the fluids range from -59‰ to -84‰. The O-H isotopic data indicate mixing between magmatic fluids and seawater in the ore-forming hydrothermal system. Similar to a typical volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, the ore-forming fluids contained both magmatic fluids and heated seawater; the ore metals and regents were derived from the underlying magma as well as felsic country rocks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","97","Volcanic rocks","Alkalinity - Binary alloys - Calcite - Cobalt deposits - Copper compounds - Copper lead zinc deposits - Deposits - Economic geology - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead zinc deposits - Neodymium alloys - Niobium alloys - Pyrites - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Seawater - Sedimentary rocks - Sedimentology - Sulfur compounds - Tantalum alloys - Ternary alloys - Volcanoes - Zinc sulfide","Arc magmatism - C-h-o isotopes - Pb-zn deposits - Re-Os isotopes - SW China","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: KZZD-EW-TZ-20, Acronym: -, Sponsor: CAS-SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams; Number: 2009CB421003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41273049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: SKLOG-ZY125-06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2009CB421003 ), the CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams (Intraplate Mineralization Research Team; KZZD-EW-TZ-20 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41273049 ), and the State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry (12th Five-Year Plan: SKLOG-ZY125-06 ).

Because of access difficulties and low population density, baseline information about natural and human-induced disturbances in these regions is often limited or nonexistent. Landsat time series offer invaluable opportunities to reconstruct past land cover changes. However, the applicability of this approach strongly depends on the availability of good quality, cloud-free images, acquired at a regular time interval, which in mountainous regions are often difficult to find. The present study analyzed burn scar detection capabilities of 11 widely used spectral indices (SI) at 1 to 5 years after fire events in four dominant vegetation groups in a mountainous region of northwest Yunnan, China. To evaluate their performances, we usedM-statistic as a burned-unburned class separability index, and we adapted an existing metric to quantify the SI residual burn signal at post-fire dates compared to the maximum severity recorded soon after the fire. Our results show that Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) are always among the three best performers for the detection of burn scars starting 1 year after fire but not for the immediate post-fire assessment, where the Mid Infrared Burn Index, Burn Area Index, and Tasseled Cap Greenness were superior. Brightness andWetness peculiar patterns revealed long-term effects of fire in vegetated land, suggesting their potential integration to assist other SI in burned area detection several years after the fire event. However, in general, class separability of most of the SI was poor after one growing season, due to the seasonal rains and the relatively fast regrowth rate of shrubs and grasses, confirming the difficulty of assessment in mountainous ecosystems. Our findings are meaningful for the selection of a suitable SI to integrate in burned area detection workflows, according to vegetation type and time lag between image acquisitions. © 2018 by the authors.","","77","Fires","Biodiversity - Ecosystems - Fire hazards - Image acquisition - Population statistics - Time series - Vegetation","Burn scar detections - Burned areas - Landsat time series - Mountainous regions - Normalized difference moisture indices - Population densities - Residual severity - Spectral indices","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 31560118, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31560599, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31560599 and 31560118), and Science Foundation of Yunnan (2015FB157).

Based on the paragenesis sequence of the Fule deposit, the major elements and trace elements of gangue minerals were analyzed via Electron Probe Microanalyze ( EPMA) and Laser Abrasion ( LA) -ICPMS. Trace elements of carbonate in the Fule deposit reveal that there is a trend from various Eu anomaly to positive Eu anomaly and from a strong negative Ce anomaly to weak negative Ce anomaly, indicating precipitation of sulfide and dolomite are due to decreases of f02, temperature and pH. There is a trend of decrease of Fe and Mn from early to late mineralization, indicating Fe and Mn were released in a low pH environment and incorporated into dolomite. The Sr concentration of carbonate show an increasing trend, indicating the fluid continued to react with the wall rock, incorporating more Sr. Dolomite and calcite Fe-Sr and Mn-Sr iilustrate that there are mixing of two fluids.

High-resolution diatom analysis of a14C-dated sediment core retrieved from Lugu Lake, Yunnan provides a detailed history of palaeoenvironment changes from 30,000 to 10,000cal. yr BP. A model of climate-diatom interactions (linking thermal stratification, ice cover and catchment-derived nutrients) isproposed to explain the observed changes. Prior to 24,500cal. yr BP the dominance of the planktonic Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica indicates a period of stable stratification and low nutrient levels, with a moderate change of temperature and precipitation in the southwest monsoon region. During the LGM (24,500-14,500cal. yr BP), the loss of the planktonic diatoms and a switch to small Fragilaria spp. suggest an altered thermal regime in the lake (i.e. weaker stratification and possibly ice cover). From ~18,000cal. yr BP, the expansion of planktonic taxa (Stephanodiscus and the Asterionella formosa) and increased %TOC are indicative of increased nutrient availability reflecting altered vegetation and soil processes due to rising regional temperatures. After 14,500cal. yr BP, a rapid reversal to dominance by planktonic diatoms indicates a further increase in temperature and continued development of catchment vegetation and soils. The abrupt changes in diatom species composition around 24,500 and 14,500cal. yr BP suggest that the ecological status of the lake exceeded limnological thresholds. Interestingly, however, the Younger Dryas event is not clearly recognizable in either the diatom or pollen records in the Lugu Lake sediment record. In a partial redundancy analysis, 44.2% of the variability in the total diatom assemblages in the period 30,000-10,000cal. yr BP was accounted for by changes in summer solar radiation. The relationships between the diatom assemblages and the C/N and pollen data are further evidence of climate-catchment-vegetation interactions and their impact on lake functioning. The composition of diatom assemblages in the Lugu Lake sediment core reflects direct and indirect (i.e. via catchment processes) climate forcing and in particular, the strength of the southwest monsoon, which in turn corresponds to orbitally-induced variability in Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation from 30,000cal. yr BP to 10,000cal. yr BP. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","101","Climate models","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Catchments - Ecology - Glacial geology - Ice - Lakes - Nutrients - Phytoplankton - Runoff - Sediments - Solar radiation - Thermal stratification - Vegetation","Change of temperatures - Ice cover - Lake-sediment records - Last Glacial Maximum - Monsoon climate - Nutrient availability - Palaeoecology - Stable stratification","442.1 Flood Control - 443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: NIGLAS2012135004, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2010CB950201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41272379, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Royal Society; ","We thank Guobang Tong for providing pollen data, and also thank Zhengtang Guo, Houyuan Lu and Luo Wang for their helpful discussions and suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript.

There are a series of small to medium-sized Au and Pb–(Zn) deposits around this intrusion. Those deposits are spatially associated with the Habo alkaline intrusion. (1) The δ34S values of sulfides from Au deposits range from −1.91 ‰ to 2.69 ‰, which are similar to those of Pb–(Zn) deposits (−3.82 ‰ to −0.05 ‰) and both indicate a much greater contribution from magma. (2) The Habo alkaline intrusion has relatively homogeneous Pb isotopic compositions with206Pb/204Pb ranging from 18.608 to 18.761,207Pb/204Pb from 15.572 to 15.722 and208Pb/204Pb from 38.599 to 39.110. These Pb isotope ratios are similar to those of Au deposits, whose206Pb/204Pb range from 18.564 to 18.734,207Pb/204Pb from 15.582 to 15.738 and208Pb/204Pb from 38.592 to 39.319. Pb ratios in both the intrusion and Au deposits suggest that Pb mainly derived from the depth, probably represents a mixture of mantle and crust. Pb–(Zn) deposits, however, show a decentralized trait, and most of them are similar to that of the alkaline intrusion with206Pb/204Pb ranging from 18.523 to 18.648,207Pb/204Pb from 15.599 to 15.802, and208Pb/204Pb from 38.659 to 39.206. (3) In the plumbotectonic diagram207Pb/204Pb versus206Pb/204Pb, almost all of Au and Pb–(Zn) deposits have the same projection area with the Habo alkaline intrusion, which indicates that those deposits almost share the same source with the alkaline intrusion. (4) Isotopic age of the Habo alkaline intrusion is 36–33 Ma, which is similar to that of Beiya, whose ore-related alkaline porphyries age is 38–31 Ma and molybdenite Re–Os age is 36.9 Ma. Therefore, along with S–Pb isotope traits, we suggest that the Habo Au and Pb–(Zn) deposits should be typically Ailaoshan-Red RiverCenozoicalkaline-related deposits and ore-forming ages of these deposits should be later than that of the Habo alkaline intrusion. © 2016, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","47","Gold deposits","Deposits - Gold - Isotopes - Sulfur compounds","Alkaline intrusion - Genetic relationships - Isotopic composition - Ore genesis - Pb isotope ratios - Pb isotopes - Projection area - Source material","547.1 Precious Metals",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results indicated that the contribution rates of TN and TP loads from non-point source (NPS) (i. e., 74.2% and 68.0%, respectively) were more than that from point source (i. e., 25.8% and 32.0%, respectively) during 2008.For TN loads, the magnitude order of the contribution of NPS was as follows: land use > atmospheric precipitation > rural life > livestock. For TP loads, the magnitude order was as follows: land use > rural life > atmospheric precipitation > livestock. Also, Contribution rates of TN loads from NPS in Baoxianghe watershed were larger than that in Lake Dianchi watershed, the contribution rates of TP loads from NPS in Baoxianghe watershed was close to that in Lake Dianchi watershed. Furthermore, average relative errors of IECM to estimate the TN and TP loads were 15% and -6%, respective. In comparison, the average relative errors of conventional export coefficient model were 54% for TN loads and 17% for TP loads.

In many applications, masking PCA has been used to create subsets of samples or sub-areas to enhance the effect of the main objects of interest. In this paper we suggest how the representativeness of samples or pixels can be quantified using a fuzzy membership function based on fuzzy set theory. In this new method, the relative importance of pixels or samples can be taken into account using a multivariate statistical method such as PCA. A Fuzzy Masking PCA is proposed and implemented in GeoDAS GIS on the basis of a spatially weighted PCA (SWPCA). This paper introduces the mathematical treatment of the fuzzy masking PCA and follows a case study of identifying the locations of intrusive bodies from geochemical data in the Gejiu mineral district in Yunnan, China. Power-law functions based on the inverse distance from mapped felsic intrusions are applied as weighting functions in FMPCA. The results indicate that fuzzy mask PCA increases the signal-noise ratio of the component representing igneous intrusions and decreases the influence of sedimentary rocks.

Geological surveys (the Guichao and Dongbo Sheets at a scale of 1: 50000) in the Funning area conducted by this study show that diabase sheets or dikes not only intrude into Paleozoic strata, but also penetrate arc-related basaltic andesites (ca. 255 ∼ 241 Ma) and low-middle Triassic strata (the Luolou Formation and Beifeng Formation, respectively). These geological facts clearly indicate that the emplacement of the mafic intrusive rocks in the Funing area was occurred after the Middle Triassic and significantly later than the Emeishan plume (ca. 263 ∼252Ma). In addition, these mafic rocks are also significantly distinct from the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in the rock types and assemblages. Therefore, the geological facts presented in this study come to a conclusion that the mafic intrusive rocks in the Funing area are the product of magmatism after collision orogeny between the South China and Indochina blocks (Indosinian orogeny), rather than the part of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province. © 2017 Science Press.

However its palaeoenvironmental significance is unclear. Several studies suggest that the occurrence of a large amount of Pediastrum indicates a gradually decreasing lake-level, while others point out that Pediastrum mainly occurs in the deep areas of lakes. Thus clarifying the relationship between Pediastrum and lake levels is of great importance for improving the reliability of palaeoenviromental reconstruction. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of Pediastrum in Xingyun Lake, a semi-enclosed shallow fault and eutrophic lake located in central Yunnan Province, southwest China. We obtained 4 lake surface water samples at water depths of 4, 4.5, 5.2 and 6.5 m; 16 water samples collected at various depths within the water column at the deepest part of the lake; and 10 lake surface sediment samples taken at different water depths from the lake shore to the deepest part using a Grab sampler. We present the results of Pediastrum analysis of samples of both the lake water and surface sediments of Xingyun Lake and discuss the relationship between the Pediastrum distribution and the lake-level/water depth. The variation of the fossil records during the past 3000 years is also reported. The results show that two types of Pediastrum were identified in the water and lake sediment samples, including Pediastrum boryanum and Pediastrum simplex. The concentration of Pediastrum in the water samples is extremely low, varying from 2 to 6 grains mL-1. Spatially, the concentrations of Pediastrum in the surface lake water samples exhibit little change with increasing water depth. In terms of the depth variation within the water column in the deepest part of the lake, the Pediastrum concentration of the bottom sample is the highest, which may be related to the effects of resuspension and redeposition of lake sediments caused by wind-induced turbulence in shallow water. With respect to the lake surface sediment samples, the Pediastrum content is relatively high. The concentration of Pediastrum varies from 60700 to 104000 grains g-1, with an average of 81000 grains g-1; and the relative percentage abundance ranges from 66%-80%, averaging around 76%. Interestingly, both the concentration and percentage content of Pediastrum in these samples exhibit no significant relationship with water depth. Based on comparison of the results from Xingyun Lake with those of other workers, we conclude that the relationship between the Pediastrum distribution and water depth inferred from the lake sediments of several relatively larger lakes mentioned in previous studies may be caused by depositional processes: turbulence resulting from wave activity in these larger lakes could result in the resuspension of Pediastrum in shallow water and its focusing into deeper areas. However, whether or not there is a large quantity of Pediastrum living in the lake water may be related to the physicochemical status of the lake water, determined by factors such as the river input, nutrient level, temperature, pH and salinity. In addition, these factors may vary between different lakes in different regions. Therefore, the variation of Pediastrum content cannot be used as an indicator of water depth or lake-level without careful consideration of these factors. In addition, it needs to be used in the context of multi-proxy studies. Both the percentage and the concentration of fossil Pediastrum in the sediments of Xingyun Lake exhibit distinct features over the last 3000 years: very low values before 2000 cal a BP followed by a rising trend, and then an abrupt increase after 1500 cal a BP. This is consistent with variations in the intensity of human activity revealed by frequent high-amplitude fluctuations in mean grain-size and by an abrupt increase in magnetic susceptibility. In addition, the abrupt changes in fossil Pediastrum in Xingyun Lake precede those of mean grain-size and magnetic susceptibility, suggesting that the Pediastrum from the Xingyun Lake sediments may be a sensitive indicator of the process of lake water eutrophication caused by human activities. © 2016, Science Press.

Dating by 40Ar/39Ar of hydrothermal sericite grains collected from adededeltaaaered rocks near auriferous quartz veins at Zhesang gold deposit yielded a plateau age of 215. 3 ± 1. 9Ma, which is highly consistent with zircon U-Pb age (215 ± 5Ma) of the mafic rock in a nearby area. It is inferred that there might exist contemporaneous buried intrusions in the Zhesang deposit. The deep-seated magma, resudededeltaaaed from the post-coUision of the IndoChina Block with the South China Block, triggered fluids of possibly meteoric origin to circulate and leach out ore-forming elements from sedimentary rocks to form the Zhesang Carlin-Type gold deposit.","","48","Gold deposits","Binary alloys - Deposits - Geochronology - Graphical user interfaces - Lead alloys - Sedimentary rocks - Silicate minerals - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Ar-Ar dating - Dynamic background - Gold mineralization - Indosinian orogenies - Metallogenesis - Ore-forming elements - South China block - Zircon U-Pb dating","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This is a key problem of islanded operation. The dynamic process of voltage can be divided into several phases. This paper analyzes the major factors influencing the overvoltage level in different phases. The overvoltage in hundreds of milliseconds after disturbance in phase two is lower than that of phase one, but the duration is longer and the criterion of voltage is higher. The voltage level of this phase is notably affected by excitation control of generators. The short-circuit ratio is closely related to the overvoltage level and the short-circuit ratio differs from phase to phase. The voltage control of the generator high-voltage-side increases the short-circuit ratio of phase two after disturbance and mitigates the overvoltage by reducing the electrical distance between the constant voltage source and the system. The rational voltage level and reactive power distribution in normal operation is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the high-voltage-side voltage control is verified by simulation results. © 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press","","19","Electric machine control","Electric generators - Electrolysis - HVDC power transmission - Voltage control","High voltage - Islanded DC sending system - Load compensation - Over-voltages - Short circuit ratio","705.2 Electric Generators - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 731.2 Control System Applications - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To explore the local effects of bare rocks within different seasons, soil moisture was measured in a KRD region (Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, southwest China) at different depths and in different directions and distances from rock outcrops in both the dry and the wet seasons. The soil moisture north and east of the rocks was higher compared to the other directions and to the control plot. This effect is attributed to the shading by the rocks. The shading effect is evident in all seasons but more pronounced in the dry season. In the wet season, the directional dependency is restricted to the surface layer and the increase in soil moisture with depth is more pronounced around the rocks than at the control plot. This is attributed to precipitation-induced runoff from the rock outcrops infiltrating into the deeper layers at the rock–soil interface. These findings suggest the redistribution of water in the wet season and the spatial variation of evapotranspiration in the dry season are factors controlling the local soil moisture pattern around the rock outcrops. © 2016, The Author(s).","","36","Soil surveys","Climatology - Drought - Landforms - Moisture meters - Rocks - Soil moisture","Bare bedrocks - Dry and wet seasons - Ecological process - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) - Seasonal changes - Soil interfaces - Soil moisture distribution - Spatial variations","443 Meteorology - 444 Water Resources - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 944.1 Moisture Measuring Instruments",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is therefore a nice prototype to study the natural and/or anthropogenic influences on the arsenic geochemistry of the sediment in highland lakes. In this study, lacustrine sediments were recovered from the lake and the differences in the occurrence of arsenic between the surface (0–10 cm depth) and sub-surface sediments (>20 cm) were investigated. The arsenic distribution in the sub-surface sediment was in accordance with the locations of springs, suggesting that arsenic therein was affected by groundwater. The surface sediment, however, was affected by human contamination carried by Yangzong River. In the sub-surface sediment, arsenic concentrations increased with pH values but decreased with redox potentials. Higher grain sizes corresponded to lower arsenic contents. Arsenic was strongly positively correlated with Sb and Bi due to their similar geochemical behaviors. In the surface sediment, however, the human activities increased the arsenic concentration in the sediment and weakened the correlations between arsenic occurrence, pH/Eh values, grain size, and trace metals. Although the average differences in the trace element concentrations between surface and sub-surface sediments over the entire Yangzonghai Lake were less than 15 %, the pairwise differences were statistically significant, and the southern portion of the lake showed the greatest anthropogenic influence. This research will provide important information on the geochemistry and environmental science of arsenic in fault-controlled highland lakes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","64","Arsenic","Grain size and shape - Groundwater - Groundwater geochemistry - Lakes - Redox reactions - Surficial sediments - Trace elements","Anthropogenic influence - Arsenic concentration - Correlation coefficient - Environmental concerns - Environmental science - Geochemical behaviors - Lacustrine sediments - Trace element concentrations","444.2 Groundwater - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The data show that the principal sulfide minerals (galena, sphalerite and pyrite) in the four orebodies are enriched in heavy sulfur, the δ34S values between 10.9‰ and 17.7‰ and where δ34Spyrite > δ34Ssphalerite > δ34Sgalena. The δ34S values of sulfide are close to that of the sulfates from the carbonate strata within the region.

In a case study of each county in the region, we used the method of ecological footprint to study spatiotemporal change of ecological capacity in different period. We compared the values of ecological capacity with that calculated by the theory of net primary productivity (NPP for short) in order to analyze the differences between two methods. The results showed as follow: (1) Ecological capacity of Lancang River Valley reduced year by year. (2) Ecological capacity had a negative correlation with population density. But its pattern of distributing was consistent with that of ecological capacity. (3) Ecological capacity Calculated by NPP increased gradually from north to south. Comparing with two methods, ecological capacity calculated by NPP was considered as maximum capacity in theoretical, and that by ecological footprint as real value. © 2008 IEEE.","","15","Rivers","Bioinformatics - Biomedical engineering - Ecosystems - Landforms - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Population statistics","Biological resources - Ecological capacity - Ecological fooeprint - Ecological footprint - Lancang River - Net primary productivity - Population densities - Spatio-temporal changes","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.1 Geology - 741.1 Light/Optics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By interpreting the wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profile between Zhefang and Binchuan, which crosses Tengchong and Baoshan blocks in Dianxi (western Yunnan) tectonic zone, we reconstruct the crustal structure with seismic traveltime tomography for crustal P-wave velocity and the seismic scattering image for crustal seismic reflection structure. In this paper, we firstly present the crustal structure images of P-wave velocity and seismic reflection under the wide-angle seismic profile. These results demonstrate that, the crustal velocity structure and seismic reflection structure along the profile can be divided into 3 segments, and there is an obvious difference of crustal structure among the eastern, the western and the middle segment. Generally, crustal P-wave velocities in the Baoshan segment are 0.1 -0.2 km/s slower and seismic reflection amplitudes from Moho discontinuity are stronger than the other 2 segments. In the studied area, crustal thickness is about 40 km, and shows the thickening tendency from west to east along the profile. Additionally, it can be seen that there is one strong-amplitude seismic reflection event as bright points at the depths of 8-10 km, along the segment of 80-115 km of the profile (southward of Tengchong); and seismic reflection wave-field from Moho discontinuity varies obviously along the lateral direction. Finally, we make some discussions on the crustal thickening pattern in the Sanjiang fault belt, structural environment of earthquake development and the contact relationship between the Tengchong block, Banshan block and Luxi trough.

The average ω (TP) in YN was (1256±621) mg/kg, which was higher than that in MLYR [(601±76)mg/kg]. Soil erosion resulted in the higher content of calcium bound phosphorus (HCl-P) in the sediments of YN, and the high salinity of their lake water were conductive to phosphorus burial. High organic matter content in sediments also inhibited the migration of phosphorus in lakes of YN, and the SWI Pfluxwas 0.17~1.07 mg/(m2·d). However, in MLYR phosphorus forms were closely related to non-point source nutrient pollution and phytoplankton bloom, and redox sensitive phosphorus (BD-P) accounted for the majority of TP. The potential mobile phosphorus (the sum of loosely adsorbed P, BD-P, NaOH bound P) accounted for 60.60% of TP, which was around 2 times of that in YN, and its SWI Pfluxwas 0.002~1.32 mg/(m2·d). Thus, measures including reducing agricultural nonpoint source pollution, maintaining and recovering macrophytes in lakes should be taken to improve water quality in MLYR.

After stepwise thermal demagnetization, the high-temperature component magnetization with unblocking temperature of around 680 °C is isolated. Positive field tests show that the high-temperature component magnetization from 25 sites is primary for the Cretaceous formations. A tilt-corrected mean direction is D = 59.9°, I = 45.2° with α95 = 5.1°, corresponding to a paleopole at 35.8°N, 173.1°E with A95 = 5.6°. Comparison with Cretaceous paleomagnetic pole of the whole China block indicates that amount of clockwise rotation in the Pu'er area is evaluated to be 46 ± 9° with respect to the whole China block, which is consistent with large amount of rotation in the Mengla and Jinggu areas (47° and 66°) in the central part of the Simao Terrane. Clockwise rotation of the central part is larger by more than 20° compared to the Yunlong and Yongping areas of northern part of the Simao Terrane, suggesting that the Simao Terrane experienced internal deformation. The southward displacement of the Pu'er area expected from inclination data is 7.5 ± 6.6° with respect to the Chuan Dian fragment, which is a similar estimate to other areas in the Simao Terrane and the Indochina block.

A lot of phenomena in earthquake observations such as aftershock distribution, stress shadow, earthquake interaction and migration were well explained based on the theory of earthquake stress interaction. It is important that understanding the process of earthquake interaction could give an insight into the physical mechanism of earthquake cycle, and could help us assess the seismic hazard in future. It has long been recognized that regional stress accumulated by tectonic motion is released when earthquake occurs. When earthquakes occur, the accumulated stress does not vanish completely, but is redistributed through the process of stress transfer, and then the redistributed stress may trigger potential earthquakes. The increment of Coulomb failure stress loading in the certain regions may improve the seismic activities. By contrast, the decrement of Coulomb failure stress in the areas of stress shadow where the stress on faults may unload could lead to the decrement of seismic activities. On August 3, 2014, an MS6.5 earthquake occurred in Zhaotong-Ludian region, Yunnan Province, China, killing and injuring hundreds of people. Therefore, it is critical to outline the areas with potential aftershocks before reconstruction and re-settlement so as to avoid future disasters. Based on the elastic dislocation theory and multi-layered lithospheric model, we calculate the co-stress changes caused by the Zhaotong-Ludian earthquakes to discuss its influences on aftershock distribution and surrounding faults. It is shown that the Coulomb stress changes based on the rupture in the NNW direction can explain better the aftershock distribution. It indicates that the NNW direction may represent the real rupture. The aftershocks mainly distribute in the regions with increased stress along main rupture and west to the rupture. In other regions with increased stress, the distributions of aftershock are rare which may indicate the low tectonic stress accumulation in these regions. The stress accumulation and corresponding seismic hazard on the southern part of Zhaotong Fault, Qiaojia segment of Zemuhe-Xiaojiang Fault and northeastern part of Lianfeng Fault are further increased by the Zhaotong-Ludian earthquake. We should pay special attention to the southern part of Zhaotong Fault where seismic activity is very high in recently years and the increment of Coulomb failure stress in this area is more than 0.1bar(0.1bar is the threshold of earthquake triggering). In order to make a more objective and comprehensive discussion, we calculate the sensitivity of the parameters such as effective coefficient of friction, the calculated depth and multilayered crustal model. © 2015, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.

Therefore, various testing methods such as environmental scanning electronic microscope (ESEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), the pore specific surface area measurement, and isothermal adsorption/desorption experiments were used to analyze microscopic pore types and pore structures of the shale cores. The following results were obtained. First, nanopores are well developed in the Qiongzhusi shale where the types of matrix pores include interclay mineral pores, organic pores, inter-crystalline pores, mineral moldic pores, and secondary dissolution pores, featured by a small specific surface area and large surface porosity. Second, the main factors controlling the microscopic pore structure there are organic content (TOC), kerogen type, types and content of clay minerals, and thermal maturity (Ro), among which thermal maturity is the most significant. At the overmature stage, the specific surface area and pore volume decrease sharply with the increase of thermal maturity. In conclusion, the reason for the revelation from the drilling data in the study area is that after a long period of geological process and rather high thermal evolution, microscopic pore structure characteristics such as a sharp decrease of micropores, the significantly reduced pore volume and pore specific surface area, etc. are unfavorable for gas adsorption and accumulation in the overmature Qiongzhusi shale.","","35","Nanopores","Atomic force microscopy - Gas adsorption - Organic minerals - Pore structure - Shale - Shale gas - Specific surface area - Well drilling","Gas potential - Guizhou Province - Main controlling factors - Microscopic pore structures - Permian","482.2 Minerals - 522 Gas Fuels - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Laminae are formed of silicified Calothrix mats or featureless opal-A that contains no microbes, scattered spherical and rod-shaped microbes, and/or rare Calothrix. Rapid silicification of the Calothrix led to preservation of their basal heterocysts, vegetative cells, trichomes, tapering filaments, and laminated and splayed sheaths.The Calothrix mats grew during the dry season when there was maximum sunlight because of low cloud cover. During this time, the mats grew under stable conditions because the water that flowed across the discharge apron was sourced from the springs, and temperature and water geochemistry was more or less constant. Growth of the Calothrix mats decreased during the wet season (April to late September) when sunlight is reduced due to the extensive cloud cover associated with the monsoonal rains. During the wet season, water flowing over the discharge apron is a mixture of rainwater, runoff from the surrounding hillsides, and spring water. Such variable flow conditions, water temperatures, and water geochemistry curtailed microbe growth and impacted silica precipitation.The precipitates at Meinuquan are like those associated with some Icelandic hot springs. Although growth of Calothrix is controlled by sunlight in both settings, the periods of maximum sunlight in China (October-March) and Iceland (June-August) are at different times of the year because of their geographic locations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","93","Plants (botany)","Bacteria - Groundwater - Hot springs - Hydrochemistry - Laminating - Silica","Calothrix - Geographic location - Microbe silicification - Opal-A - Seasonal laminae - Vegetative cells - Water geochemistries - Water temperatures","444.2 Groundwater - 481.2 Geochemistry - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 816.1 Processing of Plastics and Other Polymers",,"Number: SIDSSE1301, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: A6090, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41272370, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Samples used in this study were collected with the permission of Yunnan Tengchong Rehai Tour Developing Co., Ltd., which is the administration section of the Rehai geothermal area.

The objective of our study is to provide a state-of-the-art model and a large-scale numerical simulation platform, on which estimation of the risk of large earthquake triggering sequences can be carried out in a middle or long-term time scale with realistic data and constrains inputted from field observation and geological survey. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","","50","Numerical models","Cutting - Data handling - Earthquakes - Risk perception - Simulation platform - Stresses","Finite element approximations - Initial stress field - Parallel data processing - Parallel simulations - Regional earthquakes - Seismic processing - Sichuan - Unstructured meshes","484 Seismology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 40774049, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 2008CB425701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: INF105-SCE-02-12, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","Received June 12, 2008; accepted December 18, 2009 doi: 10.1007/s11430-009-0138-4 &dagger;Corresponding author (email: hzhang@gucas.ac.cn) Equal contributors (email: * wuzhl@gucas.ac.cn, ** shiyl@gucas.ac.cn) Supported by National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2008CB425701) and National Natrual Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40774049, 40474038)We thank Peizhen Zhang and Xiwei Xu from Institute of Geology, Chinese Earthquake Administration for the constructive discussions and data required by the numerical modeling.

The deposit is hosted within coal seams of the Miocene Bangmai Formation, deposited on top of a Ge-rich granite batholith. The Bangmai Formation is divided into eight units among which three are coal-bearing. The Ge-bearing coal seams are inter-layered with siliceous rocks and siliceous limestones in the basal coal-bearing unit. The coal seams of the other two coal-bearing units are not interbedded with siliceous rocks and siliceous limestones, and are also barren with respect to Ge. Equant or elongate Ge-orebodies are generally located at fault intersections. Germanium is mainly associated with organic matter within the coal seams and is concentrated at the top and bottom of the coal seams, where the latter are in contact with the layered siliceous rocks or siliceous limestones. Major and trace element contents, and O- and C-isotopes of the siliceous rocks and siliceous limestones, are similar to those of hydrothermal sediments, indicating formation by hydrothermal sedimentation. Compared with barren coals, Ge-rich coals are notably rich in Nb, Li, Sb, W, Bi and U and show substantial enrichment of HREE which increase together with Ge. Germanium-rich coals contain disseminated pyrite with δ34S ranging from 17.2 to 51.4‰, similar to pyrite in barren coals, and thin vein-like pyrite with δ34S ranging from - 5.4 to 1.9‰, similar to sulfides in granite-related quartz veins. We propose that circulating hydrothermal fluids leached abundant Ge and other elements from Ge-rich granites in the basement, and were then discharged into the basin, mainly along fault intersections, to form layer-like siliceous rocks and siliceous limestones by depositing Si and Ca. The deposit was formed via interaction between Ge in the fluids and organic matter in the coal seams. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Soil budgets were determined from the difference between precipitation input (including nutrient leaching from canopy) and output via runoff and drainage. The forest was characterized by low canopy interception and surface runoff, and high percolation and stream flow. Concentrations of nutrients were increased in throughfall and stemflow compared with precipitation. Surface runoff and drainage water had higher nutrient concentrations than precipitation and stream water. Total nitrogen and NH4+-N concentrations were higher in soil water than stream water, whereas K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations were lower in the former than the latter. Annual nutrient fluxes decreased with soil depth following the pattern of water flux. Annual losses of most nutrient elements via stream flow were less than the corresponding inputs via throughfall and stemflow, except for calcium, for which solute loss was greater than the inputs via precipitation.

This is a composite complex that is composed of two-period intrusions (biotite granite of Late Triassic and porphyry monzogranite of Late Cretaceous) in Xiuwacu district, while the W-Mo deposit was formed during 82 ∼ 86Ma. However, there are no explicit reports about the relationship between these two intrusions of different ages and whether the Late Triassic intrusion had contributed to the W-Mo metallogenesis. So, the authors try to answer these questions by geochronology, oxygen fugacity and other ways, after the research of their forming dating and geochemistry characteristics of these two intrusions, wishing to reveal their metallogenic characteristics and offer some theoretical support for the prospecting practice. Research shows that the crystalline age of biotite granite is 211. 7 ±2. 6Ma with high SiO2(69. 48% ∼ 73. 73%), belonging to shoshonitic series, metalumnious, enrichment of LREE and LILE, depleted in HREE and HFSE of Nb, Sr, Ti, with weak negative Eu abnormal, high magmatic oxygen fugacity (fo2= - 19. 4 ∼ -9. 1, average - 13.7); While the crystalline age of porphyry monzogranite is 76. 8 ±3. 8Ma with the age in a core of the zircon grains as 219 ±2. 6Ma, and the rock has the similar geochemical characteristics with the former, high SiO2(67. 35% ∼ 75. 65%), belonging to shoshonitic series, metalumnious, but the rock has higher REE (higher than the biotite granite), significant negative Eu anomaly (greater than the biotite granite), relatively lower magmatic oxygen fugacity (fo2= - 30. 4 ∼ - 18. 2, average - 23. 4). Based on the above, combining with the widely distributed of faults in Xiuwacu district, two periods intrusions are contacted with each other along F4with nearly SN strike, and the NW strike wrench faults (F1-F3) are ore control structures. This paper argues that there was an inheritance relation between the later porphyry monzogranite and the former biotite granite. The biotite granite was rooted in fraction melting of the lower crust just over the Ganzi-Litang Ocean westward subduction zone in Late Triassic, thus the magma was enriched with water and had high oxygen fugacity, which was effectually to form Cu-Au deposits, and this has been partially proved in practice. While the porphyry monzogranite was rooted in fraction melting of the thickened lower continental crust, as the magma had less water and lower oxygen fugacity, it has the potential to form W-Mo deposits. In a word, as the magmatic hydrothermal fluid was migrating along the fault-crack system in this area in Late Cretaceous, it inherited and developed the former intrusion and finally formed the aplite veinlets and the Xiuwacu W-Mo deposit in this area.","","72","Europium","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Copper deposits - Crystalline materials - Deposits - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Gold alloys - Gold deposits - Granite - Melting - Mica - Molybdenum deposits - Oxygen - Silica - Silicate minerals - Tectonics - Zircon","Continental crusts - Control structure - Geochemical characteristic - Hydrothermal fluids - Late cretaceous - Oxygen fugacity - Subduction zones - Xiuwacu","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933.1 Crystalline Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The district consists of three deposits: South Pulang (~96% of the total ore reserves) and the smaller East and North Pulang deposits. Four intrusive phases host the three Pulang deposits, which are, in order of emplacement, premineralization fne-grained quartz diorite and coarse-grained quartz diorite, intermineralization quartz monzonite, and late-mineralization diorite porphyry. The complex intruded carbonaceous rocks of the Late Triassic Tumugou slates. Zircon U-Pb laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry dating shows that intrusive activity occurred at about 216 ± 2 Ma. Hydrothermal alteration of the intrusions at Pulang includes fve main types: K-silicate, epidote-chlorite, chlorite-illite, quartz-illite, and clay alteration. K-silicate alteration, subdivided into early K-feldspar alteration and late biotite alteration (dominant), mainly affected the central quartz monzonite and adjacent coarse-grained quartz diorite and fne-grained quartz diorite. Epidote-chlorite alteration, the most widespread alteration in the district, extends from the deposit core outward and has overprinted K-silicate alteration at South and North Pulang. Late chlorite-illite, quartz-illite, and clay alteration have overprinted preexisting K-silicate and epidotechlorite alteration assemblages and are locally developed in all four intrusive phases. Copper and gold are positively correlated and are mainly (90%) associated with epidote-chlorite alteration and, to a lesser degree, with K-silicate and chlorite-illite alteration. Hypogene pyrrhotite is intergrown with chalcopyrite and mainly occurs in chlorite-illite- and quartz-illite-altered, coarse-grained quartz diorite at East Pulang. Molybdenite Re-Os dating shows that mineralization in the district occurred at 216.54 ± 0.87 to 216.13 ± 0.86 Ma. The sequence of intrusion emplacement, alteration and veining, and sulfde associations at the three deposits suggests that South and North Pulang are two separate porphyry Cu-Au deposits, whereas East Pulang is probably a distal part of South Pulang. The dominance of primary magnetite over ilmenite and the assemblage titanite + magnetite + quartz in the causative quartz monzonite, and the abundant hydrothermal anhydrite veins associated with early K-silicate and main-mineralization epidote-chlorite alteration indicate the oxidized nature of the felsic intrusion and resultant early hydrothermal fluids. The pyrrhotite related to late chlorite-illite and quartz-illite alteration suggests local reduction due to interaction with the carbonaceous Tumugou slates. The atypical association of epidote-chlorite alteration and Cu mineralization at Pulang either is due to fluids from another porphyry deposit nearby overprinting epidote-chlorite alteration onto preexisting copper mineralization and K-silicate alteration at Pulang or is the result of collapse of epidote-chlorite-stable fluids into the K-silicate-altered core during waning hydrothermal activity. © 2019 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.","","93","Clay alteration","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Copper compounds - Copper deposits - Deposits - Economic geology - Feldspar - Gold alloys - Gold deposits - Iron ores - Laser ablation - Lead alloys - Magnetite - Mass spectrometry - Mica - Mineralogy - Molybdenum compounds - Osmium alloys - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Slate - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Copper mineralization - Diorite porphyries - Hydrothermal activity - Hydrothermal alterations - Hydrothermal fluids - Laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometries - Porphyry deposits - Southwest China","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 801 Chemistry",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Full utilization of forest texture will be a great help in increasing the accuracy of forest classification based on remote sensed data. Taking Shangri-La as a study area, forest classification has been based on the texture. The results show that: (1) From the texture abundance, texture boundary, entropy as well as visual interpretation, the combination of Grayscale-gradient co-occurrence matrix and wavelet transformation is much better than either one of both ways of forest texture information extraction; (2) During the forest texture information extraction, the size of the texture-suitable window determined by the semi-variogram method depends on the forest type (evergreen broadleaf forest is 3×3, deciduous broadleaf forest is 5×5, etc.). (3)While classifying forest based on forest texture information, the texture factor assembly differs among forests: Variance Heterogeneity and Correlation should be selected when the window is between 3×3 and 5×5; Mean, Correlation, and Entropy should be used when the window in the range of 7×7 to 19×19; and Correlation, Second Moment, and Variance should be used when the range is larger than 21×21.","","27","Classification (of information)","Entropy - Forestry - Information retrieval - Linear transformations - Remote sensing","Co-occurrence-matrix - Ecological systems - Forest classification - Intrinsic characteristics - Remote sensed data - Texture information - Visual interpretation - Wavelet transformations","641.1 Thermodynamics - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that the ore fluid is H2O-NaCl system in this area. The fluid inclusions can be divided into three types, i.e., daughter mineral-bearing fluid inclusion (S-type), liquid fluid inclusion (W-type) and Vapor fluid inclusion (V-type). Most of the daughter mineral in S-type is halite, with vanishing temperature higher than homogenization temperature of vapor-liquid. Its homogenization temperature and salinity vary in ranges of 192°C to 570°C and 31.2% to 69.63 % NaCleqv, respectively, which suggest a deep sourced fluid. The homogenization temperature of W-type ranges from 98°C to 583°C, and salinity is low to medium, from 3.55% to 22.98% NaCleqv. V-type inclusion is characterized by high-temperature (454°C of homogenization temperature on average) and low-salinity (9.54% NaCleqvon average). The coexistence of different phase ratios of all types' fluid inclusions in high temperature stage, with similar homogenization temperature, indicated that the ore-forming fluid experienced boiling. Therefore, it is suggested that boiling is the main metallogenic mechanism. The genesis of this deposit belongs to sedimentary with deep resource hypothermal overprint.","","22","Mineralogy","Boiling liquids - Copper deposits - Deposits - Petrography - Sodium chloride","Daughter mineral - Fluid inclusion - High temperature - Homogenization temperatures - Microthermometry - Ore fluids - Ore-forming fluid - Vapor-liquid","481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 641.2 Heat Transfer",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The vertical distributions of concentrations of ore-forming elements (Au, Ag, Cu, Pb and Zn) in 101 mineralized drillcores with various mineralization types are examined using self-affine fractal and multifractal models. The study reveals that the vertical distributions of element concentrations are controlled by ore type, geological position and spatial co-existence of multi-type mineralizations. Generally, element distributions in most drillcores dominated by M-FA orebodies exhibit higher Hurst exponent (H) and lower correlation dimension (D2) than those dominated by P-CA or S-P orebodies, representing that the M-FA mineralization has a strong persistent element distribution and weak compact distribution of high element concentrations. This is likely due to the wide transportation of ore-bearing fluids and heterogeneous metal enrichment during formation of M-FA orebodies. Variations in mathematical parameters for M-FA dominated drillcores are strongly influenced by variations in geological positions and corresponding orebody shapes. High element concentrations are more compact mostly in contact areas than in distal Triassic carbonates. The spatial co-existence of multi-type mineralizations causes strong persistence of element distributions and weak compactness of high element concentrations. The correlations of D2for Au vs. Cu and Pb vs. Zn in M-FA dominated and L-FA drillcores are high, suggesting that Au and Cu have similar distribution patterns, and Pb and Zn have similar distributions. In P-CA and S-P orebodies, only Pb and Zn exhibit similar spatial distributions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","","36","Gold deposits","Copper - Copper alloys - Deposits - Fractals - Geology - Laminates - Mineralogy - Ores - Soils - Spatial distribution - Zinc","Distribution patterns - Element concentrations - Element distribution - Hurst exponents - Mathematical parameters - Multifractal parameters - Vertical distributions - Wandongshan","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: B07011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: GPMR201026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We appreciate the valuable and careful comments from two anonymous reviewers and the revisions of John Carranza.

This paper carried out mineral chemistry and whole rock geochemistry study on three volcanos (Maanshan, Heikongshan, and Dayingshan) of the THV, and discuss the origin and dynamics of the magmatism. The majority of the THV are high potassium calc-alkaline rocks, including basaltic trachyandesite and trachyandesite. We found negative correlations between Si02 and CaO, Fe203 , Ti02, MgO, and positive correlation between Si02 and K20, which indicate the fractional crystallization of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. The xenocrysts of plagioclase with acidic composition (An = 28) has overgrowth basic plagioclase rim (An = 65), and xenocrysts of quartz with narrow pyroxene reaction rim, were found in the trachyandesite samples, which possibly suggest the crustal contamination by granitoid country rock during the magma upwelling processes in shallow level of the crust.

When f less than or equal 6.0 Hz the coda attenuation ratio β(f) observed on both sides of earthquake-generating fault are basically identical.

The β(f) going through the fault observed at Yunlong station is 30% lower than that in Tianxin station in which the seismic waves do not go through the fault. The reason for the difference in space distribution of coda attenuation is discussed. The results also show that factor A0(f) of wave source is not only related to the source strength, but also to frequency f.

The major and trace elements including Sr and Ga, rare earth elements (REE) and halogens in apatite from the ore-related intrusions have been determined using electron microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to evaluate the potential of apatite as a petrogenetic-metallogenic indicator. In this study, both unaltered and altered apatite grains have been selected from the ore-related quartz diorite porphyry and quartz monzonite porphyry. Generally, the altered apatite shows variable but lower Na, S, Mn, Ca, Y and REE concentrations than the unaltered apatite. Most of the apatite analyses are characterized by high Sr, δEu and low Y, indicating that the parental magma has the adakite-like signature. The results from this study show that halogens, Sr and REE in apatite can be used to track parental magma compositions, oxidation states and crystallization process. The apatite in the Pulang deposit shows higher δEu, lower Mn and δCe, and relatively negative correlation between δEu and δCe compared with the Triassic Xiuwacu barren plutons. This indicates that the oxidation state of the ore-bearing porphyries from Pulang is higher. In addition, the decreases in (La/Sm)N, (La/Yb)N and (Sm/Yb)N ratios are likely a result of fractionation of monazite or the exsolution of bearing-Cl hydrothermal fluids. The Cl/F ratios in the Pulang apatite suggest that it might form in a typical subduction condition. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

The current geochronological studies reported these plutons formed in the range of 536 ∼448Ma. In this paper, a granitic outcrop formed in ∼437Ma is first discovered in Gaoligongshan Group through LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating. The zircon Hf-isotope and bulk-rock major and trace element data of the granites are reported to further constrain the proto-Tethyan tectonic evolution. The major element data reveal these Early Silurian granites are high silicic (SiO2= 72.78%∼73.69%), high alkali (K2O + Na2O =7. 23%∼8.70%) and peraluminous (A/CNK = 1. 08 ∼ 1. 12). The trace element data exhibit they are relatively enriched in LREEs, LILEs (Rb, K) and Pb, and depleted in HFSEs (Nb, Ta, P, Zr, and Ti), Ba, Sr and Eu. AU the mineral assemblage characteristics and geochemical features of the rock simples are comparable to those of S-type granites attributed to partial melting of metasediments dominated by psammite with residual plagioclase in the source area. Zircon ∈HF(t) (-9.8∼ -6.2) and tDM2(2. 0 ∼ 1.8Ga) also prove those S-type granites are mainly derived from the ancient crustal metasedimentary, with little mantle-derived components introduced into the melt. According to zircon saturation temperatures (TZr) and Ti-in-zircon thermometer, the temperature decreases from ∼ 794°C to ∼ 754°C during the process of partial melting to magma consolidation. The high temperature of the melt indicates the mantle may as a source for the extra heat required for crustal anataxis. Previous research indicates in the Early Paleozoic Gondwana continental margin experienced proto-Tethyan subduction (ca. 530 ∼ 510Ma), accretionary orogenesis of microcontinental fragments and slab breakoff (ca. 510 ∼490Ma), lithospheric thickening (ca. 490 ∼475Ma), and lithospheric delamination (ca. 475 ∼460Ma). The demolition of the lithospheric mantle will lead to asthenosphere upwelling and continued extension of continental lithosphère. Under the tectonic extension, the granitic rocks emplaced in ∼ 437 Ma in Tengchong Block may be produced through partial melting of the ancient crustal metasediments dominated by psammite, and mantle may supply some extra heat for the partial melting process.","","72","Geochronology","Delamination - Feldspar - Geochemistry - Granite - Hafnium alloys - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Melting - Silica - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Structural geology - Tectonics - Trace elements - Zircon","Early Paleozoic - Hf isotope - Lithospheric delaminations - Tengchong Block - Zircon U-Pb age","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Influenced by subduction of the Ganzi-Litang Ocean, Indosinian magmatism is closely related to the Pulang porphyry and Langdu porphyry-skarn type copper deposits and Songnuo porphyry copper spot. Majority of researches thus far have been focused on the petrological, chronological and geological features of Pulang and Langdu mineralized and Songnuo barren quartz monzonite porphyries. In this paper, the major and trace element concentrations of biotites, measured by EPMA and LA-ICP-MS techniques, are used to investigate the petrogenesis and mineralization of biotites. The EPMA analyses of major elements demonstrate that biotites from Pulang are distinguished from Langdu or Songnuo biotites by higher MgO, TiO2and lower FeO, Al2O3abundances but little differences in SiO2, Na2O, K2O and CaO contents. Analyses of REE suggest that ∑REE of biotites are less than 5%(mass fraction) of the whole rock in all three regions. Trace elements analyses illustrate that biotite is an important carrier of Rb, Ba, K, Ti, Nb, Ta, but it has less ability in hosting Th, U, Pb, Sr, Zr, Hf and Y in comparison with host rocks; nevertheless, ∑REE and Rb, Hf and Cr contents in biotites from Pulang are higher than that from Langdu and Songnuo. The mineral chemistry of biotites show that, the quartz monzonite porphyry from Pulang formed under condition of higher temperature and oxygen fugacity, and it has a higher degree of differential evolution compared with porphyry copper deposit from Langdu and Songnuo. Moreover, the results show that Cu concentration is higher in mineralized plutons from Pulang or Langdu than in barren plutons from Songnuo. © 2017, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

We provide insight into the failure mechanics of the Hongshiyan landslide using data obtained by means of remote sensing techniques and traditional in-situ surveys. Geological data obtained by these methods was then used for kinematic and numerical analyses. Our study shows that failure of the Hongshiyan landslide involved a high rock slope with an average slope of 55° and aspect of 185° SSW, in which the geological setting consists of an upper strong limestone slab and an underlying weak silty mudstone. The geological setting allowed the landslide to develop, as follows: i) the silty mudstone, due to its poor mechanical properties, was subject to ductile deformation under the compressive loading from the overlying strong limestone slabs; ii) a large number of release fractures in the limestone developed as a consequence of pre-failure progressive deformation in the underlying weak mudstone; iii) the oxidation and solution along steep joint walls in the upper limestone indicates that the joints are pathways that allow water ingress into the mudstone, further promoting the degradation of shear strength in this layer. Distinct element modelling (UDEC) was used to back analyse the failure mechanism and develop the geological model that best reproduced the Hongshiyan failure geometry. Results show that the failure surface consisted of two elements. The upper steeply dipping release surface formed along the slope-parallel steep cross joints defining a jointed, strong limestone slab, and the toe of the failure formed a curved failure surface through the ductile weak silty mudstone, underlying the limestone slab, independent of any discontinuities within it. The pre-failure observations and numerical analysis suggest that the Hongshiyan slope was in a state of marginal static stability prior to the earthquake as a result of pre-failure progressive deformation controlled by the shear strength of the underlying mudstone. Overall, the marginal pre-earthquake stability of the Hongshiyan slope, coupled with the strongest seismic loading, which the Hongshiyan slope has been historically subjected to, are the reasons why this moderate earthquake induced a large-scale catastrophic rock slope failure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","","43","Failure (mechanical)","Deformation - Earthquakes - Geology - Landslides - Lime - Limestone - Mechanical properties - Numerical analysis - Numerical methods - Remote sensing - Slope protection","Distinct element modelling - Earthquake stability - Earthquake-triggered landslides - Landslide dam - Progressive deformation - Remote sensing techniques - Seismic slope stabilities - UDEC","481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 41521002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science Fund for Creative Research Groups; Number: SKLGP2017K003, Acronym: CDUT, Sponsor: Chengdu University of Technology; Number: -, Acronym: SKLGP, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection; ","We are grateful to Dr. Janusz Wasowski for his helpful suggestions and meticulous editing, as well as two anonymous reviewers for their critical questions and insightful comments which helped to improve the original manuscript and drew our attention to the Google Earth imagery of 22/12/2010.

Due to unprecedented high vertical resolution, high accuracy, global coverage and long-term stability, the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) technique has a great potential to complement other meteorological observation systems and improve extreme weather monitoring and forecasting. This research investigates a method of extreme weather monitoring using GPS RO technique. The profiles from COSMIC GPS RO mission are used to analyze the drought in the southwest of China in 2010. The results demonstrate the great potential of GPS RO technique to extreme weather events monitoring. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.","","11","Weather forecasting","Cosmology - Drought - Global positioning system - Meteorological problems - Radio - Weather information services","Atmospheric sounding - COSMIC - Extreme weather - Extreme weather events - GPS radio occultations - High vertical resolution - Meteorological observation - Radio occultations","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To regulate fish community structure scientifically and define a rational biomanipulation strategy, hydroacoustic investigation were carried out in Yudong Reservoir with Simrad EY60 split-beam echo sounder in July of 2013, accompanied with the sampling of Nordic multi-mesh gill nets (mesh-size=8.5, 4.0, 12.5, 2.0, 11.0, 1.6, 2.5, 4.8, 3.1, 1.0, 7.5 and 6.0 cm). A total of 12 fish species were collected and the density was 638.4±310.2 ind./1000 m3. Fish distributed unevenly and its density tend to increase from dam part, middle part, tributary part to upper part of the reservoir, with density of 521.5±371.3, 561.9±189.2, 653.7±323.7, 1137.1±90.4 ind./1000 m3, respectively. Moreover, fish in the upper reservoir has a bigger size than that in other parts. The vertical distribution pattern is: 97.6% fish habitat in the 0-10 m layer while there was only 2.4% fish distributed in waters deeper than 10 m, average target strength in the 0-20 m layer was highest (-58.6 dB) while the 20-40 m layer was lowest (-63.9 dB). The Multivariate regression tree model indicates that temperature and water depth have significant impact on fish density. To control the algae bloom, we suggest to enhance stocking of Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, and to introduce endemic piscivorous fishes at the same time to regulate fish community. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","","46","Reservoirs (water)","Fish - Mesh generation - Regression analysis - Spatial distribution - Underwater acoustics","Biomanipulation - Community structures - Controlling factors - Environmental factors - Multivariate regression trees - Spatial distribution patterns - Split-beam echo sounders - Vertical distributions","441.2 Reservoirs - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 921 Mathematics - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This permits Binchuan, which for nearly 20 years, has always been committed to the city and rural development. The most obvious conversion land use types were unused land and cultivated land, with cultivated land showing a clear decreasing trend, and majority of conversions were to rural and mining residential land, and unused land mostly converted to grassland and rural and mining residential land. For woodland, it experienced an initial increase, then decrease, and then finally increased procedure. However the increase of woodland area is not large (it remained in stable condition), and this proved Binchuan has an emphasis on the protection of forest resources. The water area from 1995 to 2000 years showed a substantial reduction, but in the subsequent 10 years has rebounded. However water resources is still relatively scarce, suggesting the Government to strengthen the construction of water conservancy facilities and soil and water conservation and related work.

Carbonate rocks are common in the surrounding rocks of ore deposits. But such mining districts generally do not have the conditions to construct traditional tailings impoundments due to the different degrees of karstification. This paper utilises field investigations, chemical analyses, and permeability tests, etc. to study the effect of tailings impoundments on the underlying karst water systems in the Gejiu world-class Sn-polymetallic mine located in a typical karst region in southern China, with samples collected from both karst springs deriving from the mining area and tailings porewater. Because of the abundance of sulphide minerals in the ores, acid mine drainage is expected to pose a high risk. However, the results indicate that the tailings porewater is moderately neutral and is characterized by the SO4–Ca–Mg hydrochemical type. This can be attributed to the substantial buffering capacity of carbonate minerals. Pollution elements in the tailings porewater mainly include SO42− and toxic metals including As, Cd, Mn, Pb, and Hg. The type of pollution factors and the degree of contamination are not consistent in the different tailings impoundments. The hydrochemical classification of four karst springs distributed in the south of the mining area is HCO3–Ca–Mg. The concentrations of SO42− and the toxic constituents in the springs are far below the national standards for drinking water. The spring water not being contaminated may be attributed to the operation mode of the tailings impoundments (peripheral discharge and reuse of ponded water), the residual clay between the tailings impoundments and the carbonate bedrocks and the sufficient buffering capacity of the underlying karst systems. The tailings disposal at the Gejiu tin mine within the natural karst depressions is able to provide a reference for the operation of karst mines in China and elsewhere. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","52","Tailings disposal","Aquifers - Carbonates - Carbonation - Chemical analysis - Groundwater resources - Hydrochemistry - Landforms - Mechanical permeability - Ores - Pollution - Potable water - Sedimentary rocks - Springs (water) - Sulfur compounds - Tin mines - Wall rock - Water conservation - Water quality - Waterworks","Buffering capacities - Carbonate rock - Field investigation - Karst aquifer - Lateritic clay - Peripheral discharges - Pollution elements - Water quality assessments","444 Water Resources - 444.2 Groundwater - 445.2 Water Analysis - 446 Waterworks - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Previous studies have suggested that the abnormally enriched trace elements (including Ge, W, As, Sb, Be, U, and Nb) and rare earth elements and Y (REY) in the Wulantuga and/or Lincang high-Ge coals are associated with organic matter to varying degrees. Unlike previous studies that have used untreated bulk coal for trace element analyses, element affinities in this study were evaluated based on a comparison of their concentrations before and after HCl-HF treatment. Thirteen bench samples from Wulantuga and Lincang were micronized to ~ 3 μm using a fluid energy mill to ensure effective exposure of mineral matter to acids during subsequent HCl-HF demineralization. Trace element concentrations of both micronized coals and micronized-demineralized coals were determined using ICP-MS. Separately, a multi-stage acid leaching analysis was conducted to investigate the individual effects of HCl, HF, and HNO3on trace element content. Most trace elements that are widely considered to have varying degrees of organic affinity in the Wulantuga and/or Lincang high-Ge coals, including Ge, W, As, Sb, Be, U, Nb, and REY, can be removed to a large extent by thorough HCl-HF leaching, which suggests that if these elements do have an organic association they are held only weakly by the organics. In addition, multi-stage acid leaching results show that HCl is highly effective in the removal of W, As, and REY in the Wulantuga high-Ge coal and As, Be, U, and REY in the Lincang high-Ge coal, whereas HF contributes most to the removal of Ge and Sb in the Wulantuga coal, and Ge, W, Sb, and Nb in the Lincang coal. The highest Ge contents are seen in those lignites that have the highest huminite contents. The most likely explanation for the observations made in this study is that the abnormally enriched trace elements (especially Ge) in the Wulantuga and Lincang high-Ge coals are weakly bonded to organic matter, possibly occurring in the form of chelates, thus allowing them to be removed by HCl-HF. Alternatively, these elements may be associated with fine-grained minerals (or poorly crystalline mineraloids or non-mineral inorganics) that are closely associated with organic matter but are difficult to detect. © 2017","","94","Trace elements","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Chlorine compounds - Coal - Coal deposits - Deposits - Germanium - Germanium deposits - Leaching - Nitric acid - Organic minerals - Rare earths","Acid leaching - Element affinity - Fine-grained minerals - Lincang - Trace element analysis - Trace element concentrations - Trace element content - Wulantuga","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 504.1 Light Metal Mines - 524 Solid Fuels - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University; Number: -, Acronym: SIU, Sponsor: Southern Illinois University; Number: -, Acronym: CUMT, Sponsor: China University of Mining and Technology; Number: 2016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Rice University; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: B17042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fine&nbsp;Ceramics&nbsp;Opening&nbsp;Fund; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41420104001), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902), the ?111?

Volcanic rocks are dominated by alkali basalt and trachyte basalt. There has long been a controversy on the environment of formation of basalts. Some scholars hold that the basalts were formed in a continental environment, some thought they were formed in an oceanic environment and others considered that the basalts were emplaced in a back-arc basin. This study focuses on the geochemical characteristics of the basalts on the basis of their major elements, REEs and trace elements. At the same time, strongly incompatible elements such as Ta, Th and Hf and their ratios were used to differentiate the geotectonic settings of basalts. The results showed that the basalts in the region studied were formed in a continental rift environment.","","26","Basalt","Natural water geochemistry - Ore deposits - Tectonics - Trace elements","Continental environment - Polymetallic ore deposits - Tectonic environment - Trace element geochemistry","444 Water Resources - 481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504 Mines and Mining, Metal","Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Previous studies show that the Beiya alkaline porphyry intrusions are the fractionation product of a mantle-derived magma emplaced in an extension environment at the post-collision stage of the India-Eurasian plate collision; the Beiya deposit is considered to be skarn-related. Based on detailed field studies and previous work, we propose that the Beiya porphyry and associated Au-rich polymetallic ores were formed by the emplacement of magmas within the Jinshajiang-Honghe strike-slip fault during the late stage of the India-Eurasian plate collision at 45-25 Ma. At Beiya, the mineralized zones in the Cu-Au-rich porphyries are surrounded by Au-Cu-Fe skarns and Au (Cu) veins.

The sulfur isotope signature of the sulfide mineralization in the Beiya and Qinhe deposits is -2.40‰-4.50‰ and 1.25-2.75‰, respectively.

The chemical characteristics of groundwater were analyzed by cluster analysis, factor analysis, and path model analysis. Meanwhile, we qualitatively and quantitatively assessed the sources of groundwater hydrochemistry in the Buckwheat basin. The results showed that the groundwater in the study area was weakly alkaline, and the major ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, HCO3-, and NO3- had high spatial variability. According to the clustering analysis, the groundwater in the study area can be divided into two categories, namely, class A and class B, and these have the following two subsets: A1, A2, B1, and B2. From A to B, the chemical types of groundwater become more complex. The hydrochemistry types of class A were all of the HCO3-Ca type, while those of class B1 were HCO3-Ca, HCO3-Na•Ca, and HCO3-Na•Ca•Mg, and those of class B2 were HCO3-Ca, HCO3-Ca•Mg, HCO3-Na•Ca. In order to further explore the influence factors of groundwater hydrochemistry, we determined that carbonate rocks, human activities, evaporite rocks, and silicate rocks were the main material sources of groundwater through factor analysis and path model analysis. Among all of the above factors, the dissolution of magnesium sulfate evaporite and the actions of human activities were found to be important reasons for the formation of carbonate rocks, which served as the main sources of groundwater chemical components and diverse hydrochemistry characteristics. © 2019, Science Press.

In this study, geochemical analyses (grain size, OC, N, δ13C) were carried out. The April 2014 sediment was finer than the October 2013 sediment. OC content was in the range of 1.07–2.68 % showing a increasing OC content with decreasing percent sand from the October 2013 sediment to the April 2014 sediment. TN distribution in surface sediments followed a similar distribution and was commonly correlated with OC. The correlation of δ13C values and N/C ratios in sediment reflected a mixing of soil-derived and terrestrial organic matters. The Ali/Aro ratios from the solid-state13C-NMR spectra exhibited more aliphaticity for April 2014 sediments. The isotopic analyses on the fatty acids of sediments from twenty sampling stations in Xingyun Lake indicated that terrigenous components can be assigned as the major sources of the organic matters in the lake sediments. The low yields in lignin in sediment pointed to nontypical terrigenous inputs to the lake sediments. Ratios of p-hydroxyacetophenone to p-hydroxyl phenols (Pon/P) in the surface sediments (0.08–0.22) over the all sampling stations in Xingyun Lake further demonstrated a contribution from soil-derived organic matters. It was observed a plot of the ratio of S/V versus C/V exhibited an organic input attributed to angiosperm nonwoods. The reworking of surficial sediments may result in a difference in organic input between the October 2013 sediment and the April 2014 sediment. Furthermore, the associated ratios of (Ad/Al)v, P/(V + S) in sediment indicated that the April 2014 sediments had experienced the lower degree of oxidation of lignin than the October 2013 sediments. This can be attributed to the higher fine particle content in the former sediments protecting organic matter than in the latter sediments, as revealed by the lower alkyl C/O–alkyl C ratio (A/O–A) in solid-state13C NMR spectra of April 2014 samples. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","49","Surficial sediments","Analytical geochemistry - Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Fatty acids - Lakes - Lignin - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Organic compounds","Aromaticities - Chemical compositions - Degree of oxidations - Geochemical analysis - Hydroxyacetophenones - Sediment organic matters - Sedimentary organic matter - Terrestrial organic matter","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In our research area, the Pb–Zn deposits are mainly hosted in the Permian Yangxin Formation and are composed of dolostone and limestone. The distance between the ore bodies and the Permian Emeishan basalt ranged from 50 to 160 m. In this study, the nickel rich minerals, including vaesite, polydymite and millerite, were reported for the first time in the Fule deposit. These minerals occurred as xenomorphic mineral aggregate and were sporadically distributed in the sphalerite–galena–calcite vein, which is the main ore type in the deposit. Our study indicated that the paragenetic sequence of minerals in the Fule deposit is the following order: polydymite → vaesite → millerite → sphalerite → galena → tetrahedrite (tennantite). The geological occurrence characteristics of those nickeliferous minerals suggested that the Permian Emeishan basalt is a possible barrier layer of Pb–Zn ore-forming fluid, and it is an important source for the Ni and part of the Cu in the deposit. The Sichuan–Yunnan–Guizhou Pb–Zn mineralization province is a world-class production base of Pb and Zn, in which the Permian Emeishan basalt and Pb–Zn deposits have uniformly spatial distribution, but the relationship of mineralization between them is still under debate. This report provides new evidence for understanding the relationship between Pb–Zn mineralization and Permian Emeishan basalt in the Sichuan–Yunnan–Guizhou Pb–Zn mineralization province. © 2018, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","34","Ores","Basalt - Calcite - Deposits - Geology - Lime - Mineralogy - Nickel deposits - Sulfide minerals - Temperature - Zinc deposits - Zinc sulfide","Barrier layers - Emeishan basalts - Geological significance - Guizhou Province - Mineral aggregate - Nickeliferous - Ore-forming fluid - Zn deposits",,,"Number: 41173063, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014CB440900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgements This research project was jointly supported by the National ‘973 Project’ (No. 2014CB440900), the State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41430315), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41173063).

However, the effects of CBM coproduction were not satisfying in early stages, and the gas production from multiple coal seams was even lower than that from a single coal seam. Previous research has employed various methods, including production data analysis and numerical simulation, to ascertain the controlling factors of CBM production in multilayer areas. But it is still unknown how they influence the gas production. To tackle these problems, a set of physical experiments simulating the process of CBM coproduction in multilayer areas is conducted. In these experiments, the permeability ratio, the reservoir pressure difference and the distance between two seams are set as independent variables, while the forward gas flow rate, the reversed gas flow rate in sublayers and the total gas flow rate in the tube well are the dependent variables, which are used to define sublayer interlayer interference index and analyze the mechanism of interlayer interference. The results are as follows. 1) The relationship between the production contribution of single layer and permeability ratio is exponential; that is, the production contribution of single layer is dominated by the permeability ratio. If the permeability ratio of the two seams is greater than 5 times, then an imbalance of production contribution between layers may occur. 2) The performance of the upper coal seam is dominated by the reservoir pressure difference; that is, the sublayer interlayer interference index of the upper coal seam increases with the reservoir pressure difference. 3) The performance of the lower coal seam is dominated by the distance between coal seams; that is, the sublayer interlayer interference index of the lower coal seam increases with the distance between coal seams. The sublayer interlayer interference index proposed in this paper provides a new quantitative standard for the magnitude of interlayer interference. The effects of permeability ratio, reservoir pressure difference and distance between coal seams on the gas production can be used as a reference for the optimization of reservoirs combination and drainage systems for the purpose of eliminating the interlayer interference and improving gas production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","","78","Coal deposits","Coal - Flow of gases - Gases - Methane - Multilayers - Natural gas wells - Numerical methods - Petroleum reservoir engineering","Controlling factors - Independent variables - Interlayer interferences - Physical experiments - Production data analysis - Quantitative standards - Reservoir anisotropy - Reservoir pressures","503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 512.2.1 Natural Gas Fields - 524 Solid Fuels - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,"Number: 2016ZX05044002-005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Key Research Program of Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; Number: 41772155, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Research Program for Science and Technology of China: [Grant Numbers 2016ZX05044002-005] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China : [Grant Numbers 41772155 ].

As a result, it is hard to reveal the relationships between these tectonic units. The Fugong region is located in the east of the Eastern Himalaya Syntax, and is consisted of several blocks of the Tibetan Plateau and of the Sanjiang Orogenic Belt. This paper reports LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating results of detrital zircons from the Carboniferous strata in the Fugong region. Field and petrological study demonstrated that these strata are of shallow marine facies likely in a passive continental margin. Detrital zircon U/Pb analyses of three quartzite samples reveal five major Pb/238U age-intervals: 2550 ∼2400Ma, 1800 ∼ 1550Ma, 1200 ∼ 1080Ma, 1000 ∼ 850Ma and 600 ∼480Ma, which are peaked at ∼ 2502Ma, ∼1724Ma, ∼1120Ma, ∼886Ma and ∼512Ma, respectively. This age spectrum suggests that the Upper Paleozoic strata in Fugong area are highly comparable with those of the Lhasa block. Taking the spatial continuity of the Cenozoic magmatic belt in southeastern Tibet into account, these strata, along with those of the Tengchong block, seem to be the southern extending of the Lhasa block, which likely had resulted from stretching, bending and rotation of this block due to the impingement of the India continent along the Eastern Himalaya Syntax. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

The mineralization is hosted by sandstone in the Early Cretaceous Jingxing Formation and limestone breccia in the Paleocene Yunlong Formation. Mineralization in both types of host rocks is characterized by a paragenetic sequence beginning with marcasite–sphalerite (Stage 1) followed by pyrite–marcasite–sphalerite–galena (Stage 2), and then galena–sphalerite–pyrite–sulfate–carbonate (Stage 3). Pyrite from these stages have different δ33S compositions with pyrite from Stage 1 averaging − 9.6‰, Stage 2 averaging − 8.9‰, and Stage 3 averaging + 0.3‰. Sphalerite hosted by the sandstone has similar δ66Zn values ranging from 0.10 to 0.30‰ in all stages of the mineralization, but sphalerite samples from the limestone breccia-hosted ore show variable δ66Zn values between − 0.03 and 0.20‰. Our data on sphalerite precipitated during the earlier stages of mineralization has a constant δ66Zn value and cogenetic pyrite displays a very light sulfur isotope signature, which we believe to reflect a sulfur source that formed during bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). The Stage 3 sphalerite and pyrite precipitated from a late influx of metal-rich basinal brine, which had a relatively constant variable δ66Zn isotopic composition due to open system isotope fractionation, and a near zero δ33S composition due to the influence of abiotic thermochemical sulfate reduction from observed sulfates in the host rock. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","140","Mineralogy","Biomarkers - Deposits - Economic geology - Isotopes - Lead deposits - Lime - Limestone - Pyrites - Sandstone - Sulfide minerals - Sulfur compounds - Zinc - Zinc sulfide","Bacterial sulfate reduction - Early Cretaceous - Isotope fractionation - Isotopic composition - Ore genesis - Sulfur isotope - Thermochemical sulfate reduction - Zinc isotopes","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Abundant biomarkers, including n-alkanes, isoprenoid, steranes and terpanes, are detected by GC-MS from this ore. The n-alkanes of mineral samples show a low carbon molecular components with highest peaks of nC16 or nC22. OEP values of the n-alkanes show no odd-even carbon dominance. Pr/Ph ratios indicate that mineral samples possess phytane dominance. The terpanes distribution patterns of mineral samples are pentacyclic terpanes>tricyclic terpanes>tetracyclic terpanes. The steranes consist mainly of C27-steranes, C28-steranes and C29-steranes. According to abundance, C29-steranes>C27-steranes> C28-steranes, pregn-steranes and 4-methyl-steranes are also identified. All these characteristics indicate mixed contributions from bacterial and algae and higher plant wax sources with a possible dominance of bacterial and algae origin organic matter. The Jinding lead-zine ore was probably deposited in a reduction environment and high saline condition. Considering the sedimentary environment of the mineral-bearing strata, we conclude that reducing environment and sealing condition play an important role in the formation of the Jinding lead-zinc ore.","","26","Biomarkers","Biological materials - Gas chromatography - Lead deposits - Lithology - Mass spectrometry - Paraffins - Zinc deposits","Ore formation - Ore genesis","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Land use indices within three buffer distances from dam centre were calculated to quantify the effects of dam construction. The results showed that land use structure changed greatly during and after dam construction. Forestland and grassland were two main types of land use, which occupied over 79.70% of total area in 10000 m buffer. The main conversion of land use types took place from forest land to grass and farm land between 1974 and 1991, and that was almost consistent between 1991 and 2004. During 1974-1991, spatial dynamics of grass, farm and construction land were much larger than water body and forest land, and had an increasing tendency and the balanced state decreased with the increased off-dam distances which indicated that conversion of input and output were frequently between the three land use types. During 1991-2004, water body had the largest value of Rss, in a state of extreme non-balanced with its Psreached 0.96, 0.96 and 0.99 in 10000, 5000 and 1000 m buffer, respectively. Further studies showed that direct effect was limited in the 1000 m buffer region based on the land use indices including temporal dynamics of land use change (Rs), spatial dynamics of land use change (Rss,) and tendency and state index (Ps). Generally, three indices of each land use type decreased with the increased off-dam distances. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","11","Land use","Dams - Dynamics - Ecology - Forestry - Geographic information systems","Almost consistent - Buffer analysis - Construction land - Input and outputs - Land-use structures - RS interpretation - Spatial-temporal changes - Temporal dynamics","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 441.1 Dams - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use",,"Number: 50939001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40871237, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 50939001, No. 40871237).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
