The front lens of the DLCL is used as both a diffusion cell and a key imaging element; the refractive index (RI) of liquid filled in its core can be measured in the way of spatial resolution. The rear lens of the DLCL is used as an aplanatic component, and either the RI position of spherical aberration (SA) or the SA in a range of RI caused by the front lens can be regulated by selecting the liquid, of which RI is pre-prepared and filled in the rear liquid core. Equipped with the aplanatic DLCL, two methods have been applied to measure the D value of 0.33mol/L KCL aqueous solution at temperature 298.15K. The first method derives D value precisely from the drift rate of diffusion image and the measured D is 1.8508 × 10-5cm2/s. Meanwhile, the second method obtains the D value rapidly by analyzing an instantaneous diffusion image and the measured D is 1.8619 × 10-5cm2/s. The measured values are in good agreement with the literature value, demonstrating that the designed DLCL works well in measuring liquid diffusion coefficients. © 2017 Optical Society of America.","","21","Aberrations","Diffusion in liquids - Refractive index - Solutions","Cylindrical lens - Diffusion cells - Imaging elements - KCl aqueous solution - Liquid diffusion coefficient - Measured values - Spatial resolution - Spherical aberrations","741.1 Light/Optics",,"Number: 2016CYH05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 61465014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant NO. 61465014); Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan (Grant NO. 2016CYH05); Scholarship Award for Excellent Doctoral Student granted by Yunnan Province, China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we design two approximation algorithms for the GSC problem.

In this paper, we propose a user-dependent method to detect communities in multi-relational social networks. We define a multi-relational community as a shared community over multiple single-relational graphs while the quality of a partitioning of nodes is assessed by a multi-relational modularity, and we design a desirable set of communities to represent the requests of users and use Normalized mutual information (NMI) between the desirable set of communities and the sets of communities detected in each single-relational graph as the weights for measuring the importance of all kinds of relationship types. We then use a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities.

On the other hand, the voltage sag detection method, based on nonrecursive DFT algorithm, has short detection time but poor filtering ability. Aiming to meet the requirements of fast response and good accuracy, this paper proposed a voltage sag detection method based on improved nonrecursive DFT algorithm. By means of disturbance filter, which is combined with several notch filters and a low-pass filter, the filter characteristic of nonrecursive DFT algorithm has been improved, and the detection delay time is reduced.

An affine correction based algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can resist combined geometric attacks and keep a higher watermark embedding capacity. The SURF algorithm and the RANSAC algorithm are used to extract, match and select feature points from the attacked image and the original image. Then, the least square algorithm is used to estimate the affine matrix of the geometric attacks according to the relationship between the matched feature points. The attacks are corrected based on the estimated affine matrix. A fine correction step is included to improve the precision of the watermark detection. To resist the cropping attacks, the watermark information is encoded with LT-coding. The encoded watermark is embedded in the DWT-DCT composite domain of the image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has a high embedding capacity, but also is robust to many kinds of geometric attacks. © 2016 IEEE.","","23","Geometry","Digital watermarking - Distributed computer systems - Image watermarking - Matrix algebra - Robustness (control systems)","Affine matrices - Embedding capacity - Least square algorithms - LT codes - Surf algorithms - Watermark detection - Watermark embedding - Watermark information","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra",,"Number: 61062005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.61062005)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Most of the energy produced came from fossil fuels, making irreversible damage to the environment. Lately, there has been an effort by nations to produce energy using clean methods, such as solar and wind energy, among others. Wind energy is one of the cleanest alternatives. However, the wind speed is not constant, making the planning and operation at electric power systems a difficult activity. Knowing in advance the amount of raw material (wind speed) used for energy production allows us to estimate the energy to be generated by the power plant, helping the maintenance planning, the operational management, optimal operational cost. For these reasons, the forecast of wind speed becomes a necessary task. The forecast process involves the use of past observations from the variable to forecast (wind speed). To measure wind speed, weather stations use devices called anemometers, but due to poor maintenance, connection error, or natural wear, they may present false or missing data. In this work, a hybrid methodology is proposed, and it uses a compact genetic algorithm with an artificial neural network to reconstruct wind speed time series. The proposed methodology reconstructs the time series using a ANN defined by a Compact Genetic Algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","22","Electric power system planning","Electric power systems - Forecasting - Fossil fuels - Genetic algorithms - Neural networks - Speed - Time series - Wind - Wind power","Compact genetic algorithm - Energy productions - Hybrid methodologies - Irreversible damage - Maintenance planning - Operational management - Solar and wind energies - Wind speed time series","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In addition, the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is employed for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in the PV module in this stage. The second stage cascades a H-bridge inverter and LCL filter. To feed high quality sinusoidal power into the grid, the software phase lock, outer voltage loop and inner current loop control method are adopted as the control strategy. The performance of the proposed topology is tested by Matlab/Simulink. A PV module with maximum power 300W and maximum power point voltage 40V is applied as the input source.

However, because of their strong influence on global warming and the impact of HCFCs on the ozone layer, refrigerants such as ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrocarbons (HC), having minimal impact on the environment, are being considered. So far, HCs have only been safely used in domestic refrigeration. Ammonia has been used mainly for industrial refrigeration whereas CO2is still under study. In this paper, a comparative study of the various feasible alternatives is presented in a survey that was undertaken with major stake holders in the field. The retrofitting possibility of existing equipment was assessed and safety issues associated with each refrigerant were analysed. The major setback of hydrocarbons as a widely accepted refrigerant is its flammability which was considered as a major safety hazard by the majority of respondents in the survey and the main advantages are the improved equipment coefficient of performance (COP) and better TEWI factor. This resulted in a 12 % drop in energy consumption. Despite the excellent thermodynamic properties of ammonia, its use has mainly been confined to industrial refrigeration due to its toxicity. In Mauritius, the performance of ammonia in air conditioning is being evaluated on a pilot basis. The major setback of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant is the high operating pressure which is considered a safety hazard. The high initial investment cost and the lack of qualified maintenance technician is also an issue. The use of CO2is mainly being considered in the commercial refrigeration sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","22","Industrial refrigeration","Air conditioning - Ammonia - Carbon dioxide - Commercial refrigeration - Energy utilization - Fluorocarbons - Global warming - Hazards - Hydrocarbons - Investments - Ozone layer - Refrigerants - Safety factor - Surveys - Thermodynamic properties","Alternative refrigerant - Coefficient of Performance - Comparative studies - Domestic refrigeration - Feasible alternatives - High operating pressure - Hydrochlorofluorocarbons - Impact on the environment","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 643.3 Air Conditioning - 644.1 Refrigeration Methods - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

High oxygen composition is responsible for instability and low heating value of bio-oil and high acid content for corrosiveness. Aims of the present work are to evaluate possibilities of achieving phase separation between oxygenated and non-oxygenated compounds in bio-oil using a proposed stirred tank reactor and to achieve synergistic effects on bio-oil yield and non-oxygenated compound layer yield. Separation of bio-oil into two layers, i.e. that containing oxygenated compounds (polar phase) and non-oxygenated compounds (non-polar phase) is important to obtain pure non-polar phase ready for the next processing of hydrogenation and used directly as bio-fuel. There has been no research work on co-pyrolysis of biomass-plastic considering possibility of phase separation of bio-oil. The present work is proposing a stirred tank reactor for co-pyrolysis with nitrogen injection, which is capable of tailoring co-pyrolysis conditions leading to low viscosity and viscosity asymmetry, which induce phase separation between polar phase and non-polar phase. The proposed reactor is capable of generating synergistic effect on bio-oil and non-polar yields as the composition of PP in feed is more than 25% weight in which non-polar layers contain only alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","44","Phase separation","Biofuels - Polypropylenes - Pyrolysis - Tanks (containers) - Viscosity","Bio-oil yield - Biomass plastics - Low heating values - Nitrogen injection - Non-polar phase - Oxygenated compounds - Stirred tank reactors - Synergistic effect","619.2 Tanks - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The proposed rolling scheduling model has further improved the operation cost of system in the intra-day generation process, enhanced the system's accommodation capacity of wind power, and modified the key transmission section power flow in a rolling manner to satisfy the security constraint of power grid. The improved NNIA algorithm has defined an antibody preference relation model based on equal incremental rate, regulation deviation constraints and maximum & minimum technical outputs of units.

In addition, the electronic and geometrical effects that affect the NO dissociation reactions have been investigated in detail. The calculation results are presented as following: The effective activation energies of the best NO dissociation pathways on the Rh(1 0 0), the Rh(1 1 0), and the Rh(1 1 1) are 0.63, 0.66 and 1.77 eV, respectively. The activity of the Rh planes for NO dissociation is in the order of Rh(1 0 0) Rh(1 1 0) > Rh(1 1 1). The low dissociation barrier for Rh(1 0 0) and Rh(1 1 0) is associated with the existence of a lying-down NO structure which acts as a precursor for dissociation. By Mulliken population analysis and structure analysis, both electronic and geometrical effects are found to affect the NO dissociation reactions, but the geometrical effect exceed the electronic. The energy decomposition scheme has been used to provide further insight into the NO dissociation reactions. Based on the calculations, the interaction energy between N and O in the transition state (EintTS) on the Rh(1 1 1) is found much larger than that on the Rh(1 0 0) and the Rh(1 1 0). The major differences of EintTS should originate from the variation of the bonding competition effect. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, feature selection based on random forest is used to eliminate redundant features and reduce the computational complexity.

To improve its identification performance and reduce the computational complexity, the CPV based on each variable's maximum variation is proposed to determine candidate variables.

It is shown that the members of multi-agents system in reciprocal communication network will asymptotically form a cohesive cluster with finite size if the nonlinear attraction and repulsion functions satisfy some very mild assumptions. These results can be generalized into the case that the network is non-reciprocal with detailed balance condition. However, under general non-reciprocal networks the members of the system could appear some oscillatory or dispersed behavior depending on the choices of the nonlinear attraction and repulsion functions. We present several numerical simulations demonstrating the correctness of our theoretic results.","","14","Multi agent systems","Control engineering - Convergence of numerical methods","Cohesive clusters - Collective behavior - Detailed balance - In networks - Multi-agents systems - Nonlinear attraction and repulsion - Reciprocal communications - Repulsion functions","921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effects of carbonization temperature, activation temperature, and ratio of KOH to chars on the pore development of WSACs were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the microstructure and morphology of WSACs. Methanol adsorption performance onto the optimal WSAC and the coal-based AC were also investigated. The results show that the optimal preparation conditions are a carbonization temperature of 700 °C, an activation temperature of 700 °C, and a mass ratio of 3. The BET surface area, the micropore volume, and the micropore volume percentage of the optimal WASC are 1636 m2/g, 0.641 cm3/g and 81.97%, respectively. There are a lot of micropores and a certain amount of meso- and macropores. The characteristics of the amorphous state are identified. The results show that the optimal WSAC is favorable for methanol adsorption. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of the optimal WSAC is 248.02mg/g. It is shown that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the optimal WSAC is almost equivalent to that of the common activated carbon. Therefore the optimal WSAC could be a potential adsorbent for the solar energy adsorption refrigeration cycle. © 2016, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","36","Chemical activation","Activated carbon - Adsorption - Carbonization - Characterization - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Methanol - Microporosity - Potassium hydroxide - Refrigeration - Scanning electron microscopy - Solar energy - X ray powder diffraction","Activation temperatures - Carbonization temperatures - Energy adsorption - Equilibrium adsorption capacity - Methanol adsorption - Potential adsorbents - Preparation conditions - Walnut shells","644.1 Refrigeration Methods - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We first used recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the features of dependencies in Malay, and the parametric model was established through multivariate feature matrices for Malay texts using long short-Term (LSTM).

Its biosorption properties as a function of environmental parameters such as contact time, initial concentration, pH, temperature and bacterial dosage were investigated through batch experiments, and the removal capacity peaked at pH 6.0, 40 °C and 0.5 g biomass L−1 at an initial concentration of 105 mg L−1. Sorption occurred extremely rapidly at the beginning, equilibrium was reached after approximately 1 h and 4 h for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively, and the biosorption kinetic data for both metals were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model (r2 > 0.99). Sorption isotherms showed that the adsorptions of both metals were highly favourable, and equilibrium data were better described by the Langmuir model (r2 > 0.98 for Cu2+ and 0.99 for Cd2+), with the estimated maximum sorption capacities of 12.6 and 26.5 mg g−1 for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively. Desorption assays suggested that biosorption was a chemical process and that a fraction of the metal ions might have entered the bacterial cells. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl and phosphate functional groups on the bacterial cell walls might be mainly responsible for the biosorption, although their contributions to the binding of Cu2+ and Cd2+ were different.

Focus of the work is two-fold. A lateral-directional, non-linear guidance controller is developed first to ensure tight ground track control without violating saturation limits of bank angles. For trajectory tracking, path following vectorial computations are performed for both straight and curved tracks in North-East-Down (NED) as well as in Earth-Centred-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference coordinate systems. Furthermore, for the wind field estimation based on generated flight data and a Frozen Dryden Wind Turbulence Model, a Discrete-Time Kalman Filter (DKF) is employed. Simulations are run for real flight scenarios with noisy sensors and gust winds. The simulation analysis highlights the effectiveness of the proposed technique in comparison to the conventional direct method estimation used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is also shown that the suggested method is capable of providing smoothed estimates for the aircraft attitude states and sideslip angle. © 2015 IEEE.","","17","Supersonic aircraft","Air navigation - Aircraft detection - Antennas - Automation - Electronic guidance systems - Fighter aircraft - Flight control systems - Flight simulators - Kalman filters - Risk perception - Turbulence models - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Discrete-time Kalman filters - Lateral guidance - Trajectory tracking - Wind field estimation - Wind modelling","431.5 Air Navigation and Traffic Control - 652 Aircraft and Avionics - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

According to the characteristics of landmark, the image is divided into two parts with circle and character H. The analysis reveals a geometric correlation exits between corner points of character H. The correlation has a low sensitivity to rotation post and environment. The results show that recognition algorithm based on corner points not only keeps the real time performance but also detects landmarks at any degree of rotation in the 2D image plane from the air, and outperforms linear feature algorithms.
