In essence, it corresponds to a constrained optimization problem, objective function of which is non-linear and non-differentiable and exist multiple local minima making this problem a special difficulty. In this paper, we propose Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) with penalty function to solve 13C-based metabolic flux estimation problem. The stoichiometric constraints are transformed to an unconstrained one, by penalizing the constraints and building a single objective function, which in turn is minimized using QPSO algorithm for flux quantification. The proposed algorithm is applied to estimate the central metabolic fluxes of Corynebacterium glutamicum and compared with conventional optimization technique. Experimental results illustrated that our algorithm is capable of achieving fast convergence to good near-optima. © 2014 IEEE.","18","Metabolism","Constrained optimization - Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Constrained optimi-zation problems - Metabolic flux - Metabolic network - Penalty function - Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To model the mechanism of the surface deformation, several models, including lateral extrusion of rigid blocks along large strike-slip faults and lower crust flow have been proposed. The crustal-flow model, in which the middle/lower crust in central Tibet is partially molten and flows from central Tibet through Sichuan into Yunnan, is gradually accepted by seismologists. Therefore, the study of the deformational characteristics in crust and mantle and the geodynamic model beneath Sichuan and Yunnan (southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau) remains one of focused issues in the earth sciences of the world for many years. Although the fine crustal structures have been obtained in the region during the past several decades, the mechanisms for plateau deformation and expansion are still enigmatic due to the resolution limitations of methods and/or data. The aim of this paper is to select the previous results, analyze their discrepancies and conclude the reliable evidence for the lower crustal-flow model. The lower crustal flow model on the evolution of the Tibetan plateau yields surface velocity and deformation field consistent with observations of GPS, thus being very popular in the earth science community. A scientific problem in deep geophysics is searching for evidence on the existence of the lower crustal flow. In this paper, GPS observations, focal mechanism solutions, and Pms phase splitting in Sichuan and Yunnan are combined to explore the reasonability of crustal deformation models. On the other hand, based on the analysis of tomography, receiver function inversion, and magnetotelluric profiles, this paper discusses whether there exits the deep evidence on lower crustal flow beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as the distribution scale of lower crustal flow if it is really present. The geodynamic implications are also investigated in relation to surface geological features, GPS velocities, Pms phase splitting, and focal mechanism. We observe a conspicuous sharper clockwise rotation around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, and suggest that the deformation between the upper and lower crust within Sichuan and Yunnan is coupled. Resistivity imaging by magnetotelluric measurements have mapped two zones of high electrical conductivity at depth 20~40 km beneath southeast Tibet, only along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault and Jiali-Nujiang fault, respectively. However, the crustal velocity structure obtained by inversion of receiver functions and surface waves shows that intra-crust low-velocity zone (IC-LVZ) is locally distributed in western Sichuan, and not found in the Sichuan basin. Additionally, by analysis of the polarity of the converted phases at intra-crust interfaces, we suggest that a wide-spread IC-LVZ is present in Yunnan. According to the distribution features of the negative polarity at intra-crust interface and crustal structure from joint inversion of receiver functions of surface waves, it is concluded that an IC-LVZ from eastern Tibet on a large scale may exist beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, and has reached the southern Yunnan, but has a complex geometric shape. In Yunnan, this zone appears to be constrained in a certain area by the Xiaojiang and Jinshajiang-Red River faults. This conclusion is not quite consistent with previous suggestion that the lower-crustal flow reaches only the Lijiang-Jinhe fault, and that the lower crustal flow is only bounded within two arc-like channels. © 2015, Science Press.

Physiological studies have shown that our central neural system (CNS) is able to adapt muscle force, stiffness and damping to perform different tasks under various environments. However, there has been very little research in the robotics communities to incorporate human motor skills of muscle force, stiffness and damping adaptation into teleoperation. As a matter of fact, muscle activities regulated by CNS can be represented by surface electromyography (sEMG) measured by electrodes attached on the skin of human limbs. Therefore, sEMG based teleimpedance control has been recently developed to transfer the variable stiffness from human operator to a robot for flexible manipulation [1], [2], [3]. In this paper, we have developed a personalised variable gain control, whereas the control gain is set according to muscle activation extracted from sEMG signals, and force feedback is employed such that human operator is able to sense the circumstance in a haptic manner and to adapt muscle contraction subconsciously as if they are directly interacting with the environment. The proposed method enables an operator to adjust tracking speed and stiffness of the telerobot easily on the fly, and thus greatly improves a user's manipulation ability for delicate tasks, especially in the presence of motion amplification and varying payload on the telerobot. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested and confirmed by comparative experiments, in which a 7-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm of Baxter® robot is employed. © 2015 IEEE.","33","Feedback","Automation - Damping - Degrees of freedom (mechanics) - Electromyography - Gain control - Muscle - Remote control - Robotics - Stiffness","Comparative experiments - Flexible manipulations - Haptic feedbacks - Motion amplification - Physiological signals - Stiffness and damping - Surface electromyography - Variable gain","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 931.1 Mechanics - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: EP/L026856/1, Acronym: EPSRC, Sponsor: Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","This work was supported in part by EPSRC grant EP/L026856/1, Royal Society grant IE130681, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 61473120, 61174045 and U1201244 and Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China 2014A030313266 and Guangzhou Research Collaborative Innovation Projects No. 2014Y2-00507.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on Quick Bird image classification, information of buildings can be extracted, and the density and landscape pattern of buildings can be analyzed, the height of buildings can be measured by calculating the length of the shadow. The results could provide scientific basis for town planning, urban ecological construction. Kunming is the capital of Yunnan Province, China. It is a key city in southwest China, and national historical and cultural city, an important tourism and trade city of China. For some reason the comprehensive strength of Kunming has obviously lagged behind the eastern coastal cities, even behind a number of western cities of China. A strategic decision called 'Building modern and new Kunming' was put forward by the provincial government in May 2003. It aims to optimize and enhance urban functions, reduce population density and building density and relieve traffic pressure, improve the quality of the environment. In order to achieve governmental goals it needs some data like building height and density. On the other hand, there are no many good ways and methods to extract this information, especially in some typical geographic unit. Study on information extraction of building height and density in Kunming will help to do a good planning in core area of Kunming and will help to explore the new methods of remote sensing information extraction. Quick Bird image (path/row: 129/043) acquired at November 6, 2006 has been used to extract the information of density and height of buildings, analysis spatial pattern of buildings' patches supported by GIS and GPS. First the geometric correction of panchromatic band(0.61mx0.61m, 450-900nm) and multispectral bands(2.4mx2.4m, blue 450-520nm, green 520-600nm, red 630-690nm, near infrared 760-900nm) had been done, then 5 bands data had been fused by principal component transform. Third, all the buildings had been classified by parallelepiped supervised classification based on maximum likelihood classification. Fourth, building density had been calculated and the building height can be measured by use the relationship between azimuth angle of the Sun and satellite, shadow of building and the height. The results showed that: (1) the building density between the first-ring road and the second-ring road (27.51%) is slightly higher that of within the first-ring road (25.62%) in Kunming, and there were differences between the four core urban areas - From high to be followed by Xishan district (30.20%), Guandu district (29.73%), Panlong district (28.04 percent) and WuHua district (23.74%). This was mainly because there are much more public land (as squares, parks, gardens and green spaces on the streets) in Wuhua district and Panlong district which located within the first-ring road than that of other area. (2)The building shape index of Kunming was complicated, diverse and uneven distribution.

Then a decay parameter-based algorithm is employed to determine the decomposition times. Finally, the de-noised Doppler signal is reconstructed using the selected components. The SNR improvements and the maximum frequency estimation precision with simulated Doppler blood flow signals have been used to evaluate a performance comparison based on the wavelet, the wavelet packets and the matching pursuit de-noising algorithms.

These applications involving Doppler signals require the accurate estimation of the IWMF over short durations of the signal due to its nonstationarity. The traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) method requires stationarity of the signal during a finite window, making it inaccurate to analyze signals having relatively wide bandwidths that change rapidly with time. In order to accurately estimate the Doppler IWMF waveform, even when the temporal flow velocity is rapid (high nonstationarity), we extract the Doppler IWMF waveform from the time-frequency distribution estimated using the matching pursuit (MP) with stochastic time-frequency dictionaries in the present study. Because of its local adaptivity to transient structures, the MP algorithm provides a remarkably compact time-frequency description and high time-frequency resolution of a signal. A comparative evaluation has been made between the classic (STFT-based) and the MP-based algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the Doppler IWMF waveform estimated using the MP with stochastic dictionaries is more accurate than that based on the STFT. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, this architecture adopts the structure of octree to store data and establish the corresponding index mechanism, it can make use of the idea of different dimensional space partitioning to achieve a multi-dimensional index. Secondly, the relevant algorithms are designed to sustain the characteristics of this framework in this paper. Finally, the simulation experiment shows that the skip-octree architecture is feasible and efficient.

Based on the Fick's second law, the liquid diffusion coefficient is calculated according to the relationship between the diffusion image width and time. The diffusion coefficient of 0.33 mol/L KCl aqueous solution is D=1.8530×10-5cm2/s, which is measured at the room temperature (25) and by equivalent observation altitude measurement method. The relative error between the measured results and the literature values is 0.65%. The proposed method makes use of the advantage of DLCL that can reduce the spherical aberration in certain range of refractive index, which makes the liquid diffusion coefficients have the characteristics of high accuracy (relative error is less than 1%), high speed (measurement time is about 60 min), and the visualization of diffusion process. © 2018, Chinese Lasers Press.

The experiments on decomposition of images show that our algorithm is very efficient. © 2014 IEEE.","19","Computational methods","Artificial intelligence","Directional information - Image decomposition - Mathematical frameworks - Multi scale analysis - Regularization terms - Shearlet - Variaitional - Variational modeling","723.4 Artificial Intelligence",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

An efficient implementation of such numerical scheme is often desired for practical usage. In this paper, based on fast discrete Sine transform, we design an efficient algorithm to implement this scheme. To do this, Poisson equation is first discretized by fourth-order compact finite difference method. The subsequent discretized system is not solved by the usual method - matrix inversion, instead it is solved with the fast discrete Sine transform. By doing this way, the computational cost of proposed algorithm for such scheme with large grid numbers can be greatly reduced. Detailed numerical algorithm of this fast solver for one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three dimensional Poisson equation has been presented. Numerical results in one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions and four dimensions have shown that the applied compact finite difference scheme has fourth order accuracy and can be efficiently implemented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One important issue in constructing the SDSS for epidemic disease prevention concerns the incorporation of epidemic spread models in a GIS. The chapter begins with a description of the capabilities of GIS in epidemic prevention. Some established models of an epidemic spread are studied to extract essential computational parameters. A technical schema is then proposed to integrate epidemic models using a GIS relevant geospatial technologies. The GIS modeling platforms share a common spatial database the modeled results can be visualized spatially by desktop Web clients. A complete solution for establishing the SDSS for epidemic disease prevention based on the model integrating methods the ArcGIS software is suggested in this chapter. The proposed SDSS comprises several sub-systems: data acquisition network communication model integration epidemic disease information spatial database epidemic disease information query statistical analysis epidemic disease dynamic surveillance epidemic disease information spatial analysis decision support as well as epidemic disease information publishing based on the Web GIS technology.

However, with no special treatment, the expected compression gain will be cancelled by the model cost introduced by high order context models. Context quantization is an efficient method to deal with this problem. In this paper, we analyze the general context quantization problem in detail and show that context quantization is similar to a common vector quantization problem. If a suitable distortion measure is defined, the optimal context quantizer can be designed by a Lloyd style iterative algorithm. This context quantization strategy is applied to an embedded wavelet coding scheme in which the significance map symbols and sign symbols are directly coded by arithmetic coding with context models designed by the proposed quantization algorithm. Good coding performance is achieved.","18","Image coding","Algorithms - Digital arithmetic - Image quality - Iterative methods - Mathematical models - Vector quantization - Wavelet transforms","Context modeling - Context quantization - Entropy coding","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Theoretical (THR)","Number: -, Acronym: CUHK, Sponsor: Chinese University of Hong Kong; ","The author would like to thank Dr. R.

In our offline social networks, social relationships that an individual (ego) maintains with other people (alters) can also be organized into circles or groups according to the ego network model [1]. As to online social network, in order to help users cope with personal social network, many OSN sites provide services for users to group their friends. With many restrictions, such as on Facebook one cannot access other's personal information unless they establish ties with each other, the network structure is the only information known by users. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find circles on personal social network mainly from the structural view. Based on the defined structural similarity and the condition where nodes constitute a circle, the algorithm is able to cluster the most similar nodes into the same circle. We then give proof to demonstrate the convergence of our algorithm. To show the effectiveness of our algorithm, we realize the algorithm on Facebook datasets. Compared with the community detection algorithm, the results are evaluated from the visualized quantified aspect. From the results, we find that community detection algorithm cannot directly deal with the circle detection problem due to the characteristic of ego network and our algorithm can effectively handle the circle detection on ego network. © 2014 IEEE.","15","Social networking (online)","Clustering algorithms - Online systems - Population dynamics - Signal detection","Circles - Community - Ego networks - Network structures - On-line social networks","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper proposes a novel key pre-distribution method based on trivariate symmetry polynomial and hash function. First, the base station assigns some random numbers to each node using BIBD, then two nodes calculate the initial pairwise key using trivariate polynomial which is rotation symmetry. Afterwards each node performs hash operation on the pairwise key depending on the node identifier. In this way, any pair of nodes can obtain the session key. The proposed scheme can guarantee that every pair of nodes intersects on at least one common random number to establish the pairwise key using BIBD. This scheme greatly increases the network connectivity with acceptable computational overhead since only polynomial arithmetic is involved. © 2014 IEEE.","14","Sensor nodes","Hash functions - Network security - Polynomials - Wireless sensor networks","Common random numbers - Computational overheads - Key management - Key pre-distribution - Network connectivity - One way hash functions - Polynomial arithmetic - Trivariate","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921.1 Algebra",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
