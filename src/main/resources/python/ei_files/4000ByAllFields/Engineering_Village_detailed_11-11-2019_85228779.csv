It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate XML Schema Definitions from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the method based on regular expressions, we consider its many inadequacies. We provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSDs when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, XTree impressively minimizes the necessary time and main memory to extract the schema. Our approach features several advantages over known techniques: XTree scales to very large documents (beyond 1 GB) both in time and memory consumption; it is able to extract a general, complete, correct, minimal, and readable schema for complex documents; it detects elements appear as a sequence or choice. Experiments confirm these features and properties. © 2012 IEEE.","13","XML","Biomedical engineering - Extraction","Complex documents - Large corpora - Large XML documents - Memory consumption - Regular expressions - Tools and techniques - Xml schema definitions - XML schemas","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By using linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the existence condition of mixed H -/H∞ fault detection observer gain and its solving approach is derived, which leads to an iterative algorithm for optimal solution.

Methods of documentation, causality, and standard economics were employed. The results indicate that it is necessary to reform the property rights system of urban land, failing to adapt to both fast urbanization and marketability development; and that the access of the reform is to rebuild the property rights system based tenure by adding ground right and land enslaving right and land development right for urban, with improving the tenure and management of urban development as aim and with privatizing use of urban land as emphasis. Meanwhile, it is also important to match reforms of both regulations and administration system together with that of the property rights system. The conclusion is that rebuilding the property rights system for urban is legal base to transfer administration of urban land from only administrative permit into multiple methods used by administrative and economic and legal ways, which is more adaptation to the development of China.

Any design flaw in any of these algorithms could lead to attacks on GKD protocols. We show how two recently-proposed stateful GKD protocols based on asymmetric cryptographic primitives suffer from collusion attacks due to security flaws in either secret assignment algorithms or leave rekeying algorithms. A variety of single-user attacks and improvements on stateless group rekeying algorithms of a number of GKD protocols based on Shamir's Secret-Sharing Scheme (SSS) have been put forward. We show the stateless group rekeying algorithms of one improved protocol and its variant (proposed by us) still suffer from attacks. In addition, we prove a lower bound on the size of a user's long-term secret for perfectly secure multi-session stateless GKD protocols. This bound reveals that (i) it is impossible to design an infinite-session stateless GKD protocol that is both perfectly secure and practical; (ii) all the considered SSS-based stateless GKD protocols are bound to be either incorrect or vulnerable to attacks.

Especially, the non-functional requirements are the determinants of the trustworthy software that show how it achieves the users' desired goals. Considering the importance of trustworthy software and the urgent needs for it, an approach to obtaining process strategies for trustworthy software in the early phase of requirements engineering is proposed. Firstly, the definition of trustworthy software requirements is defined as the combination of the trustworthiness requirements and the quality requirements. Trustworthiness requirements are defined as both functional requirements and trustworthiness concerns. Quality requirements are defined as soft goals. Then, based on fuzzy set theory and information entropy, acquisition method of trustworthiness concerns and soft goals is proposed. On this basis, process strategies for obtaining framework are proposed. Unlike the traditional early-phase requirements engineering which focuses on technical and design decisions, the aim of this study is to make process decisions to support trustworthy software development. In addition, to address the conflict relationships of the non-functional requirements, a reasoning method is developed for solving satisfiability problems of non-functional requirements in trustworthy software. Finally, through analyzing a trustworthy third-party certificate authority software case, feasibility of the proposed approach is described. © Copyright 2015, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

To obtain the global optimal solution gradually, we search the solution space through alternate iterations of global exploration and local exploitation. According to different responsibilities, the searchers (atoms) can be divided into two kinds: the global atoms and the local ones. The global atoms explore the whole solution space to locate the potential areas rapidly. The local atoms exploit each potential area to improve the quality of the solution found by the global atom. The algorithm has two characters: on the one hand, the search strategy with clear division of responsibilities eliminates the need of balancing global exploration and local exploitation, which helps the global exploration to escape from local traps while ensuring the local exploitation. On the other hand, the alternate iterations of global exploration and local exploitation guarantee the asymptotic behavior of algorithm. The asymptotic property of multivariant optimization algorithm is proved theoretically. Extensive comparisons with some outstanding evolutionary algorithms are carried out based on eight complex multi-modal benchmark functions. Results show that this multivariant optimization algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms in asymptotic property. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

In this article, we will use nonlinear adaptive filter based on nearest neighbors in Phase Space to solve EMD end effect.","7","Adaptive filters","Adaptive filtering - Interpolation - Phase space methods","Cubic spline functions - Empirical Mode Decomposition - End effects - Lower envelopes - Nearest neighbors - Nonlinear adaptive filter - Nonlinear and non-stationary signals - Signal decomposition","921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that the artificial pillar width is the most sensitive and important parameter to the stope stability. As the artificial pillar width increases, the stope tends to be unstable.

The original infrared spectra of all the 152 B. edulis samples collected from 2011 to 2014 and 26 different areas of Yunnan Province were optimized with orthogonal signal correction and wavelet compression (OSCW) method. The spectral data that before and after being preprocessed with OSCW were analyzed with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The classification results of PLS-DA were compared. Then the 152 B. edulis samples were randomly divided into a training set (120) and a validation set (32) to establish the PLS classification prediction model. The results showed that, after OSCW processing, the classification result of PLS-DA was significantly better than the other one which was not processed by OSCW. Principal component score plot can accurately distinguish B. edulis samples collected from different years and different origins. It indicated that OSCW can effectively eliminate the noise of spectra and reduce the unrelated interference information about the dependent variables to improve the accuracy and calculation speed of spectral analysis. Before OSCW preprocessed, the R2and RMSEE of PLS model of the training set were 0.790 1 and 21.246 5 respectively while R2and RMSEP of the model of validation set were 0.922 5 and 14.429 2. After OSCW pretreatment, R2and RMSEE of the training set were 0.852 3 and 17.238 1 while R2and RMSEP of validation set were 0.845 4 and 20.87. It suggested that OSCW could improve the predictive effect of the training set, but the over-fitting of OSCW-PLS may reduce the predictive ability of validation set. Therefore, it was unsuitable to establish a model with OSCW combined with PLS. In a conclusion, OSCW combined with PLS-DA can eliminate a large amount of spectrum interference information. This method could accurately distinguish B. edulis samples collected from different years and different origins. It could provide a reliable basis for the discrimination and classification of wild edible fungi. © 2016, Peking University Press.

In this paper, we study the application of a novel textural feature aiming for CE video summary. To overcome the possible illumination and camera motion in the imaging process, spatial pyramid based color histogram is first proposed to describe the color content in a CE frame. Then, Gaussian based local binary pattern is further utilized to describe the textural features in a CE frame.

The results show when the content of hydrogen exceeds 0.29%, the super plasticity of the titanium alloy welded plate decreases with the increase of the hydrogen content. The decrease of the shrinkage of the base material is larger than that of the weld section with the increase of hydrogen content. The K can be used to describe the non-uniform deformation of the weld and the base material during the superplastic deformation of laser welded joint of the TC4. The K value increases with increaseing hydrogen content, increaseing deformation temperature and decreaseing strain rate.

However, ontologies in knowledge-based systems usually suffer from semantic heterogeneities due to distributed developers. Ontology matching is a key solution to the heterogeneity problem in knowledge management. Though state-of-the-art ontology matching systems are able to support diverse ontology matching tasks, the semantic heterogeneity in ontology matching is still the main challenge. In this paper, we propose an element and graph combined matching framework to specifically deal with semantic heterogeneity during ontology matching. Moreover, we also develop an automated ontology matching system and evaluate the system in diverse ontology matching tasks. By using the graph indexing technique, the matching system is scalable with large ontology matching. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves a good result in highly heterogeneous matching tasks and a comparable result in large ontology matching tasks. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.","21","Ontology","Application programs - Indexing (of information) - Knowledge based systems - Knowledge management - Semantics","Element matching - Graph matchings - Ontology matching - Similarity propagation - Weight calculation","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use",,"Number: 71171132, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61373030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The paper has been supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under contract number 71171132 and 61373030.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Design/methodology/approach - Based on self-determination theory, three important contextual factors of QQ knowledge-communication groups were selected as exogenous variables and three typical autonomous motivations as mediating variables to construct a knowledge-sharing model. Internet questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS. Findings - Reciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. Autonomy support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations. Originality/value - This study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of autonomy. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","62","Motivation","Group theory - Knowledge management - Surveys","Autonomous motivations - Design/methodology/approach - Knowledge communication - Knowledge-sharing - QQ group - Questionnaire surveys - Self-determination theories - Structural equation modeling","723.5 Computer Applications - 912.4 Personnel - 921.1 Algebra",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Experiments show that the method overcomes the disadvantages of the wavelet analysis getting the discontinuous edge; it is better in noise immunity and anti-artifact interference compared with the traditional GVF snake model.

However, previous studies generally found that biochar was only effective in a narrow low pH range for Cr(VI) removal, and less attention was paid to biochar which can be effectively operated in a wider range of pH. This study showed that the jute fiber-based biochar pretreated H3PO4 can availably remove and reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in wastewater over a broadened operating pH range of 1–6, in which the intrinsic pH of Cr(VI) solution was included. For this, XRD, Raman, SEM, elemental analysis and N2 adsorption- desorption techniques were utilized to characterize the structure and compositions of the biochars. FTIR, XPS, Boehm titration and zeta potential measurements were performed to determine the surface group and charge distributions. It was revealed that in comparison with the biochar activated by KOH, H3PO4-treated biochar offered sufficient acidic groups such as phosphonic acid and carboxyl on the surface, from which the supplied protons could maintain the pH within a stable range of 1.9–3.4. XPS analysis exhibited that the electron-rich C–O, P–O and C–P bonds acted electron donating moieties to reduce high potential Cr(VI). Cr(VI) uptake experiments showed that Freundlich multilayer chemisorption occurred on the heterogeneous surface. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model suggested the surface reaction was the rate-controlling step.

Previous researches have suggested that prediction of protein function is essentially a multi-label classification problem. Nonetheless, the large number of protein functional annotation labels brings the huge challenge to various kinds of multi-label classifiers applied to protein function prediction. To achieve more accuracy prediction of protein function by multi-label classifiers, we consider the characteristics of high correlation between protein functional labels, and propose a framework of protein function prediction based on Boolean matrix decomposition (PFP-BMD). Meanwhile, considering the problem of hardly satisfying exact decomposition and column in condition simultaneously of current Boolean matrix decomposition algorithms, an exact Boolean matrix decomposition algorithm based on label clusters is proposed, which realizes the hierarchical extended clustering of labels by the label-associated matrix. What's more, we prove its ability of optimal Boolean matrix decomposition based on related deductions. The experimental results show that this exact Boolean matrix decomposition algorithm possesses considerable advantage in reducing the computational complexity in comparison with existing algorithms. In addition, the application of the proposed algorithm in PFP-BMD can effectively improve the accuracy of protein function prediction, and more importantly, reducing and restoring dimensions in the functional label space of proteins using this algorithm lays the foundation of a more efficient classification of various multi-label classifiers. © 2019, Science Press.

In general, the parameters of S-PCNN are set manually, which is complex and time-consuming and usually causes inconsistence. In this paper, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to overcome these shortcomings and improve fusion performance. Firstly, source images are divided into several equidimension sub-blocks, and then, spatial frequency is calculated as the characteristic factor of the sub-block to get the whole source image’s characterization factor matrix (CFM), and by this way the operand can be effectively reduced. Secondly, S-PCNN is used for the analysis of the CFM to get its oscillation frequency graph (OFG). Thirdly, the fused CFM will be got according to the OFG. Finally, the fused image will be reconstructed according to the fused CFM and block rule. In this process, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to get the best fusion effect. By CFM and block method, the operand of the proposed method will be effectively reduced. The experiments indicate that the multi-focus image fusion algorithm is more efficient than other traditional image fusion algorithms, and it proves that the automatically parameters setting method is effective as well. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","46","Image fusion","Feature extraction - Image processing - Neural networks - Object recognition - Parameter estimation - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Processing","Characteristic factors - Characterization factors - Image fusion algorithms - Image fusion methods - Image processing - methods - Multifocus image fusion - Oscillation frequency - Pulse coupled neural network",,,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: 61640306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

We transform the conditional event to normal events and corresponding logical combination events via Conditional Event Algebra, and use Gibbs simulation to sample the normal events to be a stationary state. By computing the quantitative values of the stationary events, we can evaluate the quantitative value of conjunction and disjunction operations of conditional event at last and finish backward reasoning.

Nevertheless, the so-called high-quality is an uncertain or fuzzy definition, which is very suitable for fuzzy theory to address this problem. By the integration of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and fuzzy sets, this paper proposes a new multi-focus image fusion scheme, which can merge the important features of different source images into a fused image. First, the source images are decomposed by SWT to get a set of sub-images with different detailed features. Second, the Gaussian membership function (GMF) is utilized to get the fuzzy sets of sub-images data. Third, the local spatial frequency (LSF) is employed to extract the local features of the sub-images by the generated fuzzy sets. At last, the fusion rule is designed based on consistency verification to fuse the sub-images according to the LSF of fuzzy sets, and then inverse SWT (ISWT) is implemented to reconstruct the fused image. The experimental and contrastive results of different image sets show that the proposed method is an effective multi-focus image fusion scheme which can achieve better fusion effect than other methods. © 2013 IEEE.","50","Image fusion","Fuzzy sets - Image processing - Inverse problems - Membership functions - Wavelet transforms","Consistency verifications - Gaussian membership function - Important features - Multi sensor images - Multi-sensor information fusion - Multifocus image fusion - Spatial frequency - Stationary wavelet transforms","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BIOINT, Sponsor: Biological Interactions Doctoral Programme; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61640306, in part by the Scientific Research Fund of Education Department of Yunnan Province in China under Grant 2017YJS108, and in part by the Doctoral Candidate Academic Award of Yunnan Province in China.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on single-factor tests, Box-Benhnken center composite experiment was carried out with three factors, including alcohol concentration, extraction temperature, solid-to-solvent ratio. RSM was used to determine the effect of prime factors on the yield of flavonoids. Besides, the antioxidant activity in vitro of flavonoids from maca leaves was evaluated. Results showed that the optimum extraction conditions by RSM were ethanol concentration 65%, extraction temperature 64°C, and solid-to-liquid ratio 29:1 (mL/g). Under these conditions, the extraction yield of total flavonoids was (2.49±0.02)%, which was close to the measured value. Thus, the fitted quadratic regression model was valid. The IC50 of the obtained total flavonoids against hydroxyl, superoxide anion and DPPH radicals were 0.605, 0.425 mg/mL and 0.165 mg/mL, respectively. The scavenging impact of the three radicals was more effective than that of 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol (BHT) at the same concentration, but lower than vitamin C.","14","Optimization","Extraction - Flavonoids - Oxygen - Regression analysis - Surface properties","Alcohol concentrations - Anti-oxidant activities - Antioxidant evaluations - Ethanol concentrations - Extraction temperatures - Lepidium Meyenii Walp. leaves - Optimum extraction conditions - Response surface methodology","802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we consider the problem of direction set K-Cover for minimum coverage breach in directional sensor networks. First, we formulate the problem as a game called direction scheduling game (DSG), which we prove as a potential game. Thus, the existence of pure Nash equilibria can be guaranteed, and the optimal coverage is a pure Nash equilibrium, since the potential function of DSGs is consistent with the coverage objective function of the underlying network. Second, we propose the synchronous and asynchronous game-theoretic based distributed scheduling algorithms, which we prove to converge to pure Nash equilibria. Third, we present the explicit bounds on the coverage performance of the proposed algorithms by theoretical analysis of the algorithms' coverage performance. Finally, we show experimental results and conclude that the Nash equilibria can provide a near-optimal and well-balanced solution. © 2014 Jin Li et al.","19","Scheduling algorithms","Congestion control (communication) - Game theory - Real time systems - Routers - Sensor networks","Asynchronous games - Directional sensor networks - Distributed scheduling algorithms - Objective functions - Potential function - Pure Nash equilibrium - Round-robin fashions - Underlying networks","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
