We accumulate the state trajectories that agent experienced in every training episode, and eliminate the state loops existed in the original state trajectories, then the acyclic state trajectories are used to find the critical states. The critical state is a state that has high probability to appear in all these acyclic state trajectories, that means, if agent wants to reach the goal state, then it would have high probability to pass the critical states. So the critical states can be used to shape agent reaching the goal state faster. The Grid-World problem is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

By means of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the research literatures in recent years, it is possible that scholars have a relatively more comprehensive command over the latest subjects, and this can provide some directions for scholars when launching other studies to promote the sustainable development of ME. In this paper, the research hotspots, theme structure, and development trends of ME were surveyed based on literatures in CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). Firstly, among all the extracted keywords, 33 high-frequency keywords representing research hotspots were identified. Secondly, the status and relationship of the research hotspots were calculated and described through social network analysis (SNA). Finally, three research themes were classified by cluster analysis, and their distribution was depicted in a two-dimensional map. In conclusion, the results show that the current research direction of ME in China mainly revolves around two main lines and three research theme areas. Although China has made some achievements, the development of ME is still immature and unbalanced, and four development trends will be the research focus in the future. © 2018 Totem Publisher, Inc.

For the laser gain is excited by side-pumping scheme, it is found that the polarization property of lasing emission is simply dependent on the polarized states of the pump beams. The polarization property of lasing emission depends on the propagating situation of the pump beams in an optical fiber if the laser gain is excited by evanescent-wave pumping scheme, that is, if the pump beams within the fiber are meridional beams, the lasing emission is a transverse electric (TE) wave that forms a special radial polarization emission. However, if the pump beams within the fiber are skew beams, both transverse magnetic (TM) and TE waves exist simultaneously in lasing emission that forms a special axially and radially mixed polarization emission. Pumped by skew beams, the wave-number differences between TE and TM waves are also investigated quantitatively, the results demonstrate that the wave-number difference decreases with the increase of the fiber diameter and the refractive index (RI) of the cladding solution. The observed polarization characteristics have been well explained based on lasing radiation mechanism of WGM fiber laser of gain coupled by evanescent wave. © 2013 Optical Society of America.","21","Whispering gallery modes","Electromagnetic wave reflection - Fiber lasers - Optical fibers - Optical resonators - Polarization - Pumping (laser) - Refractive index","Evanescent wave - Lasing emissions - Polarization characteristics - Polarization properties - Radial polarization - Radiation mechanism - Transverse electric waves - Transverse magnetic","711 Electromagnetic Waves - 714.3 Waveguides - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 744.1 Lasers, General - 744.4 Solid State Lasers",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

From the experimental results, the stable engine operation was achieved by fuelling TME as those of RME and the gas oil. The thermal efficiency of TME is almost the same as that of the gas oil. TME has longer ignition delay compared to the other test fuels due to the lower ignition ability. The pour point of TME is-7.5°C and that is the same as that of RME.

NAM presents significant quasi-periodic oscillation of 35-years in 1895-1955, and 15-years in 1971-2008. The decadal cycle mutation of NAM was owing to the oscillation cycle variation of the external forcing, and the external forcing factors before and after the mutation of NAM periodic oscillations were not exactly the same. Before the 1960s, the external forcing, such as PDO, ATM, North America snow cover and the Antarctic sea-ice oscillation (ASIO) contributed greatly to the NAM quasi-35-years-periodic oscillation.

Providing QoS is more challenging for mobile subscribers at vehicular speeds than for others. On the other hand, time variability and unpredictability of the wireless channel may cause QoS degradation for these users. Therefore, providing seamless handovers especially at vehicular speeds is necessary for maintaining QoS. This paper proposes a new downlink handover priority scheduling algorithm for different scheduling services which is providing lossless handovers and QoS. Taking the power degradation rates into consideration, this algorithm assigns higher priority to the users who have higher speeds. A priority based AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) is also performed for better performance. The analysis results show the efficiency of proposed scheme. © 2009 IEEE.","8","Scheduling algorithms","Degradation - IEEE Standards - Metropolitan area networks - Mobile computing","Adaptive modulation and coding - Broadband connection - Mobile subscribers - Power degradation - Scheduling service - Seamless mobility - Wireless channel - Wireless metropolitan area networks","802.2 Chemical Reactions",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The structure, morphology, and microwave absorption performances of the Fe3O4/PJBC composites were investigated in detail. Due to the porous structure and large interfaces between Fe3O4 and PJBC, the Fe3O4/PJBC composites show excellent microwave absorption performances. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of −39.5 dB is obtained for the Fe3O4/PJBC composites at the frequency of 6.4 GHz. When the thickness is only 1.6 mm, an effective absorption bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) for 5 GHz is achieved from 13.8 to 17.8 GHz. The excellent microwave absorption performances for the Fe3O4/PJBC composites are rooted in enhanced impedance matching, large interfaces, ionic polarization, eddy loss, natural resonance, and multiple reflection and scattering.

Due to the host–guest interaction, AO and AP molecules both can enter into the hydrophobic inner cavity of amPA5 that could form a complex of 1:1 guest–host with amPA5 according to the size of molecules and the cavity of amPA5, but the AP interacts more strongly with amPA5 than with AO, so it can detect AP by the host-guest competition.

In this study, an inexpensive 3D electrode of Ni3S2@Ni foam was obtained through a hydrothermal condition using sodium sulfide as corrodent and Ni foam as both substrate and Ni source. The formation mechanism of this Ni3S2layer was studied through a process analysis based on physical chemistry with assistant of the results from characterizations. The obtained Ni3S2@Ni foam was used as electrode to test its hydrazine electro-oxidation properties in terms of DHFCs and electrochemical sensor.

In the aspect of hydrazine electrochemical sensor, the fabricated Ni3S2layer leads to increased sensitivity and dynamic response property. The results indicate that as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses a potential for practical application in hydrazine electro-oxidation, and Ni3S2is a very promising substitute material for noble metals in hydrazine electro-oxidation.

This study aims to separate the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the upper catchment of the Red River Basin in China. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test methods were applied to identify the trends and change points of the hydro-meteorological variables. The hydrological sensitivity, climate elasticity and hydrological simulation methods were adopted to estimate the contributions of climate variability and human activities to runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff significantly decreased by 1.57 mm/year during the period of 1961-2012. A change point in annual runoff coefficient occurred in 2002. Accordingly, the annual runoff series were divided into the baseline period (1961-2002) and the impacted period (2003-2012). Mean annual runoff of the impacted period decreased by 29.13% compared with the baseline period. Similar estimates of the contributions of climate variability and human activities were obtained by the three different methods. Climate variability was estimated to be responsible for 69%-71% of the reduction in annual runoff, and human activities accounted for 29%-31%. Climate variability was the main driving factor for runoff decrease in the catchment. © 2016 by the authors.","55","Climate change","Catchments - Elasticity - Human resource management - Rivers - Runoff - Testing - Watersheds","Climate variability - Human activities - Hydrological sensitivity - Hydrological simulations - Red River - Runoff changes","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 912.2 Management",,"Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41301099), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2016YFA0601601).

A mutative scale optimization method was developed to efficiently treat these constraints. The method enlarged the time step of the original problem for weakening even eliminating the temporal coupling constraints. Its final purpose was to enhance the convergence speed of solution algorithm and improve the poor solutions of the problem. During the solution process, a series of optimization problems with same operational horizon, objective and demands but different longer time steps were first generated according to the original problem, and then solved in descending order of time step. The initial solution for each problem depended on the optimized power generation of last problem with longer time step. The whole process will not terminate until the original problem with the shortest time step was addressed. The optimization of hydropower system operation in Yunnan Power Grid was used to test the mutative scale method. The simulation operation results show that the proposed method is capable of producing better solutions and cost less time than conventional single-scale optimization method. © 2014 Chin.

The weights of five indexes are determined by the Entropy Method. Finally, we got the SFI (State Fragility Index) through the MADM (Multi-Attribute Decision Making) model. Secondly, we selected the Central African Republic and chose the year of 2014 as the sample which had the largest increasing rate to study how the variable of climate change impacted on a state's fragility. We found that there was a drought increasing its CSI and Economy Fragility Index (EFI) and consequently made the state more fragile. Then we use the TSM (Time Series Method) to predict the fragility index of Central Africa in 2014 without the impact of climate change.

According to the research, the dosage of cement curing agent used for cementing and filling the pores among the grains of concrete debris is consistent with that of compressive strength and porosity from different methods of curing concrete debris. However, the dosage of lime and gypsum curing agent are not the case. That is to say, the dosage of cement used for filling and cementing pores in experiment is equal to that from the theory. But the dosage of lime or gypsum from the experiment is less than that of fully filling the pores among concrete debris from theoretical calculation. It is demonstrated that the process of cement solidifying concrete debris complies with the theoretical model of stabilized soil, while the cement-lime or cement-gypsum composite solidifying agent does not. A hypothesis is made that the mechanism of cement solidifing debris is achieved through filling and cementing. Based on microstructure analysis, a conclusion would be made that the mechanism of the curing agent made by cement - lime or cement - gypsum composite is that their interactions produced a large amount of acicular ettringite and gelling materials, and the interaction of these sediment particles is able to improve the microstructure of solidified objects. For this reason, macroscopic compr essive strength of curing concrete debris was improved.

An important terminal goal of effective data cleaning is to identify the relational tuple or tuple that are 'most related' to a given query tuple. Because a tuple has many attributes, by approximate matching to every attribute of a query tuple against every single attribute of a relational tuple separately, some scores of every relational tuple that express the degree of matching can be acquired. To use these scores to get quantitative distance relationship between a query tuple and relational tuple, and return the first k tuple of relation, is the present solved problem. That is top-k selection problem-identifying the first k tuple which is the closest ones of a relation to the given query tuple.

The seismic rubber bearings with fire protection were analyzed by ABAQUS finite element thermal analysis method. The results of fire resistance test and numerical simulation were compared. The results show that fire resistance limit of the seismic rubber bearings with fire protection is longer than three hours. The fire resistance limit meets the requirements of the GB50016-2014 code for fire protection design of buildings. And the system of fire protection allows a free movement of 150 mm of the bearings. The comparisons between numerical results and those of fire test show that the numerical simulation of thermal analysis can well analyze the thermo-physical field of the seismic rubber bearings.

An extensive experimental investigation is conducted using AT&T face database covering face recognition under controlled/ideal conditions, different illumination conditions and different facial expressions. The recognition ratio is 87% when only Gabor feature, including three exemplar images per person are available.

In this paper, we propose a reliable mobile underwater wireless communication using wideband chirp signals and a novel symbol self-synchronization method. The use of chirp signals takes advantage of the low Doppler sensitivity as well as their good autocorrelation properties. Several lake experiments and computer simulations have been carried out to verify the proposed system over different distances. Phenomenon of synchronization error accumulation caused by Doppler shift is presented.

Then the exact frequency offset estimating can be done by the cancellation operation of long training symbols. The simulation based on 802.11a PHY model is done.

Maximum likelihood estimation for robust initial phase error and Doppler shift are derived by using training sequence.

Using solar heat pump system to heat strawberry greenhouse in winter can not only utilize new energy effectively, but also encourage strawberries to be marketed early and increase their yield and quality. Stereoscopic planting in greenhouse can improve the utilization of space. In order to explore the optimal height of the multistoried heating in the greenhouse, and to match the coefficient of performance (COP) values of the solar heat pump system, a stair-heating mode was designed in this paper. Two greenhouses with the same size were built in Yunnan Normal University, with 20 strawberry plants grown in each greenhouse, using the 'Jingzangxiang' strawberry variety as experimental material. One of the greenhouses was heated by solar heat pump system, which consisted of evacuated tube solar collector, heat pump, water tank and stair-heating system, another one was normal greenhouse without heating system. Strawberries were planted in potted substrates, and the strawberry pots were placed on the steps in the solar greenhouse, while the other strawberry pots were placed on the ground in the normal greenhouse. In this experiment, the temperature and humidity in two greenhouses were analyzed. The temperatures in solar greenhouse in sunny and cloudy days were analyzed separately. In the solar greenhouse, the air temperatures were measured at the height of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m above the ground, and the temperature measurements were carried out separately in sunny days and cloudy days. Furthermore, the quality and yield of strawberry were also compared in the solar greenhouse with stair-heating and the normal greenhouse. In addition, the COP values of the solar heat pump system were measured in sunny days and cloudy days. The results showed that the COP value of solar heat pump system was between 3.02-5.15 in winter in the monsoon climate area of the northern subtropical low latitude plateau. When the weather was sunny, the temperature curves at different spatial altitudes were also different because of the influence of solar radiation. The maximum air temperature at 2.0 m in heated greenhouse was as high as 40.4 in sunny days, which exceeded the temperature range required for strawberry growth, and the maximum air temperature at the height of 1.0 and 1.5 m was 31.6 and 34.2 , respectively, which were within the temperature range required for strawberry growth. The highest night-time heating efficiency was located at 1.5 m. When the average ambient temperature was 8.4 in cloudy day, the daily average air temperature ranges of 1.0 and 1.5 m were 14.1 and 16.9 in solar greenhouse. In the case of the same COP value provided by the heating system, the stair- heating characteristics of the solar greenhouse showed that heating at heights of 1.0 m to 1.5 m from the ground could obtain a temperature environment with a daily average air temperature of 15.5 , and the heating effect was good. Strawberry production in solar greenhouse was 1.56 times of that in normal greenhouses. The average soluble solids content of strawberries grown in solar greenhouse was 10.5% which was higher than that in normal greenhouse. Therefore, the yield and quality of strawberries grown in solar greenhouse are higher than those in normal greenhouse. In addition, the yield and quality of strawberry located at the 1.0 m stair was best with the maximum of the single fruit being 32.3 g and the soluble solid content being 12.5%. In general, when 55 water circulating cascade heating system is used, the temperature in the heights of 1.0 m from the ground is more suitable for strawberry growth. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this paper, we propose the industrial-strength eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a network substrate for these non-trivial Peer-to-Peer Grid Computing applications. © 2009 IEEE.","26","Grid computing","Mobile computing - Peer to peer networks","Communication infrastructure - Execution model - Extensible messaging and presence protocols - Industrial strength - Parallel application - Parallel grids - Peer to peer grid computing - Peer-to-peer interaction","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper begins with the presentation of a new manifold learning algorithm called bidirectional visible neighborhood preserving embedding (BVNPE). Similar with existing manifold techniques, BVNPE first links every data point with its k nearest neighbors (NNs). Then, we construct a reliable neighborhood graph by checking two criteria: bidirectional linkage and visible neighborhood preserving. Third, we assign the weights to each edge in this reliable graph based on the pairwise distance between data points. Finally, we compute the low-dimensional embedding, trying to preserve the manifold structure of input dataset by mapping nearby points on the manifold to nearby points in low-dimensional space. Moreover, this paper also proposes a linear BVNPE called BVNPE/L for straightforward embedding of new data, and a multilinear BVNPE called BVNPE/M, which represents the tensor structure of image and video data better. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.

Although passive microwave remote sensing imagery has been widely used for detecting snow depth in a large area, the accuracy is limited due to the coarse spatial resolution especially in complex terrain areas. This paper aims to improve the spatial resolution of snow depth detection by integrating multi-source remote sensing data, such as optical snow extent and passive microwave brightness temperature data. With the assist of snow extent product with higher spatial resolution, a linear unmixing method is adopted for improving mixed pixel problem in passive microwave images. Snow extent is not only utilized for identifying the proportion of different components in a mixed pixel but also for indicating their spatial locations. Illustrated with a case study in western China, the spatial resolution of snow depth detection is increased with pixel size from 0.25 degree to 0.05 degree. The proposed method shows that integrating higher resolution optical product is an effective means for improving the spatial resolution of snow depth detection. © 2011 IEEE.","13","Image enhancement","Image fusion - Image resolution - Pixels - Remote sensing - Snow melting systems","Multisource data - Snow covers - Snow depths - Spatial resolution - Western China","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Global motion transform between neighboring frames are estimated by using a fast and robust feature-point based algorithm. Then a hybrid global-local motion compensation scheme is proposed to reduce the temporal redundancy of video sequences.

In this paper, a feasible radio frequency (RF) bandpass sampling architecture of single-channel SDR receiver is proposed. The tradeoff between the sampling frequency and resolution of the analog-todigital converter (ADC) and the selectivity and tunability of the bandpass filter provides a natural way to alleviate the design challenge of RF bandpass filter. The passband of the bandpass filter can be wider than the bandwidth of the desired signal, resulting in increasing the sampling frequency and resolution. The minimum acceptable sampling frequency is based on the bandwidth of the signal and the passband of the bandpass filter. The out-of-band interferences are further attenuated in digital domain. The signal can be decimated by sample rate conversion after it has been converted to baseband to reduce the processing rate. © 2009 IEEE.","11","Software radio","Analog circuits - Bandpass filters - Bandwidth - Mobile computing - Radio - Radio receivers - Signal sampling","Band-pass sampling - Communication standards - Out-of-band interferences - Radio frequencies - RF band-pass filters - Sample rate conversion - Sampling frequencies - Software-defined radios","703.2 Electric Filters - 713 Electronic Circuits - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
