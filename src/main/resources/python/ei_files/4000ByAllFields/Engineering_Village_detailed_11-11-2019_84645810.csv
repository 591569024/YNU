With a reserve of approximately 200 Mt of ore containing 6.1% Zn and 1.3% Pb, Jinding is the largest sandstone-hosted Zn-Pb deposit in the world. Most previous studies assumed that the mineralizing fluids were derived from within the basin (including meteoric recharge), and the fluid flow was driven by topographic relief under a hydrostatic regime. In contrast, we propose that the mineralizing system was strongly overpressured based on observations of hydraulic fractures and fluid inclusion data. Numerical modeling results indicate that the overpressures could not have been produced by normal sediment compaction. Thrust faulting and input of mantle-derived fluids are likely responsible for the building-up of the high overpressures. The special hydrodynamic regime and potential contribution of mantle-derived fluids to the mineralizing system distinguish Jinding from other known sedimentary basin-related Pb-Zn deposits. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fifteen elements including Li, Mg, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Cs, and Pb in the sclerotia of W. extensa collected from 28 regions of Yunnan province were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion. The measurement data were analyzed by SPSS through principle component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis, and cluster analysis (CA). The results showed that the correlation coefficients (r) of the linear regression equations of the anayte elements were all above 0.999 0, the measured values of standard reference materials were in agreement with the certified values, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were all below 8%. Hence this method is suitable for the determination of mineral elements of wild W. extensa because of its good precision and accuracy. Our analysis results indicated that wild W. extensa collected from Yunnan contained many kinds of mineral elements. The concentration levels of Ca (925.79 μg/g), K (370.42 μg/g), Mg (115.20 μg/g), and Fe (115.80 μg/g) were the highest, and the levels of toxic elements As and Pb were below the maximum safe limits stipulated in the Standard for Maximum Levels of Contaminants in Foods (GB 2762-2012) and the FAO/WHO standards. The results of PCA indicated that 4 principal components were chosen to examine the dataset which could explain 77.55% of the total variance. V, Fe, Li, As, Cs, Cr, Pb, Sr, Ca, and Mn were inferred to be the characteristic elements in wild W. extensa. The results of correlation analysis and CA were in agreement with PCA. All the tested elements could be grouped into three clusters: Fe, V, Li, Cs, As, and Cr as the first cluster; and Pb, K, Rb, Zn, Mg, and Cu as the second cluster; and Mn, Ca and Sr as the third cluster. The results of CA indicated that there were significant differences in the contents of mineral elements mainly because the mineral element contents of wild W. extensa were greatly influenced by the topography and climate characteristics of Yunnan province. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

Mineral exploitation is one of the most important sources of As environmental problems. In this study, the nine villages (S1-S9) in the vicinity of a Pb-Zn mining area in Yunnan province were chosen as study area, and the county town 20 km away from mining was selected as reference area (S10). The samples including 76 cultivated soils, 306 crop/vegetables and 86 human hairs were collected. Microwave digestion was used to pretreat these samples by controlling the three variables of acid dosage, temperature and duration to get the optimal solution of muti-media. The Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine the contents of As in order to investigate the As pollution level and human health risk in muti-media. The results will provide a reference for policy decision on the prevention and treatment of As pollution caused by mining. Results showed that: (1) after these samples were pretreated by microwave digestion, As detection limits for soil, crops and human hair ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 μg•L-1, and accepted recoveries ranges were 92.43%~112.23% (soil), 97.88%~114.72% (crop/vegetable) and 91.44%~109.65% (hair), respectively, and relative standard deviation was less than 5% with satisfactory results. (2) The mean content of As in soil was 70.66 mg•kg-1, which was 3.84 times higher than that of the background value in Yunnan province. According to GB 15618-1995 of 'soil environmental quality standard' (Grade ) and the single-factor pollution index (Pi), cultivated soil was severely polluted by As. Furthermore, the highest As content was detected in S1, which might be closely related to the mining, smelting and transportation for many years. In crop/vegetables samples, the mean As content of tuber-vegetables was 1.75 mg•kg-1, followed by leafy-vegetables (0.77 mg•kg-1), which was higher than the maize (0.52 mg•kg-1) and root-vegetables (0.51 mg•kg-1). Based on the maximum permissible standard set by China, the excessive rate of As content in crops was 80.64%. (3) The potential health risk assessments of As exposed to multiple pathways among local residents were evaluated by the hazard index (HI), the total carcinogenic risk (TCR), the target hazard quotient (THQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR), respectively. The total non-carcinogenic risk of As for adult and child were 1.13~1.20, which was unacceptable risk. The carcinogenic risk was as high as 10-3, exceeding the general risk acceptable level (10-4) recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Besides, diet was the dominant exposure pathway. The THQs (>1) and CRs (>10-4) of As in vegetables showed that a potential risk did exist, and the TCR of As for child was higher than that for adult. In view of high As risk of vegetables grown in local area, so we suggested that the nonlocal foods were input to avoid health risks of As pollution and those crops whose edible parts are not easy to accumulate As should be largely planted. (4) The contents of As in hair samples in mining area were 0.97 μg•g-1, which was 4.41 times higher than that in S20 km (0.22 μg•g-1) (p-1). The contents of As from male were higher than that from female, and the Group (19~40 years) were higher than Group (≥41 years). It meant that the males in 19~40 years who acted as the major participant in mining and smelting activities were more vulnerable to exposure to As than others. (5) This study provided a powerful basis for the As pollution level in muti-media of the mining area, but also for the assessment of As exposure risk to local human health. © 2019, Peking University Press.

The temporal and spatial distribution of water quality tendency was observed. The water quality of each river is dependent on the hydrology effect such water gate and circulating irrigation system. We must consider the hydrology effect to accurately understand water quality variations of river in this study field. In river without highly circulating irrigation system or water gate effect, the downstream nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increase occurred in area dominated by open field cultivation, whereas the NO3-N concentration was constant or decreased in area dominated by greenhouse land use. This result suggests that greenhouse covers the soil from precipitation, and nitrate load of greenhouse could be less than that of open field cultivation while the rainfall event. In the upper reaches of river, where is dominated by open field cultivation, there were no sharp increase dissolved molybdate reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus concentration, but P load was accumulated in the lower reaches of river, whose predominant land use is greenhouse. Although the P sources is unclear in this study, greenhouse area may have potential of P loads due to its high P content in greenhouse soil.

The mean atmospheric CO2concentration in the late Miocene and the late Pliocene of western Yunnan were higher than present days, and therefore it can be inferred that the climate was warmer in the Neogene of western Yunnan than present days.

In this paper, 18 macro and trace elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, V, and Zn) in both flesh and peel of Wolfiporia extensa from seven sites of Yunnan province in China were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The average recovery rates of certified reference materials for GBW10015 (spinach leaves) ranged from 90.5 to 113%, for GBW10028 (citrus leaves) from 92.8 to 106%, and for GBW07603 (bush branch and leaves) from 83.3 to 114.6%. Generally speaking, the concentration of all elements determined was at common level. The results of this survey indicate that mineral compositions in peel were higher than in flesh. In peel, the contents of investigated trace metals in mushroom samples were found to be in the range of 1,660–13,400 µg·g−1dry matter (dm) for Fe and 29.6–710 µg·g−1dm for Mn.

In flesh, the concentration of Fe was in the range of 54–900 µg·g−1dm, and it was 1.5–49 µg·g−1dm for Mn, followed by Ba, Cu, Rb, and Zn in the range of 1 to 10 µg·g−1dm, while for Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Li, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, and V it was −1dm. The concentration of toxic elements, such as As, Cd, and Pb, in both flesh and peel was below the permissible limits of World Health Organization. However, As and Pb contents in peel were higher than the limits permitted in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

In China, the study on Yunnan panax notoginseng mainly focuses on the physiological property and effects of ginsenosides on human bodies, but the research on processing technology is superficial. According to the national standard in China, the main efficacy index of panax notoginseng is the panax notoginsenoside(PNS) content. However, there are no reports on the effect of drying methods and drying conditions to PNS content. In order to study the influence of drying process to PNS content of Yunnan panax notoginseng, Yunnan panax notoginsengs and their slices were dried by three different methods (natural drying, oven drying and hot-air drying) in this work. The drying curves and drying rate curves of these methods were obtained. The drying kinetics models of main roots within different temperatures in oven drying were established. Meanwhile, the PNS contents of main roots dried by these methods were tested through High-performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC), and the regression equation about temperature and time to PNS content was established and optimized. Results showed that oven drying had a shorter drying time and faster drying rate compared with natural drying. The PNS contents of dried products within natural drying, oven drying and hot-air drying were 7.246%, 11.305%, 8.259%, respectively. It showed that the oven drying kept the PNS content of panax notoginseng higher. Through drying curves and drying rate curves of panax notoginseng, it could be found that there was only falling rate period and no constant rate period during the drying process. The parameters of Lewis model, Page model and Henderson-Pabis model were evaluated through R2. Page model was found to be more suitable in describing the drying characteristics of panax notoginseng. The drying kinetics equation was MR=exp[-0.0037exp(0.0623T)t1.5336exp(-0.0156T)]. It firstly put forward the relationship among moisture ratio, drying temperature and drying time at the drying process of main roots, and it provided a basis for the control of drying process of panax notoginseng. The effective moisture diffusivity of main roots dried at different temperatures was among 3.073×10-10m2/s-1.291×10-9m2/s. The results of significance analysis showed that the drying temperatures had a highly significant impact on the effective moisture diffusivities. The regression equation about temperature and time to PNS content of main roots was y=-606-61.875T+36.625t+0.7559T2-0.1641Tt-0.1096t2. Through response analysis and equation optimization, under the condition of safe moisture content, the better drying temperature (50-60) and time (106-144 h) were obtained. Although main roots' slices had a shorter drying time compared with the whole main roots, the PNS contents of them were lower than the main roots'. To sum up, in order to keep the active ingredients(PNS) of panax notoginseng better, the whole main roots are more fit for the drying process. This result are meaningful to guide the actual production of Yunnan panax notoginseng.","24","Drying","High performance liquid chromatography - Models - Moisture - Ovens - Plants (botany) - Solar dryers - Temperature","Drying characteristics - Effective moisture diffusivity - Equation optimization - Evaluation - Panax notoginseng - Panax notoginsenosides - Physiological properties - Processing technologies","641.1 Thermodynamics - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Multiple measurement data assess the performance of the integrated process, and the combined data set is usually large and complex, among other characteristics.

The study of the scale interval in which the object features are located can eliminate useless information and retrieve useful scale data that are needed for metallogenic prediction. Thus, the model that the specific deposit presents will be rapidly and accurately identified to enhance the efficiency of the prediction and analysis models. This paper employs an improved bidimensional empirical decomposition method to decompose aeromagnetic survey data and expresses and decomposes the spatial distribution of deposits with a mixed Gaussian model. By comparing the decomposition results on various sampling data scales with the distribution function for the deposit, the characteristic scale interval that contains the measurement information that exhibits the greatest similarity to the distribution of the deposits can be identified.

The concentrations of eight heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in soils from 40 sampling points around the Jinding Zn-Pb mine in Yunnan, China, were analyzed. An environmental quality assessment of the obtained data was performed using five different contamination and pollution indexes. Statistical analyses were performed to identify the relations among the heavy metals and the pH in soils and possible sources of pollution. The concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn were extremely high, and 23, 95, 25, and 35% of the samples, respectively, exceeded the heavy metal limits set in the Chinese Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (GB15618-1995, grade III). According to the contamination and pollution indexes, environmental risks in the area are high or extremely high. The highest risk is represented by Cd contamination, the median concentration of which exceeds the GB15618-1995 limit. Based on the combination of statistical analyses and geostatistical mapping, we identified three groups of heavy metals that originate from different sources. The main sources of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu are mining activities, airborne particulates from smelters, and the weathering of tailings. The main sources of Hg are dust fallout and gaseous emissions from smelters and tailing dams. Cr and Ni originate from lithogenic sources. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","50","Soil pollution","Binary alloys - Contamination - Heavy metals - Lead alloys - Lead zinc deposits - Multivariant analysis - Nickel silver - Quality management - Risk assessment - Smelting - Soils - Spatial distribution - Tailings","Airborne particulate - Environmental assessment - Environmental quality assessment - Environmental quality standards - Environmental risk assessment - Identification of sources - Multi variate analysis - Soil contamination","452.3 Industrial Wastes - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 533.2 Metal Refining - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics - 922 Statistical Methods",,"Number: LO1404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013-1, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgements All sources of funding of the study should be disclosed.

The ore body mainly occurs in the stratum of Shahechang Group of Upper Cambrian. Controlled by NE trending faults and its flanking associated structures, it features equal interval and lateral trending distribution in the spatial domain. The development and mineralization of wall-rock alteration experienced two stages, low medium temperature stage and medium-high temperature stage. Metallogenic materials are mainly from the ore-bearing stratum and deep concealed rock mass. Through the study of such geological features as lithology of ore-bearing stratum, structure of ore-controlling Faults, wall-rock alteration, and ore fabrics, the author believes that the formation of the deposit is closely related to the multi stages of tectonic movements and magmatic hydrothermal activities.

The mushrooms X. puniceus (Boletus amygdalinus), X. spadiceus (Boletus ferrugineus) and X. versicolor (X. rubellus) were from the Yunnan land, and X. badius (Boletus badius) was from the region of Europe in Belarus and X. badius, X. chrysenteron, X. ferrugineus, X. versicolor (X. rubellus) and X. subtomentosus from Poland. The THg in the fungal and soil materials was determined using validated method by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy. Estimated was also probable dietary intake and health risk from THg in Xerocomus spp. examined by consumers. The data showed that THg content of Xerocomus spp. emerged in the European localizations in Poland and Belarus is at an order of magnitude lower level than determined in samples from the Yunnan Province. A reason for an elevated content of THg in mushrooms from Yunnan can be related to abundance of Hg in the geochemical background of soils there. The assessed doses showed that a single meal composed of 300 g of fresh fruiting bodies of X. spadiceus from the Wuding localization in Yunnan in China if consumed once a week will provide THg at dose close to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value set for THg, while doses will be lower for all other localizations in Yunnan and Europe.

Tectonically, it belongs to the Sanjiang Block. Vapor–liquid two-phase fluid inclusions, CO2-bearing fluid inclusions, and daughter-bearing inclusions were identified in sulfide-rich quartz veins. Microthermometric and Raman spectroscopy studies revealed their types of ore-forming fluids: (1) low-temperature, low-salinity fluid; (2) medium-temperature, low salinity CO2-bearing; and (3) high-temperature, Fe-rich, high sulfur fugacity. The δ18O values of chalcopyrite-bearing quartz ranged from 4.96‰ to 5.86‰, with an average of 5.40‰. The δD values of ore-forming fluid in equilibrium with the sulfide-bearing quartz were from − 87‰ to − 107‰, with an average of − 97.86‰. These isotopic features indicate that the ore-forming fluid is a mixing fluid between magmatic fluid and meteoric water. The δ34S values of chalcopyrite ranged from 13.3‰ to 15.5‰, with an average of 14.3‰. Sulfur isotope values suggest that the sulfur in the deposit most likely derived from seawater. Various fluid inclusions coexisted in the samples; similar homogenization temperature to different phases suggests that the Badi fluid inclusions might have been captured under a boiling system. Fluid boiling caused by fault activity could be the main reason for the mineral precipitation in the Badi deposit. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","41","Ore deposit geology","Carbon dioxide - Copper compounds - Copper deposits - Deposits - Hydrogen - Isotopes - Mineralogy - Ores - Oxygen - Quartz - Sulfur compounds - Temperature","Fluid inclusion - Homogenization temperatures - Medium temperature - Mineral precipitation - Ore genesis - Ore-forming fluid - Oxygen isotopes - Sulfur isotope",,,"Number: 1212011140050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 41663006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This research was jointly supported by the Geological Survey of China (Grant No. 1212011140050) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41663006).

The various tectonic units of different characteristics are separated by fault structures mainly developed in Cenozoic. Granitic intrusions of various stages which were formed due to allochthonous emplacement or mingmatization are widespread along the tectonic belt. The Ailaoshan tectonic belt has multiple tectonic natures during different geologic history stages. On the whole, it has experienced three important tectonic stages, i.e. Pre-tethys, Tethys, and Cenozoic intracontinental stages. During the Pre-tethys evolution until Early Paleozoic, the major part of the belt (especially along the eastern zone) had affinity to the Yangtze block, and preserved records of Late Archean-Neoproterozoic crustal evolution. Since the Late Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic the tectonic belt became a part of the Tethyan domain with the opening of Paleotethys. The belt was evolved into a tectonic domain with different nature from that of the South China-Yangtze plate. Subsequent closure of the Ailaoshan Ocean in from Early Carboniferous and the Jinping-Song Da Ocean since Early Permian resulted in the formation of the paleo-Ailaoshan orogenic belt. The closure of the Tethyan oceans made Yangtze-South China block and Indochina block to become a unified continent.

This study discussed effect of sulfate evaporate salt layer on lead-zinc mineralization of the Huize and Maoping deposits using sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides and gypsum from the two deposits. δ34SV-CDT value of the Huize ore sulfides ranges from 11.0‰ to 20.0‰ (averaging 14.7‰), with most concentrated in 13.0‰~17.0‰, roughly representing total sulfur isotopic composition. δ34SV-CDT value of the carbonate-associated sulfate ranges from 10.4‰ to 18.6‰ (averaging 13.1‰), slightly lower than the ore sulfides. δ34SV-CDT value of the gypsum in the Carboniferous gypsum salt layer ranges from 12.9‰ to 17.1‰ (averaging 13.6‰), which is consistent with that of the carbonate-associated sulfate. δ34SV-CDT value of the ore sulfides in the Maoping deposit is closely related to its occurrence layers. The δ34SV-CDT value of the ore sulfides in the Baizuo Formation (C1b) ranges from 7.1‰ to 17.5‰, with an average of 12.8‰, which is slightly lower than carbonate-associated sulfate and gypsum in Carboniferous carbonate strata. The δ34SV-CDT value of ore sulfides in the Zaige Formation (D3zg) ranges from 18.3‰ to 22.7‰, with an average of 21.1‰. The results are unlikely with the ore sulfides in the Baizuo Formation (C1b) or the Huize deposit. The δ34SV-CDT value of the gypsum in the Zaige Formation (D3zg) ranges from 21.9‰ to 25.9‰, with an average of 23.6‰, which is slightly higher than sulfides in the Zaige Formation (D3zg). By comparing the sulfur isotopic compositions of the sulfides, sulfate and gypsum, we propose that the sulfur in the ore sulfides of Huize and Maoping lead-zinc deposits mainly came from the sulfate in the ore-bearing strata. In addition, sulfur in the ore sulfides of the Huize lead-zinc deposit mainly came from Carboniferous gypsum salt layer, with only 10% of the sulfur from the underlying Zaige Formation gypsum salt layer; while sulfur in the Zaige Formation ore sulfides of Maoping lead-zinc deposit derived from the Zaige Formation gypsum salt layer, sulfur in the Baizuo Formation ore body mainly came from the Baizuo Formation gypsum salt layer, i.e. the gypsum was reduced in situ. Collectively, we divided the metallogenic process into two stages. At the first stage, gypsum reacted with methane and/or other organic compositions forming hydrogen sulfide gas, which preserved in interlayer fissures or karst caves companied with large scale dolomization. At the second stage, ore-forming fluids containing Pb, Zn and other metals leached from the basement rocks mixed with H2S-rich fluids, resulting in precipitation of pyrite, galena, sphalerite and forming high-grade ores. © 2018, Science Press.

The deposit comprises multiple scheelite ore bodies; multilayer skarn-type scheelite ore bodies are dominant, with a small amount of quartz vein-type ore bodies. Skarn minerals include diopside, hedenbergite, grossular, and epidote. Three mineralization stages exist: skarn, quartz–scheelite, and calcite. The homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal minerals that formed in different paragenetic phases were measured as follows: 221–423 °C (early skarn stage), 177–260 °C (quartz–scheelite stage), and 173–227 °C (late calcite stage). The measured salinity of fluid inclusions ranged from 0.18% to 16.34% NaCleqv (skarn stage), 0.35%–7.17% NaCleqv (quartz–scheelite stage), and 0.35%–2.24% NaCleqv (late calcite vein stage). Laser Raman spectroscopic studies on fluid inclusions in the three stages showed H2O as the main component, with N2present in minor amounts. Minor amounts of CH4were found in the quartz–scheelite stage. It was observed that the homogenization temperature gradually reduced from the early to the late mineralization stages; moreover, δ13CPDBvalues for ore-bearing skarn in the mineralization period ranged from − 5.7‰ to − 6.9‰ and the corresponding δ18OSMOWvalues ranged from 5.8‰ to 9.1‰, implying that the ore-forming fluid was mainly sourced from magmatic water with a minor amount of meteoric water.

Here, we focused on the Yunnan province, a typical mountainous region in southwest China, where soil productivity plays a key role in agricultural development. The objectives were to assess spatial variation and sustainable utilization of soil productivity in the Yunnan province. We constructed a soil database based on 706 soil profiles collected from China's second national soil survey, and assessed soil productivity with a soil productivity index model. We found significant differences in the soil productivity indexes among soil types; the indexes ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 and averaged 0.47. Higher productivity soils generally occurred in forest areas within the west and northwest sub-regions of Yunnan, while lower productivity soils tend to be located at low or extremely high elevations. The soil productivity index was lowest for barren land, followed by dry farmland, grassland, paddy fields, horticultural land, and forest lands. We found the productivity index to increase significantly as latitude increased and to vary with altitude at lower elevations. The soil productivity index ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 generally from the southeast sub-region to the northwest sub-region. Conversion of forest land or grassland to dry farmland may seriously degrade soil productivity. Local governments should consider soil productivity conservation practices when seeking to exploit land resources in mountainous areas. Yunnan's western sub-region has high potential for agricultural development. Effective soil remediation measures and soil and water conservation are needed in the central and southeast sub-regions to maintain sustainable soil productivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","82","Soil surveys","Farms - Forestry - Land use - Natural resources - Productivity - Soil conservation - Soil pollution - Soils - Spatial distribution - Water conservation","Agricultural development - Altitude - Conservation practices - Mountain regions - Pi models - Soil and water conservation - Soil productivity - Sustainable utilization","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 444 Water Resources - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 41101267, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: DWR, Sponsor: Department of Water Resources; Number: 2011FZ009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (grant number: 41101267 and 41301099 ), Basically Apply Research Plan of Yunnan Province (grant number: 2011FZ009 ), and Department of Water Resources of Yunnan Province: Water Science and Technology Project .

However, very few remote sensing studies have estimated the shoot damage ratio (SDR). Thus, we used multi-date Landsat satellite imagery to quantify SDRs and assess the possibility of using spectral indices to determine the beetle outbreak time and spread direction. A new threshold-based classification method was proposed to identify damage levels (i.e., healthy, slightly to moderately infested, and severely infested forests) using time series of moisture stress index (MSI). Permanent plots and temporal field inspection data were both used as references for training and evaluation. Results show that a single threshold value can produce a total classification accuracy of 86.38% (Kappa = 0.80). Furthermore, time series maps detailing damage level were reconstructed from 2004 to 2016. The shoot beetle outbreak year was estimated to be 2013. Another interesting finding is the movement path of the geometric center of severe damage, which is highly consistent with the wind direction. We conclude that the time series of shoot damage level maps can be produced by using continuous MSI images. This method is very useful to foresters for determining the outbreak time and spread direction. © 2016 by the authors.","61","Damage detection","Classification (of information) - Forestry - Remote sensing - Satellite imagery - Time series","Damage ratio - LANDSAT - Multi-datemethods - Tomicus yunnanensis - Tomicusminor","655.2 Satellites - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The objective was to constrain the source and evolution of the CO2-rich ore-forming fluid. The Maocaoping cupriferous veins (types V1 and V2) are hosted in mylonitized and metamorphosed Jurassic sedimentary rocks. Early- to late-stage hydrothermal tourmaline occurs as vein-related alteration halos (tourmaline-A) in altered marble or schist, as tourmaline-V1 in type V1 veins, and as tourmaline-V2 in type V2 veins. Tourmaline-A, -V1, and -V2 belong to the alkalic group and consist mostly of dravite, with δ11B values of − 3.9‰ to − 1.1‰, − 2.8‰ to + 0.5‰, and − 6.3‰ to − 3.9‰, respectively. Tourmaline-G belongs to the alkalic group and consists of schorl, with δ11B values of − 14.7‰ to − 12.2‰. The similarities in chemical composition between marble- and schist-hosted tourmalines and between tourmalines in veins and alteration halos (indicating their formation at different water/rock ratios) suggest that the compositions of the hydrothermal tourmaline at Maocaoping were controlled mainly by the chemistry of ore fluid rather than that of the host rocks. The similarities together with the lack of systematic variations in δ11B values in individual tourmaline grains imply that mixing of multiple fluids cannot be important during the mineralization. The positive shift in δ11B values from tourmaline-A to tourmaline-V1 is interpreted to result from continuous precipitation of tourmaline in a closed fluid system. Relative to tourmaline-A and -V1, tourmaline-V2 is Fe-rich, Al-poor, and11B-depleted. These differences may be explained by fluid phase separation and subsequent escape of the CO2-rich vapor phase during the formation of type V2 veins, consistent with the observations that these veins are extensional, contain large amounts of carbonate minerals, and include fluid inclusions trapped in the vapor–liquid two-phase field. The earliest tourmaline-A records the initial ore fluid chemistry. The calculated δ11B, δ18O, and δD values of the initial ore fluid in equilibrium with tourmaline-A at mineralization temperatures of 280 to 320 °C are − 0.3‰ to + 3.0‰, + 10.7‰ to + 11.8‰ and − 110‰ to − 84‰, respectively. The δ11B values as well as the chemical compositions of tourmaline-A are much different from those of tourmaline-G, suggesting that the ore fluid at Maocaoping was not derived directly from the peraluminous granitic magma. The B–H–O isotopic features as well as enrichment of CO2in fluid inclusions also suggest the ore fluid cannot solely be derived from basinal fluid or meteoric water. The simplest explanation is that the fluid was derived from a metamorphic fluid that had obtained isotopically lighter hydrogen via reaction with “organic” compounds (e.g., CH4, H2S). Alternatively, the ore fluid sourced from the mixed metamorphic fluid and basinal brine, meteoric water, or degassed magmatic fluid. It implies that the vein Cu ore formation in the Lanping Basin is unlikely as a result of a sole magmatic or basinal fluid activity and it needs the involvement of metamorphic fluid/process. © 2016","87","Silicate minerals","Carbon dioxide - Copper - Copper deposits - Deposits - Hydrochemistry - Isotopes - Marble - Mineralogy - Ores - Phase separation - Sedimentary rocks","Chemical compositions - Continuous precipitation - Fluid sources - Hydrothermal fluids - Isotopic composition - Maocaoping - Systematic variation - Tourmaline","481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 544.1 Copper - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: IGCP/SIDA600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1212011220908, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 12120114010301, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: U0933605, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41273050, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41320104004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41373049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We wish to thank Shui-Yuan Yang and Xiong Yan for their help with LA-ICP-MS analyses.

The deposits occur within weakly metamorphosed rocks of the late Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic Dongchuan Group and are spatially associated with discordant breccia bodies that are interpreted as having formed from salt diapirs. The Tangdan deposit, the largest in the region, consists of stratiform and discordant orebodies predominantly hosted in dolostones immediately above hematitic sandstones and siltstones and in black shales above the dolostones. Host rocks for the deposit display a complex paragenetic sequence of alteration and mineralization. Early sodic alteration resulted in the growth of both albite and ferroan dolomite. Later potassic alteration resulted in the precipitation of potassium feldspar and locally biotite in argillaceous layers. Sulfide mineralization was temporally and spatially associated with silicification that postdated both sodic and potassic alteration. Textures suggest that silicification may have preferentially affected evaporite minerals in the dolostones. Copper sulfides form bedding-parallel disseminations, veinlets and, to a lesser extent, stockworks. Copper sulfides are dominated by chalcopyrite with lesser bornite and chalcocite. Hypogene chalcopyrite and bornite from the Tangdan deposit have d34S values that range from -12.7 to +9.3% and cluster between -3 to +5% The values suggest derivation from Mesoproterozoic marine sulfates. The dolostone host rocks have relatively homogeneous C and O isotope values ranging from 0.2 to 1.3% d13CV-PDB and from 19.1 to 22.4% d18OV-SNOW. Carbonate minerals in quartz sulfide veins display both a trend toward lighter oxygen isotope values and a trend to significantly lighter carbon isotope values. The light carbon isotope values suggest involvement of organic carbon in the mineralizing process. Alteration and mineralization at Tangdan probably occurred via interaction of oxidized saline brines derived from the underlying red-bed sequence with partially to wholly lithified dolostones. Sulfide precipitation was likely due to both redox reactions and mineralizing fluid pH changes resulting from dolomite and sulfate dissolution. The styles of alteration and mineralization at the Tangdan deposit are similar to those observed in the Central African Copperbelt, particularly the dolostone-hosted orebodies in the Mines Series of the Democratic Republic of Congo. © 2012 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.","54","Copper compounds","Copper deposits - Deposits - Feldspar - Geochronology - Isotopes - Mica - Mineralogy - Organic carbon - Redox reactions - Sedimentary rocks - Sedimentology - Sulfide minerals - Sulfur compounds","Central African Copperbelt - Democratic Republic of Congo - Mineralizing fluids - Oxygen isotope values - Potassium feldspar - Southern Sichuan Province - Sulfide mineralization - Sulfide precipitation","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The model is further used for estimating the probability of use-attainment associated with lake water as a drinking water source and various levels of candidate criteria (based on the reference conditions and the current environmental quality standards for surface water). It is found that these candidate criteria cannot satisfy the designated 100% use-attainment.

And some studies stated that the deficit of precipitation was the main reason to recent droughts in southwestern China. Although precipitation is the main influence factor of drought formation, many studies have shown that evapotranspiration also plays a vital role in the progress of drought evolution. But how actual and potential evapotranspiration affect drought evolution is not well understood. In order to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations of the climate aridity in recent years as well as the roles of evapotranspiration in drought development in the YG region, monthly actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration data products during 2000-2014, including satellite-retrieved MODIS MOD16 data and GLDAS-Noah model simulation as well as the observed precipitation data were used to calculate 3 meteorological drought indices, i.e., standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized reconnaissance drought index (RDIst) and evaporative stress index (ESI). With the Mann-Kendall trend test method, the 15-year temporal variations of SPI, RDIst and ESI in YG region are investigated. Besides, the severe drought that happened during 2009-2010 in YG region is further investigated as an example to analyze the role of actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration in drought evolution. According to the spatial distribution of annual average precipitation and the trend test results of 12-month SPI, there is a remarkable downtrend in middle Yunnan with an area of 12945 km2, indicating that areas with low annual precipitation are getting drier. The spatial patterns of trend tests for RDIst calculated based on different potential evapotranspiration are similar, consistent with that of SPI trend test result, both implying that there is a very significant drying trend in middle Yunnan and a slight drying in its surrounding areas, and the significant drying trend in the middle Yunnan is mainly controlled by the changes of precipitation. In terms of the trend of ESI, its spatial distributions based on MOD16 and GLDAS-Noah evapotranspiration data show great differences, but they both indicate an obvious drying trend in central Yunnan, which is similar to that of SPI and RDIst. Trend analyses of all 3 drought indices show that, the climate aridity in Guizhou Province is stable, while there is a considerable drying trend in middle Yunnan because of the joint effects of significant decline of precipitation and the remarkable increase of potential evapotranspiration. As the regional drying is not only controlled by the changes of precipitation but also affected by the changes of evapotranspiration, drying areal extents indicated by ESI and RDIst are larger than that indicated by SPI. During the 2009-2010 drought happened in YG region, actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration played little roles at the early stage, but with the evolution of drought, they greatly aggravated drought situations at the late stage. At the end of drought when precipitation returned to its normal condition, potential evapotranspiration kept positively biased for about 1-3 months, whereas actual evapotranspiration kept negatively biased for about 5 months, illustrating that actual evapotranspiration has a longer effect on drought evolution than potential evapotranspiration. The analysis of 2009-2010 severe drought also indicates the effectiveness of different drought indices, that is, ESI considers both actual and potential evapotranspiration, and is more reasonable than SPI and RDIst for monitoring drought evolution. So it can be concluded that when accurate actual evapotranspiration data are available, drought indices based on both actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration are preferable to those based on only potential evapotranspiration for drought monitoring. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reliable actual evapotranspiration products available most of time while there exist many widely used methods for potential evapotranspiration calculation, therefore when actual evapotranspiration products are not available, a practical option is using drought indices that take potential evapotranspiration into account. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Comparing the principal component color composite images, which are created by three PCA techniques, a color composite image created by applying selective two bands PCA technique is more reliable to visually interpret the type and the intensity of alteration haloes around the intrusive igneous bodies.","7","Principal component analysis","Clay alteration - Copper deposits - Geology - Hazards - Igneous rocks - Mapping - Minerals","Color composite image - Copper mineralization - Field informations - Hydrothermal alterations - Principal component - Principal Components - Remote detection - Statistical tables","405.3 Surveying - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A reinforcement system consisting of a geogrid, front stability piles (FSPs), retaining sheets, prestressed anchors, and rear deeply buried piles (DBPs) has been used to stabilize the slope. Two typical slope sections were selected to study the high-fill slope stability and retaining mechanism of the reinforcement system. Field measurements of the horizontal displacement and strain in the piles, as well as the anchor working load, were collected and analyzed. In addition, a series of two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses combined with a strength reduction technique was conducted to analyze two selected cross sections. The results show that the retaining structure behavior is closely related to the fill construction process of a high-fill slope. The deflection of the stabilizing pile increases almost linearly with the filling height in the initial stage of fill construction. The variation in the working load of the prestressed anchor shows an offset between prestress loss and increasing fill pressure. The FEM results can provide insight into the pile-soil interaction mechanism and its contribution to fill slope stabilization. The FSPs shift the sliding surface from through the slope toe to through the top of the FSPs. The anchors can reduce the bending moment by supplying additional bearing points. The DBPs can share a portion of the sliding thrust and effectively enhance the safety factor.

This area is highly deformed as it was involved in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. The sedimentary and deformation features of the basins have significant implications for the tectonic evolution of southeast margin of the plateau. The Paleogene deposition and subsequent structural activities in these two basins illustrate three phases of deformation, including strong compression deformation in the Early Eocene, extensional deformation in the Middle Eocene and the strike-slip deformation during Oligocene. The very first compression deformation exhibits as fold-thrust system in the Lanping area, thrust movement along the Ailaoshan-Red River Fault, and broad folds in the Jianchuan Basin. Regarding the sedimentation, the Paleocene Mengyejing Formation is characteristics by fine grained rocks and shore-lacustrine facies, while the Eocene Baoxiangsi Formation occurs as fluvial deposition and has the feature of foreland basin deposition. The switch from shore-lacustrine to fluvial deposition may result from the strong compression during the Eocene. Afterwards, the basins' tectonic regime transferred from the early compression to extension, and the intrusion of high-K granites and dikes during the Middle-Late Eocene indicates an extensional background. At the same time, the deposition was transformed from the fluvial facies of Baoxiangsi Formation to meandering fluvial facies with molasse features in the Eocene Jinsichang Formation. The absence of Oligocene sediments and the onset of the sinistral strike-slip along the Ailaoshan-Red River Fault suggest strike-slip deformation during the Oligocene. Therefore, the Jianchuan-Lanping Basins experienced twice kinematics transform at the Middle Eocene and Oligocene, which is also supported by the provenance study of the basins. Integrating the studies about the Eocene magmatism in the southeast plateau, the huge Oligocene strike-slip movements along the Chongshan and Gaoligong Shear Zones, and the rotation of the Baoshan Block at the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the Paleogene tectonic evolution includes compression during the Paleocene-Early Eocene, extension during the Middle-Late Eocene, and transpression during the Oligocene. © 2017, Science Press.

Fault systems are significant to mineralization in this district because faulting activities have confined magmatic activities into certain spatial scales and temporal stages, which provide both hydrothermal fluids and heat for mineralization within fracture zones. Analysis of fault density using the singularity theory to characterize development of fault systems suggests that spaces produced by faulting activities favored the migration of hydrothermal fluids and mineralization. In addition, the singularity theory is applied to examine singular distributed ore-forming elements. Principal component analysis was used to model the spatial distribution of enrichment of the association of ore-forming elements, which suggests that geochemical haloes are linked with characteristic hydrothermal mineralization in the study area. For modeling mineral prospectivity, student's t-values were estimated by weights of evidence method to depict patterns of fault density and geochemical anomalies that are highly correlated with known mineral deposit occurrences in the study area. By overlaying these patterns, distributions of enrichments of associated ore-forming elements and spaces due to faulting that favored mineralization can be modeled and areas prospective for mineral exploration can be delineated. The consistency of the results with information from published documents demonstrates that the exploration model discussed in this paper is useful and effective for investigating geological issues related with faulting activities. © 2012.","57","Faulting","Financial data processing - Fractals - Geochemistry - Mineral exploration - Mineral resources - Mineralogy - Ore analysis - Ores - Principal component analysis","Fault density - Geo-information integrations - Geochemical anomaly - Geochemical exploration - Hydrothermal mineralization - Ore-forming elements - Singularity - Weights of evidences","481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 801 Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: -, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2009AA06Z110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1212010733811, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: ERC-OGP0183993, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Thanks are due to two anonymous reviewers, Dr. Renguang Zuo, and Dr. John Carranza for their critical reviews and constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

The Gaoligongshan tunnel is one of the key projects, for which the biggest difficulty in geological route selection is how to understand the deep tectonic environment. Especially it lacks knowledge on the deep geological structure related to the geothermics, earthquakes and so on. This paper takes the Gaoligongshan tunnel as the main research object, by processing, interpreting and inverting the magnetotelluric (MT) data along the Gaoligong Mountain zone, to probe the deep electrical structure below the Gaoligongshan tunnel. A 3D vertical fault model is constructed according to the geological conditions around the tunnel, which is also based on the analysis of the relationship between the regional geological structure and the main engineering geological problems. The 3D finite element forward modeling results show that the lateral resolution is related to the distance and position of survey points, the closer distance leading to higher resolution. And the resolution can be enhanced when the survey points coincide with the projection locations of the fault on the surface. Data processing and analysis include calculation of the electric strike and 2D skewness of the area using MT phase vector decomposition and NICG 2D inversion of apparent resistivity and phase data, which reveals the electrical structure above 10 km depth of the Tengchong block, Longling-Ruili structure zone and Baoshan block and the relationship between them. The results show that the electrical structure of the profile CD can be divided into three parts. The electrical structure of the Tengchong block is bedded better than Baoshan, both of which are characterized by high resistivity. Below 3 km depth of the Longling-Ruili structural zone between the two blocks is a low resistivity belt nearly vertically extending below 3km, likely reflecting the Dingqing-Nujiang collision suture zone in western Yunnan. The six deep buried faults closely related to the engineering are explained by the profile AB, and it is inferred that the fault F7-3 is responsible for the 1975 Longling MS7.3 earthquake according to the seismic geology, surface geology and deep background. There is a low resistance channel with maximum depth of about 4 km which begins from the Huangcaoba fault on the surface and extends downward, probably controlling the deep-circulation channel of geothermal together with the Huangcaoba fault, which is considered to be the important engineering geological condition for the Gaoligongshan tunnel scheme, forming a relatively low-temperature channel at the position of the line. In sum, the exploration results show that the electrical structure of the Longling area in western Yunnan reveals the characteristics of deep buried faults and the fractured deep-circulation channel of geothermal of the Gaoligongshan tunnel, which provides the evidence of deep geological background for the route selection of the engineering project. © 2017, Science Press.

To simulate the spatial distribution of fracture networks, this paper proposes a geostatistical method in consideration of their directions (strikes and dips). Fracture locations are generated randomly, following fracture density values assigned by sequential Gaussian simulation method. Fracture direction is divided into n equal (or un-equal) groups, and sample fracture directions are assigned to its corresponding group. Then sample fracture directions are transformed into indicators consisting of n binary variables, where 1 and 0 represents belonging to and not belonging to this group. For calculation convenience, the indicator number is reduced by using the principal component analysis. Then ordinary kriging is employed to estimate the distributions of these principal components. The results are inversed to the original indicator form, and the biggest one is assigned as 1 while the others are assigned as 0. Fracture directions are generated randomly by using the cumulative distribution function of the biggest group. Based on these simulated results, fracture elements can be determined with location and direction. At last, fracture elements within the angle and distance tolerances are connected to be one fracture. The case study of the fracture data in Gejiu dolomite of southeast Yunnan Province shows that the combination of sequential Gaussian simulation, ordinary kriging and principal component analysis can provide a reasonable simulation result for locations and di-rections of fractures.","21","Fracture","Interpolation - Principal component analysis - Tin mines","Cumulative distribution function - Fracture distributions - Fracture network - Geo-statistics - Geostatistical method - Principal Components - Sequential Gaussian simulation - Three dimensional simulations","421 Strength of Building Materials; Mechanical Properties - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This confirms that the Feixianguan Fm in western Guizhou and northeastern Yunnan provinces was severely remagnetized. Thermal demagnetization also resolves two postfolding components from the limestone samples of the Mid-Triassic Dashuijingshan Formation from southern Yunnan Province: a low temperature component acquired in recent times and a high temperature component probably acquired shortly after the India-Asia collision. The mean in-situ direction for the high temperature component based on eighteen sites is D=95.4°, I=28.4° with α95=6.2°, which indicates a clockwise rotation of 86.3±7.3° with respect to stable Eurasia. This result together with paleomagnetic results previously reported from the Jurassic-Eocene rocks in the same area demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that the central Simao Terrane has experienced large clockwise rotations due to the India's collision with, and continuing penetration into, Asia. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","37","Demagnetization","Clocks - High temperature effects - Lime - Magnetization - Rotation - Temperature","Feixianguan formation - India-Asia collision - Paleomagnetic rotations - Postfolding - Remagnetization - Triassic","641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments",,"Number: EAR 8816968, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: EAR, Sponsor: Division of Earth Sciences; ","We thank geologists from No. 113 Geological Brigade of Guizhou Province and from Regional Geological Survey Team of Yunnan Province for their field assistance.

The skarn deposit has geophysical characteristic of the medium or low resistivity of contact zones, low density of porphyry, high magnetic susceptibility and high polarizability of the iron ore. This study follows multiple laws and principles of geology and geophysics to analyze ore-controlling factors in different stages, accomplishing the positioning of concealed skarn deposits and the establishment of the geophysical exploration model.

The orebodies, hosted in the dolostone of the Devonian Zaige Formation, the Carboniferous Baizuo and the Weining Formations, are mainly vein and massive ores composed of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, quartz, and calcite. To constrain the metallogenic age and the source of the reduced sulfur of the Maoping lead–zinc deposit, direct Rb–Sr chronometry of sphalerite and in situ sulfur isotope analysis of sulfides of all paragenetic stages was studied. A sphalerite Rb–Sr age of 202.5 ± 8.5 Ma for sulfide mineralization obtained from a quantitative geochronological two-component paleomixing model coincides with a well-constrained episode of the evolution of the Youjiang foreland basin from the Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic. In situ sulfur isotope analysis shows that sulfur isotope values are distributed between 14.7 and 23.2‰ with a maximum difference of 8.5‰. However, the δ34S values of pyrite, sphalerite, and galena are closely clustered and vary from 20.9 to 23.2‰ 19.3 to 21.0‰ and 14.7 to 17.2‰ respectively. The relation of the δ34Spyrite > δ34Ssphalerite > δ34Sgalena in all samples indicates that sulfur isotope equilibrium fractionation between coexisting pyrite, sphalerite, and galena may have been reached at temperatures of approximately 120–250 °C. From this, the total δ34S of the ore-forming fluids was calculated to be 19.7 to 22.0‰ which is interpreted as the result of thermochemical reduction of aqueous sulfate in the Youjiang Basin basinal brine. Based on these results and previously reported metallogenic ages, the features of the ore-controlling structures, ore-body features, and the characteristics of the ore-forming fluids of other typical lead–zinc deposits in the SYG triangle, the Zn–Pb deposits located within the SYG triangle are genetically related to migration of basinal brines caused by the contraction and then closure of the Youjiang foreland basin in the Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","136","Zinc deposits","Calcite - Deposits - Geochronology - Isotopes - Lead deposits - Ore reduction - Pyrites - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","Foreland basin - Guizhou - Maoping - Mississippi - Sulfur isotope","481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 12120114019701, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; ","This research was financially supported by the China Geological Survey project (No. 12120114019701).

The radiance calibration and atmosphere calibration are taken to ETM+ image and then NDVI is used to estimate vegetation proportion, which in turn is used to estimate emissivity. After that the generalized single-channel algorithm is used to calculate LST and A-D four temperature anomalous areas are determined in the geothermal distribution map. At last the causes of the temperature anomalies are discussed. We come to the conclusion that the distribution of geothermal anomalies is controlled by the faults in the study area. It is the intrusion of mantle-derived magma that finally caused the land surface temperature anomalies.

In this study, a synthetic evaluation indexes system for sustainable land use was constructed through the application of landscape metrics. Taking Yongsheng County of Yunnan Province, China as a case study, a series of quantitative evaluation were conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2001, to monitor the temporal dynamics of regional land use sustainability. Two indicators, contributing amount of indexes, and obstacle amount of indexes, were also set up to ascertain the significance of all the evaluation indexes to the evaluation results.

Assessing the impact of climate change on the drought characteristics of Yunnan Province is particularly important. The drought conditions in Yunnan Province were analyzed by using the multi-time scale standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The seasonal variation of two indexes and the characteristics of drought in the region were analyzed by using non-exceedance probability and runs theory, respectively. The results showed that the non-exceedance probability of SPEI (1) below and equal to -1.0 in the winter of 1961-1995 was 5.2%, and it was increased to 18.4% from 2066 to 2100; the non-exceedance probability of SPEI (6) below and equal to -1.0 was increased from 4. 4% to 21.4%, SPEI (24) was increased from 7.0% to 25.7%. It was showed that due to climate change, serious droughts may occur in the future, and the medium and long-term droughts were more serious than short-term droughts. Severe droughts caused by climate change during the winter and summer periods from 1961 to 1995 and from 2066 to 2100, and the severity of medium-and long-term droughts was particularly strong during winter and summer. SPI and SPEI time series were applied to the runs theory and it was found that the drought intensity determined by SPEI (1) from 1961 to 1995 was 28.3, which reached 60.9 by 2066 to 2100, indicating that the climate changes had exacerbated the future drought. The results were instructive and practical for drought prediction and assessment in Yunnan Province, as well as its risk management and application decisions. At the same time, it can provide a scientific reference for the future dry farming ecological management and drought evolution prediction. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Yunnan province, locating in southwest China, experienced an extreme drought event (from autumn of 2009 to spring of 2010), with the lowest percentage rainfall anomaly and the longest non-rain days in the past 50 years. This study aimed to explore the characteristics and differences in the response to drought of four land cover types in Yunnan province, including forest, grassland, shrub, and cropland during the period 2001-2011. We used remote sensing data, MODIS-derived EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) to study the vegetation responses to this extreme drought event. The EVI time series were decomposed into trend, seasonal and remainder components using BFAST (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend) which accounts for seasonality and enables the detection of trend changes within the time series. The preliminary results showed that: (1) BFAST proved to be capable of detecting drought-induced trend changes in EVI time series. (2) Changes in the trend component over time consisted of both gradual and abrupt changes. (3) Different spatial patterns were found for abrupt and gradual changes. (4) Cropland exhibited an abrupt change, due to its sensitivity to severe drought, while the forest seemed least affected by the extreme drought.","18","Drought","Climate change - Forestry - Radiometers - Rain - Remote sensing - Time series - Vegetation","Enhanced vegetation index - Environmental risks - Global climate changes - Rainfall anomaly - Remote sensing data - Spatial patterns - trend - Vegetation response","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The accuracy of such models greatly depends on the reliability of the rainfall data used. In turn, due to spatio-temporal variations in rainfall, the reliability of the rainfall data is mainly controlled by the distance between the rain gauge and the source area of the event. The high variability of rainfall events has been noted by many researchers, but detailed analysis using local rainfall data is scarce. We report here our comparison of rainfall data derived from two meteorological stations (MS.1 and MS.2) which were located at the deposition fan (1820 m.a.s.l) and source area (2400 m.a.s.l), respectively, of Touzhai Landslide in Yunnan, China. The two MSs spanned 580 m in elevation and 2.23 km in horizontal distance. Rainfall data collected hourly for a 1-year period (1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014) were analyzed. The results showed that rainfall at the two locations differed significantly. First, the vertical rainfall gradient between the two MSs was up to 187.9 mm/100 m, and the rainfall amount at MS.2 was 1.8-fold greater than that at MS.1. Second, MS.2 had both a greater amount of rainfall and a longer duration of events compared to MS.1, and high-intensity rainfall events were more frequent at MS.2. Thirdly, rainfall at the two locations was asynchronous, i.e. the rainfall at MS.2 always started earlier and ended later than that at MS.1. Both MSs showed a diurnal rainfall pattern in which it rained less during the daytime and more during the nighttime. These data revealed a negative relationship between rainfall and temperature and a positive correlation between rainfall and elevation. Based on all data together, the rainfall difference between the deposition fan and the depopulated source area of Touzhai Landslide is distinct. We conclude that in mountainous areas with a large altitude difference, rainfall data can improve the precision of rainfall threshold models only when rain gauges are sufficiently close to the source areas. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","87","Rain","Deposition - Landslides - Rain gages","Diurnal rainfall - High intensity rainfall - Meteorological station - Positive correlations - Rainfall distribution - Rainfall induced landslides - Rainfall thresholds - Spatio-temporal variation",,,"Number: U1033601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: U1502232, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China–Yunnan Joint Fund (U1502232, U1033601) and Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (2013531411005).

It plays an important role in regulating the internal matter in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, and controlling the major strong earthquake activity in the region. Extracting the region tectonic landforms information from the RS (remote sensing) images and DEM (digital elevation model) to quantitative study of tectonic geomorphology of the fault zone. The results show that the fault belt have the characteristics of segmented partitions. The northern boundary faults of the Jinguan-Chenghai basin are dominated by normal faults, and they have the highest vertical movement rate in the zone. Qina faults are dominated by strike-slip movement, which have the highest strike-slip activity rate. The eastern boundary faults in Binchuan basin are also dominated by normal faults. The vertical activity rate is lower than that of the northern section. Comprehensive analysis shows that the Quaternary vertical activity of Chenghai-Binchuan fault zone is lower from north to south, and strike-slip activity in central is strongest, diminishing to south. The long-term activity rate of Binchuan fault zone has maintained a relatively stable state, the vertical activity rates between 0.09-0.69 mm/a. Horizontal strike-slip rate between 0.20-1.40 mm/a. The Quaternary activity of faults mainly is 'medium' and 'weak', but the future earthquake risk should not be ignored, especially in the south middle of it. © 2018, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

This study presents it, and GIS-based technology route is recommended in the TM application. The study area is Yongsheng County, Yunnan Province, P. R. China. Six Landsat TM images are acquired over Yongsheng County with geometrical correction, procession and classification. Landscape types, including farmland, urban area, forest, watershed, wasteland and selected farmland are obtained as Areas of nterest). The elevation and grade maps of Yongsheng County are produced on its Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a scale of 1:250,000. We group the elevation into five levels: 1,000 - 1500m, 1500 - 2000m, 2000 - 2500m, 2500 -3000m; and above 3000m; and four levels are determined for grade maps, i.e., 0 - 6, 6 - 15, 15 - 25, and above 25 degrees. Under the help of GIS tools, area of six landscape types on five elevation levels is calculated separately. We also obtain area of farmland on each elevation and grade level through the same methodology. All these data work in the subsequent analysis of landscape pattern. It is found that farmland mostly locates in areas with elevation below 2,000 m and grade less than 15 degrees, for example, 'candid' areas. We can interpret it by the great ease these candid areas provide for farm work. The Index of Component Fragmentation Degree (ICFD) is used to evaluate human's disturbance on farmland. ICFD is relatively small for 'candid' areas due to comparatively large farmland patches, but maximizes itself where elevation is from 2,000 to 2,500m. It gives a signal of serious human disturbance there. This disturbance is just deforestation for farmland on this belt. We also analyze the landscape pattern of urban areas. Its area reaches a maximum on the belt with elevation between 1,500 and 2,000m. It's also considerable that urban area decreases as the elevation increases and reaches almost ZERO where elevation is above 3,000m. Results presented in this paper suggest that farmland landscape pattern shows its vertical variance according to elevation ranges, and human's disturbance weights much in this variance. This study also provides information on deforestation for farmland, and it seems valuable in environmental protection and region regulation.","10","Pattern recognition","Agriculture - Environmental protection - Geographic information systems - Image analysis - Information analysis - Remote sensing - Watersheds","Digital elevation model (DEM) - Farmland landscape - Technical route - Youngsheng","903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 811.0.3 Economics, Research and Miscellaneous - 811.0.2 Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics - 811.0.1 Biology and Biochemistry - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 741.1 Light/Optics - 723.5 Computer Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 444.1 Surface Water - 731.1 Control Systems","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
