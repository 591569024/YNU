The bleaching effects of three kinds of oxidation systems, i. e., peroxide (H2O2), peracetic acid (CH3COOOH) and H2O2/CH3COOOH system, were investigated. The results showed that H2O2/CH3COOOH system was better than the single systems of H2O2 and CH3COOOH. The main process parameters in H2O2/CH3COOOH system was optimized using the response surface method. The optimal conditions were m(CH3COOOH):m(ESDMW) 20:1, m(H2O2):m(ESDMW) 36.7:1, time 80 min and temperature 118.5. Under these conditions, the L value of the product was 62.02, which was almost consistent with the model prediction. The joint use of H2O2/CH3COOOH system with the Cr6+ was explored. The results showed that the bleaching effect of the joint use of Cr6++CH3COOOH/H2O2 was better than any other methods used before. More importantly, under the premise of better bleaching effect, the dosage of Cr6+ was significantly reduced by the optimized process. ©, 2015, The Editorial of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products».

This study proposes a method to predict the remaining-dangerous time (RDT) of the icing load accretion on an interval of the power transmission lines with modified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). Based on the predicted RDT of the cables during ice accretion, the appropriate preventative measures can be scheduled in advance by electric power companies. The estimation model with the learning algorithm of support vector machine for icing load accretion is built through historical icing load accretion data and meteorological conditions first. Then, the estimated icing load accretion sequence can be obtained through the estimation model by forecasting the meteorological conditions. The modified HSMM method can eliminate the possible underflow issue during computation, and be used to build the RDT prognosis model. With the estimated icing load accretion sequence and RDT prognosis model, the authors can predict RDT of the icing load accretion on an interval of the power transmission lines. The developed prognosis algorithm is verified through collected meteorological conditions and icing load accretion data on the Dazheng 73# power transmission line in Zhaotong area, Yunnan Province, South China. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.","","20","Power transmission","Cables - Electric lines - Electric utilities - Forecasting - Markov processes","Cable failures - Electric power company - Estimation models - Hidden semi-Markov modeling - Hidden semi-Markov models - Meteorological condition - Prognosis models - Yunnan province","602.2 Mechanical Transmissions - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Then, a power-balanced operation plan is obtained by adjusting the power flow area by area, with the consideration of distribution of power imbalance in the power grid. The active power imbalance and reactive power imbalance are derived after the integration of data. Finally, an automatic power flow convergence adjustment process is developed to generate the operation plan that meets analytical requirements according to the weakest transmission path theory.

Herein, cone scales of Cedrus (Pinaceae) were uncovered from the Upper Pliocene Sanying Formation, Longmen Village, Yongping County of Yunnan Province in southwestern China. Detailed comparisons show that these fossils all belong to the genus Cedrus (Pinaceae), and a new species is proposed, Cedrus angusta sp. nov. This find expands the known distribution of Cedrus during the Late Pliocene to Yunnan, where the genus no longer exists in natural forests. Based on the analysis of reconstructed Neogene climate data, we suggest that the intensification of the East Asian winter monsoon during the Quaternary may have dramatically increased seasonality and given rise to a much drier winter in Yunnan. Combined with information on Cedrus fossil records and its seed physiology, we conclude that the intensification of a drier climate after the Late Pliocene may have prevented the survival of Cedrus seedlings, leading to the eventual disappearance of Cedrus in western Yunnan. This study indicates that the topography in southwestern China acted as a vital refuge for many plants during the Quaternary, but that other species gradually disappeared due to the intensification of the monsoonal climate. © 2013 University of Washington.","","60","Climate change","Atmospheric thermodynamics","Cedrus - Climatic changes - Longmen - Monsoon - Pliocene - Quaternary - Sanying Formation - Yunnan","443.1 Atmospheric Properties",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy; Number: EAR-0746105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 123106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Education Foundation; Number: 31100166, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Dr. Xiao-guo Xiang from the Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr. Olesya V.

The interval containing the Luoping biota is the middle to upper part of Member II of the Guanling Formation. The fossil assemblage of the Luoping biota is a mixture of marine animals, terrestrial plants and a few terrestrial animals. To date, more than ten fossil groups have been recovered, which include marine reptiles, fishes, arthropods, echinoderms, ammonites, bivalves, gastropods, lingulid brachiopods, foraminifers, and plants. The Luoping Biota is one of the most diverse Triassic marine fossil Lagerstätten records in the world. The age of the Luoping biota is assigned to the Pelsonian Substage of the Middle Triassic Anisian Stage based on the index conodont Nicoraella Kockeli. Well-preserved, diverse marine reptiles are one of the highlights of the Luoping biota, including ichthyosaurs, sauropterygians, protorosaurs and archosauromorphs. Mesozoic is remarkable for marine reptiles, whose swimming modes, however, remain a topic of much controversy because of the absence of their tracks. Hundreds of seabed tracks found in Luoping Biota, which were assigned to Dikoposichnus luopingensis, provide new materials for the study of their locomotive mode. Besides, the macropredator Nothosaurus zhangi reported from Luoping Biota also supports the existence of the makers of Dikoposichnus luopingensis. The skull of Nothosaurus zhangi is the largest sauropterygian ever reported in Triassic. The occurrence of a different assemblage of marine reptiles as top predators in the food web indicates a well developed marine ecosystem, showing full rebuilding of the marine ecosystem after the mass extinction that happened about 250 million years ago. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Drought is the most prominent agro-meteorological disaster which poses serious threat to maize production. Therefore, it is important to analyze its temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and occurring regularities to provide technical supports for disaster prevention and reasonable layout of maize production in Southwest China. In this study, daily meteorological data, collected from 60 stations in maize planting areas of Southwestern China during 1960-2010, were used to calculate the Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) which computed daily and based on three important factors (soil, vegetation and atmosphere). The spatial distribution of drought frequency at maize growth periods and annual variations of drought in recent 50 years were analyzed to validate the application of ARID in this region. The results showed there were obviously regional characteristics in recent 50 years. Drought happened most frequently in north center and northeast of YunNan and south of SiChuan, followed by GuanYuan of SiChuan areas, mountains of southwestern SiChuan, northwestern YunNan, YuanJiang and its surrounding areas. Areas with the lowest incidence of drought mainly located in the most regions of ChongQing, the north of GuiZhou and other regions. Drought occurred with the highest frequency at the stage of emergence to jointing and the lowest frequency at the stage of tasseling to filling. In addition, with the development of the growth, drought occurrence had the tendency to move to the east. ARID extremely differed in sub-regions of Southwestern China during maize growing periods. In general, light drought happened in higher frequency than moderate and severe drought. Specifically, only a few regions were moderate drought or fluctuated between light drought and moderate drought. The inter-annual change feature of ARID showed that drought was light in 1980s and became more serious at the beginning of the 21st century.","","27","Drought","Disaster prevention - Disasters - Grain (agricultural product) - Monitoring - Spatial distribution","Agricultural - Maize - Maize growth periods - Meteorological disasters - Northwestern Yunnan - Regional characteristics - Southwestern China - Temporal and spatial distribution","444 Water Resources - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Leaf N and P of 126 plant species in 70 vegetation plots in GPES were investigated in central Yunnan, southwestern China, and leaf P fractions (i.e., inorganic vs. organic P) of the dominant species were examined. Our objectives were to improve the understanding of the role of soil N and P variability in controlling leaf N and P stoichiometry of plant communities in GPES. We found that plants in GPES had higher mean leaf P (4.07 mg/g) and lower N:P ratios (4.94) than average plant values that have been recorded in other parts of the world so far. Some fast-growing plants had extremely high leaf P (>10 mg/g). Community leaf N and P contents increased as soil N availability increased, but soil N variability was unrelated to community leaf N:P. Instead, community leaf P and N:P ratios were primarily determined by soil P; as soil P availability increased, leaf P increased and leaf N:P significantly decreased. Greater accumulation of inorganic P relative to organic P in leaf was the direct driving factor for community leaf P and N:P ratio patterns in GPES. Although soil P availability was the main controlling factor of leaf N:P patterns, community composition could be manipulated to restore the balance of N and P stoichiometry based on the different responses across species and plant types. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","45","Soils","Forestry - Nitrogen - Phosphorus - Stoichiometry","Central Yunnan - Geochemically P-enriched soils (GEES) - Inorganic phosphorus - Organic phosphorus - Species specifics","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Compared to the traditional sliding window (SW) technique with disadvantages of the empirical predetermination of a fixed maximum window size and outliers sensitivity of least-squares (LS) linear regression method, the BSW based singularity mapping approach can automatically determine the optimal size of the largest window for each estimated position, and utilizes robust linear regression (RLR) which is insensitive to outlier values. In the case study, tin geochemical data in Gejiu, Yunnan, have been processed by BSW based singularity mapping approach. The results show that the BSW approach can improve the accuracy of the calculation of singularity exponent values due to the determination of the optimal maximum window size. The utilization of RLR method in the BSW approach can smoothen the distribution of singularity index values with few or even without much high fluctuate values looking like noise points that usually make a singularity map much roughly and discontinuously. Furthermore, the student's t-statistic diagram indicates a strong spatial correlation between high geochemical anomaly and known tin polymetallic deposits. The target areas within high tin geochemical anomaly could probably have much higher potential for the exploration of new tin polymetallic deposits than other areas, particularly for the areas that show strong tin geochemical anomalies whereas no tin polymetallic deposits have been found in them. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","","46","Tin deposits","Deposits - Geochemistry - Least squares approximations - Linear regression - Mapping - Statistics - Tin","Gejiu, Yunnan - Linear regression methods - Polymetallic - Robust linear regression - Robust regressions - Singularity indices - Sliding window methods - Spatial correlations","405.3 Surveying - 481.2 Geochemistry - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: 2015A030310246, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 41502310, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41272361, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41502310 , 41272361 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province , China (No. 2015A030310246 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Because there are very few terrestrial records of this event, most of our understanding comes from marine cores. In this report, we first present new palaeomagnetic data that revises the dating of our 400 m-thick lacustrine section in Wenshan (Yunnan), previously thought to be Late Miocene. These new data suggest an older age, ca. 15.2–16.5 Ma, coinciding with the MMCO. We measured δ13C on bulk organic matter (δ13Corg), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratios at a high sample resolution to: (1) reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental changes in the lake catchment area, and (2) infer mechanisms responsible for these changes. Our results show that all four geochemical parameters demonstrate that a strong environmental change occurred around the middle of the section, shortly after the C5Cn/C5Br geomagnetic reversal and the Early/Middle Miocene boundary at 15.97 Ma. We propose that the environmental shift may be due to a combination of a change in climate, which became cooler, together with a change in organic matter cycling within the lake. This study provides a new insight into the MMCO and demonstrates that although the MMCO was generally a warm event, it was also a time of climatic instability and abrupt environmental changes. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","58","Organic carbon","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Catchments - Climate change - Geomagnetism - Lakes","C/N ratio - Carbon isotopes - Environmental change - Environmental shifts - Geochemical parameters - Miocene - Total Organic Carbon - Yunnan","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 481.3.2 Earth Magnetism and Terrestrial Electricity - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: -, Acronym: RAS, Sponsor: Russian Academy of Sciences; Number: 11431780, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 15310, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: XTBG-F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41404056, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 2013GCX606, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: U1502231, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: USGS, Sponsor: U.S. Geological Survey; ","The authors are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, which significantly improved the manuscript.

A series of OFs were established under multiple scales of composite windows by using gradient based method and a coarse OF was estimated by using the weight of each scale determined by a squared gradient consistency.b. The OF was first quantized into two digitized orientation zones and the two-orientation-zone filtering was adapted to the OF blocks based on a filtering mask obtained after eliminating the isolated blocks.In the end a similar three- digitized-orientation-zone filtering were performed to obtain an accurate and smooth OF.To validate the performance,the proposed method was applied to OF computation using the FVC2004 databases.The experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods according to their performance in OF computation.The proposed method can correct spurious ridge structure and meanwhile avoid singularity deviation compared with the previous works. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Firstly, the fingerprint image was considered as a non-stationary 2D signal and was transformed to Fourier domain by short time Fourier transform analysis. Subsequently, a creative angular and radial estimation method was proposed to calculate the orientation and the frequency images of the fingerprint in Fourier domain after performing root filtering and morphological filtering. Finally, based on the curvature of fingerprint, a Butterworth notch band pass filter and a Gaussian band pass filter were applied to filter the low curvature area and the high curvature area, respectively, which can effectively remove the noise in the singular area and non-singular area while remaining the main frequency pattern. The proposed method was subjectively and objectively compared with approaches in literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is of better performance than the compared methods since it can remove noise, enhance the contrast between ridge and valley of fingerprint and simultaneously preserve the correct ridge direction. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Since human actions were extracted from Kinect and inertial sensors, they can be characterized by multiple feature representations. By encoding the multiview features into a unified space, it could be optimal for human action recognition. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature fusion method termed multiview Cauchy estimator feature embedding (MCEFE) for human action recognition. By minimizing empirical risk, MCEFE integrates the encoded complementary information in multiple views to find the unified data representation and the projection matrices. To enhance robustness to outliers, the Cauchy estimator is imposed on the reconstruction error. Furthermore, ensemble manifold regularization is enforced on the projection matrices to encode the correlations between different views and avoid overfitting. Experiments are conducted on the new Chinese Academy of Sciences - Yunnan University - multimodal human action database to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MCEFE for human action recognition. © 2013 IEEE.","","52","Image recognition","Encoding (symbols) - Inertial navigation systems - Interfaces (computer) - Parameter estimation - Pattern recognition","Chinese Academy of Sciences - Data representations - Feature embedding - Feature fusion method - Human-action recognition - Intensive research - Manifold regularizations - Reconstruction error","722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,"Number: 14CX02203A, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016B010108010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140417113430736, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140901003939013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JSGG20160331185256983, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JSGG20140703092631382, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 2015A030313744, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 2014DP173025, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61301242, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 6140051238, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 6140021567, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572486, Grant 61671480, Grant 6140021567, Grant 6140051238, and Grant 61301242, in part by the Yunnan Natural Science Funds under Grant 2016FB105, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252 and Grant 2015A030313744, in part by the Shenzhen Technology Project under Grant JCYJ20140901003939001, Grant JSGG20160331185256983, Grant JSGG20140703092631382, Grant JCYJ20140417113430736, and Grant JCYJ20140901003939013, in part by the Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, in part by the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University, in part by the Special Program of Guangdong Frontier and Key Technological Innovation under Grant 2016B010108010, in part by the Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant 2014DP173025, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China University of Petroleum (East China) under Grant 14CX02203A.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the present study, based on detailed on-site survey, indoor rainfall tests were designed to investigate the different hydraulic responses of initial and seismic slopes to rainfall. To further assess the joint effects of earthquake disturbance and subsequent rainfall on slope failure, the rainfall unsaturated seepage fields of the above two types of slope were simulated separately. Then, based on the pore water pressures obtained in the above calculations, the safety factors of the slopes were calculated using a finite element method. The results showed that the seismic slopes are inclined to rainfall infiltration, which significantly increased the pore water pressure and induced the rise of ground water. Moreover, the factor value of seismic slope safety suffering subsequent rainfall was shown to be smaller than the undisturbed one. Finally, a deeper potential failure zone and wider soil mass sliding range evidently illustrated the combined effect of earthquakes and rainfall on the triggering of slope failure. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","10","Rain","Earthquakes - Finite element method - Groundwater - Infiltration - Landslides - Pore pressure - Pressure distribution - Safety factor - Soils","Combined effect - Hydraulic response - On-site survey - Pore-water pressures - Potential failures - Rainfall infiltration - Unsaturated seepage - Yunnan province","443.3 Precipitation - 444.2 Groundwater - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 484 Seismology - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although digital elevation models (DEMs) are often useful to improve mapping accuracy, high quality DEMs are seldom available over large areas, especially in developing countries. In this study, a hierarchical approach coupled with topographic information derived from coarse DEM was developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of forest mapping over mountainous areas. The overall idea of increasing mapping accuracy over large mountainous areas is to reduce spectral variety over areas to be mapped. The approach consists of three major steps. The first step is to partition a large mountainous area into several small mapping zones. Forest mapping is then conducted in each zone independently. At the second step, forest areas are separated from non-forest areas through a semi-automatic binary classification procedure. At the third step, forested areas are then further classified into detailed forest types by coupling Landsat ETM+ imagery and two topographic variables derived from a coarse DEM (extracted from 1:250,000 digital elevation contour layer, which are readily available). This hierarchical approach was illustrated and evaluated through a case study in Northwest Yunnan, China, a very rugged terrain in the world. Forests and non-forests were separated accurately and efficiently (the overall accuracy is 0.97 and Khat value is 0.94 of whole area). It was found that the inclusion of the coarse topographic data improved the mapping accuracy significantly (overall accuracy from 0.74 to 0.84, from 0.76 to 0.89, from 0.78 to 0.84 in three test areas, respectively), and that the difference in accuracy between the use of coarse DEM data and the use of fine DEM data for the study area is not significant (overall accuracy from 0.84 to 0.86). The results indicate that the hierarchical approach, coupled with coarse DEM information, is effective in increasing the accuracy of forest mapping over very rugged terrains when high quality digital elevation models are not available. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the Coulomb stresses on the Tingri and Nyalam earthquakes transferred by the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence are (2~3)×103Pa and (2.4~3.1)×105Pa, respectively. It implies that the Tingri and Nyalam earthquakes are triggered by the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence. Then, we projected the stress changes generated by the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence on the fault planes and slip directions of the active faults near the source region and in Chinese mainland. The Coulomb stress largely increases on the Himalayan main frontal thrust fault and the extensional normal faults in the interior of the Tibet plateau, such as the Kyêbxang Co-Xainza-Dinggyê fault zone, the fault zone of the southeast foot of the Nyaiqêntanglha Mountains, the Yibug Caka-Dawa Co-Gyêsar Co fault zone, the Cam Co-Palung Co fault zone. While it decreases on the strike-slip faults in Tibet plateau, such as the Altyn Tagh fault, the East Kunlun fault, the Yushu-Maqu fault, west of the Pangong Tso fault, the Lhari fault. The Coulomb stress also decreases on the faults on the north and south side of the Tienshan Mountains. Little Coulomb stress changes appear on the faults in northern Xinjiang, North China, Northeast China and South China. Lastly, we calculated horizontal stress changes generated by the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence. The horizontal area stress increases in the north direction of the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence (most of the Tibet plateau and Xinjiang region), and decreases in southern Tibet to the east side of the earthquake sequence and south part of the Sichuan-Yunnan region. Little horizontal area stress increase took place in North China and Northeast China. Little horizontal area stress decreases are seen in South China. The principal compressive stress shows an outward radiation centered on the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence with the principal extensional stress along the direction of concentric circles in western China. The principal compressive stress shows NE direction in Northeast China, NEE in North China and SEE in South China, respectively. The direction of the horizontal stress change generated by the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence presents a similar pattern of the contemporary stress field, which means that collision between the India and Eurasia plates associated with the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence is the major dynamic source for tectonic deformation in Chinese mainland. © 2015, Science Press.

Compared with unaltered granite, the content of total REE of potassic alteration granite increases, and the HREE rises higher than LREE. Besides, La and Ce of the LREE increase more than Pr and Nd. Secondary potassium feldspar inherits the REE characteristics of the alteration fluid. These probably result from high temperature and F, Cl, CO2rich features of the fluid. The content of total REE of epidotization-chloritization granite is relatively unchanged. The decease of LREE and slight increase of HREE perhaps are caused by the combination of factors of alteration, absorption of mica and early potassium alteration. Eu and Ce anomaly indicate that potassic alteration occurs at relatively high temperature in oxidation conditions, and epidotization- chloritization occurs at relatively low temperature in reducing conditions. REE are closely related to main ore-forming elements in the altered granites, providing relevant information for ore prediction in inner granite acteration zone.","","33","Granite","Cerium - Chlorine compounds - Copper - Deposits - Feldspar - Mica - Potassium - Rare earths - Silicate minerals - Temperature - Tin","Distribution patterns - Ore-forming elements - Oxidation conditions - Polymetallic - Potassium feldspar - Reducing conditions - REE features - Yunnan province","482.2 Minerals - 544.1 Copper - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Expanding culture was put into the denitrify tower to study its effect on the NO and NOxremoval efficiency. The fungal community structure through high-throughput sequencing analysis was monitored. The results showed that the strain 3LNB through morphological, nitrogen (NO3-) removal characteristics research, and ITS sequence analysis was identified as Fusarium solani. For up to 10.01 g/L of NO3-_N, the denitrifying rate of bacteria control group was 5.6% with nitrogen removal efficiency of 0.56 g/L, but the denitrifying rate of strain 3LNB was 15.1% with nitrogen removal efficiency of 1.51 g/L for 10 days, which proved that the strain 3LNB had strong denitrification function.

The case-study on the piperocks from the Lower-Middle Ordovician Hongshiya Formation at Dabaochang of Qiaojia, northern Yunnan Province, Southwest China indicates that the forming and preservation of piperocks were controlled by the depositional environment, the intensities of predation, competition, bioturbation, and the contents of nutrition and oxygen in watermass.

In order to ascertain the shale gas accumulation conditions and resource potential in the region, more than 300 core samples collected uniformly (at a sampling interval of 2m) were analyzed through organic geochemistry and petromineralogy tests taking the complete core data of the first single well GY1 in which all main Devonian shale formations were encountered in Guizhong depression during drilling as the research object. According to the analysis result, the Devonian shales in the northwest of Guizhong depression are characterized by large thickness (470~1300m), high TOC (0.29%~10.63%), high thermal evolution degree (Ro 1.88%~2.84%), etc., thus making for generation and enrichment of shale gas. In addition, their features such as high content of brittle minerals, high development degree of organic pores and micro-fractures, etc. also show that the shale layers can be well stimulated. However, after reconstruction by multiphase tectonic movements, fault activities have a certain destructive effect on the shale reservoirs in the region and a large impact on the gas bearing property of the shales. From perspective of exploration potential, according to the analysis of various parameter indexes of 3 main Devonian shale formations (Liujiang Formation, Luofu Formation, and Nabiao Formation), it is believed that the Lower Member of Liujiang Formation is relatively favorable in terms of organic geochemical characteristics, physical characteristics, hydrocarbon accumulation conditions, etc. and is the key layer of shale gas exploration in the region. 2019 Aussino Academic Publishing House.","","18","Petroleum prospecting","Gases - Geochemistry - Geological surveys - Oil bearing formations - Organic minerals - Planning - Resource allocation - Shale - Shale gas - Sustainable development","Accumulation conditions - Devonians - Exploration potential - Geochemical characteristic - Guizhong depression - Hydrocarbon accumulation - Physical characteristics - Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi region","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 512.1.1 Oil Fields - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 522 Gas Fuels - 912.2 Management",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The pivotal step of ethanol production from lignocellulose is the degradation of lignocellulosic materials to monomeric sugars through the concerted action of cellulolytic enzymes. In order to search for more efficient lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms and their enzymes, strains from humus soil samples of Gaoligong Mountains State Nature Reserve, Yunnan province, China, were isolated and purified. One of the fungal isolates YT01, with very high lignocellulose-degrading ratio and velocity, was identified as Pe´nicillium expansum. It metabolized numerous saccharides and polysaccharides, removed much of the holdbacks of lignin and hemicellulose for cellulose hydrolysis. YT01 had activity from multiple extracellular polysaccharidedegrading enzymes, including one xylanase (64 kDa), three endoglucanase (73 kDa, 43 kDa, 40 kDa), one exoglucanase (38 kDa) and one α-glucosidase (57.8 kDa). In this paper, the results showed that 69.32% cellulose, 78.66% hemicellulose and 66.22% lignin of un-pretreated rice straw were degraded after 4 days fermentation of YT01, which were much higher than the relative activities of control strains demonstrated in other reports. YT01 may have strong potential for industrial application and bio-resource utilization.

Subsequently, the pixel direction of fingerprint ridge was computed, then the directional image of fingerprint ridge was obtained by dividing the directions into three parts. Finally, after eliminating the noise and completing the non-ridge area, singularities under multi-scales of smoothing were detected. Furthermore, information fusion was applied to eliminate the false feature points to accurately locate the singularities. Experimental results on FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 show that the accuracy of singularity detection obtained by the proposed method is improved and the accuracy ratio is 92.35%.

Due to nonperson supervision for a long time, there are not enough historical power generation records, so the forecasting model is difficult to be developed. In this paper, the support vector machine (SVM) is chosen as a method for short-term power generation energy prediction because it shows many unique advantages in solving small sample, nonlinear, and high dimensional pattern recognition. In order to identify appropriate parameters of the SVM prediction model, the genetic algorithm (GA) is performed. The GA-SVM prediction model is tested using the short-term observations of power generation energy in the Yunlong County and Maguan County in Yunnan province. Through the comparison of its performance with those of the ARMA model, it is demonstrated that GA-SVM model is a very potential candidate for the prediction of short-term power generation energy of SHP. © 2014 Gang Li et al.","","41","Forecasting","Genetic algorithms - Hydroelectric power - Pattern recognition - Scheduling - Support vector machines","Energy forecasting - Energy prediction - Forecasting modeling - High-dimensional - Prediction model - Small hydro power - Small hydropower stations - Yunnan province","611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The representative local structure preserving methods include manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. In this paper, we propose a local structure preserving method that effectively integrates manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. Particularly, we construct a new graph Laplacian by combining the traditional Laplacian and pairwise constraints. The new graph Laplacian can better preserve the local geometry and then further boost the performance. Finally, we build new local structure preserving classifiers including kernel least squares and support vector machines.

What makes metal oxides useful in these technologies is the fact that their chemical and electronic properties can be tuned to enable charge exchange with a wide variety of organic molecules. Although it is known that charge exchange relies on the alignment of donor and acceptor energy levels, the mechanism for level alignment remains under debate. Here, we conclusively establish the principle of energy alignment between oxides and molecules. We observe a universal energy-alignment trend for a set of transition-metal oxidesgrepresenting a broad diversity in electronic propertiesgwith several organic semiconductors. The trend demonstrates that, despite the variance in their electronic properties, oxide energy alignment is governed by one driving force: electron-chemical-potential equilibration. Using a combination of simple thermodynamics, electrostatics and Fermi statistics we derive a mathematical relation that describes the alignment.","","34","Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)","Charge transfer - Electronic properties - Molecules - Semiconducting organic compounds - Thermodynamics - Thin film transistors - Transition metal oxides - Transition metals","Donor and acceptor - Energy level alignment - Low-resistance contacts - Mathematical relation - Organic molecules - Organic photovoltaics - Organic thin film transistors - Power conversion efficiencies","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The summation of Jl and Js provides a minimum value Jmin under the same hydraulic radius R, and corresponds to a critical diameter d0 between the coarse particle of the solid phase and the fine particle of the liquid phase. By analyzing field data measured at Jiangjia gully, Yunnan Province, China, a relationship between the minimum energy gradient Jmin and the critical diameter d 0 for a viscous debris flow has been established, in which the minimum energy gradient decreases with increasing critical diameter and hydraulic radius.

Moreover, the study investigated if age, gender or cultural factors affect these attitudes. A total of 345 students from two in many aspects different countries, China (Yunnan University) and Sweden (Dalarna University) participated in this study. To access learners' perceptions toward mobile technology use, we employed Kearney's pedagogical framework to mobile learning from a socio-cultural perspective (Kearney, Schuck, Burden, & Aubusson, 2012). Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to approach students' cultural views, as these dimensions represent some values - aspects of culture - that may affect attitudes toward technology and learning individually as well as in combination. The findings show the respondents' attitudes toward mobile learning are very positive with individualization being most positive (83%) followed by collaboration (74%), and authenticity (73%). The statistical analysis indicates that Hofstede's factors cannot explain the differences in mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) attitudes in the chosen sample. Among the personal factors, gender is identified to be a predictor to explain the differences in students' attitudes toward MALL. This study shows that technology itself seems to be the most important culture-shaping factor, more important than culture inherited from the physical environment, and more important than age. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is one of the highland characteristic agricultural products that develops in priority of Yunnan Province and also pillar crops of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It is of great significance for assessing the agricultural development in the region by grasping the planting information quickly. Remote sensing image has the characteristics of wide coverage area and short return period. Therefore, it has become an important mean to quickly understand agricultural situation on the help of remote sensing image to extract crop information. For this reason, based on the remote sensing images of the 30-m resolution Landsat 8 in Maguan County in October 2014, using the OIF best band combination and the maximum likelihood supervised classification method, the spatial information of the Sanqi distribution in Maguan County was extracted. The extraction result was analyzed with an accuracy of 82.3%. The results of extraction can better reflect the regional distribution of Sanqi in Maguan County, and also provide a reference to other regions that plant Sanqi. © 2018 IEEE.","","24","Remote sensing","Agricultural products - Classification (of information) - Crops - Data mining - Image processing - Information retrieval - Maximum likelihood","Agricultural development - Band combinations - Maximum likelihood supervised classifications - Regional distribution - Remote sensing images - Sanqi - Spatial informations - Yunnan province","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 922.1 Probability Theory",,"Number: 20115303110002, Acronym: AAC&U, Sponsor: Association of American Colleges and Universities; Number: 41501436, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20115303110002, Acronym: AAC&U, Sponsor: Association of American Colleges and Universities; Number: 41501436, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Supported by the Special joint fund for doctoral disciplines in Colleges and Universities(No.20115303110002), the National Ntural Science Foundation’sYouthScienceFundProject(No.41501436).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

From the rock body→ contanct zone→ wall-rocks, mineralization zones can be divided into Mo→Cu→Au, and the mineralization temperature cooled down as high→high-medium→medium-low→low. By the way of the geological age's studies, we discovered that alkaline-rich porphyries formed at the same time and space as the mineralization. REE, trace elements show that the mineralizing fluid and the magmatic fluid came from enriched mantle. Analyzed with the trans-magmatic mineralization theory, we suggest that the mineralizing fluid is a kind of un-mixing mantle fluid which was contained in the alkaline-rich magma. During the Crystalline diagenetic process, the mantle fluid escaped from the magma varying degrees, and contaminated with the crustal fluid, forming a series mineralization. If the mantle fluid was trapped in the alkaline porphyries, the typical deposit of orthomagmatic metallogenic system, Machangqing porphyry Mo-deposit, formed. When mantle fulid entered into the contact zone between magma body and wall rock or strata next to the contact zone, the typical deposit of the contact-metasomatic metallogenic system, Machangqing porphyry Cu (Mo)-deposit formed. Some of the gold deposits in alkaline porphyries were controlled by the faults cutting through the rock body. In this process, the mantle fluid's properties changed from magma→supercritical fluid→liquid going with the changes of depth, environment and physical and chemical condition. Moving fluid carried activated and enriched ore-material at suitable places. It is the deep geologic process causes crust-mantle contamination and profits to form large and supper-large deposits.

This paper aims to reveal the emplacement age, petrogenetic type, nature of source rocks and tectonic environment. Zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating shows that the formation age of syenogranite is ∼218Ma. This indicates that syenogranite ' s formation age belongs to the Late Triassic. Geochemical characteristics indicate that syenogranite has characteristics of high silicon (SiO2 =70. 28% ∼74. 49%), rich alkali (K2O + Na2O =6. 81% ∼ 8. 71%) belonging to prealuminous (A/CNK = 1. 00 ∼ 1. 12) and high kalium calc alkaline. Trace elements show that rock mass is enriched in light rare earth elements (LREES), large ion lithophile elements (LILES) (K, Rb), and depleted of high field strength elements (HFSEs) (Nb, Ta, P, Ti, Ba, Sr and Eu). Most of the light rare earth element were powerfully differentiated (LREE/HREE =6. 07 ∼ 13. 8). Therefore, all the characteristics recognize that the rock mass belongs to S-type granite, and rocks in this source region mainly are clastic rock. The value of zircon Hf(t) is (-10. 74 ∼ -4. 14), The second stage Hf model age (tdm)range from 1. 5Ga to 1. 9Ga. These data indicate that Triassic syenogranites derived from the ancient crust melting. Rock has relatively low zirconium saturation temperature, average ∼ 655°C. It shows that no mantle-derived magma is added. The results indicate that Late Triassic syenogranites from Lianghe probably formed by the melting of ancient crustal materials in extensional setting of post-collision. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

The chronology, geochemistry and petrogenesis of three types of porphyry rocks were studied in Luchun-Jinping area, which provided new evidence for the correlation between crust-mantle action and Ailaoshan-Red River shear zone. The U-Pb ages of granite porphyries, quartz monazite porphyries and syenite porphyries are 34. 36 ± 0. 39Ma, 35. 48 ± 0. 39Ma and 35. 36 ± 0. 43Ma, respectively. The zircon sm(t) in the three samples are - 6 . 4 ~ + 2. 6, - 1. 5 ~ + 3 . 6, and - 3. 1 ~ + 1 . 0, respectively. The three types of rocks have similar characteristics of trace elements, rare earth elements and isotopic. They are enriched in large ionic lithophile elements, strong fractionation between heavy and light rare earth elements, depleted in high field strong elements (such as Nb, Ta and Ti), and weak negative Eu abnormal. The rocks have homogenous Sr isotopes (Sr/ Sr = 0. 7067 ~ 0. 7078) and Nd isotopes (sm (t) = - 3 . 8 ~ - 3 . 7) . Based on the comprehensive analysis of this study and the regional research results in the Ailaoshan-Red River shear, the origin of the Cenozoic alkali-rich porphyries was discussed. The granite porphyries and quartz monzonitic porphyries were from the partial melting of the thickened lower crust, but the syenite porphyries were generated from the enriched lithospheric mantle. The enrichment of source area may be caused by the subduction metasomatism of the Neoproterozoic and late Paleozoic oceans. In western Yunnan, the isotopic homogeneity, such as Sr and Nd isotopes of crust source and mantle source rocks, may be due to the subduction metasomatism of these two oceans. In Ailaoshan-Red River shear zone, the result of India-Eurasia continuous collision caused the lower crust thickening of lithospheric. In Sanjiang region, at about 35Ma, the delamination of the lithosphere mantle, caused the upwelling of the asthenosphere, and further initiated the partial melting of the lower crust and lithosphere mantle, which caused partial melting of the lower crust and lithospheric mantle, and the magma invaded along crustal fissures to form different types of alkali-rich porphyry. © 2019 Science Press.
