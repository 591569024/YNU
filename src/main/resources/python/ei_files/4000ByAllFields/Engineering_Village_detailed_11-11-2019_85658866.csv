The results from six batch biogas reactors, which were designed to ferment at 9, 15, 21, 35, 45 and 55 °C, showed that: 1) The components of the microbial communities and metabolic pathways were found to be very similar but the metabolic activities increased significantly when the temperature grew from 15 to 35 °C. 2) Hydrogenotrophic metabolism was almost exclusively observed when the temperature was lowered to 9 °C, whereas greater bacterial diversity involving hydrolisis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis was observed when the temperature was raised to 45 °C. Finally, these dominant bacteria involved in hydrolisis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis decreased in number when the temperature was raised to 55 °C and acetotrophic-type metabolism became the major metabolic pathway. That means the turning point for microbial community composition and metabolic pathway from mesophilic to thermophilic was at 45 °C and the metabolic pathway at 9 °C was somewhat different to those observed at 15–35 °C. © 2018","","61","Anaerobic digestion","Batch reactors - Biogas - Metabolism - Microorganisms - Physiology","Abiotic factors - High-throughput sequencing - Metabolic pathways - Psychrophilic - Thermophilic","461.9 Biology - 522 Gas Fuels - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment",,"Number: 20135303110001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51366015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; Number: 2015KF07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; Number: 2013DH041, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31160123 / C0309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FA030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","The authors would like to thank the following funding providers for their generous grant funding: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 31160123 / C0309 ); the Yunnan Provincial Sciences and Technology Platform Promotion Plan ( 2013DH041 ); the Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Universities ( 20135303110001 ); the Yunnan Province Key Fund of Applied Basic Research ( 2014FA030 ); and the Open Fund from Yunnan Provincial Renewable Energy Engineering Key Laboratory ( 2015KF07 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China ( NSFC, 51366015 ).

The turnover rates were the highest in the transition zones between different vegetation types, whereas species-area curves showed larger within-transect beta diversity at middle elevations. The effect of elevation on alpha diversity was due mainly to the differences in seasonal temperature and moisture, and these environmental factors mattered more than spatial distances to the turnover rates along the elevation gradient, although the impact of the environmental factors differed with the growth form (herb, shrubs or trees) of the species. The differences in the patterns of plant biodiversity between the two aspects helped to assess several hypotheses that seek to explain such patterns, to highlight the impacts of contemporary climate and historical and regional factors and to plan biological conservation and forest management in this region more scientifically. © 2016 by the authors.","","49","Plants (botany)","Biodiversity - Forestry - Landforms - Snow","Baima Snow Mountain - Comparative studies - Elevational gradients - Mountain aspect - Northwest Yunnan - Plant species diversity - Three Parallel River region","443.3 Precipitation - 454 Environmental Engineering - 481.1 Geology",,"Number: 41371190, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31321061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31170449, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371190, 31170449, 31321061).

By applying vitrinite reflectance measurement, inclusion thermometry, fission track dating and EASY% Ro numerical simulation, the Triassic coal thermal evolution history of the Chuxiong Basin was analyzed, and the results were concluded. The vitrinite reflectance of Chuxiong Basin is higher in the west and south in general. Vertically, in the east, west, and north of the basin, the vitrinite reflectance increases with increasing depth, and in the northern part, exceptionally high values occur, and there is no significant regularity in the east. The formation of inclusions inside quartz veins in Chuxiong Basin Triassic coal are unrelated with magmatic hydrothermal fluid, and there are multi-phase inclusions formed in three or four sections of tectonic movements. The main heating period (apparent age) of the Triassic coal is concentrated in the late Cenozoic, during which the coal was subjected to repeated thermal disturbance, resulting in a multimodal distribution of the fission track data, which reveals mild burial features of the early stages of the Late Cenozoic. The Triassic coal of Chuxiong Basin has experienced two major temperature increasing processes, which occurred in the early-mid Yanshan and the early Himalayan, respectively. The first hydrocarbon generation period of coal organic matter occurred in the formation stage of the foreland basin, during which the south and west of the basin generated large amounts of hydrocarbon, but little was preserved. The second generation stage in the Early Himalayan had conditions suitable for high gas accumulation, especially in the western and southern regions. The upper Triassic coal is of moderate burial depth and is less affected by the strike-slip effect. There are key areas of Chuxiong Basin oil and gas exploration, such as the Yanfeng Basin in the north-central, Yongren and Yunlong areas. © 2016","","38","Coal deposits","Coal - Economic geology - Fission reactions - Hydrocarbons - Petroleum prospecting - Reflection","Chuxiong Basin - Geological significance - Hydrocarbon generation - Multimodal distributions - Oil and gas exploration - Thermal evolution - Thermal evolution history - Triassic","481.1 Geology - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 524 Solid Fuels - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 932.2.1 Fission and Fusion Reactions",,"Number: BK20150179, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Number: 2015XKZD07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2015XKZD07 ) of China and the Foundation Research Project of Jiangsu province (Youth Fund Project) of China (No. BK20150179 ), and A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (PAPD).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is proved that for small fluctuations the relaxation time Tc as a function of λ (the correlated intensity between noises) exhibits very different behaviours for α D (α and D, respectively, stand for the intensities of additive and multiplicative noises). When α > D, Tc increases with increasing A.

The 3D computation reveals that some patterns of field distributions of light in the probe are formed due to the polarization of light and the structure of the probe. This calculation is very helpful for understanding the radiation mechanism of light in the near-field region and the behavior of light propagation in the probe.

Our results are as follows: (i) there is a positive correlation between radio luminosity Lr and αrx and a negative correlation between Lr and vp. High-energy peak BL Lacs (HBLs) and low-energy peak BL Lacs (LBLs) can be distinguished very well; the dividing lines are probably those of log Lr = 43.25 (erg/s) and αrx >(or &le)0.75 for log Lr-αrx plot and those of log Lr &le 43.25 (erg/s) and log vp > 14.7 for the log Lr-log vp plot; (ii) there is a weak positive correlation between optical luminosity Lo and αrx and a negative weak correlation between Lo and vp; (iii) there is no correlation between X-ray luminosity Lx and αrx or between Lx and vp.

The adsorption amount of Cd(II) on the treated activated charcoal increased remarkably. It was also found that the more powerful the acidity of the surface and the larger the adsorption amount of Cd(II), so the charged groups on the surface of activated charcoal are considered as the main adsorption-activated sites for inorganic ions.

Without a consensus on the appropriate amount of automation, the surgeon should decide how best to utilize the system. Hence, this paper reports the design and development of a robotic system, capable of varying levels of automation, from a fully autonomous plan execution to shared or manual control. In this work, we focus primarily on shared control to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of laser retinal surgery. By allocating most of the information processing to the robotic system, the surgeon collaborates closely with the robotic system during execution of the surgical plan, reducing the risk of damage to the fovea and ablation of healthy retinal tissue, and improving surgical outcome. In our solution, the joystick of the laser machine with which the clinician uses to align the laser to target a specific pathology is held onto by both the clinician as well as by the robot. The non-permanent robotic attachment tracks the operator's motion and provides haptic cues to guide the operator's positioning of the laser beam based on the input surgical plan. A prototype system with algorithms for haptic feedback is described and was implemented. Experiments were performed to determine the feasibility of this shared control robotic system for retinal surgery. © 2015 IEEE.","","12","Robotic surgery","Ablation - Automation - Haptic interfaces - Laser ablation - Laser beams - Laser surgery - Ophthalmology - Robot programming - Robotics - Surgery","Automation in medicine - Collaborative control - Haptics - Medical robotics - Retinal surgery","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 731.5 Robotics - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The new framework adopts a beam splitter incorporated with two original CASSI systems employing a set of novel complementary code patterns. Complementary CS measurements are acquired in this framework. Furthermore to enhance the intensity of captured light we propose a more effective alternative solution based on digital-micromirror-device (DMD).

The combination of the MJ and MD trajectories provides an effective kinematic scheme for robotic applications. An approach based on time spacing optimization is developed to find the global minimum-jerk as well as minimum-distance trajectory of a robot manipulator within joint space using cubic splines, despite the fact that the manipulator dynamics as well as the obstacle avoidance are not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework which guarantees the continuity of joint displacements, velocities and accelerations.

Fasudil (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1h before the operation. Results: Administration of fasudil markedly ameliorated tissue injury demonstrated as the decreasing levels of serum AST, ALT, CK-B, cytokines and MPO and SOD activity increased. The expressions of Rho-kinase in liver tissue markedly attenuated and the expression of eNOS in liver enhanced markedly compared with I/R group. Conclusions: Fasudil can alleviate liver and intestine injury induced by intestinal I/R, which may be attributed to the inhibition of neutrophil infiltration through inhibiting the activity of Rho-ROCK. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","4","Rats","Enzymes - Tissue","Intestinal ischemia - Intraperitoneally - Liver injuries - Neutrophil infiltration - Protective effects - Protective potentials - Rho-kinase inhibitors - Superior mesenteric arteries","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Part of the research efforts have focused on analyzing stock data, which is a major application of time series analysis. However stock data is always considered as a unidimensional sequence in recent research lacking of the whole market perspective. This paper regards the stock data as a multi-dimensional time series and proposes a novel method of stock trend analysis based on feature reduction method. By taking advantage of the partial least squares, we rank the dimensions of stock data firstly. Then a feature selection algorithm based on the dimension rank is developed referring to the wrapper algorithm. Finally the algorithm is utilized to analyze the stock trend in both single stock and the whole market perspectives on the real stock data. Experimental results show the potential of the feature reduction based trend analysis method of multi-dimensional series, which performs better to the unidimensional-based methods and obtains the global information from the whole market view. © 2015 IEEE.","","25","Time series analysis","Automation - Commerce - Data mining - Harmonic analysis - Learning systems - Least squares approximations","Feature reduction - Multi dimensions - Partial least square (PLS) - Trend analysis - Whole market view","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The execution time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of task types which is an improvement over the previous algorithm, whose execution time is polynomial in the number of tasks.

The cascaded resonators of the filter are formed by properly etching the slots on the top metal plane of a SIW cavity. The slots create the electric coupling. The magnetic coupling is formed by period metallic vias in the middle of a SIW cavity. Furthermore, the electric and magnetic couplings achieves two transmission zero points. The electric coupling have influence on the upper transmission zero point, and magnetic coupling have influence on the lower transmission zero point.

The gamma-ray spectra of some unidentified Galactic sources show that the corresponding counterparts are likely gamma-ray pulsars.

Combining the observed nonthermal X-ray emission detected by Chandra or XMM-Newton and the gamma-ray emission by EGRET, we study the high-energy radiation from these putative pulsars based on the revised vacuum outer gap model.Results. By comparing the estimated spectra with the observations, we estimated the spin parameters and the inclination angles for these five putative pulsars.
