In this paper, we introduce three basic quantization methods commonly used in JPEG or JPEG-2000 standard, USQ(uniform scalar quantization) USDZQ(uniform scalar dead-zone quantization) and UTCQ(universal trellis coded quantization) which is recently regarded as a competitive quantization strategy. We apply these three types of quantizers to the DWT transformed coefficients of images. The performance comparisons show that the UTCQ can quantize data more precisely than the two other quantizers with the same step size. But when they are combined with the zero or high order entropy coders, the USDZQ is the best instead. In these comparisons, we show that if the dead-zone is designed carefully, the USDZQ can effectively reduce the output bits of the entropy coder, although it reduces quantization precision by discarding some data around zero. These results show that the threshold we choose for the USDZQ is reasonable, it is suitable for transform based image compression system.","9","Image coding","Algorithms - Image compression - Mathematical models - Spurious signal noise - Wave filters - Wavelet transforms","Entropy coders - Uniform scalar dead-zone quantization (USDZQ) - Uniform scalar quantization (USQ) - Universal trellis coded quantization (UTCQ)","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.2 Electric Filters - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Two primary problems are faced in existing channel assignment algorithms. One is that it is impossible to achieve global optimization because both the time and space complexity are high. The other problem is that those algorithms can not be scaled flexibly and, thus, cannot be applied to large networks. To solve the above problems, this paper models the channel assignment problem with particle swarm optimization model by utilizing its advantages of fast convergence and low cost. Based on the network message exchange and interference model, a particle swarm optimization based channel assignment algorithm (PSOCA) is proposed. This algorithm aims at minimizing the fitness function with constraints of radios, channels, interference and so on. Through intensive simulations, the algorithm proposed is proved feasible, both the network throughput and packet drop ratio are remarkably improved in comparison with other similar algorithms. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

This prototype was designed in galvanized sheet with an opening diameter of 120 cm. The experiment was carried out on the roof of the building of the solar energy laboratory of FHB University. Tests of boiling eggs were carried out. During operation, two configurations of the conical cooker were adopted. In the first configuration, the cooker was used without modification. On the other hand, in the second configuration, a removable glass plate is placed in the cone and at a distance of 25 cm from the base. This contribution has the role of creating a greenhouse effect between the absorber and the glass. During the tests, the temperature of cooking, the ambient temperature as well as the solar illumination were measured. The tests were conducted in accordance with the maximum cooking time of some foods given by »Solar cookers international». Despite the observed cloudy periods, maximum temperatures obtained by the eggs were 82°C in 2 hours cooking for the first configuration and 100°C in cooking 1h10 for the second configuration.

However, a restriction is that the distance from the testing position to the magnet's position must be much farther than the size of the magnet. The magnetic dipole model is not suitable for the near-filed around the magnet. Here, we propose a modified method for the correction of the near-field by introducing some coefficients to correct the magnetic dipole model. We divide the magnet's field into several regions according to the distance respect to the magnet size. We carried out experiments to measure the magnet's field, and then searched the suitable coefficients for each region to minimize the errors which between the measurements of magnetic strength and the presumed model values. In this paper, we investigated the magnetic field distribution for three types of magnets, Hollow Cylindrical Magnet Magnetized in Axially, Filled Cylindrical Magnet Magnetized in Axially and Hollow Cylindrical Magnet Magnetized in Radial. We use the modified magnetic dipole model to calculate the magnetic strength distribution for these magnets.

The scaling gains of the inputs and output of the proposed fuzzy controller are parameters that can be tuned conveniently. So, in this paper, an adaptive FLC with the tuning of scaling gains by fuzzy logic is proposed. The advantage of this method is that the universe of discourse of the fuzzy sets can be tuned by adjusting the scaling gains according to the speed error. This significantly improves the dynamic response and steady state performance of the system under the control of the proposed adaptive FLC. In this paper, the principles of tuning scaling gains of the inputs and output are described.

The study of the petrography and geochemical features of the Beiya monzogranite porphyry presented in this paper shows that the Beiya monzogranite porphyry is characterized by amphibole phenocrysts, with high Sr (> 300 X 10-6), low Y (-6) and high (La/Yb)N(6. 19 ∼ 26.8) values, which indicates that amphibole crystalizes in early magmatic differentiation. The presence of amphibole during the early stages of crystallization indicates that the Beiya ore-related magma were very hydrous melts. At the same time, the contents of amphibole suggest that the water contents of the Beiya melts are varying between 3. 8% and 4. 1%, which further confirmed Beiya ore-related magma is relatively water-rich. During the process of partial melting in the source of the Beiya gold deposit, the addition of H2O can reduce the melting point of magma, promote remelting of the source containing copper, gold sulfide, or extraction of copper, gold ore-forming elements from rock, or gather the scattered distribution of metal elements in magma, forming metal-rich magma. After the emplacement of the Beiya ore-related magma, through the pressure decrease to reduce the water solubility, or by magma crystallization increasing the water contents of the Beiya melts, prompted the magmatic water earlier reached saturation and dissolved fluid. Then providing main ore-forming fluids and metal source for the porphyry mineralization and generating (or improving) the metallogenic potential of the Beiya water-rich magma. In general, the water-rich magma in the Beiya gold deposit not only plays an important role during the process of ore-fluid formation, but also the components of Cu, Au and other metal of the ore-forming fluid.","84","Gold deposits","Copper compounds - Deposits - Geochemistry - Gold compounds - Metals - Mineralogy - Ore treatment - Ores - Petrography - Sulfur compounds","Constraints on mineralization - Distribution of metal - Geochemical features - Magma crystallization - Metallogenic belt - Ore-forming fluid - Water solubilities - Western yunnan","481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 533.1 Ore Treatment",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The innovation of software technology, the increase of software scale and the shortened developing period make the traditional manual testing meeting enormous challenges, while the development of automated testing technology has promoted the progress of the software testing industry. Because of the particularity of financial and banking services, the bank is under an obligation to ensure the quality and reliability of software. Therefore it's vital to test the software. In specific practice, although the powerful third-party testing tools can be used as a solution, it is hard to rely on certain tool to implement automated testing, hence a framework of automated test is required to be introduced for testing, which intends to handle high efficiency and high-quality testing for software automation. This paper proposes a kind of software automation testing framework based on QTP, mainly targeting on the core of the bank, credit, online banking to test the function of the three major operations. The framework is a secondary development based on QTP and mainly for regression testing of software, which integrates techniques including object recognition, data-driven, and keyword-driven technology, checkpoint technology, to proceed business-level testing. The paper expatiated on four issues, which were the test system design, the test standardization, the testing framework design and the testing of the implementation. The practical application shows that the framework can improve the operational efficiency, reduce the test cost, and guarantee the smooth progress of the software automation testing. © 2016 IEEE.","17","Software testing","Application programs - Automation - Computer networks - Efficiency - Finance - Object recognition - Software reliability - Testing","Automated testing tools - Business automation - Design and implementations - Operational efficiencies - Secondary development - Software automation - Software technology - Test automation frameworks","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 913.1 Production Engineering",,"Number: 61461054, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61461054.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The influences of the parameters, such as the cable sectional area, the pretension, the span, the space between the horizontal cable and the vertical cable, the space between the glass and the vertical cable, the bond length, the glass length and so on, on the overturning resistance were studied. The results show that the effect of the sectional area of the vertical cable on the overturning resistance of the connectors is greater than that of the sectional area of the horizontal cable. The effect of the pretension of the vertical cable is greater than that of the horizontal cable. The span of the vertical cable exhibits greater impact than that of the horizontal cable. The effect of the bond length of the vertical cable is greater than that of the horizontal cable. There is a power function relationship between the overturning angle and the sectional area of the vertical cable. When the span of the cable net is 12.6 m and the glass is square, an exponential relationship exists between the overturning angle and the glass length. The overturning angle of the connectors at the mid-span of the lowest row is the maximum. The overturning resistance of the connectors in the cable glass curtain wall can be improved by increasing the section area of the vertical cable, the pretension of the vertical cable as well as the bond length of the vertical cable and decreasing the span of the vertical cable and the glass length. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

The rupture dimensions are about 2-4 km for the five sequences. The hypoDD relocation errors are only 0.36 or 0.63 km for the two test clusters, which are much smaller than the dimensions of the rupture areas.

The similarities in the distributions of brGDGTs between surface sediments and catchment soils indicate that soil is the dominant source of brGDGTs. This contrasts with the recent emphasis on lacustrine GDGTs in other regional studies. Holocene temperature evolution is characterized by an early cool phase (with a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of 12.5 °C) prior to 7.6 cal kyr BP, followed by a rapid warming towards the local thermal maximum (MAAT = 13.8 °C) from 7.6 to 5.5 cal kyr BP and a subsequent long-term cooling that ended at 1.5 cal kyr BP. Temperature changes after 1.5 cal kyr BP show high variability and low correspondence to global climate events such as the Medieval Warm Period. Overall Holocene temperature variation has been primarily controlled by boreal summer insolation changes. The larger amplitude (1.5–4.0 °C) in annual cooling during the early Holocene in MAAT contrasts with summer temperature records from this region (range of cooling 0.3–1.0 °C) and indicates the likely influence of lower winter temperature on MAAT variation. We suggest that substantial remnants of the Northern Hemisphere ice-sheets during the early Holocene enhanced the winter westerlies and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), and decreased the winter temperature in southwestern China, leading to a cold early Holocene climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","79","Glycerol","Atmospheric temperature - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Catchments - Lakes - Sediments","branched GDGTs - Holocenes - Indian summer monsoon - Paleotemperature reconstruction - Yunnan province","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: 41572337, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: UCAS, Sponsor: University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","We would like to thank Dr. Rong Chen, Dr. Ming Ji and Dr. Hongqu Tang for field assistance.

After that, LBP histograms of image blocks in a FKP ROI image are connected together to build the feature vector of the FKP ROI image.

Significant velocity variations spatially and with depth are observed. High-velocity regions are found beneath the Himalayas and most parts of southern Tibet. These high-velocity regions can be interpreted as subducting Indian continental mantle lithosphere, accreted terranes and a cold, non-convective mantle wedge beneath central Plateau. They are disjointed suggesting that the subducting Indian lithosphere is fragmented laterally. In the western Tibetan Plateau, the high-velocity region extends northwards to the middle of Qiangtang Terrane. In the central Plateau, the highvelocity region reaches near the Bangong-Nujiang suture. The northern extent of the subducted Indian continent cannot be determined uniquely from Pn models because the Indian plate dips moderately beneath southeastern Tibet. Around the Plateau, Tarim, Qaidam, Gonghe and Sichuan basins are floored by high-velocity Asian continental blocks that keep the elevation of these basins lower than surrounding regions. We found no evidence of an ongoing southward subduction of Asian lithosphere beneath central to northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two major Pn low-velocity anomalies are found beneath northern and northeastern Tibet, primarily within the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi Terranes. The northern Tibet low-velocity mantle is situated in a continental backarc of the India-Asia continental subduction zone, and hence we interpreted this region as thin thermal lithosphere with upwelling mantle driving by the subducting Indian lithosphere. The Qilianshan is also underlain by a low-velocity mantle structure and could be related to the same upwelling in this continental backarc. A narrow N-S trending low-velocity anomaly is found beneath the Yadong-Gulu Rift and confirmed that the Lhasa Terrane is not limited to the crust, but involves the entire lithosphere. Another pronounced low Pn velocity region is observed in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, southern Yunnan and northeastern Myanmar. This feature is probably related to backarc convection associated with the subduction and rollback of Indian oceanic slab beneath Myanmar and Yunnan province, China.International Seismological Centre, On-line Bulletin, http://www.isc.ac.uk, Internatl.

Based on the complex permittivity and permeability results, the Reflection loss (RL) of the Fe3O4/Fe/C composites were calculated. The Fe3O4/Fe/C composites show a RL peak of −51.3 dB for a 2 mm thick positioned at 17.2 GHz frequency. When the absorber thickness was adjusted to 2.3 mm, the effective adsorption bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) is 5.6 GHz (12.4–18 GHz) frequency. Simultaneously, the RL peak of the absorber still reaches −40.8 dB at 14.7 GHz frequency. The RL peak is explained using the quarter-wave cancellation model. The microwave absorption behavior of Fe3O4/Fe/C composites can be attributed to the reasonable impedance matching and the existence of interfaces around the composites.

The fluorescence quenching approach was applied to the sensing of mercury ions in water. Rodamine B absorb on the surface of RhB-GQDs, and it can prevent RhB-GQDs from contacting with interfering cations. The presence of N atoms reduces the ability of interfering cations to form stable complex with carboxyl groups, and gives the RhB-GQDs good selectivity to mercury ions.

To understand the seismicity in this region, a new seismic experiment is carried out based on the tomographic inversion of P- and S-wave arrival times from the regional earthquakes recorded by 49 seismic stations in Yunnan Province of Southwest China. In this study, we reduce the extreme disproportionality of the data distribution using an events combination method, and we use arrival times to construct the reference velocity model. Checkerboard tests and odd/even data tests are carried out to assess the reliability of the inversion results. The reliable P-wave velocity model reveals two low-velocity anomaly zones (LVAZs) bounded by major strike-slip faults. Almost all the large earthquakes in this region occurred in the two LVAZs and the trend of the two LVAZs is consistent with a global positioning system velocity field based on the Eurasia-fixed reference frame. We propose that the two LVAZs are material migration passageways in the SETP. In the vertical direction, the mechanically weak crustal materials are sliding southward with the rigid block, while the underlying mantle materials continue to be compressed by the collision. This vertical model is broadly consistent with the seismic anisotropy in the crust and lithospheric mantle from shear-wave splitting. The new regional geodynamic model gives a reasonable interpretation of the seismicity of the SETP, and we suggest that the material migration in the passageway zones plays an important role in the tectonic evolution of the SETP. © The Author(s) 2018.","73","Earthquakes","Geodynamics - Seismic prospecting - Seismic waves - Shear flow - Shear waves - Strike-slip faults - Velocity - Wave propagation","Asia - Body waves - Dynamics: seismotectonics - Seismic tomography - Seismicity and tectonics","481.3 Geophysics - 484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: 2014CFA110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; Number: 41474093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41704046, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank the Earthquake Administration of Yunnan Province for providing the seismic waveform data.

To address the problems, the low-altitude remote sensing image registration algorithm based on dual-feature for arable land in hills and mountains was proposed. Due to the complex environment and the influence of light factors in hills and mountains, the feature points of remote sensing images are extracted by using the scale-invariant SURF algorithm. And then the dual-feature descriptor using geometrical structure of aerial images was constructed. On this basis, by taking Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the core and combining with two single feature difference descriptors (i.e., global distance descriptor based on euclidean distance and local structure descriptor based on sum vectors), the dual-feature finite mixture model (DFMM) was obtained, which can simultaneously evaluate the correspondence between two features. With the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the spatial transformation of the global and local structure of the registration image was carried out based on the Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF). In order to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments were carried out by using UAV images with different viewpoints taken from sloping arable land in hills and mountains. Experimental results show that comparing with SIFT, SURF, CPD, AGMReg, GLMDTPS and PRGLS, our method provides better performances in most cases, and can apply to multi-view remote sensing image registration of other complex terrain by small UAV. © 2018, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

The nodal neighboring region is adopted in the proposed algorithm. Numerical example shows that good result can be gotten through less optimization iteration. The approach can solve complex structures easily, in which holes cannot be properly layed out in advance. The proposed method considerably improves the ability of LSM to find the optimal topology.

Based on this viewpoint, collecting process strategies from different software engineering processes and using aspect-oriented modeling, an approach to modeling NFRs-oriented software processes is proposed. The purpose of the approach is to ensure the development or evolution of high quality software through the whole life cycle of the software. First, a knowledge base of process strategies is created to store the activities for ensuring the software qualities. Based on these strategies and using aspect-oriented approach, corresponding aspects are defined to be composed into the base software process models. The need for these aspects is based primarily on the factor that the activities for NFRs and the base process models can be created separately and easily to be composed later. Besides, the conflicts between multi-aspects and between aspects and base models are detected and controlled. Second, a modeling aided tool NPAT (non-functional requirements-oriented processes aided tool) is developed to support the modeling of NFR-oriented software processes. Finally, the theory, the approach and the tool were used in a case study. Through the case study, the theory and the approach are proved to be feasible and the tool is proved to be effective. The NFRs-oriented software process modeling approach can help an organization provide a focus for enhancing software qualities by adding the NFR activities to the software processes. © 2016, Science Press.

The algorithms proposed can implement the normal communication between the ASFA and the SSFA. And mobile users can obtain the anticipant service flow. Therefore, the network exit and the states mismatch can be avoided. The proposed scheme can be implemented through minimally modifying the existing Mobile-WiMAX specification. Furthermore, after the relocation of SSFA follows the change of the anchor point in the CSN mobility management, the ASFA is not conscious of the location movement of the SSFA. In this paper, the context transfer is applied for notifying the current location of the SSFA to the ASFA. © 2009 IEEE.","9","Network architecture","Mobile computing - Relocation - Wimax","Anchor point - Context transfer - Essential elements - Management IS - Mobile users - Mobile WiMAX - Mobility management - Service flows","619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 717 Optical Communication - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems - 718 Telephone Systems and Related Technologies; Line Communications - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Gas-sensing performance of the sensors is investigated by testing their gas response to acetone, which exhibits favorable selectivity, good gas response value, fast response/recovery time, low detection concentration and good long-term stability to acetone. Gas response β was defined as the ratio of Ra/Rg, where Ra and Rg are the resistance values of gas sensor exposed in air and objective gas, respectively. Among all these as-prepared gas sensors, the 0.5% Pt-functionalized TiO2 based gas sensor shows the highest gas response value of 29.51–200 ppm acetone at 300 °C, and the gas response value is 5.2 times higher than that (5.67) of pure TiO2 based gas sensor. It also has excellent selectivity to acetone when comparing with toluene, n-butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. The large specific surface area (168.101 m2 g−1) provides enough contacting interface between gas and the as-prepared materials, then the gas molecules could be broken into CO2 and H2O by the active adsorbed oxygen species.

MPSMDA uses experimentally validated data to build a miRNA-disease heterogeneous information network (MDHIN). Thus, miRNA-disease association prediction is transformed into a link prediction problem on a MDHIN. Meta-path based similarity is used to measure the miRNA-disease associations. Since different meta-paths between a miRNA and a disease express different latent semantic association, MPSMDA make full use of all possible meta-paths to predict the associations of miRNAs with diseases. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets for performance comparison with existing approaches. Two case studies on lung neoplasms and breast neoplasms are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of MPSMDA. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","27","RNA","Database systems - Diseases - Forecasting - Information services - Semantics - Tumors","Breast neoplasm - Disease associations - Heterogeneous information - Latent semantics - Link prediction - Meta-paths - MiRNA - Performance comparison","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 723.3 Database Systems - 903.4 Information Services",,"Number: 2016FB110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017YDJQ06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61562091, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1802271, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the following foundations: National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1802271, 61562091), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FB110), Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University (WX173602), and Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan University (2017YDJQ06).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Combine these two models by using the weight function may create more advantages in remove the noise, enhence the boundary, protect the smooth region and fine texture.

The accuracy and efficiency of the sensor is demonstrated by experimental results. The sensor is based on continuous microwaves and digital signal processing technique. A tobacco box usually contains 50 bars of cigarette and a bar contains 10 packs of cigarette. Sometimes a shortage of bars would happen in a tobacco box, though manufacture of cigarette is highly roboticized. It can be detected accurately by the sensor when a shortage of bars happens in a tobacco box. Comparing with the method of nuclear weighing meter, the microwave-based sensor has the advantages of high accuracy, low-power, no radiation, and more convenience. The microwave-based sensor can also measure the mass of components in some substances. © 2005 IEEE.","5","Microwave devices","Digital signal processing - Packaging - Sensors - Tobacco","Cigarette bars - Microwave based sensors - Nuclear weighing meters - Tobacco boxes","821.4 Agricultural Products - 821.0 Woodlands and Forestry - 811.1.2.2 Machinery Equipment and Maintenance - 811.0.3 Economics, Research and Miscellaneous - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 714 Electronic Components and Tubes - 694.1.1 Packaging, Wrapping and Materials Handling (Using paper products) - 694.1 Packaging, General","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
