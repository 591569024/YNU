Ottelia acuminata community used to be a dominant community type in Yunnan's plateau lakes, but it is only found in a limited number of lakes nowadays with its observable changing characteristics. In the present study, species composition and distribution patterns of the community in Lake Jianhu were studied, with plot method and dispersal coefficient method in order to understand the development trend of the population, the relationship between its distribution pattern and environmental factors, and to provide some scientific basis for the protection of Ottelia acuminata and plateau lakes. The results showed that the community was composed of 18 species belonging to 12 families and 14 genera, with submerged type, free-floating type, floating-leaved type and hygrophyte as four major life forms. The distribution pattern of Ottelia acuminata and Potamogeton malaianus was clumpy, while other species were randomly distributed. The aggregation intensity of Ottelia acuminata was the highest among all species, which was close to the maximum clump distribution. Ex-situ conservation, basin maintenance and habitat management are some promising approaches to effectively slow down lake swamping process and conserve Ottelia acuminata community. © 2017 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","","30","Population distribution","Conservation - Lakes - Nonlinear analysis","Coefficient methods - Distribution patterns - Environmental factors - Ottelia acuminata community - Population distribution patterns - Potamogeton malaianus - Randomly distributed - Species composition","405.3 Surveying",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, China has a long history of deforestation, agriculture, mineral resource extraction, and other anthropogenic activities that impact the environment. Here, we present a sediment record from Xing Yun Lake in the Yunnan Province of China that reveals significant alterations to the lake, its ecosystem, and its watershed beginning as early as 500 AD. A comprehensive suite of biogeochemical and isotopic proxies reveal several rapid transitions related to changes in agriculture and lake-level management that coincides with cultural and dynastic transitions. The deterioration of contemporary environmental conditions at Xing Yun arises from a long history of anthropogenic manipulation, eutrophication, and pollution of the lake and its watershed.

The Strahler hypsometric values of the whole area (catchment), elevation zones' terrains and their depressions are measured. Supported by Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies, these Strahler hypsometric measurements are designed based on the development mechanism of karst landform, which includes height-reduction horizontal erosions and depth-increase vertical erosions. The results indicate that landscapes with different development features on various topographic surfaces have different Strahler values. The differences and patterns could be used as an indicator to reflect the evolution of landscapes. Shilin county's geomorphic structure has four levels of terrains with different altitudes at the late period of mature stage. Such a structure is formed from the decomposition of the monadnock karst planation plateau with an interplay of the faults and the erosion base of Bajiang river. Shilin county has a rejuvenating geomorphic structure, which is heterogeneous from other geomorphic structures of the same stage. The terrain above 2100 metres of altitude is the structural erosion karst plateau middle mountain evolved from the monadnock karst planation plateau with less depressions. The terrain with an altitude of 1900-2100 metres shifts from the monadnock karst planation into the monadnock karst plateau depressions and cone karst depressions with less underground rivers. The elevation zone with an altitude of 1700-1900 metres is a karst hill slope. The zone is composed of the vertical layer structure of the Stone Forest and the horizontal terrace geomorphic structure. The vertical layer structure of the Stone Forest comprises stone forest remains, pinnacle-shaped stone forest, buried stone forest, and baked stone forest. The horizontal terrace geomorphic structure contains karst hills, stone forest, karst depressions, underground rivers, karst springs, and Bajiang river-basin. The landform is shaped from the mixed functions of vertical and horizontal karst processes, with water resources produced and water-soil eroded off. This is the theoretical foundation for the comprehensive protection and utilization of the Stone Forest reserve. © 2018, Science Press.

Water retention in the soil zone and shallow fractured rock zone (subcutaneous) is a key factor for plant growth. Distinction of water sources taken by karst plants is a challenging task for botanists and hydrologists but is needed for ecosystem management. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to investigate water sources for Cyclobalanopsis glaucoides primary forests at Shilin Geopark in Bajiang vally, central Yunnan of China. Proportions of water sources for plant uptake were determined by the δD and δ18O values of plant stem water, and water taken from soil layers and the subcutaneous zone. The analysis reveals that water was mainly taken from the soil layers and to less degree the subcutaneous zone as well. In dry seasons with scarce precipitation, plants in the primary forest were prone to take more water from subcutaneous zone and deeper layer of soil. Different species had different water use strategies, Cyclobalanopsis glaucoides took a larger proportional water from the deeper layer of soil, suggesting its deeper roots and wider range of shallower roots. However, Olea yunnanensis and Pistacia weinmannifolia extracted more percentage of water from the deeper soil water and subcutaneous water because of its deeper roots. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","","11","Forestry","Ecosystems - Isotopes - Landforms - Soil moisture","Ecosystem management - Infiltration capacity - Primary forest - Stable isotopes - Stable-isotope analysis - Water retention - Water uptake - Water use strategies","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.0 Woodlands and Forestry",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Finally, the heavy metal contents were analyzed for contrast. The results show that the metal contents in the water and dust samples are higher than reference values. The contents of Zn, As, Cu and Pb in the tailings samples are rich and the average values are 2225, 1855, 870.50 and 417 mg/kg, respectively. The metal contents in soils surrounding the tailings exceed the background levels and are similar to the tailings pollution status. The results of single factor pollution index method shows that the pollution degree of water is in the decreasing order of Zn, Pb, As, Hg, Cu, As, Cd, Cu, and the pollution degrees of dust and soil samples in the decreasing orders of Zn, Pb, Hg, Cr and Zn, As, Pb, Cu, Cr, Sn, Cd, Hg, respectively. The Nemerow integrated index results suggest that the pollution degrees of concentrate filtration and fine ore bin are the highest. The Nemerow integrated index of soil samples is 21.73, which is significantly higher than the standard value of surface water class IV. The comparative analysis shows that the tin mineral processing plant becomes a combined polluted area by various metals, and the amount of heavy metals is in the decreasing order of Zn, As, Cu, Pb, Sn, Cr, Cd and Hg, and the ratio of heavy metals from tailings is 79.17%, which accounts for the most.","","19","Air pollution","Dust - Heavy metals - Minerals - River pollution - Soil pollution - Soil surveys - Soils - Surface waters - Tin - Tin mines","Background level - Comparative analysis - Heavy metal contents - Heavy metal pollution - Mineral processing - Pollution degree - Pollution index - Reference values","444.1 Surface Water - 451 Air Pollution - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 453 Water Pollution - 482.2 Minerals - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 546.2 Tin and Alloys",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Methods: The mutations located in exons 2-12 and in parts of introns of G6PD gene were analyzed by amplification refractory mutation system(ARMS), natural and mis-match primer PCR/restrict enzyme, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCR-SSCP) analysis and automatic DNA sequencing. Results: Among these 23 samples, 5 different point mutations in G6PD gene were identified, and they constituted 5 genotypes. There were 7 Han and 3 Dai patients with G487A mutation, 7 cases with both intron 11 T93C and C1311T mutations, 4 cases with intron 5 636 or 637 T&rarrdel mutation, 1 case with G871A mutation, and 1 case with G487A/ T93C/C1311T mutation. Two haplotypes, 93C/1311T and 93C/1311T/487A were identified in Yunnan. A strong association was observed between C1311T and the Nla III restriction site produced by intron 11 T93C. The findings of the investigators on IVS-5 636 or 637T&rarrdel in Chinese, on G871A in mainland of China, and on G487A in the Han people of Yunnan have not been reported previously. Conclusion: G6PD deficiency is very heterogenous in Yunnan; G487A is one of the common mutations in that province and may be of different origins.

The southwestern province of Yunnan is among the provinces piloting the current iteration of power market reforms. As such, lessons from Yunnan will inform future market reform and renewable energy policies in China and potentially elsewhere. The dominance of hydropower in Yunnan's energy portfolio and the particular transmission constraints it faces, offer an interesting case study of the challenges of decarbonization. We report on market architecture reforms and aggregate market data collected from the Yunnan Power Exchange. We review four elements in the reformed market architecture. Market pricing rules, transitional quantity controls, the generation rights market, and inter-provincial trade. The specifics of market reform reflect a compromise between decarbonization, inter-provincial competition, grid security and development objectives and contribute to understanding of how the dual transitions of hydropower decarbonization and market liberalization interact. We conclude on six insights regarding the role of the grid operator, security checks on trade, integration of cascade hydropower, the inclusion of renewables in the generation rights market, price controls, and market participant price uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","","72","Commerce","Architecture - Costs - Decarbonization - Electric industry - Financial markets - Hydroelectric power - Power markets","China's electricities - Hydropower - Market architectures - Market liberalization - Power industry - Renewable energies - Renewable energy policy - Transmission constraint","402 Buildings and Towers - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics",,"Number: 51210014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support (No. 91547201 and No. 51210014 ).

The landscape index was calculated and the correlation analysis was conducted to examine the influences of different land use types on forest fires, as well as the influence strength of the increasing fire burned area. This study aimed to lay a theoretical foundation for future in-depth study on the impact of forest landscape on forest fires. Method: Forest fires were classified based on the Forest Protection Regulations combined with the actual situation in the study area in Yunnan Province. The remote sensing images were pretreated and reclassified, and the land use classification diagram of Yunnan Province was granted. The ArcGIS grid method was used to grid and seven kinds of landscape indexes were chosen[number of plaques (NP), mean patch size (MPS), patch density (PD), contagion index (CONTAG), patch richness (PR), patch richness density (PRD), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and calculated. The correlation analysis and the Bootstrap method were applied to study the relationship between forest fires and the landscape index, furthermore to investigate the influence of landscape pattern on forest fires. Result: A total of 1457 fires occurred during 2005 to 2008 in Yunnan Province, and among which the 98 were major fires. Within the grid with the side length of 10 km, the chance of high-grade forest fire occurrence was increased with the increase of the average plaque area of coniferous forest, broadleaf forest, grass and shrubs, but it decreased with the increase of mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest, river and wetland. In more than 100 hectares of forest fires, the correlation coefficient of contagion, Shannon diversity index, landscape shape index, patch density, the number of plaques and forest fire area were -0.022, 0.300, 0.253, -0.333, -0.360 and -0.302, respectively. All correlations except for that with landscape shape index were significant. In 0-1 hm2of forest fires, the correlation between the contagion index and the forest fire area was believable at the 0.01 level. For forest fires with burned area of 50-100 hm2, Bootstrap significance of CONTAG and SHDI was credible at 0.01 and 0.05 levels. When forest fire area was more than 100 hm2, burned area was negatively correlated with SHDI with the negative correlation coefficient of -0.333, and the correlation was significant at the 0.01 level. Conclusion: The increase of the average patch area of coniferous forest, broadleaf forest, grassland and shrub promoted the spread of forest fires, while the increase of the average patch area of the mixed broadleaved-conifer forest and wetland inhibited the spread of forest fires. Through the Bootstrap test of significance, the influences of Shannon diversity index, landscape abundance and spread index on burned area dropped in the range of 0-1 hm2fire burned area. However, in the range of 50-100 hm2fire burned area, the influences of spread index, Shannon diversity index and plaque quantity on burned area decreased. The correlations of forest fire and Shannon diversity index, the patch number and the patch density were changed to more negative with the increase of fire rating, and the inhibiting effect on forest fire gradually increased. On the contrary, the correlation of forest fire and spread index was changed to more positive with the increase of fire rating, and the promoting effect gradually increased. The impacts of landscape indices on fire burned area were obvious for major forest fires. © 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

Also, several structural parameters were obtained by further calculation based on FTIR data and curve-resolved bands. From the functional group analysis, it can be seen that most of the oxygen in lignite exist in the forms of phenolic hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl and methoxyl, which have impact on its pyrolysis characteristics.

We calculate effective discharge, defined as the discharge that transports the most sediment, for 44 stations for which there is at least one complete year of daily suspended sediment concentration and mean daily discharge data, and find that the effective discharge is approximately the mean monsoon discharge for all stations. The correspondence of the effective discharges with the mean annual flow and monsoon discharge for all stations demonstrates that monsoon flow dominates suspended sediment transport in the region, rather than storm flow during discrete, short-duration storm events. In this region, the monsoon lasts for 4 months (June-September) and during that time transports 86% of the suspended sediment load. In contrast to the general observation from temperate environments that infrequent, stochastic storm events dominate sediment transport (with 90% of the suspended sediment transport occurring in 10% of the time), our findings show that the mean monsoon discharge dominates sediment transport in the rivers draining the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. © 2010 Geological Society of America.","","36","Suspended sediments","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Sediment transport - Sedimentation - Stochastic systems - Storms","Annual flow - Daily discharge - Effective discharge - Short durations - Storm events - Suspended sediment concentrations - Suspended sediment loads - Tibetan Plateau","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 961 Systems Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, the modes of occurrence of Fe were investigated on a very special kaolin from Yunnan China, which contains kaolinite and halloysite at the same time. Attempts were made to study the Fe species by correlating the XRD, microscopic investigations and XPS spectral information of the clay samples. Mineralogical characterization revealed that halloysite or kaolinite as the main mineral phases associated to illite, quartz and gibbsite as ancillary mineral in the Yunnan kaolin samples. Apart from the main mineral phases, goethite, magnetite and hematite are the three major iron impurities in this kaolin. Microscopic investigations (SEM/EDX and TEM/EDS) confirmed the both existence of pseudo-hexagonal kaolinite and tubular halloysite. The relationship between the mineral and iron impurities was also pointed out under microscope, the results showed that the iron impurity materials exist as free iron forms, and they tend to be present alone or adsorbed on the surface of kaolinite instead of halloysite. XPS characterization gives the specific content of the iron impurity, and the relative ratios of goethite, magnetite and hematite are 55.7%, 32.9% and 11.4%, respectively.

Mineral physics experiments reveal that phase changes from olivine to β phase and γ-spinel to perovskite+magnesiowustite, at pressures equivalent to the existing at those mantle discontinuities, largely explain the variations in seismic velocity observed by the seismologists. The globally observed seismic velocity discontinuity at 660 km depth marks the bottom of the MTZ, which is the natural boundary between the upper and lower mantle. This discontinuity is considered an important mantle boundary, since it is especially associated with the mantle dynamics, the source of mantle plumes and the sinking of the subducted plates. On the other hand, temperature variations are the cause of thickening and thinning of the MTZ in correspondence with the positive and negative slopes of the Clapeyron curve at the 410 and 660 km mantle discontinuities, respectively. Receiver function analysis is a straightforward and commonly accepted method of studying the crust and upper-mantle structure through the use of teleseismic waveforms recorded at three-component seismic stations. This method requires the rotation of the ZNE displacement components to the radial and transversal components in the horizontal plane; and later the transformation of the radial and vertical components, which lie in the same vertical plane, into the L and Q components of the ground motion. By deconvolving the L component from the Q-component, both the source, far field path and instrument effects are removed. The resulting receiver function waveform is the ground's impulse response. The analysis of each receiver function recorded at an array station provides, after moveout correction, a detailed estimation of the depth of the interface where the P-to-S seismic phase conversion is produced. However, the converted Ps phases at the discontinuities of 410 and 660 km depth are so weak that stacking of a large amount of waveforms is needed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver functions. In this study, we obtained 8600 teleseismic P-wave receiver functions recorded at 48 permanent broadband stations deployed in Yunnan and surroundings, which later were properly stacked in a single trace in 1°×1°-sized grid cells. Before stacking, the receiver functions were migrated from time domain to depth domain with the help of a reference earth model. Finally, we obtained 6 stacking images of receiver functions at latitude of 28°, 27°, 26°, 25°, 24° and 23°N, being the stacking depth in the 0-800 km range. The results indicate: (1) further north of 26°N, the average depths of the 410 and 660 km mantle discontinuities are in a range of 407-408 and 663-670 km, respectively, while the average thickness of the MTZ is within the range of 255-269 km, which are values very close to the global average thickness of 250 km. (2) South of 26°N, the average depths of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities are in a range of 412-426 and 675-703 km, respectively, and the average thickness of the MTZ is within the range of 262-279 km, which is obviously larger than the global average value of 250 km. The deepening of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities in the Yunnan region is obviously associated with the eastward subduction of the Indian plate below the Burma Arc; then, based on the greater thickness of the MTZ beneath the Yunnan region, we suggest that the eastward subduction of the Indian plate occurs mainly south of 26°N in the Yunnan region. © 2017, Science Press.

Some 20 A. alpina communities were distributed in two traditional smelting tailing piles of Minbingyingjiying (TST) and Shangduoduo village (SDD) with different Pb smelting history. The morphological characteristics (plant height, branch number, basal leaf length, basal leaf width and root morphology) of A. alpina, contents and accumulation characteristics of eight potentially toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Al, Fe) in soil and plants were analyzed. The results showed that the morphological characteristics of A. alpina were mean plant height 12.25 cm, the basal leaf length 17.69 cm, leaf width 5.40 cm, the total root length 117.86 cm plant−1, the root diameter 0.90 mm. The leaves of A. alpina in SDD were longer and narrower with higher plant height compared with in TST. The main companion plants of A. alpina were Sporobolus fertilis (Steud.) W. D. Clayt, Arenaria orbiculata Royle ex Edgew. et Hook. F. and Eulalia speciosa. (Debeaux). The H′ and Dsi were 0.56–2.04 and 0.44–0.95, respectively. The plant species numbers, H’, Dsi and Epi of A. alpina communities in TST were higher than those in SDD. Pb contents in shoot of two A. alpina samples were more than 1000 mg kg−1, Cd content in shoot of one A. alpina sample >100 mg kg−1 and Zn contents in shoot of seven A. alpina samples >10,000 mg kg−1 with the enrichment factors and transport coefficients greater than 1. The results indicate that A. alpina as a Zn, Pb and Cd hyperaccumulator, could be used for long-term phytoremediation of soils contaminated by Cd, Pb and Zn. Species diversity of A. alpina community during long-term natural vegetation restoration was high in the middle succession with single-peak model, and A. alpina would be dominant in the succession climax stage in potentially toxic metal contamination areas. © 2019 The Authors","","68","Lead smelting","Biodiversity - Bioremediation - Restoration - Soil pollution - Value engineering - Vegetation","Accumulation characteristics - Arabis alpina - Hyperaccumulator - Morphological characteristic - Potentially toxic metals - Species composition - Transport coefficient - Vegetation restoration","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 533.2 Metal Refining - 911.5 Value Engineering",,"Number: 2018YFC1802603, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 2017HC015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41867055, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The study was supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFC1802603 ), The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41867055 , 31560163 , and 41761073 ) and The Innovation Team for Farmland Non-pollution of Yunnan Province ( 2017HC015 ).

Since then, over 11 billion USD has been allocated to the program, but the NFPP's success at promoting reforestation is unclear as neither the extent of forest cover change, nor the potential factors influencing the spatial variability of change have been examined. This research employs a case study in northwest Yunnan Province, southwest China, to evaluate the spatial variability of forest cover change under the NFPP and investigate drivers that have influenced recent patterns of change. I employ a mixed methods, cross-scale research framework that includes the analysis of areal trajectories and spatial variability of Landsat-5 imagery-derived forest cover change at three administrative levels before and after the NFPP's introduction; landscape ecology-based metrics to measure the shifting patterns of forest cover change at the patch level; and household interview data on village-level forest resource use patterns and processes in three neighboring villages. Prefecture- and county-level analyses suggest rather stable forest cover across the three-county study area since the introduction of the ban, though township-level measures of forest cover change show a degree of spatial variability as well as a temporal delay in policy implementation effectiveness. Village-level remote sensing analysis shows comparable amounts of forest cover change between study villages but disparate forest resource use patterns in terms of location and amount. Though all research villages continue to exploit local forests for firewood and timber relatively unfettered by policy restrictions, villagers with tourism-derived income are able to buy forest products collected in outside forests much more often; this redistributes local-scale deforestation to the benefit of local and detriment of distant forests. Tourism is often heralded as the solution to rural development challenges in China's southwest, but this research shows the unintended consequences that may result from inconsistent participation at the village-level, consequences which merely redirect, not reduce, forest use pressures, and that are contrary to the goals of state policy.

Here, typical Emeishan basalt saprolites that are widely distributed in the Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces were examined in terms of their basic physical indexes, compression properties, shear properties and microstructure to identify the differences between the parent rock and weathered product. The Emeishan basalt saprolites are characterized by a low density, high void ratio and medium–low compressibility. Also, these saprolites exhibit inelastic nonlinear response and relatively high cohesion during pressure tests. There is a brittle failure in low confining stresses and plastic deformation in high values, indicating the preservation of structural and textural characteristics from the parent rock; however, with highly developed secondary porosity, its strength is much lower than the parent rock. All the results indicate that Emeishan basalt saprolites are a kind of unique geological material, requiring consideration during construction and engineering within the region. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","34","Soil testing","Basalt - Mechanical properties - Physical properties - Rock products - Shear strength","Compression properties - Geological materials - Mechanical behavior - Non-linear response - Physicomechanical properties - Saprolite - Secondary porosity - Textural characteristic","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 505 Mines and Mining, Nonmetallic - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Remote sensing data based model is an effective and widely used method to obtain NPP at regional and global scales. While the spatial and temporal resolution of estimated result is limited by the resolution of inputted NDVI data. In this paper, a new framework was proposed to simulate long time series and fine scale NPP based on multi-source remote sending data in Yunnan province, China. GIMMS3g NDVI datasets and MODIS NDVI products were integrated to construct the consistent and high quality monthly NDVI data from 1982 to 2014 with 1km spatial resolution. There processing steps were designed to reach this target, successively are reconstruction, normalization and multi-sensor fusion. Then the long term NPP were calculated by Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model with the carefully interpolated meteorological data. The results showed a gradually decreased NPP from the southwest to the northeast in study area. Furthermore, the annual NPP presents a volatile upward trend in the past 33 years, consistent with the trend of temperature in. © 2016 IEEE.","","17","Remote sensing","Climate change - Ecosystems - Forestry - Observatories - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Time series - Time series analysis","Carbon cycles - NDVI time series - Net primary productivity - Remote sensing data - Spatiotemporal analysis","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 741.1 Light/Optics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results have shown that the basalt has highly consistent geochemical characteristics, while the geochemical characteristics of rocks and granites are island arcs. The geochemical analysis of rare earth elements in the mining area indicates that the mining area possesses sedimentary characteristics, and skarn enriches iron elements and supplies iron elements such as pyrite in the mining area. The metallogenetic genesis of the mine indicates that the mineralization of the mining area involves multiple phases and multiple stages, including the sedimentation of the sedimentary rocks in the Hercynian period and the laminar filling of the magmatic rocks.

These materials are distributed in intergranular space, along the cracks in minerals or along amphibole cleavage. They are associated with silicification, carbonation and sulfidation in the wall rocks, mineralized rocks and gold ores in the Laowangzhai gold deposit. The special petrographical texture characters of thees black opaque matters as coexistence of liqutation and precipitating cocrystallization reveal the transitional features of the mineralizing fluid between the magmatic melt and the hydrothermal fluid. Combined with REE composition of the host rocks and ores, we suggest that these super-microcrystalline solid, black opaque materials under the transmitted-light microscope are the direct microcosmic manifestations of metasomatism of mantle fluids which are thought to be of the characters of melts and supercritical fluids. During the metasomatic alteration, the mantle fluids were transformed into thermal fluids from magmatic melts. Their simultaneous contaminations by hybridization of mantle-derived and crust-derived materials in the deep geological processes were favorable for gold metallogenesis in the area.","","37","Gold deposits","Deposits - Effluent treatment - Geochemistry - Magnetite - Ores - Oxide minerals - Petrography - Silicates - Sulfur compounds - Supercritical fluids - Textures - Titanium dioxide - Tungstate minerals - Wall rock","Electron microprobes - Element geochemistries - Hybridization of mantle and crust - Hydrothermal fluids - Intergranular space - Metasomatic alterations - Microcrystalline solids - Mineralizing fluids","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The moisture adsorption/desorption curves and the moisture adsorption/desorption rate curves were analyzed. The experiment results indicate that C. gigantea fiber exhibits superior hygroscopicity compared to that of cotton, and under standard atmospheric conditions, the equilibrium moisture regain of C. gigantea is 11.4%. The hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms of C. gigantea fiber is higher than that of cotton in all relative humidity range. The C. gigantea fiber's moisture adsorption-desorption behavior can also be described using an exponential model. Its moisture desorption rate and the difference of the moisture absorption and desorption equilibrium time are significantly higher than that of cotton fiber. The hygroscopic capacity and moisture absorption/desorption rate of C. gigantea fibers are high in comparison with cotton fibers. Thus, C. gigantea fabric when wearing is more comfortable than cotton fabric. Both C. gigantea fiber and cotton fiber exhibit poor infiltration property, but the adsorption capacity of C. gigantea fiber, being 133.62%, is significantly higher than that of cotton (74.98%). It concludes that fibers extracted from C. gigantea pod can be an ideal source as absorbent materials. © 2016, Periodical Agency of Journal of Textile Research.

In this study, a spatial survey of ten lakes with different nutrient levels in Eastern Yunnan was conducted through analyzing the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and elemental composition for aquatic plants (submerged macrophyte, floating plant), phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. The result shows that, among the four groups of lake organisms, floating plant has the most negative signal of stable carbon isotope, with a mean value (±SD) of -28.99‰±0.86‰. While phytoplankton (-21.88‰±2.97‰) and zooplankton (-20.85‰±2.70‰) are characterized by similar carbon isotope values, the submerged macrophyte has a large variation with significantly more positive δ13C value (-12.04‰±4.57‰). This indicates that the difference in carbon sources absorbed or utilized has caused the deviation in stable carbon isotope composition among these four organisms. In terms of stable nitrogen isotope, the primary producers, including submerged macrophyte (5.43‰±5.84‰), floating plant (5.58‰±7.38‰) and phytoplankton (7.26‰±3.83‰), show significantly similar δ15N values. While the δ15N value of primary consumer, zooplankton (11.02‰±3.18‰), is significantly higher with a averaged enrichment factor by 3.46‰, indicating the effect of nitrogen isotope fractionation across trophic levels in our lakes. Furthermore, the carbon isotope signal of lake organisms are also affected by factors such as water temperature and water depth. The variation in the nitrogen isotope signal is dominated by lake eutrophication, which leads to a gradual enrichment in the organismal signal of δ15N. In addition, the carbon and nitrogen content of aquatic organisms from Yunnan lakes are higher than those in lakes from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There existed a threshold C/N ratio of primary producers and primary consumers in defining the shift between autochtonous and allothonous sources of organic matter in our lakes. This spatial survey provided important data for understanding the food web composition and biochemical cycling for plateau lakes. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","","61","Lakes","Aquatic organisms - Biogeochemistry - Carbon - Eutrophication - Isotopes - Nitrogen - Phytoplankton - Plankton - River pollution - Surveys","Biogeochemical cycling - Carbon and nitrogen - Elemental compositions - Middle and lower reaches of the yangtze rivers - Stable carbon isotope compositions - Stable carbon isotopes - Stable nitrogen isotope - Trophic level","453 Water Pollution - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.2 Geochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

With the plant material resources in Yunnan, they are able to create numerous kinds of patterns and drawings on the textile fabric, surrounded by the local rural flavor and intense ethnic characteristics. However, with the social and economic development, together with the opening to the outside world, this ethnic textile activity which reserves much of the primitive style and national characteristics has shrunk and stalled at this moment, turning into the modern manufacturing of commercialization. It is a necessity for the textile art design to embody distinctive nationality and local characteristics before opening to the world. At present, it is of great value to study the textile materials and art forms of the minorities in depth and figure out the whole process from the acquisition and preliminary processing of textile raw material to spinning, weaving, printing and dyeing. Taking advantage of the plant resources in Yunnan, the local minorities are still conducting a series of family sideline production in their textile activities, including the plantation of hemp and cotton, the collection of wild plant fiber to be the textile material, the production process of spinning, weaving, printing and dyeing and so forth, whose main purpose is for private use. In not a few ethnic stockaded villages in Yunnan province we can find various ancient looms standing at the gable walls of the farmhouses, on the threshing ground or in the central rooms. In the bamboo houses of Dai, the women are rotating the spinning wheels with squeaky sounds. On the market of Miao, the two sides of the street are lined with Miao women wearing colorful clothes and hemp cape on the shoulder. They are twiddling hemp strands in the hands, either doing business with the basket in front of them or doing some embroidering at the same time. With the natural materials, they can produce numerous patterns by the ways of weaving, dyeing, sewing, drawing, embroidering or printing. Some are plain and pure, while others are complicated and delicate. The colors are sometimes splendid and solemn, and sometimes mild and elegant; the keynote is lively and pleasant while the pattern is of varied density; the layout is so well organized and the structure is so ingenious that it seems every beautiful and pleasant thing in the world can be found in the patterns, surrounded by the ethnic rural flavor. No matter the structure is simply or complex, it can well present the beauty of nature and creation with the primitive style. It has accumulated the outstanding wisdom and creativity of the labor people from various ethnic groups, standing for the old and excellent ethnic cultural traditions. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","","3","Weaving","Dyeing - Hemp - Printing - Shoulders (road) - Spinning (fibers) - Textile fibers - Textile industry - Textiles","Folk arts - Local characteristics - Minority - National characteristics - Preliminary processing - Printing and dyeing - Social and economic development - Textile materials","406.2 Roads and Streets - 745.1 Printing - 819 Synthetic and Natural Fibers; Textile Technology",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Shear strength of the soil including two factors, cohesion and the internal frictional angle, which could reflect the strength of the soil, is important for the engineering design. The soft soil in the south of Kunming Basin, Yunnan Province is different with the soft soil in the coastal areas because of its complex causes and special geotechnical properties. However, soft soil in Kunming Basin is still classified and evaluated by the national standards that is mainly formation by the statistics of the coastal areas, which would cause great risks in the construction of Kunming city. In order to get some correlativity between the shear strength and physical parameters of soft soil, this paper takes twentyseven areas in the south of Kunming Basin which are constituted by soft soil into study. The result presents that neither the linear relation nor the multivariate linear relation between cohesion and the physical parameters, the correlativity is too low to put forward a empirical formula, which indicate the cohesion might be closely related to the organic content. While there is also no obviously linear relation between the internal frictional angle and the physical parameters, a multivariate linear relation is existed between them. The results may put forward some suggestions for the engineering design.","","7","Shear strength","Adhesion - Coastal zones - Friction - Project management - Soils","Correlativity - Correlativity analysis - Empirical formulas - Engineering design - Geotechnical properties - Internal frictional angles - Physical parameters - Soft soils","471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 912.2 Management - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The zircon U-Pb ages of the syenite porphyry and trachyte in the Yao'an Au-Pb-Ag deposit respectively are 33.8±0.42 Ma and 33.9±0.60 Ma. And their patterns of trace elements and REE, and the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, are very similar to the contemporary mafic volcanic rocks and lamprophyre from the western Yunnan, but obviously different from the contemporary alkali-rich adakitic rocks in the western Yangtze craton. The relationships of SiO2 contents with major and trace element contents of the whole-rocks indicate that magmas for the syenite porphyry and trachyte could be formed by differentiation of the contemporary mafic magmas in the diggings. This implies that syenite porphyry and trachyte may have similar source to the mafic magmas. High Rb/Sr(≥0.1) and low Ba/Rb(20) ratios of the syenite porphyry and trachyte indicate that they were derived from a metasomatized enriched mantle source with abundant phlogopite. And the low ΕHf and the old model age of the rocks indicate that the metasomatism of the source region might happen in Mesoproterozoic. The alkali-rich magmation in Yao'an is closely related with the mineralization. The syenite porphyry and trachyte of Yao'an have a higher initial Pb isotopic composition than the mafic volcanic rocks and lamprophyre from the western Yunnan, which implies that some degrees of the crustal contamination might occur during evolution process of the magmas which could increase the metal contents of the magma and enhance the mineralization potential of the magmas. The moderate oxygen fugacity of the magmas in favour of the Au enrichment. And the obvious fractional crystallization of hornblende and the formation of abundant biotite indicate that the primary magmas were very hydrous, which facilitated the formation of ore-forming fluids. All of these features could provide advantageous conditions for the mineralization in the Yao'an deposit. © 2019, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

The concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in the maize samples presented a decreasing trend from roots to shoots to seeds, except for Zn (roots > seeds > shoots), and the content of HMs in the maize roots was positively correlated with both soil total and extractable HMs. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) intensively colonised in the maize roots, and their functional roles are discussed in the soils contaminated by HMs. The study results showed that intensive mining and smelting activities contributing to soil metal contamination present a high metal-pollution risk for crops grown.

The pollution and the ecological degradation of the plateau lakes have become increasingly prominent since 1990s. Consequently, the lake basins are facing serious challenges in the sustainable development. Promoting sustainable development of the plateau freshwater lake basins has become an important issue. The key of sustainable development is the coordinated development of the regional ecological and economic system. The paper intends to make a new thought on the sustainable development of ecological and economic system based on the adaptive control theory. The ecological and economic characteristics of the Yunnan plateau freshwater lake basins are pointed out in the first part. Then some related points of adaptive control theory have been summarized. Based on the adaptive control theory, a conceptual controlling frame of sustainable development of the plateau freshwater lake basins has been established. Detecting mechanism, modifying mechanism and learning mechanism are the major components of this frame. Based on the information being gotten by detecting, the decision makers can use modifying measures to keep the control system running on the expected situation. In order to make this adaptive controlling frame works well, some operational instructions are proposed in the end. An appropriate controlling mechanism can make an ecological and economic system act as a self-adaptive system. Economic and social development can coordinate with the regional ecological environment protection. With the efforts on the process of sustainable development, the Yunnan plateau lake basins will get a brighter future. ©2010 IEEE.","","6","Adaptive control systems","Control theory - Decision making - Ecology - Economic and social effects - Lakes - Planning - Regional planning - Sustainable development - Water","Adaptive Control - Controlling mechanism - Ecological and economic - Ecological degradations - Ecological environment protections - Economic and social development - Lake basins - Self-adaptive system","403.2 Regional Planning and Development - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 731.1 Control Systems - 912.2 Management - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To obtain simple and applicable correlations, taking Qujing of Yunnan province, China, as example, a one-year field measurement was conducted in a naturally ventilated residential room. Based on collected data, PMV indices were calculated by using Newton's iterative method. It is shown that the PMV values approximately vary from -2.1 in winter to +1.1 in spring and the indoor thermal environment in winter is basically discomfortable. The correlations between the indoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature and PMV were studied by using the linear regression technique. Numerous correlations with high relativities were developed. It is convenient to use them to analyze and predict the indoor thermal environment under similar climatic conditions. The results of this work enrich and develop the basic theory of the indoor thermal environment design and control. ©2010 IEEE.","","10","Thermal comfort","Iterative methods","Climatic conditions - Field surveys - Indoor air temperature - Indoor thermal environments - Linear regression techniques - Mean radiant temperature - Predicted mean vote - Thermal sensations","643 Space Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, the distance between stochastic solutions and the disease-free equilibrium of the corresponding deterministic model is estimated in the time mean sense by constructing stochastic Lyapunov functions. Particularly, by the comparison theorem of stochastic differential equations and the law of large numbers, sufficient conditions for the extinction of the disease are obtained in the special case. Next, the existence of the unique ergodic stationary distribution is proved by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. Finally, the model is used to simulate the human malaria data in Yunnan province and predict the trend of malaria in Yunnan. © 2018","","52","Stochastic models","Differential equations - Diseases - Dynamics - Epidemiology - Light extinction - Lyapunov functions - Stochastic systems - White noise","Deterministic modeling - Disease-free equilibrium - Law of large numbers - Stationary distribution - Stochastic differential equations - Stochastic lyapunov functions - Stochastic solution - Transmission dynamics","461.7 Health Care - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921 Mathematics - 921.2 Calculus - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: 11401512, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11461073, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11501498, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014211C014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Province; ","The authors would extend their thanks to Professor Daqing Jiang for his valuable comments and Dr. Dandan Tang for her help on data analysis.

It is also an important attempt to find the coordination of land space layout between planning. Taking the urban agglomeration in central Yunnan as an example, this paper selects 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2015 as research periods to analyse the spatiooral expansion characteristics of construction land in whole region. The results show that the overall distribution of construction land is relatively dispersion at four time points, mainly along the northeast-southwest direction, and the distribution in the southwest direction is the most concentrated. Using FLUS model simulate the construction land spatial expansion pattern by 2020 under the scenarios of planning guidance and policy restraint, and analyze the ecological effects of spatial expansion. The simulation results show that the construction land expansion area under the two scenarios is continuously increased, but the degree of expansion is different. The construction land fragmentation degree and fractal dimension have been reduced compared with the previous, and the degree of intensive utilization of construction land is increased. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","15","Expansion","Agglomeration - Ecology - Energy resources - Forestry - Fractal dimension - Land use","Construction land - Ecological effect - Ecological protection - Landscape effects - Rational expansions - Spatial expansion - Urban agglomerations - Urban construction","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 525.1 Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Issues - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,"","This paper was funded by the National Natural Science Fund of China (No.41761081). and acknowledgement for the data support from "National Earth System Science Data Sharing Infrastructure, National Science & Technology Infrastructure of China.

The results are summarized as follows: (1) Fluid inclusions in Tianbaoshan deposit have medium-low homogenization temperatures and medium salinities, and ore-forming fluids are mainly derived from basin brine, whereas fluid inclusions in Huize deposit represent high-medium homogenization temperatures and medium salinities, and ore-forming fluids are dominantly derived from basin brine, but with evidence for mixing of different fluids. (2) The values of 3He/4He in Tianbaoshan deposit and Huize deposit range from 0.02 to 0.32 Ra (where Ra is the atmospheric value; 3He/4He = 1.4×10-6), indicating that the ore-forming fluids are dominated by continental crust fluids, where as a small but clear mantle helium contribution is present. And the measurements of 40Ar/36Ar ratio (345.0-1 698.8) indicate that the ore-forming fluids mainly consist of saturated atmospheric water. (3) Combined with geological features, fluid inclusion trapped in sulphide minerals and He-Ar isotopes, it is concluded that the ore-forming processes of Tianbaoshan deposit and Huize deposit are related to the evolution of Youjiang sedimentary basin and the magmatic activities of the Emeishan large igneous province. © 2018, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

This study aimed at providing and evaluating data on total Hg contents of sclerotia collected across of the Yunnan land in China, which is generally lacking information. Sclerotia of W. extensa showed a low contamination with Hg when compared to fruiting bodies of many mushroom species. The Hg contents ranged from 0.004 1 to 0.019 mg Hg per kg dry matter with a median value of 0.011 mg·kg-1dry matter and an overall mean value of (0.011±0.004) mg·kg-1dry matter. Mercury content of sclerotia varied between the places of collection in mountainous Yunnan. Assessed intake of Hg by adult eating 50 g of the “average” Yunnan's origin sclerotia contained in the “Fuling jiabing” snack could be between 0.000 009 2 and 0.000 55 mg per capita or between 0.000 003 4 and 0.000 016 mg per kg body mass for a typical adult of mass 60 kg, which is a low intake and Hg intakes would even be much less if taking decoctions of sclerotia.

It is pointed out that the anti-regulation with power system stabilizer (PSS) has significantly worsened the overvoltage problem of the islanding system, and inadequate adaptability of the HVDC reactive power control for the frequency and voltage changes after a large disturbance is the direct cause of the bipole trip. The existing overvoltage controls of the islanded HVDC sending system are mainly concentrated on the converter station side, without fully utilizing the voltage control capabilities of generators. In order to better solve the temporary overvoltage problem after HVDC trips, further study on the solution to the PSS anti-regulation problem is required to bring the role of the excitation regulator into full play.

It is very difficult to map dominant vegetation communities using only multispectral remote sensing data, especially in mountain areas. However the plant community data contains useful information about the relationships between plant communities and their environment. In this paper plant community data are linked with remote sensing to map vegetation communities. The Bayesian soft classifier was used to produce posterior probabilities images for each class. Then, these images were used to calculate the prior probabilities. One hundred eighty plant plots in Meili Snow Mountain, Yunnan Province, China were used to characterize the vegetation distribution for each class along altitude gradients. Then, the frequencies were used to modify the prior probabilities of each class. After stratification in a vegetation part and a non-vegetation part, a maximum-likelihood classification with equal prior probabilities was conducted, yielding an overall accuracy of 82.1% and a kappa accuracy of 0.797. Maximum-likelihood classification with modified prior probabilities in the vegetation part, conducted with a conventional maximum-likelihood classification for the nonvegetation part, yielded an overall accuracy of 87.7%, and a kappa accuracy of 0.861.","","44","Remote sensing","Landforms - Mapping - Maximum likelihood - Satellite imagery - Snow - Space optics - Vegetation","Maximum likelihood classifications - Meili snow mountain china - Multispectral remote sensing - Overall accuracies - Posterior probability - Prior probability - Vegetation community - Vegetation distribution","405.3 Surveying - 443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology - 655.2 Satellites - 656.1 Space Flight - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Recently, Yunnan province in China experiences more and more frequent and severe droughts. It is significant to study the effect of drought on the carbon cycle of Yunnan province. Gross primary productivity (GPP) could intuitively reflect the growth status of vegetation. In this paper, we analyzed the response of GPP to droughts in Yunnan province, and evaluated the impact of meteorological factor on the carbon cycle. The results indicated that droughts could apparently lead to reduction of GPP respectively on annual, seasonal and monthly scale. And for most vegetation types, the GPP showed good correlation with both temperature and precipitation, excepting the evergreen forests. What's more, croplands were more sensitive to the droughts than other vegetation types, with the highest correlation coefficient to the precipitation and no lag existed. © 2014 IEEE.","","17","Drought","Carbon - Radiometers - Vegetation","Carbon cycles - Correlation coefficient - croplands - Evergreen forests - Good correlations - Gross primary productivity - Meteorological factors - MODIS","444 Water Resources - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

At present, different remote sensing monitoring methods has been widely used in region land cover. To improve classification accuracy is the key of remote sensing data processing and application. This paper selects Xingyun Lake that the typical Plateau Lake area of Yunnan province and the surrounding lakeside zone as research area. Based on the 30 TM Landsat remote sensing image of the research area, using supervised classification, BP neural network, and object-oriented classification to compare accuracy of three kinds of classification methods. It was found that development of BP neural network and object-oriented classification training produces more accurate results than supervised training. Object-oriented classification also produced more accurate classification than the BP neural network classification, but did not improve the accuracy significantly. The results will help to promote surface coverage information of remote sensing rapidly extraction and dynamic monitoring in the Yunnan plateau lake, moreover, it has important scientific significance to protect and formulate rationalization. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","","14","Remote sensing","Classification (of information) - Data handling - Ecosystems - Lakes - Land use - Monitoring - Natural resources management - Neural networks - Resource allocation","Classification accuracy - Classification technology - Object oriented classification - Remote sensing image classification - Remote sensing monitoring - Supervised classification - Surface coverages - Xing Yunhu","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 912.2 Management",,"Number: 2015FA016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 41261092, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41561083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Thanks to the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41561083, No. 41261092) and Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2015FA016) for providing funding to carry put the research at Kunming University of Science and Technology, China.

Although most of the algae in the water is rinsing, potential risk of algae erupt remains. The algae that would probably cause water blooms is pyrrophyta and its erupt would occur in Gucangba between late May and early June. When the velocity exceeds (0.5-0.85) m/s, the water level has 0.05 m changes, or the water temperature has 2°C changes, the algae community structure and composition changes dramatically. By examining the impacts of water stage and velocity on algae growth, this study demonstrates the feasibility of algae removal and control by reservoir ecological operation and irrigation measures.","","9","Algae control","Algae - Ecology - Reservoirs (water) - Transport properties - Water levels - Water quality","Algae identification and classifications - Algae-biological assessment of water qualities - Assessment of water qualities - Community structures - Composition changes - Ecohydraulics - Influence factors of algae growths - Water temperatures","441.2 Reservoirs - 445.2 Water Analysis - 453.2 Water Pollution Control - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The area was divided into three different geomorphological units: specifically, mountain (M), transition (T) and lacustrine (L). Mean trace element content in subsoil were determined for Pb (58.2 mg/kg), Cd (0.89 mg/kg), Cu (129.2 mg/kg), and Zn (97.0 mg/kg). Strong significant relationships between trace element content in topsoil and subsoil were observed. Both Pb and Zn were accumulated in topsoil (RTS (ratio of mean trace element in topsoil to subsoil) of Pb and Zn ≥ 1.0) and Cd and Cu in subsoil (RTS of Cd and Cu ≤ 1.0). Subsoil trace element content was related to relief, stoniness, soil color, clay content, and cation exchange capacity. Except for 7.5 YR (yellow-red) color, trace element content increased with color intensity from brown to reddish brown. Significant positive relationships were observed between Fe content and that of Pb and Cu. Trace element content in mountain unit subsoil was higher than in transition and lacustrine units (M > T > L), except for Cu (T > M > L). Mean trace element content in calcareous subsoil was higher than in sandstone and shale. Mean trace element content in clay texture subsoil was higher than in sandy and sandy loam subsoil, and higher Cu and Zn content in subsoil with few mottles.

GeographicallyWeighted Regressions (GWR) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) are jointly applied to the georeferenced data points collected from the rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna (in Yunnan province, south China) and other remotely-sensed spatial data. According to the GWR models, Age of rubber tree, Percent of clay in soil, Elevation, Solar radiation, Population, Distance from road, Distance from stream, Precipitation, and Mean temperature turn out statistically significant, indicating that these are the major determinants shaping latex yields at the prefecture level. However, the signs and magnitudes of the parameter estimates at the aggregate level are different from those at the lower spatial level, and the differences are due to diverse reasons. The ISODATA classifies the landscape into three categories: high, medium, and low potential yields. The map reveals that Mengla County has the majority of land with high potential yield, while Jinghong City and Menghai County show lower potential yield. In short, the mixed method can offer a means of providing greater insights in the prediction of agricultural production. © 2017 by the authors.","","58","Iterative methods","Data handling - Information analysis - Latexes - Mobile telecommunication systems - Regression analysis - Rubber - Rubber plantations","Agricultural yields - Geographically weighted regression - Iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques - Mekong region - Mixed method - Xishuangbanna","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 818.1 Natural Rubber - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Ore body is buried and occurs along the interlayer tectonic belt as stratiform shape. Sulfide ore is hosted by the middle Permian Yangxin Formation dolostone. Ore minerals are mainly sphalerite, minor galena and pyrite, with rare chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite, and gangue minerals are dominantly calcite and dolomite. Sulfide ore has massive, veined or disseminated structures with granular (euhedral, subhedral and anhedral) and metasomatic relict textures. There are more than 5 million tones (Mt) of sulfide ore, grading >10% Zn + Pb, and can up to 60% Zn + Pb. This paper presents the detailed ore deposit geology, and C-O, S and Pb isotopic data, aiming to reveal the sources of mineralizing elements and ore genesis. Calcite has δ13 C values ranging from 1.25‰ to 2.01‰, mean 1.64‰, which are similar to those of marine carbonate rocks, but are higher than those of mantle and sedimentary organic matters. However, δ18 O values of calcite range from 17.21‰ to 17.74‰ (mean 17.49‰), which are lower than those of carbonate rocks and organic matters, but are higher than those of mantle. Such C-O isotopic data suggests that the source of C is carbonate wall rocks, and O isotope signatures are generated by water/rock interaction between fluids and carbonate rocks. δ34 S values of sulfide minerals range from 10.04‰ to 16.43‰ (av. 14.12‰), indicating a feature of heavy S isotopes-enriched and the sources of reduced S in the hydrothermal fluids are originated mainly from evaporites within sedimentary strata by thermal-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR). Single-grain galena has206Pb/204Pb,207Pb/204Pb and208Pb/204Pb ratios ranging from 18.530 to 18.610 (av. 18.564), 15.694 to 15.702 (av. 15.697) and 38.569 to 38.657 (av. 38.601), respectively. These Pb isotopic data overlap with those of ore-formation age-corrected country sedimentary rocks and basement metaphoric rocks. Such Pb isotopic signatures demonstrate that the main sources of metal Pb are sediments and basements. This study proposes that the Fule is a carbonate-hosted, anticline and interlayer structure-controlled, stratiform, epigenetic, dispersed elements-enriched and high grade Pb-Zn deposit that formed under the background of tectonic regime shifted from extension to compression and then to extension. All those metallogenic features are probable to be related to both the Emeishan mafic magmatism and Indosinian Orogeny. © 2018 Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

Based on the type and transmission way of vibration stress wave, the main stress in the horizontal and vertical directions was analyzed and the superposition effect of the stress wave was revealed. After the mechanical analysis of the sliding mass, the calculation formulas of the anti-sliding force and the sliding force were derived and the damage mechanism of blasting vibration to the structural plane was defined. In addition, according to the structure and lithologic parameter of the slope as well as the vibration monitoring data, the west slope stability of Xiaolongtan open pit mine was analyzed. The results show that the time-dependent stability factor is proportional to the vibration speed and the peak values appear at the same time. Vibration load promotes the breakage of the structural plane leading to the drop of the west slope stability factor by 0.23%. Under the multipoint simultaneous blasting, the fluctuating laws of the stability factors are consistent. The more the start-up points are, the higher the weakening degree to the slope stability is. Under the multipoint allochronic blasting, the stability factor depends on the synthetic waveform structure of all vibration waves. The greater the blasting time difference is, the lower the weakening degree to the slope stability is. Selecting the reasonable quantity of start-up points and time difference could fully reduce the adverse influence of vibration load to slope stability. © 2015, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","29","Slope stability","Blasting - Convergence of numerical methods - Elastic waves - Loads (forces) - Open pit mining - Vibration analysis","Blasting vibrations - Calculation formula - Mechanical analysis - Rock mass structure - Superposition effect - timeliness - Vibration loads - Vibration monitoring","406.2 Roads and Streets - 408 Structural Design - 502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This effect is one way in which vegetation can contribute to lateral reinforcement of a shallow soil layer. To verify how to test traction effect of lateral roots, and how to evaluate its potential capability, the modeling prediction and experimental testing for this effect are presented in this paper. The mechanics procedure of traction effect is described, and the methods for evaluating the magnitude of lateral roots tensile strength and the magnitude of root-soil bond strength are discussed. The prediction model is established to estimate the potential capability of traction effect. Based on digital simulation, a solution is proposed for analyzing and solving the prediction model, and the correlative simulation system is developed in MATLAB. Furthermore, the experimental scheme is designed, and the experimental platform is constructed. Yunnan pine Lateral root specimens are employed in laboratory experiment testing and modeling prediction. The results show that traction effect of lateral roots on soil is obvious, and proposed prediction model is capable of indicating the actualities of traction effect and its variation. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","10","Soils","Environmental technology - Forecasting - MATLAB - Plants (botany) - Reinforcement - Tensile strength","Experimental platform - Experimental testing - In-laboratory experiments - Lateral reinforcement - Lateral roots - Model prediction - Soil reinforcement - Traction effects","454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 2009ZC041M, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31060118, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31060118) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2009ZC041M) are highly appreciated.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

At such localities thermal inertia of the near-surface materials is larger than that in the surrounding areas and relatively low surface temperature due to slower diurnal heating rate may be observed in the daytime. Therefore, the temperature-vegetation-dryness index (TVDI), a combination of surface temperature and vegetation, may be used to retrieve buried faults. Using Landsat7 ETM+ data, we have identified buried faults in this study with TVDI in Yangla copper mining district, Yunnan which is about 26 km2in area and is covered by residual deposits for the most part. A distribution map of faults of the district is obtained with linear lows of TVDI as indicators of buried faults combined with visible image interpretation and field investigation. While essential for mining practice in Yangla, our results show a remarkable potential of thermal infrared remote sensing in ore-field geological studies in poorly outcropped regions.","","26","Remote sensing","Atmospheric temperature - Copper deposits - Deposits - Infrared radiation - Surface properties - Vegetation","Buried faults - Distribution maps - Field investigation - Low surface temperature - Near-surface materials - Surface temperatures - Temperature-vegetation dryness indices - Thermal infrared remote sensing","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 741.1 Light/Optics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although several studies have addressed individual environmental elements in the study area, efforts for integrated analysis of environmental factors and human settlements are still lacking. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial distribution of physical environments for human settlements to support population distribution planning. This study includes 10 factors (topography, landform, vegetation, elevation, fault, rock, soil, earthquake intensity, temperature, and precipitation) as indicators for the assessment of human settlement suitability based on the analytic hierarchy process and grey correlation methods. Geographic information system functions were used to help understand the spatial distribution of human settlements and the causal factors.

A series of direct shear tests on specimens with different immersion time in water were performed under the constant normal loading condition. Experimental results showed that the peak shear strength of the sandstone joints can be lowered by about 50% due to immersed in water for 32 days. Under the low normal loading condition, the peak shear strength declined until the immersion time up to 8 days and beyond the point onward, the values were not sensitive to the immersion time. Under the high normal loading condition, we can observe a decline trend in the peak shear strength and the influence of water became less prominent with the increase of immersion time. The effect of water on the peak shear displacement was less obvious as the normal stress is low, while it increased with the increase in immersion time under the high normal loading condition. The variations of residual shear displacement exhibited fluctuation as the immersion time increased and no obvious regularity can be observed. Shear-induced normal displacement during the process of shearing generally switched from dilatancy to contraction (negative dilatancy)as immersion time increased. Water-induced reduction in secant shear stiffness under the normal stresses of 2.0 and 4.0 MPa can be observed for specimens immersed in water for 2 days, and beyond the point onward the stiffness decreased slightly with the increase of immersion time. One of possible weakening mechanisms would be related to the fracture energy and the friction coefficient of the cement particles within the intact block, and the other would be related to the capillary forces and the chemical and/or physio-chemical effects among contact particles distributed on the surfaces. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","34","Shear flow","Friction - Sandstone - Stiffness - Stress analysis - Wetting","Direct shear test - Friction coefficients - Influence of water - Normal displacement - Peak shear strength - Shear behavior - Shear displacement - Water-weakening","482.2 Minerals - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 41672302, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41731284, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51609178, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41672302, 41731284, and 51609178), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)(Grant No. CUG170603).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Lake deposits after river blocking formed by landslides along the river upstream, till now, are in lake sediments covered with above the accumulation of landslide , and show obviously discordance contact. The Chenghai fault is an old and strong activitiy fault nearly NS through the Zhaizicun ancient landslide in Jinsha River section. Chenghai fault is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip pull a movement, and it is with vertical rupture as well. The complex activities of the fault destroyed the continuity of the geological body, and accelerated the rock broken degree. The Jinsha River erosion action and fault zone both controlled morphological evolution of the landscape in the right bank. From the landslide scale, lithologic features, instability direction and its formation mechanism strictly by near-zone geological tectonic constraints, it is speculated that Chenghai fault activities is the main constraint of the Zhaizicun ancient landslide.","","22","Landslides","Debris - Lakes - Rivers - Strike-slip faults - Tectonics","Ancient landslide - Catastrophic landslides - Complex activity - Formation mechanism - Geological bodies - Geological tectonic constraints - Landslide dam - Morphological evolution","481.1 Geology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The changes in micromorphology and phase composition were discussed by SEM, EDS and XRD, and the separation mechanism of tin and iron minerals with gangue minerals or tin minerals with iron minerals was analyzed. The results show that tin minerals are mainly disseminated in iron minerals in the form of superfine grains and isomorphism, and few in gangue minerals. Thus, the gravity, flotation and magnetic process are unable to separate tin and iron minerals from gangue minerals effectively or recover tin and iron comprehensively. The iron concentrate with a grade of 66.58% Fe and a recovery of 86.16% and the tin concentrate with a grade of 4.56% Sn and a recovery of 63.80% can be obtained under the conditions of roasting temperature of 898 K, roasting time of 40 min, mass fraction of reducing agent 3 of 5% (mass fraction) and cohesion agent of 6 kg/t by the new technology.
