Because observing an active debris flow is very difficult, finding a method to estimate debris flow density is urgently needed for disaster mitigation engineering. This paper proposes an effective empirical equation in terms of grain size distribution (GSD) parameters based on observations in Jiangjia Gully, Yunnan Province, China. We found that the GSD follows P(D) = KD-μexp(− D/Dc), with μ and Dc representing the fine and coarse grains, respectively. In particular, μ is associated with some characteristic porosity of soil in the natural state and increases with increased porosity. Dc characterizes the grain size range of the flow and increases with the grain concentration. Studies show that flow density is related to both parameters in power law. Here, we propose an empirical equation for estimating flow density: ρ = 1.26μ-0.132 + 0.049Dc0.443, which provides not only an estimation of the density for a flow, but also describes the variation in density with the GSD of material composition; this provides important information related to the design of debris flow engineering structures. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","45","Debris","Grain size and shape - Porosity - Size distribution","Debris flows - Disaster mitigation - Empirical equations - Grain composition - Grain size distribution - Jiangjia Gully - Material compositions - Yunnan province","922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Haixi Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: KJ-2015-18, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: Y3R1340340, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41471011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: Y5R2040040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: SKHL1516, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Funding This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41471011), the West Light Foundation of The Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. Y5R2040040), the Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering (Grant No. SKHL1516), the Key Laboratory of Mountain Hazards and Surface Process, CAS (Grant No. Y3R1340340), and Scientific Project of Department of Land and Resources of Sichuan Province (Grant No. KJ-2015-18).

Especially in the recent three decades, the increasing environmental pressure has promoted its development rate and the significance of its management and operation. The number of SHP stations in China has exceeded 45,000 with a total installed capacity of more than 68 GW, ranked the first in the world. SHP provides approximately 5% of China's gross electricity generation and is the major backbone for rural electrification. However, how to manage and operate SHP effectively is still a difficult problem in China. In this paper, the current status of SHP in China is investigated. A special emphasis is given to their dispatching management. The southwestern province of Yunnan, ranked second in exploitable potential and first in established capacity of SHP in China, is taken as a typical example for the management and operation of SHP. The difficulties and challenges of management and operation of SHP in Yunnan province are depicted. A case system for the SHP management in Yunnan is introduced in details. It is believed that the system should be beneficial for regions with rich SHP resources in China and elsewhere as well. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to shale gas enrichment degree, water resources distribution and the practice of exploration and development, China mainland shale gas resources can be divided into five blocks. On this basis, the author preliminary discussed the distribution of water resources and eco-environmental problems during shale gas exploration and development. Considering the practice of shale gas exploration and development and water resources situation, the author put forward that the Upper Yangtze and Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi region would be the most favourable block, and there are problems with China mainland shale gas exploration and development, such as large water consumption, well drilling water leakage and mud loss which would contaminate groundwater. In addition, shale gas well injection (grouting) might cause the occurrence of seismic events. After analyzing the two different kinds of opinions on whether China mainland shale gas exploration and development would cause environmental problems, the author pointed out that, without a doubt, there exist eco-environmental problems during shale gas exploration and development, and further proposed that we should put the environmental protection at first place and take the road of environment-friendly shale gas exploration and development by reference to the exploration and practice of shale gas development both of China and other advanced countries in the world. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","26","Shale gas","Environmental protection - Geological surveys - Groundwater - Groundwater pollution - Groundwater resources - Natural gas wells - Natural resources exploration - Shale - Well drilling","Distribution of water - Eco-environmental - Environmental problems - Exploration and development - Gas exploitation - Gas exploration - Optimizing selection - Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi region","444 Water Resources - 444.2 Groundwater - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 481.1 Geology - 501 Exploration and Prospecting - 505 Mines and Mining, Nonmetallic - 512 Petroleum and Related Deposits",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The first phase ran from 1999 to 2014, and the second phase started in 2015. The second phase of the GfG (GfG/2) addresses some problems of the first phase (GfG/1), in particular the lack of income for the farmers, as well as some changes to the rural areas, in particular the small number of remaining farmers. The paper describes how the GfG/2 (unlike the GfG/1) encourages farmers to organize themselves in cooperatives, or work with investors, and grow fruit trees to generate sustainable incomes. The paper also describes the constraints that prevent the smooth implementation of the GfG/2, in particular the insufficient financial support, the fact that some of the land that should be converted is 'essential farmland', and the small and scattered pieces of farmland. The paper argues that in spite of this, the program is likely to succeed, and help farmers generate sustainable incomes.

Finally, we report the results of extensive model studies toward forming the dimeric yunnaneic acids A and B. These explorations indicate that the innate reactivities of the monomeric fragments do not favor spontaneous formation of the desired dimeric linkages.

The experiments were done in the Jiangjia Ravine in Dongchuan, Yunnan province. A channel mimicking the natural rivers was dig on the debris flow deposit of the ravine. The different flood discharges were created by a manmade pond in the upper reach of channel. The step-pool structure was made of boulders of 0.3-0.5 m in diameter. The first type of the step-pool system is a single step and a deep pool, the step of this type is constructed with 7 key boulders. The second type of the step-pool system is composed of several steps and a relatively small pool. The first type is much more three-dimensional than the second type. The results showed that the energy dissipation ratio of step-pool structure is as high as over 90%. The role of energy dissipation of the structure becomes smaller as the flood water inundates the whole structure, thence the energy dissipation ratio reduces with the flood discharge. The first type of the step-pool has higher energy dissipation ratio than the second type at various discharges.

The results suggested that the removal efficiency of turbidity was above 98.20%. Additionally, the average value of Silting Density Index (SDI) and residual chlorine of effluent of UF process were less than 1.80 and 0.06mg/L, respectively. However, its removal efficiency was limited by membrane fouling. And this system needed to be backwashed periodically to maintain high removal efficiency. Hardness and scale-forming ions could be decreased effectively by RO. The RO membrane fouling could be avoided by adjusting pH (7.0-7.5) and dosing scale inhibitor (MDC150, 4.00-5.00mg/L). Finally, the effluent of the UF/RO system can be reused as the cooling water or supply water for low-pressure boiler equipment. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","16","Water filtration","Effluents - Membrane fouling - Reverse osmosis - Turbidity - Ultrafiltration - Wastewater reclamation - Wastewater treatment","Advanced treatment - Average values - Chemical wastewater - Density index - Full scale tests - Removal efficiencies - Reverse osmosis systems - Scale inhibitor - Wastewater reuse - Yunnan , China","452.3 Industrial Wastes - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

All total of soil samples from the Puzhehei Scenic Spot in Qiubei County, Yunnan Province in December 2016 were measured in the lab with the spectrometer. This paper used the original reflectivity of the soil samples and its four mathematical transformations as the inversion indicators to construct Unary Linear Regression Model (ULRM), Multiple Stepwise Regression Model (MSRM) and Partial Least Squares Regression Model (PLSRM) aiming to compare the performance and inversion accuracy of these three models, and find the best performance model to inverse the SMC. The results showed that: (1) It was determined that 1350nm, 1450nm, 1841nm, 1897nm, 1905nm, 1935nm and 2146nm were the hyper-spectral characteristic bands of SMC by analyzing the correlation between soil moisture content and reflectance. (2) The coefficients of determinations R2 varied between 0.73 and 0.91 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranged from 1.51 to 1.86 with the best performance obtained with the PLSM, and the LRM had the lowest inversion accuracy. (3) The PLSRM established by the logarithm of the reflectivity of 1450nm, 1841nm, 1897nm, 1905nm, 1935nm and 2146nm was the best model of the 15 models by comparing the inversion precision of the samples in each model in this study. © 2019 SPIE.","19","Soil moisture","Least squares approximations - Linear transformations - Mathematical transformations - Mean square error - Moisture determination - Reflection - Regression analysis - Soil surveys","Hyper-spectral characteristics - HyperSpectral - Hyperspectral reflectance - Linear regression models - Multiple stepwise regression - Partial least squares regression models - Retrieval models - Yunnan province","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 944.2 Moisture Measurements",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The C. cassiicola isolates were collected from Hainan and Yunnan provinces, China, from 2006 to 2008. The assay of 24 C. cassiicola isolates on detached leaves of four different Hevea rubber clones (genotypes PR 107, Dafeng 95, RRIM 600, and Reyan 7-33-97) indicated that 23 of the isolates were susceptible to RRIM 600, and were therefore considered race 1 except for CC-023. ISSR analysis grouped 24 C. cassiicola isolates into four clusters (A, B, C, and D). Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) analysis based on Nei and Li's coefficient (calculated from the binary matrix data of 103 DNA fragments generated from 16 ISSR primers) indicated that cluster A included 19 isolates from Hainan and Yunnan (this cluster was further divided into two sub clusters (I, II), sub cluster II contained isolate CC-023); clusters B and C comprised of 1 isolates from Hainan, respectively; while cluster D encompassed 3 isolates from Hainan and Yunnan. Pathogenicity tests and ISSR analysis showed that there was no correlation between race structure, the geographical origin of the pathogen and their ISSR clusters because 23 of the isolates belonging to four distinct clusters were considered race 1 except for isolate CC-023. However, most of the isolates with different pathogenicity levels shared the same clades, and furthermore, the ISSR clusters and cology color had an exact correlation.

Although physical or chemical control of the blooms is possible in short period, these methods could cause other problems. Thus, there is still a need for research on biological factors controlling cyanobacteria blooms. We screened part of the Yunnan University actinomycete strain library and found that the extract of Streptomyces hebeiensis YIM 001Texhibited obvious inhibition on M. aeruginosa. The main component - nanaomycin A methyl ester (NAME) was isolated at a level of 20mgL-1by scale-up fermentation. Lytic mechanism experiments of NAME on M. aeruginosa demonstrated it could effectively inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa (EC50at 72h=2.97mgL-1), hinder cell division and enlarge cell size. NAME damaged M. aeruginosa cells as evidenced by decreases in algal activity, biomass, esterase activity and chlorophyll-a content. The SOD activity of the treated cells initially increased, and then decreased together with a gradual increase in both O2-and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, consistent with inhibitory effects of NAME due to lipid peroxidation damage of the algal cell membrane. The results suggest that NAME is effective for controlling undesired cyanobacteria and the Chl-fluorescence is a potential endpoint to assay the NAME eco-toxicity on cyanobacteria. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","63","Bacteria","Cell proliferation - Cells - Cytology - Ecology - Esters - Flow cytometry - Hydrogeology - Lakes - Metabolites - Physiological models - Physiology - Plants (botany) - Toxicity","Algicidal activity - Cyanobacteria blooms - Cyanobacterial blooms - Esterase activities - Methyl esters - Microcystis aeruginosa - Physiological response - Scale-up fermentations","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461 Bioengineering and Biology - 481.1 Geology - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Haixi Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 21062028, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31260138, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U0833604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Dr. Geoff Horsman (Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada) for his constructive comments, and Kunming Institute of Zoology Chinese Academy of Science, especially Jian Li, for FCM measurement.

The analysis results show that sandstones from the Mangbang Formation mainly comprise of feldspar sandstone and greywacke sandstone as well as minor shale, and the mineral assemblage mainly contains quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and illite. The sandsontes have a consistent REE pattern, enrichment of LREE relative to HREE, with LREE/HREE of 9.75~15.91 (averaging 13.24) and (La/Yb)Nof 13.06~26.41 (averaging 19.21). The SiO2/Al2O3ratio of 2.06~6.01 and index of the chemistry variation (ICV) of 0.54~1.09 together with the features of sedimentation make it clear that these sandstones resulted from recycling deposition in the passive tectonic setting, rather than the first cycle of sediments due to the relatively strong weathering. Furthermore, the Th/U values of 5.44~12.10% and CIA of 59~76 reflect a chemical weathering environment of medium intensity in warm and moist climate. A/CNK discrimination diagram shows that the sandstone clastics have a higher content of K-feldspar relative to plagioclase and low CIA value due to metasomation. The Th/Sc ratio of 4.43~25.35 (averaging 8.18) and the diagrams of Co/Th versus La/Sc, K2O versus Re, and La/Yb versus ΣREE all suggest that sandstones in the study area were mainly derived from the previously formed granites. Besides, the tectonic discrimination diagrams of TiO2versus Fe2O3T+MgO, Al2O3/(Cao+Na2O) versus Fe2O3T+MgO, K2O/Na2O versus SiO2, and La-Th-Sc all reflect that these granites were formed in the setting of passive continental margin and possibly corresponded to the long term steady state of the Meso-Tethys Ocean which has been open during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. The Husa basin was formed due to the extension along the previous Husa transpressional fault and started to deposition sourced from the peripheral granites during this period. © 2017, Science Press.

Batch flotation tests had been conducted to upgrade the phosphate concentrate by conventional fatty acids reagents under 70% -75 μm of the particle size; however, the unsatisfied results (P2O5 grade of 27.84% and recovery of 49.25%) were obtained. Also there are a large amount of slimes trapped in the concentrate and high-dosages consumption of reagents, for example, more than15 kg/t soda ash and 2 kg/t sodium silicate at only one-staged roughing. Based on the analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the sample, most of gangues are clay, quartz, and chlorite, which may easy to over-grind and deteriorate the flotation process either on reagents consumption or slurry fluidity or viscosity. A hydro-cyclone had been introduced to pre-concentrate the phosphate ore by scrubbing the slime before flotation, which can result obviously in reducing the dosages of soda ash from 15 Kg/t to 4 Kg/t, and raising the grade of P2O5 in the concentrate from 27.84% to 36.13% at the expense of about 4% recovery of P2O5. They also substantially reduced the time of sedimentation of concentrate after flotation from ~10 to ~1 min. In this paper, the effects on the recovery of P2O5 by the different dosages of flotation reagents with or without de-sliming were studied, with the objective of determining the different effects on the functions of flotation reagents by slime during flotation.","13","Flotation","Fatty acids - Magnetic separation - Magnetite - Particle size - Phosphate ore treatment - Phosphates - Recovery - Silicates - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium compounds - Sustainable development - X ray diffraction","Batch flotation - De-sliming - Different effects - Flotation process - Flotation reagents - Phosphate ores - Sodium silicate - Yunnan province","533.1 Ore Treatment - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the degree at which net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems was affected in China is not clear yet. In this study, the remote sensing driven process-based Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model was used to estimate NPP decrease in China's terrestrial ecosystems caused by the abnormal droughts in 2009. The results show that the BEPS model is able to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and NPP of China's terrestrial ecosystems reliably. Estimated GPP and NPP show similar spatial patterns, decreasing from east to west and from south to north. In 2009, annual NPP was lower than the averages over the period from 2000 to 2010 in most regions of China, especially in areas of southern China. The decrease of annual NPP in 2009 over southeast Tibet and southeast coastal areas was even more than 100 g C m2yr1. The annual total NPP of Hunan and Yunnan provinces, Guangxi and Tibet autonomous regions in 2009 decreased by 4% to 6% of multi-year means, owing to the impact of consecutive drought from summer to winter in these areas. The national total of NPP in this year decreased about 35.5 Tg C yr1, approximately equivalent to 1% of annual total NPP in China's terrestrial ecosystems averaged during the period from 2000 to 2010. © 2012 IEEE.","20","Ecosystems","Climate change - Climate models - Drought - Observatories - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Remote sensing","Boreal ecosystem productivity simulators (BEPS) - Gross primary productivity - Net primary productivity - remote sesning - Spatial patterns - Terrestrial ecosystems - Tibet autonomous region - Yunnan province","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The monitoring data of 30 cracks' movements in a typical twin-arch tunnel of the Yuanjiang-Mohei expressway in Yunnan province indicated that the width of cracks changed with time, with the general trend of increasing first and decreasing later, and any sudden change or monotonic increase in crack width is abnormal and must be caused by external disturbances.

Besides, we investigate the Lushan earthquake and discovered that seismic macroscopic anomalies such as sandboils and waterspouts, muggy weather and dog barking furiously about 8-6 hours before the earthquake, and the exploding and gas eruptions during the earthquake appeared near the epicenter. All the phenomena indicate that the genesis of Lushan earthquake is not fault movement but the sudden release of energy after the accumulation of heat underground.

How to effectively intervene the FSW population for HIV/AIDS prevention has been a public concern. In this paper, relied on a set of interview data of FSWs collected from a city in Yunnan Province, China, we first construct a social network based on if FSWs have been acquaint. We find that the network has the characteristics of “small world” with a small average shortest path and a big clustering coefficient. The network also shows a “small community” phenomenon with a low average density. In other words, individuals are close to each other in community, and their external connection is sparse. The degree of the FSW social network obeys an exponential distribution, indicating that few numbers of nodes have a large centrality (i.e. the important individuals). In addition, those nodes that is more passive in HIV/AIDS prevention have a higher level of clustering, but a lower similarity with their neighbors. Finally, we use individuals’ responses to the AIDS KAP questionnaire to predict one's position (or status) in the social network, as the social network structure is invisible, observable individual responses to the questionnaire is easier to obtain. We then propose an efficient method to choose the nodes based on individuals’ responses to AIDS KAP questionnaire for intervention and network clogging.

Statistical methods, including correlation, cluster, and regression analysis, were used to explore the relationships between rock MS and elemental variations of Zn, Fe, Pb, Ni, Cr, Si and Ca. The resulting correlation analysis demonstrated that concentrations of Fe and Zn were positively correlated with MS, whereas Pb, Si and Ca concentrations were negatively correlated with MS. The resulting cluster analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis between MS and elements concentrations show that Zn, and Cr are the crucial factors responsible for the variability of MS. These results are probably due to the Fe, Ni, and Cr elements existing in the lattice of sphalerite, which contributes positively to the MS of rocks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","27","Minerals","Binary alloys - Chromium - Cluster analysis - Lead alloys - Lead zinc deposits - Lime - Linear regression - Magnetic susceptibility - Magnetism - Mineral exploration - Nondestructive examination - Rocks - Scanning - Silicon - Zinc alloys - Zinc sulfide","Correlation analysis - Geochemical properties - Itrax core scanner - Mineralization - Non destructive - Pb-zn deposits - Stepwise multiple linear regression - Yunnan province","482.2 Minerals - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 543.1 Chromium and Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: CUG120116, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: Wuhan, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: CUG120501, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: -, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: NCET-13-1016, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 41372007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Prof. Changjiang Li and M.

Accurate forecasting can solve the problems of waste-water and abandoned electricity and ensure the safe operation of the power system. However, it faces a series of challenges, such as lack of sufficient data, uncertainty of power generation, no regularity of a single station and poor forecasting models. It is difficult to establish a forecasting model based on classical and mature prediction models. Therefore, this paper introduces a correlation analysis method for forecasting power production of SHP plants. By analyzing the correlation between SHP and LHP plants, a safe conclusion can be drawn that the power production of SHP plants show similar interval inflow to LHP plants in the same region. So a regression model is developed to forecast power production of SHP plants by using the forecasting inflow values of LHP plants. Taking the SHP plants in Yunnan province as an example, the correlation between SHP and LHP plants in a district or county are analyzed respectively. The results show that this correlation method is feasible. The proposed forecasting method has been successfully applied to forecast long-term power production of SHP plants in the 13 districts of the Yunnan Power Grid. From the results, the rationality, accuracy and generality of this method have been verified. © 2015 by the authors.","24","Small power plants","Correlation methods - Electric power generation - Electric power transmission networks - Forecasting - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants - Regression analysis","Correlation analysis - Forecasting methods - Forecasting modeling - Forecasting models - Long-term forecasting - Power production - Small hydro-power plants - Yunnan power grid","611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

These mainstream cascaded hydropower plants are characterized by large capacity, huge units, and dynamic operation control, etc. It will take a long time to be fully put into operation for all units. The hydropower plants with huge capacity have a significant impact on the long-term operation of large-scale hydropower systems and provincial power grids. In this paper, long-term scheduling methods for large-scale hydropower systems are presented and tested for dynamic operation control of Jinshajiang River and Lancangjiang River in Yunnan Power Grid (YNPG). It mainly consists of a unified evaluation method for all reservoirs to determine natural runoff process with same probability and a long-term scheduling method for large-scale hydrothermal system with different total installed capacity in different years. The method has been applied in long-term hydropower simulation scheduling analysis in YNPG from 2012 to 2015.

The vent pool, 5.6. m in diameter and up to 1.5. m deep, is lined with opal-A that was precipitated from the near-boiling spring waters. A glass suspended in the pool was coated with opal-A in two months and two PVC pipes that drained water from the pool in late 2010 became lined with opal-A precipitates in less than three months. The opal-A accumulated at rates of 0.5 to 0.75. mm/month in the spring pool and 2.5 to 3.5. mm/month in the PVC pipes. The opal-A precipitates, irrespective of where they developed, are formed primarily of silicified microbes and opal-A spheres along with minor amounts of native sulfur, detrital quartz, and clay (mainly kaolinite). The fabrics in these opal-A deposits were dictated largely by the growth patterns of the filamentous and rod-shaped microbes that dominate this low-diversity biota and the amount of opal-A that was precipitated around them. Many of the microbes were preserved as rapid opal-A was precipitated on and around them before the cells decayed. With continued precipitation, however, the microbes became quickly engulfed in the opal-A precipitates and morphological evidence of their presence was lost. In essence, the process that controls their preservation ultimately disguised them to the point where cannot be seen. Critically, this loss of morphological identity takes places even before opal-A starts its diagenetic transformation towards quartz. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","94","Bacteria","Deposits - Groundwater - Hot springs - Kaolinite - Lakes - Polyvinyl chlorides - Quartz - Sulfur","China - Diagenetic transformation - Drained water - Geothermal areas - Geothermal deposits - Growth patterns - High temperature - Microbes - Opal-A - PVC pipes - Rod-shaped - Spring water - Tengchong - Water temperatures - Yunnan province","804 Chemical Products Generally - 617 Turbines and Steam Turbines - 612 Engines - 532 Metallurgical Furnaces - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 482.2 Minerals - 461.9 Biology - 444.2 Groundwater - 407 Maritime and Port Structures; Rivers and Other Waterways - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena",,"Number: 2012CB417300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: A6090, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The samples used in this study were collected with permission of Yunnan Tengchong Rehai Tour Developing Co., Ltd, the administration section of the Rehai geothermal area.

In general, Spread F could induce fluctuations of amplitude and phase of radio waves which travel through the ionosphere. Therefore, investigation of Spread F could be used to not only reveal ionospheric electrodynamics process, but also have a significant engineering application. Due to a large amount of ionograms recorded by ionosondes, it is a challenge work to manually identify ionograms with Spread F to study characteristics of Spread F. Thus, much work has been devoted to automatic identification of Spread F. In the present study, a machine learning method related to decision tree was adopted to automatically identify Spread F from ionograms. First, ionograms were processed by image method and projection techniques to provide input parameters for decision tree. The output of the proposed decision tree is whether Spread F is present or not on ionograms. Then, a set of ionograms was used to construct a decision tree. At last, a set of ionograms was adopted to validate the performance of this decision tree. In this study, ionograms recorded at Puer station (Geographic latitude and longitude: 22.7°N, 101.5°E; Geomagnetic latitude: 12.8°N) in the Yunnan province were used. Results indicate that the decision tree performed well in automatic identification of Spread F on ionograms. The accuracy of automatic identification in a set of ionograms with Spread F was reached up to 89%.

Identifying and protecting key places that have high importance for ecological sustainability are great challenges. Ecological security patterns are such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability. In this study, taking Yunnan Province, China as a case study area, ecological sources were identified through ecosystem services, and circuit theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via calculating the ‘resistance’ or ‘current’ and thus to identify ecological corridors and key ecological nodes. The results showed that, ecological security patterns included 66 ecological sources, 186 ecological corridors, 24 pinch-points and 10 barriers. In details, the ecological sources were mainly distributed in the southwest and northwest of Yunnan Province, with the ecological corridors locating along the high mountains, and both ecological sources and corridors were mostly covered with forest land. Pinch-points covered by forest land and cultivated land, were distributed in the middle of Yunnan Province along the rivers. Approximately 75.9% nature reserves were located in the identified ecological sources, and the remainings were mainly distributed in eastern Yunnan Province with small area, showing the effectiveness in identifying ecological security patterns. Among 81 projects of low–slope hill development carried out in Yunnan Province, 46.9% showed potential human stress on regional ecological security.

Most of these landslides are concentrated near the epicentre with distances ranging from 6–12 km, especially at the upper slope along the river valley. The number of landslides increased with increasing distance from the epicentre (0–9 km) and then decreased with increasing distance from the epicentre (>9 km). The landslides decreased in density with increasing distance from the fault rupture. More than 70% of the landslides occurred on the right side of the Xiyuhe-Zhaotong fault, when viewed from Southwest (SW) to Northeast (NE).

The late Cenozoic Tengchong Volcanic Field (TVF), located in the Yunnan Province Northeast of the Himalayas, comprises a cluster of mafic continental intraplate lavas, represented by 68 volcanic cones and spanning an area of ca. 800 km2. Major and trace element data and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios of 18 newly sampled rocks from the area are used to identify the composition of their source in the SCLM. Indices of magmatic differentiation are correlated with isotope composition, marking a classic case of assimilation-fractional-crystallization (AFC) during petrogenesis. The most primitive samples, identified on the basis of element and isotope compositions, are interpreted to be directly derived from the metasomatised mantle underneath south-western China. Modelling of a best-fit scenario indicates that the isotope and trace element character of these samples can be reproduced by ca. 1% partial melting of a metasomatised mantle source, composed of depleted MORB mantle infused with 1% addition of a bulk global subducting sediment (GLOSS) component. Average isotope compositions of87Sr/86Sr = 0.705861,143Nd/144Nd = 0.512675,176Hf/177Hf = 0.282962,206Pb/204Pb = 18.305,207Pb/204Pb = 15.642 and208Pb/204Pb = 38.948 are proposed for the present-day enriched part of the SCLM. The origin of the isotopic signatures is ascribed to modifications of parent-daughter ratios in the SCLM by past subduction-related metasomatism, possibly in the form of sediment mélange diapirs. This implied that the mantle source of TVF lavas is not, as previously proposed, related to enriched geochemical reservoirs (EM-1, EM-2) associated with mantle plume activity or to so-called Dupal or Indian asthenospheric mantle. Instead, it is argued that time-integrated parent-daughter fractionation occurred long before India-Asia collision and this produced reservoirs with isotopic compositions that resemble some but not all aspects of the Dupal isotope signature. In analogy, so-called Dupal isotope signatures elsewhere may also be the result of contamination of the mantle by a crustal component, most likely subducted sediment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","99","Lead alloys","Hafnium alloys - Isotopes - Melting - Neodymium alloys - Sediments - Strontium alloys - Trace elements - Volcanoes","DUPAL - Indian mantle - Intraplate - Lithosphere - Tengchong - Yunnan","483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 484 Seismology - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: FT 140101062, Acronym: ARC, Sponsor: Australian Research Council; Number: -, Acronym: PKU, Sponsor: Peking University; Number: 41372072, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","J.-W.

Yond baps are mostly produced with goat’s milk and occasionally with cow’s milk. As a traditional dairy product produced by fermentation, yond bap contains an abundant microflora. The microbes that play a role in the fermentation of goat milk form a specific community structure. In this work, 11 types of yond bap were characterized from four different regions in the Yunnan province. We employed bar-coded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to analyze the bacterial community structure in the yond baps. The results indicated that the bacterial community structures of the 11 yond baps were different. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were detected in all the samples. Pseudomonas, a proteobacterium, was the predominant bacterial genus. Pseudomonas sequences were detected often and in most of the samples. Next, Streptococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Lactococcus belonging to Streptococcaceae family played important roles in the fermentation of yond baps as the numbers of sequences belonging to these species were higher.

This study examines a drought-prone region in Central Yunnan Province of China over a four-year period including a notable severe drought event in 2010. The study investigates the phase relationships between meteorological drought from image-based rainfall estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), and imaged drought from a remote sensing drought index, the Normalised Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) for different land cover types at local scale. The land cover types derived from MODIS and Landsat images were resampled to 250. m to match all datasets used. Significant differences between cover types are observed, with cropland and shrubland most highly correlated with 64. days' earlier rainfall and evergreen forest most responsive to rainfall 90. days earlier, indicating a need to consider detailed land cover information for accurate integrated drought indices. The finding that concurrent rainfall is only weakly correlated with observed drought, suggests that existing drought indices, which compute lowest weightings for the most distant lag period would be unrepresentative. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","22","Remote sensing","Drought - Rain - Rain gages - Vegetation","Concurrent rainfall - Condition index - Land cover informations - Meteorological drought - Phase relationships - Supply waters - Tropical rainfall measurement missions - Yunnan","443.2 Meteorological Instrumentation - 443.3 Precipitation",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","The authors would like to thank Grant 1-ZVCY from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University .",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The deposit is overlain by transported cover with a thickness of ~0.2–50 m. The geoelectrochemical extraction method (GEM) was tested over well-characterized areas of the deposit (sections A–B, C–D), and in an unexplored region (area E). GEM results are compared with soil geochemical methods (SGM) in areas of known mineralization and show that the geoelectrochemical anomalies (Pb, Zn, Ge, As, Au) exhibit a positive response to the deep concealed ore body, and that GEM can be more effective for finding the concealed Pb-Zn ore in the study area compared to SGM. A geoelectrochemical prospecting index was created for this deposit type and tested in an area without known mineralization (area E). The index shows that anomalies can be identified where the contrast value (CV) is >1 for Pb and Zn, and where there is the Y1 factor score (y1) >0 (for Pb-Zn-Ge-As-Mo-Bi). Correlation and factor analysis identify two comprehensive anomaly zones (CAZ) in area E with good prospecting potential, which can be used as the focus of the next exploration. The strong surface geoelectrochemical and soil geochemical anomalies above the fracture belt, with weak to moderate anomalies over thick transported cover above the fracture belt extension, suggest that dilatancy pumping is a dominant migration mechanism in the formation of anomalies in areas of shallow transported cover. © 2019","36","Zinc alloys","Binary alloys - Deposits - Extraction - Geochemistry - Lead zinc deposits - Mineralogy - Ores","Deep concealed ore bodies - Extraction method - Feasibility - Geochemical anomaly - Geochemical methods - Migration mechanisms - Pb-zn deposits - Yunnan province","481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: 2016YFC 0600603, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2017YFC0602604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); ","This study is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC 0600603 & 2017YFC0602604).

The Hg content of the composite samples of caps of the fruit bodies collected in the wild ranged from 0.48 to 1.78 mg kg−1dry matter and of stipes from 0.36 to 1.70 mg kg−1dry matter, whereas 0.37 and 0.25 mg kg−1dry matter were observed for farmed specimens. M. gigantea, because of a large biomass of the fruit bodies that emerge in a cluster, is an important food item in Yunnan, but knowledge on mineral composition and content of this species is largely absent.
