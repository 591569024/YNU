Although endophytic fungi and bacteria associated with rice have been investigated, little is known about the endophytic fungi of wild rice (Oryza granulate) in China. Here we studied the root endophytic mycobiota residing in roots of O. granulate by the use of an integrated approach consisting of microscopy, cultivation, ecological indices, and direct PCR. Microscopy confirmed the ubiquitousness of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) and sclerotium-like structures in root tissues. Isolations from 204 root segments from 15 wild rice plants yielded 58 isolates, for which 31 internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based genotypes were recorded. The best BLAST match indicated that 34.5% of all taxa encountered may represent hitherto undescribed species. Most of the fungi were isolated with a very low frequency. Calculation of ecological indices and estimation of taxon accumulation curves indicated a high diversity of fungal species. A culture-independent approach was also performed to analyze the endophytic fungal community. Three individual clone libraries were constructed. Using a threshold of 90% similarity, 35 potentially different sequences (phylotypes) were found among 186 positive clones. Phylogenetic analysis showed that frequently detected clones were classified as Basidiomycota, and 60.2% of total analyzed clones were affiliated with unknown taxa. Exopkiala, Cladopkialophora, Harpophora, Periconia macrospinosa, and the Ceratobasidium/Rhizoctonia complex may act as potential DSE groups. A comparison of the fungal communities characterized by the two approaches demonstrated distinctive fungal groups, and only a few taxa overlapped. Our findings indicate a complex and rich endophytic fungal consortium in wild rice roots, thus offering a potential bioresource for establishing a novel model of plant-fungal mutualistic interactions.

The orefield contains seven deposits: the Wandongshan, Hongnitang, Dashadi, Bijiashan, Weiganpo, Matouwan, and Bailiancun deposits. In this paper we report on the geochemistry and geochronology of porphyries associated with mineralization from the seven deposits. The results show that all the porphyries have similar geochemistry, with high alkalinity, high contents of SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Sr, high K2O/Na2O ratios, low MgO, Y, and Yb contents, enrichments in Ba, K, and Pb, depletions in P, Ti, Nb, and Ta, and non-evident to weak Eu depletions (δEu=0.42-0.99). In the SiO2vs. Th/Ce diagram, the porphyry samples are distributed in the area of thickened lower crust, and in the Sr/Y vs. Y and La/Yb vs. Yb diagrams, the porphyries broadly followed the batch-melting trend of amphibolite containing up to 10% garnet. LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating analysis suggests that the porphyries were emplaced between 34.62±0.25 and 36.72±0.25Ma. They were coeval with lamprophyres (34 to 36Ma) in the Beiya area and with potassic-ultrapotassic intrusive rocks (40 to 35Ma) within the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan magmatic belt, indicating possible genetic relation between these rock types. We suggest that the porphyries in the Beiya gold-polymetallic orefield were derived from the partial melting of a K-rich mafic source in the thickened lower crust, with the melting triggered by asthenospheric upwelling following the removal of lower lithospheric mantle. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","107","Gold deposits","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Binary alloys - Cerium compounds - Copper alloys - Deposits - Europium compounds - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Gold alloys - Lead alloys - Magnesia - Melting - Silica - Silicate minerals - Thorium compounds - Ytterbium - Zircon","Beiya - Genetic relations - Intrusive rocks - Lithospheric mantle - Partial melting - Potassic porphyry - Southwest China - Zircon U-Pb dating","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, PCA and CA showed that sun-dried and baked black teas could be clearly distinguished according to their volatile characteristics, which illustrated that drying methods have influences on aroma components of black tea.

Fossil diatom assemblages were investigated from an 11,000-year lake sediment core from a deep, alpine lake (Lugu Hu) in southwest China, an area strongly influenced by the southwest (or the Indian) summer monsoon. Changes in diatom assemblage composition, notably the abundance of the two dominant planktonic species, Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica and Cyclostephanos dubius, reflect the effects of climate variability on nutrient dynamics, mediated via thermal stratification (internal nutrient cycling) and catchment-vegetation processes. Statistical analyses of the climate–diatom interactions highlight the strong effect of changing orbitally-induced solar radiation during the Holocene, presumably via its effect on the lake's thermal budget. In a partial redundancy analysis, climate (solar insolation) and proxies reflecting catchment process (pollen percentages, C/N ratio) were the most important drivers of diatom ecological change, showing the strong effects of climate–catchment–vegetation interactions on lake functioning. This diatom record reflects long-term ontogeny of the lake-catchment ecosystem and suggests that climatic changes (both temperature and precipitation) impact lake ecology indirectly through shifts in thermal stratification and catchment nutrient exports. © 2016 University of Washington","","107","Climate change","Budget control - Catchments - Ecosystems - Lakes - Nutrients - Runoff - Solar radiation - Thermal stratification - Thermodynamic stability - Vegetation","Climate variability - Climatic changes - Ecological changes - Environmental change - Holocenes - Lake sediment cores - Nutrient dynamics - Redundancy analysis","442.1 Flood Control - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: NIGLAS2015QD05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: NIGLAS2012135004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2012CB956100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41272379, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We gratefully acknowledge Rong Wang for his helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Through chemical speciation analysis of Cd in the sediment,it is found that Cd in the sediments around mining area is shown mainly as reduced speciation,as well as oxidation, residues and extractable speciation from weak acid. The form of Cd in the sediments is charged by source of pollution. When the oxidized ore occurred as the main source of pollution, the quantities of extraction speciation from the weak acid and reduction are relatively high (more than 90 Yo of total metal); but when the primary ore appeared as the main source of pollution, the quantities of extraction state from the weak acid and reduction are relatively low (about 20% of total metal). Cd in the sediments of Bijiang river shown as extractable speciation from the weak acid accounted for a fairly large proportion (18.8% of total metal), which will easily discharge Cd and pollute water body, and then endanger the ecological environment of the downstream of the mine area.","","32","River pollution","Binary alloys - Cadmium - Chemical analysis - Chemical speciation - Extraction - Lead alloys - Lead zinc deposits - Ore reduction - Rivers - Sediments - Trace elements - Zinc alloys","Chemical forms - Ecological environments - Elemental speciation - Jinding Pb-Zn deposit - Mining activities - Mining areas - Non-essential trace elements - River sediments","453 Water Pollution - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This association suggests that the magmatic sulphide ores were subjected to hydrothermal alteration and subsequent redistribution, resulting in the observed textural features. Geochemically, the Baimazhai sulphide ores are enriched in Cu, Pd and Au, which, according to previous studies, reflects the action of hydrothermal fluids. Interestingly, Ar-Ar dating yielded the plateau ages of about 160-170 Ma, which are at odds with the established Permian age of the Emeishan large igneous province. We interpreted these younger ages as due to thermal resetting during post-Permian tectonothermal events. We have proposed a model in which tectonic movements and hydrothermal fluids related to these events modified the pre-existing magmatic sulphides. Given the degree of overprint, we suggested two possible scenarios: 1) the sulphide disseminations that surround the massive magmatic ores are the result of deformation and hydrothermal alteration; and 2) there were both magmatic massive and disseminated sulphides, in which case the scale and relocation of remobilization would have been smaller, but still detectable. © Science Press 2007.","","48","Geochemistry","Basalt - Deformation - Mineralogy - Tectonics - Trace elements","Amphibole - Biotite - Chlorite - Hydrothermal minerals - Sulphide hydrothermal remobilization","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Theoretical (THR)","Number: 2002GH11, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: UWA, Sponsor: University of Western Australia; Number: -, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank the staff members of the Baimazhai Nickel Mine for their generous support.

Massive magnetite is widespread in the Beiya ore district but its genesis is still the subject of debate. Five representative magnetite types are present in the Beiya deposit, namely magmatic magnetite (M1) from the ore-related porphyry, disseminated magnetite (M2) from the early retrograde alteration, massive magnetite (M3) from the early quartz-magnetite stage, massive magnetite (M4) from the middle quartz-magnetite stage and magnetite (M5) from the late quartz-magnetite stage. Compared with the M1 magnetite, the magnetites from stages M2 to M5 are depleted in Ti, Al and high field strength elements, implying a hydrothermal origin, distinct from the magmatic accessory magnetite in the ore-related porphyry (M1). The concentrations of cobalt in the hydrothermal magnetites decrease gradually from M2 to M5, and can be used to discriminate the magnetite types. The Al + Mn and Ti + V contents of the successively precipitated magnetite grains (M2–M5) suggests that the ore forming temperature decreased from M2 to M4, but increased from M4 to M5, possibly as the result of a new pulse of magma entering the chamber, which may have triggered the gold mineralization. The V content in the hydrothermal magnetite suggests that the oxygen fugacity increased from M2 to M4 but decreased as soon as the sulfides entered the system (M5). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","","52","Magnetite","Aluminum - Cobalt deposits - Deposits - Geochemistry - Gold deposits - Ores - Quartz - Sulfur compounds - Trace elements","Gold mineralization - High field strength elements - Hydrothermal magnetites - Metallogenic belt - Ore-forming process - Oxygen fugacity - Skarn - Trace element geochemistry","481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 541.1 Aluminum",,"Number: 200805580031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015M582457, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology, Croatia; Number: U1302233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40830425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41602067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41672071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40673045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40873034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1302233 , 41602067 , 41672071 , 40830425 , 40673045 , 40873034 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2015M582457 ), National Key Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2015CB452604 , 2009CB421006 ; Ministry of Science and Technology, China), Higher School Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program Funding Issue (Grant No. 200805580031 ), and the Project Supported by Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (Grant No. 2011 ).

This layered succession is formed of aragonite layers that are formed largely of 'fountain dendrites', calcite layers that are formed mostly of 'cone dendrites', and microlaminated layers that contain numerous microbes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Many of the aragonite crystals are hollow due to preferential dissolution of their cores. The calcite cone dendrites are commonly covered with biofilms, reticulate Si-Mg coatings, and other precipitates. The microbial layers include dodecahedral calcite crystals and accessory minerals that include opal-A, amorphous Si-Mg coatings, trona, barite, potassium sulfate crystals, mirabillite, and gaylussite. Interpretation of the δ18O(calcite)and δ18O(aragonite)indicates precipitation from water with a temperature of 54 to 66°C. The active hot spring at the top of the cliff presently ejects water at a temperature of 65°C.Layers, 1mm to 6cm thick, record temporal changes in the fluids from which the precipitates formed. This succession is not, however, formed of recurring cycles that can be linked to diurnal or seasonal changes in the local climate. Indeed, it appears that the climatic contrast between the wet season and the dry season had little impact on precipitation from the spring waters that flowed down the cliff face. Integration of currently available evidence suggests that the primary driving force was aperiodic changes in the CO2content of the spring waters because that seems to be the prime control on the saturation levels that underpinned precipitation of the calcite and aragonite as well as the dissolution of the aragonite. Such variations in the CO2content of the spring water were probably due to changes that took place in the subterranean plumbing system of the spring. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","","119","Carbonate minerals","Amorphous silicon - Calcite - Carbon dioxide - Coatings - Dissolution - Groundwater - Hot springs - Landforms - Magnesium compounds - Potash - Silicon compounds - Sulfate minerals","Accessory minerals - Aragonite - Aragonite crystals - China - Extracellular polymeric substances - Potassium sulfate - Preferential dissolution - Saturation levels","444.2 Groundwater - 481.1 Geology - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials",,"Number: SIDSSE1301, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 41272370, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41172309, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this research came from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (to Jones), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 41172309 and 41272370 to Peng) and the Frontier Project of the Chinese Academy of Science ( SIDSSE1301 to Peng).

The granodiorite magmatic intrusion and Cu polymetallic mineralization were related to oceanic subduction orogenesis in the Late Triassic, while the monzogranite magmatic intrusion and Mo polymetallic mineralization were mainly formed in the tectonic setting of continental-continental collisional orogeny in the Late Cretaceous. The study shows that the tectonic-magmatic-mineralization occurred from the subduction of oceanic crust in Late Triassic to the post-orogenic extension in Late Cretaceous, and the Late Triassic tectonic-magmatic activity was superimposed by the diagenesis and mineralization in Late Cretaceous. This provides a typical example for the study of compound superimposed diagenetic mineralization. © 2017, Science Press.

In this paper, the distribution of REY in different size and density fractions, their mode of occurrence, and the insight they provide on the sediment source region of the Reshuihe coal in southern China are studied. The results show that the physical separation method caused light-REY (LREY) to be enriched in the low-density and large-sized coal particles, whereas medium-REY (MREY) and heavy-REY (HREY) are enriched in small-sized and high-density fractions. In addition, LREY are more closely associated with organic matter, while MREY and HREY occur more often in aluminosilicate minerals. Moreover, the sediment source of the Reshuihe coal was mainly derived from the felsic–intermediate rocks at the top of the Emeishan basalt sequence. Further, REY in the feed coal are generally not enriched, though REY are enriched in density fractions of 1.4 kg/L. The combustion products of coal with a density of 1.4 kg/L obtained by gravity separation have a potential economic value as promising raw materials for REY. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","100","Coal combustion","Coal - Coal industry - Differentiation (calculus) - Fly ash - Organic minerals - Rare earth elements - Rare earths - Yttrium","Aluminosilicate minerals - Combustion products - Density fractions - Gravity separation - High-sulfur coals - Physical separation - Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) - Size- and density- fractions","524 Solid Fuels - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921.2 Calculus",,"Number: 2015XKZD07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 2018M632412, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 41802182, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015XKZD07), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41802182), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (2018M632412).

The87Sr/86Sr ratios of potash bulk samples suggest that both bedded and veined potash orebodies of the MPD have been affected by igneous activity resulting from decompression melting of a metasomatically altered, depleted mantle from 16 Ma to present. The Rb-Sr isotopic systematics of the potash bulk samples define several apparent “isochrons” ranging from 0.609 ± 0.026 to 14.23 ± 0.63 Ma, with the maximum age being consistent with previous K-Ar ages of the K-bearing minerals from the MPD. Such isotopic signatures imply that the MPD may have been affected by multiple-stage fluid flow events since the mid-Miocene, consisting of hydrothermal fluids, continental fresh water, and/or hot spring water. It is very likely that the MPD is still affected by fluid flow-events in modern times. The mineral assemblage of halite + sylvite with minor amounts of carnallite was formed due to the recrystallization and diagenetic modification by hydrothermal fluids. Some characteristics of halite photomicrographs and inclusions and the lack of original halite chevron patterns are also supportive of the hypothesis that the deposit has undergone a diagenetic modification and dissolution–recrystallization processes. © 2017","","52","Strontium alloys","Binary alloys - Chloride minerals - Deposits - Flow of fluids - Groundwater - Hot springs - Isotopes - Ore deposits - Potash - Potash deposits - Recrystallization (metallurgy) - Rubidium alloys - Sodium chloride","Decompression melting - Hydrothermal fluids - Igneous activity - Isotopic signatures - Isotopic systematics - Mineral assemblage - Multi stage - Recrystallization process","444.2 Groundwater - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 482.2 Minerals - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 531.1 Metallurgy - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 2011CB403007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41572067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41502080, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Key Project for Basic Research of China (No. 2011CB403007), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41502080, 41572067).

The metallogenic environment and change process directly dictate the migration, enrichment, and precipitation of Mn. To better understand its metallogenetic environment, a detailed study was undertaken involving field observation, mineralogical and geochemical and Mössbauer spectroscopic analyses. The major findings are as follows: (1) Lithofacies paleogeography, sedimentary structural characteristics, and geochemical indexes indicate that the deposits were formed in an epicontinental marine sedimentary basin environment of normal salinity; (2) there were three ore phases including Mn oxides, Mn carbonates, and mixed Mn ores. The ore minerals found were braunite, manganite, Ca-rhodochrosite, manganocalcite, and kutnahorite. Petrographic and mineralogical information indicates that the metallogenic environment was a weakly alkaline and weakly oxidized to weakly reduced environment, and the mineralization occurred near the redox interface; (3) the V/(V + Ni) ratios, δCe and Fe2+/Fe3+ found in profiles of Baigu and Gake ore sections show that the redox conditions of the ore-forming environment were continuously changing; and (4) three Fe species, α-Fe2O3, para-Fe3+, and para-Fe2+, were found in hematite and clay mineral samples using Mössbauer spectrum analysis. The presence and distribution of these Fe species indicate that the deposit was formed in a typical sedimentary environment during the mineralization process. In summary, our study showed that redox was a key factor controlling the mineralization of the Dounan manganese deposit. Our results have led us to the conclusion that transgression and regression caused fluctuations in sea level, which in turn caused the change of the redox environment. Mössbauer spectroscopy is an effective tool for studying the redox conditions of the paleoenvironment in which sedimentary manganese deposits were formed. © 2018, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","51","Ores","Deposits - Geochemistry - Hematite - Iron - Manganese deposits - Manganites - Mineralogy - Ore analysis - Sea level - Sedimentology - Spectroscopic analysis - Spectrum analysis","Field observations - Marine sedimentary basin - Metallogenetic environment - Mineralization process - Sedimentary environment - Ssbauer spectroscopies - Structural characteristics - Transgression and regression",,,"Number: SKLODG-ZY125-08, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41376080, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Engineer Li Chao (Yunnan Wenshan Dounan Manganese Industry Co., Ltd.) for his help toward collecting field geological samples, and Professor Zheng Guodong (Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources Research, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for testing and analyzing these samples.

It formed during the opening and closing of the Tethys Ocean. This basin is also known as a 'metal belt' as it hosts several metal deposits, besides, the Mengye potash deposit. However, the exact dates of the formation either in the Paleocene or the Cretaceous, and thus the origins of the marine, continental or mixed origins of the Mengye deposits, remain disputed. Based on the basin's evolution, materials of marine origin and/or remnant seawater should be present, but instead the salt layers of the Mengye potash deposit present typically continental lithological features. This study examines and reviews evaporative minerals, Br/Cl and I/Cl molar ratios, and isotopes of S, B, and Sr.I and I/Cl data for this area has not been previously reported. The basin's evaporative minerals are dominated by halite and sylvite. The amounts of anhydrite, chlorocalcite, langbeinite, glaserite, tachyhydrite and glauberite are small. All of these form in both marine and continental environments. The values of I and the I/Cl molar ratios of halite and sylvite are from 0.07 to 0.27ppm, and from 0.03 to 0.11×10-6, respectively, dependent on organic substances. Br and molar Br/Cl values are from 89.08 to 555.45ppm and from 0.06×10-3to 0.38×10-3, respectively. All of the Br/Cl molar ratios are lower than those of seawater, and most of them are 34S, δ11B and87Sr/86Sr values for evaporative minerals indicate a continental origin for the Mengye potash deposit. However, materials of hydrothermal origin are widely distributed in the basin and may have played an active role for the formation of the potash deposit. Thus the Mengye potash deposit could be of continental origin, with a remnant seawater trace. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","111","Deposits","Chloride minerals - Isotopes - Lithology - Potash - Potash deposits - Potassium chloride - Seawater - Sodium chloride","Boron isotopes - Continental environments - Continental margin - Continental origin - Lithological features - Organic substances - Strontium isotopes - Sulfur isotope","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: XDB03020400, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2013CB956401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011CB403006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41271100, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2011CB403006 ; 2013CB956401 ), the "Strategic Priority Research Program" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( XDB03020400 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41271100 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The geological phenomena of motion and deformation caused by the motion of the active fault and the sub-block have attracted the attention of researchers in this field. Based on past research achievements, we constructed the 3-dimension finite element model of Simao-Puer region containing the active fault. Applying the velocity of block per year measured by GPS data and the researches on geology and geomorphology as the boundary conditions of the finite element model, we then computed the spatial distribution of deformation in the Simao-Puer region and simulated the deformation displacement along the NEE and NNW direction. Lastly, we analyzed the characteristic of the horizontal and vertical displacement field in the Simao-Puer region. The numerical result shows that extension motion of the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau makes the movement of slump due to gravity. In the research area, the motion of fault with NEE strike draws the fault having NNW strike to move in a conjugate direction. The vertical deformation caused by the uplifting movement is consistent with the result of 60 years of larger regional standard measure and the deformation along the NNW direction distributed irregularly, which is possibly made by regional stress accumulation and readjustment after the earthquake. The deformation field along the NEE direction is larger in the west of Simao-Puer region than in the eastern part, especially the northwest part of the region corresponding to the 6.6 Jinggu earthquake that occurred recently. Lastly, we preliminarily analyzed the dynamic problems in the research area. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","18","Finite element method","Deformation - Earthquakes - Faulting - Risk analysis - Risk assessment","Conjugate directions - Deformation displacements - Horizontal and vertical displacement - Motion and deformations - Research achievements - Stress accumulation - Strong earthquakes - Vertical deformation","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Located in an area of several complex and intersecting tectonic units, the Ailaoshan poly-metallic MCA is controlled by deep crustal and mantle tectonism. Through interpretation of remote sensing images, we identified a largering structure system that surrounds the MCA. This ring structure encloses regional deep-crustal faults, ductile shear zones, geothermal anomalies, magmatic rocks, and the major mineral deposits, all of which are the reflections of deep tectonic geodynamics that have been long active in this area. Geophysical data indicate that the crust is comprised of relatively stable two or three layers, with some irregular lower-velocity belts. The Moho in the ring sutures occurs as an area of local uplift. There exists an obvious transitional zone between the crust and mantle boundaries. Asthenopheric mantle shows multi-layer upwelling, which indicates multiple events during different geological epochs. It is believed that these mantle events or pulses were responsible for the formation of the regional shear zones, magmatic rocks, and polymetallic orebodies. Furthermore, an integrated metallogenic dynamics model related to the asthenopheric upwelling pulses in the MCA is established, defining events as old as Late Paleozoic. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","","96","Mineralogy","Deposits - Geodynamics - Metals - Minerals - Ore deposits - Remote sensing - Tectonics","Ailaoshan - Asthenophere upwelling - Low velocities - Polymetallic - Pulsing - Ring structures","481.1 Geology - 481.3 Geophysics - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals",,"Number: 2006BAB01B10, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); ","Received September 21, 2008; January 22, 2009 doi: 10.1007/s11430-009-0136-6 &dagger;Corresponding author (email: geliangsheng@yahoo.com.cn) Supported by National Key Technology R & D Program (Grant No. 2006BAB01B10) and National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2009CB421000)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, to date, little documentation exists illustrating an interdisciplinary approach to management of wild mushrooms. Moreover, the empirical case studies necessary for developing applicable and practical methods are even more rare. This paper adopted an interdisciplinary approach combining participatory methods to improve the habitat management of Thelephora ganbajun, an endemic and one of the most economically valuable mushroom species in Southwest China. The paper documents an empirical case of how an interdisciplinary approach facilitated the development of a scientific basis for policy and management practice, and built the local capacity to create, adopt and sustain the new rules and techniques of mushroom management. With this integrative perspective, a sustainable management strategy was developed, which was found not only technically feasible for farmers, but also acceptable to the government from an ecological and policy-related perspective. More importantly, this approach has greatly contributed to raising the income of farmers. The paper highlights how the integration of biophysical and socioeconomic factors and different knowledge systems provided a holistic perspective to problem diagnosis and resolution, which helped to cope with conventional scientific dilemmas. Finally, it concludes that the success of this interdisciplinary approach is significant in the context of policy decentralization and reform for incorporating indigenous knowledge and local participation in forest management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","44","Management","Forestry - Fungi - Natural resources management - Research","Indigenous knowledge - Interdisciplinary research - Natural resource management - Non-timber forest products - Participatory action research","444 Water Resources - 454 Environmental Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 821.0 Woodlands and Forestry - 901.3 Engineering Research - 912.2 Management",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

These rocks provide possibility for better understanding the tectonic setting of the SW margin of the Yangtze Block in South China, however, their formation time, petrogenesis and tectonic implications are poorly documented so far. The petrological, geochemical and zircon U-Pb geochronological data for the plagioclase amphibolites in the Ailaoshan Complex are reported in this paper. Geochemical analyses show that the amphibolites have SiO2contents ranging from 46.85% to 49.03% and with relatively high FeOt(11.56%~13.09%), MgO (6.83%~ 11.57%) and TiO2contents (1.71%~2.22%), K2O+Na2O vary from 1.61% to 2.26% with Na2O/K2O ratios of 1.88~9.25. The rocks are characterized by enriched LREE ((La/Yb)N=6.55~7.52) and Nb (Nb=14.28~18.43 μg/g). On primitive mantle-normalized trace element diagrams, the rocks show no obvious Nb and Ta anomalies and significant Sr-P depletion, displaying geochemical characteristics similar to those of the Yunkai (South China) back-arc basin basalt. Zircon U-Pb dating of the amphibolite vields a mean age of 814±12 Ma. In conjunction with other geological observations, it is proposed that there was an Early Neoproterozoic (~814 Ma) arc-back-arc setting along the Ailaoshan zone in the SW margin of the Yangtze Block.","","90","Phosphorus compounds","Analytical geochemistry - Binary alloys - Feldspar - Geochronology - Iron compounds - Lead alloys - Magnesia - Niobium - Petrology - Rocks - Silica - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Strontium compounds - Structural geology - Tectonics - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Amphibolite - Back-arc basin - Back-arc basin basalts - Geochemical characteristic - Neoproterozoic - Proterozoic basement - Tectonic implications - U-Pb geochronology","481.1 Geology - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The deposited naphthalene particles migrating along with the current gas flow will inevitably result in pipe blockage or damage to devices. In order to study the migration law of the deposited naphthalene particles in gas line pipes, we took the urban gas pipeline in Kunming as an example, adopted the RSM turbulence model and the DPM model of the Fluent software to simulate and analyze the migration law of the deposited naphthalene particles in horizontal straight pipes, horizontal bend pipes and tee pipes. And the influence of the deposited naphthalene particle size, inlet velocity, temperature and pressure on the migration of deposited naphthalene particles under different pipe diameters, curvature ratios and pipe diameter ratios were analyzed respectively. The results show that: (1) The migration rates of deposited naphthalene particles in the above three types of pipes are negatively correlated with the size of the deposited naphthalene particles, and are positively correlated with pressure and inlet velocity; (2) With the increase of temperature, the migration rate of naphthalene particles in the above three types of pipes decreases first and then increases; (3) The migration rate of naphthalene particles deposited in gas line pipes is most affected by the inlet velocity of gas flow, then by temperature and least by pressure. (4) The migration rate of naphthalene particles is positively correlated with the ratio of horizontal straight pipe diameter and tee pipe diameter, and negatively correlated with the ratio of horizontal bend pipe diameter.

Combined with geochronology, the heavy metal spatio-temporal characteristics, the status relative to the pre-industrial levels, and potential ecological risk of the pollution were evaluated by the surface and core sediments from Lake Yangzonghai. The results showed that metal contents exhibited obviously spatial variations in the surface sediments. Contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were generally higher in the middle-east lake area than those in other areas. In contrast, contents of Cr, Co and Ni showed higher values in the south lake area. Contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the core sediment had increased gradually since the mid-1990s and reached the maximum values around the year of 2009-2010, followed by a gradual decline in recent years. Contents of Cr, Co and Ni showed similar temporal variations to the trends of detrital metals (such as Al and Fe), and they decreased generally in recent hundred years. As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in sediments of Lake Yangzonghai were contaminated as indicated by the enrichment coefficients, showing that metal contaminations began at the mid-1990s and reached the maximum values around the year of 2009-2010, but it declined gradually in recent years with the implementation of industrial discharge control. In the surface sediments, Cu was at unpolluted to minimal contamination levels, while Zn and Pb displayed minimal to moderate contamination levels. Metal As had moderate to strong contamination levels, and Cd showed minimal to strong contamination levels. The pollution levels of the metals in the eastern lake were higher than those in other lake areas, these are because of a relatively rare runoff, low deposition of detrital materials and high anthropogenic/detrital metal sedimentation. The metals in sediment of Lake Yangzonghai may pose a medium to strong potential ecological risk when compared with a historical pollution peak around 2002-2010. The main contribution factors were Cd and As. Potential eco-risks of the metals decreased in recent years and reduced to the low level except in the east lake area, where the metals may be of a moderate potential ecological risk. © 2017 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","","45","Lake pollution","Contamination - Geochronology - Heavy metals - Lakes - Pollution - Sedimentation - Sediments - Surficial sediments","Contamination levels - Enrichment coefficients - Heavy metal pollution - Industrial discharges - Metal contamination - Potential ecological risk - Pre-industrial levels - Spatiotemporal characteristics","453 Water Pollution - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

According to the P-T conditions and mineral assemblage characteristics, the enclaves are grouped into three types: type- I , garnet diopsidite, formed at lower crust or in the transitional section between the mantle and the crust with the metamorphic condition P = (10.47 - 11.51) × 108 Pa and T = 771 - 932°C ; type-II garnet- and diopside-bearing amphibolite, formed at the depth of middle to lower crust with the metamorphic condition: P = (6-10) × 108 Pa and T = 780 - 830°C ; type-III, metamorphosed gabbro, formed at relatively higher levels than the above 2 types with lower metamorphic condition. Type- I and type- II enclaves had experienced a decompressional retrograde metamorphism caused by tectonic elevation associated with the metasomatism of SiO2, Na2 O-rich fluid phase with the new equilibrated temperature at T = 761 - 778°C. Geochemical evidence indicates that both deep-derived mafic enclaves and host rocks have similar EMII properties, which are related to the involvement of subducted materials.

The orebodies are hosted in low-grade metamorphic rocks and skarn in contact with Cenozoic granitic rocks. Studies on fluid inclusions (FIs) of the deposit indicate that the ore-forming fluids are CO2-bearing, NaCl-H2O. The initial fluids evolved from high temperatures (462–498 °C) and high salinities (54.5–58.4 wt% NaCl equiv) during the skarn stage into mesothermal (260–397 °C) and low salinities (1.2–9.5 wt% NaCl equiv) during the sulfide stage. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (δ18OH2O: 2.7–8.8‰; δD: −82 to −120‰) suggest that the ore-forming fluids are mixture of magmatic fluids and meteoric water. Sulfur isotopic compositions of the sulfides yield δ34S values of −2.3 to 3.2‰; lead isotopic compositions of ore sulfides are similar to those of granitic rocks, indicating that the sulfur and ore-metals are derived from the granitic magma. We propose that the Cangyuan Pb-Zn-Ag deposit formed from magmatic hydrothermal fluids. These Cenozoic deposits situated in the west of Lanping-Changdu Basin share many similarities with the Cangyuan in isotopic compositions, including the Laochang, Lanuoma and Jinman deposits.

In April and September of 2017, field surveys were conducted in the five debris flow gullies (i.e., the Diaoga Creek, the Jiangjia Creek, the Lanniping Creek, the Qingshui Creek, and the Taojiaxiaohe Creek) and the Xiaojiang River. The purpose of this study is to understand fluvial geomorphological feature, water environment, and macroinvertebrate communities in the five debris flow gullies and the Xiaojiang River, to analyze the differences in macroinvertebrate communities among debris flow gullies with different riverbed structures, and to reveal the responses of macroinvertebrates to the fluvial geomorphological parameter (degree of concavity-convexity) reflecting the development degree of riverbed structure. A total of 70 taxa of macroinvertebrates were identified, belonging to 4 phyla, 6 classes, 38 families and 69 genera. With regard to the taxonomic groups, arthropods were dominant in the species richness, density, and biomass of macroinvertebrates in the five debris flow gullies and the Xiaojiang River, accounting for 78.0%-92.5%, 98.7%-100.0% and 65.0%-100.0% of the total richness, densities, and biomass, respectively. With regard to the functional feeding groups, collector-gatherers were all dominated in the five debris flow gullies and the Xiaojiang River, accounting for 74.3%-96.3% of the total densities. Regression analyses showed that the species number, density, and biomass of macroinvertebrates were all positively correlated with the fluvial geomorphological parameter (degree of concavity-convexity) of the five debris flow gullies.

The ETM+ image of Kunming Dianchi Lake Basin and 1:50000 geographical maps had been used to compare different correction methods. The results showed that: (1) The correction errors were more than one pixel and some of them were several pixels when the polynomial model was used. The correction accuracy was not stable when the Delaunay model was used. The correction errors were less than one pixel when the collinearity equation was used. (2) 6, 9, 25 and 35 GCP were selected randomly for geometric correction using the polynomial correction model respectively, the best result was obtained when 25 GCPs were used. (3) The contrast ratio of image corrected by using nearest neighbor and the best resampling rate was compared to that of using the cubic convolution and bilinear model. But the continuity of pixel gravy value was not very good. The contrast of image corrected was the worst and the computation time was the longest by using the cubic convolution method. According to the above results, the result was the best by using bilinear to resample. © 2010 SPIE.","","5","Pixels","Convolution - Geometry - Remote sensing - Rock mechanics - Virtual reality","Accuracy - Collinearity equations - Dianchi Lake basins - Experimental comparison - Geometric correction - Ground control points - Polynomial modeling - Remote sensing technology","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921 Mathematics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The average Pb and Zn grades of its 200 Mt ore reserve are 5 and 10 wt%, respectively. The Pb -Zn ore bodies mainly distributed as stratoid or vein-type within the Sinian to Permian carbonate rocks, suggesting a typical epigenetic Pb -Zn mineralization. In this study, isotope data of S and Pb sulfides from 21 deposits were compiled to reveal the source of ore-forming materials, and provide guidance for further prospecting. The δ34S values of most sulfide minerals range from +9.0‰ to +28.6‰, similar to the Sinian-to-Permian seawater sulfate (+8.0‰ to +38.7‰). It suggests that S in sulfides mainly came from thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) of the host-strata seawater sulfate. In addition, thermal decomposition of sulfur-bearing organic matter could provide part of reduced sulfur in mineralization in some Pb -Zn deposits. The Pb isotopic compositions of sulfides in the research area indicate four possible Pb sources: (1) Pb of the Tangjia deposit originated mainly from the basement rocks; (2) Pb in the Jinshachang, Lemachang and Lehong deposits mainly came from basement rocks containing radiogenic Pb isotopes and cap rock organic-rich sediments; (3) Pb of the Huize, Tianbaoshan, Maozu, Yinchanggou, Daliangzi, Yunluhe, Maoping, Fule, Shanshulin and Tianqiao deposits originated primarily from basement rocks and ore-forming fluid of multiple metal-bearing brine mixing in the cap stratum, and partly from Permian Emeishan basalt; (4) Pb of the Qingshan, Chipu, Yinchangpo, Shaojiwan and Banbanqiao deposits mainly came from sedimentary rocks, and partly from basement rocks. The multiple S-Pb isotope composition in typical Pb -Zn deposits is indicative of mixed origin for ore-forming materials in the metallogenic province. © 2018, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

Then, we take advantage of waveform cross-correlations to obtain precise time difference data and apply the double-difference method to relocate the aftershocks between October 7 and December 31. We relocate 2076 earthquakes (approximately 73.6% of the total) with an average horizontal accuracy of approximately 150 m and a depth uncertainty of approximately 700 m. The Ms 6.6 mainshock epicenter originated at 23.378°N, 100.475°E at a depth of 15.38 km. The Jinggu earthquake sequence exhibited a linearly concentrated distribution in the northwest–southeast direction with obvious segmentation features and, thus, it can be divided into four branches spatially and two stages temporally. The aftershocks first appeared around the Ms 6.6 mainshock and then extended on either side of the mainshock along the NW–SE direction (the NW branch). The earthquake rupture direction experienced a slight clockwise deflection at the NW end and rotated clockwise by approximately 90° toward the SW (the NE branch) at the SE end. Then, the rupture propagated a short distance along the SW direction and rotated counterclockwise by approximately 90° into an SSE direction (the NNW branch). There is a small angle between the NW and NNW branches. The depths of the whole sequence with vertical dip angles were shallower toward the NW and deeper with two seismogenic layers toward the SE. According to the distributions of the earthquakes and nearby fractures, it is highly possible that the Jinggu earthquake sequence occurred along a hidden fracture section of the Wuliangshan fault in the NW direction. Moreover, we can confirm that the three large earthquakes all occurred along right-lateral strike-slip faults. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","","51","Earthquake effects","Clocks - Strike-slip faults","Double differences - Earthquake rupture - Earthquake sequences - Focal mechanism - Right lateral strike slip fault - Seismogenic layers - Seismogenic structures - Waveform cross correlation","484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments",,"Number: 2017CESE0101, Acronym: CEA, Sponsor: China Earthquake Administration; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41704066, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41474049, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41661164035, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Sidao Ni of the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The landslide deposited entirely on the valley floor, and the landslide dam was eventually converted to a hydraulic structure for a permanent disposal. Despite the importance of material compositions to the slope stability and internal stability of a landslide dam, it was practically not viable and costly to explore the deeply buried materials in field. A 2D discrete element modeling (PFC2D code) was performed in this study to investigate the kinematic behavior of the Hongshiyan landslide. The study aims to provide insights into the material compositions of the landslide dam for future stability evaluations. The simulation results showed that for the landslide sitting in a deep V-shaped valley with constrained movement and steep slip surface gradient, the kinematic behavior was more sensitive to the bond strength (strength of intact rock mass) than the residual friction coefficient (residual friction of detached rock mass). The simulation results also suggested that the rock blocks were scarcely decomposed during sliding, as the material compositions of the landslide dam was primarily controlled by the development of joints and fissures prior to the failure. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","67","Landslides","Dams - Earthquakes - Finite difference method - Friction - Kinematics - Rock mechanics - Rocks","Constrained movement - Discrete element modeling - Earthquake-triggered landslides - Internal stability - Kinematic behaviors - Landslide dam - Material compositions - Stability evaluation","441.1 Dams - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 484 Seismology - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics",,"Number: SKL2018ZY09, Acronym: SKL-WAC, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin; Number: 2017YFC0404803, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41571012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grants 2018YFC1505004 and 2017YFC0404803), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41571012), and State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (SKL2018ZY09).

Compared with the CK, yield and output value of replanted flue-cured tobacco after 5 year continuous cropping decreased by 35.0% and 47.6%, respectively. Research of rhizosphere micro-ecology showed that resistance-related enzymes activity in rhizosphere soil, including soil polyphenol oxidase, catalase, peroxidase, dehydrogenase, followed the order: 2 years continuous cropping >5 years continuous cropping >CK., It indicated that phenols, peroxides, and other harmful substances were rich in continuous cropping soil, which stimulated the activity of such enzymes. BIOLOG analysis showed that 2 years continuous cropping and 5 years continuous cropping treatment were beneficial for growth of microflora feeding on phenolic acids as carbon source, which also indicated that soil phenolic substances enriched and pathogenic microorganisms increased under continuous cropping soil. In summary, as continuous cropping years increased, toxic substances were enriched and pathogenic microorganisms were increased, thereby causing continuous monoculture problems which further lead to yield reduction and quality deterioration. ©, 2015, State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and China Tobacco Society.

Ore bodies of the Luping deposit are mainly stratiform type, host in the Middle Triassic Beiya Formation limestone and Lower Triassic Qingtianbao Formation sandstone, and occur along NNW-trending bedding-plane faults within axis of Beiya-Qinghe syncline. Three ore types, namely the Pb-Au sulfide, Fe-Au, and Au ores, can be discerned regarding their ore metal association with reserves of 2.7million tonnes (Mt) (average grade: 3.06wt.% Pb, 0.66g/t Au, 41g/t Ag, and 0.82wt.% Zn), 3Mt (average grade: 30wt.% Fe, 0.96g/t Au and 31g/t Ag), and 0.67Mt (average grade: 2.16g/t Au and 13g/t Ag), respectively. Pb-Au sulfide ores contain mainly galena, siderite, native gold, sphalerite, and pyrite, with minor chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite, and gangue minerals such as quartz, calcite and dolomite. Sulfide ore textures include mainly brecciated, banded and vein, and minor massive and disseminated. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of alkali-rich quartz syenite porphyry from drill holes yielded a Late Eocene (Priabonian) age (36.2±0.4Ma), broadly coeval to the zircon U-Pb ages (ca. 38Ma-31Ma) of alkaline porphyries and molybdenite Re-Os age (36.9±0.3Ma) from the Beiya deposit near Luping. Calcite separates have δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values ranging from -5.8‰ to -5.1‰ (average: -5.6‰) and +13.2‰ to +14.7‰ (mean: +13.6‰), respectively, suggesting association with the mantle. The sulfides have a narrow range of δ34SCDT values (+0.8‰-+2.8‰, mean +1.8‰), which is similar to that of mantle-derived S (0±3‰). 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values of the sulfides range from 18.62 to 18.69, 15.66 to 15.70 and 38.92 to 39.08, respectively, similar to those of the porphyry whole-rock (206Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=18.61-18.71, 207Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=15.64-15.77 and 208Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=38.88-39.32). Ore deposit geology and C-O-S-Pb isotopic data suggest that the sources of metals and ore-forming fluids were likely to be derived from the alkali-rich porphyries in the Beiya area. We propose that the Luping deposit is best classified as an epithermal Pb polymetallic deposit associated with the Beiya alkaline porphyries (ca. 36Ma-31Ma). Similar to other deposits related to the Cenozoic alkaline porphyries in the Jinshajiang-Red River (Ailaoshan) metallogenic belt, the Luping deposit may have been formed in the India-Eurasia post-collisional setting, when partial melting occurred in the Triassic stagnant slab that thickened the lower crust and the upper mantle, producing the alkaline magmatism and its associated mineralization. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","65","Ore deposit geology","Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper compounds - Deposits - Economic geology - Exploratory geochemistry - Geochronology - Gold compounds - Gold deposits - Iron alloys - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead deposits - Lime - Osmium alloys - Pyrites - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Silver alloys - Sulfur compounds - Tectonics - Zinc sulfide - Zircon","Alkaline porphyry - Pb isotopes - Polymetallic - Southwest China - Zircon U-Pb age","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: SKLODG-ZY125-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2014CB440905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41163001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research is jointly supported by the 12th Five-Year Plan Project of State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. SKLODG-ZY125-02 ), the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB440905 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41163001 and 41402072 ).

Skarn and orebodies occur mainly between the different units of the Upper Triassic Qugasi Formation or within altered limestone adjacent to Late Cretaceous intrusions (78-76 Ma). Three main paragenetic stages of skarn formation and ore deposition have been recognized on the basis of petrographic observations: (1) pre-ore-stage hornfels with diopside (Di87-72Hd12-7), small-scale endoskarn with reddish grossular (Adr22-57Gr78-43), diopside (Di83-92Hd7-15), vesuvianite, and abundant exoskarn with red-brown andradite (Adr75-98Gr2-22), sahlite (Di28-41Hd58-71), and wollastonite; (2) syn-ore-stage retrograde minerals, sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, molybdenite, galena, and sphalerite), quartz, and calcite; and (3) post-ore-stage calcite veins. Sulfur isotope values of sulfides are relatively high, with an average δ34S = 4.9% (n = 40), suggesting that the ore-forming fluid was magmatic and that the sulfides precipitated from a relatively reducing ore fluid. The coexistence of silicate melt and primary fluid inclusions in quartz phenocrysts of the mineralizationrelated quartz monzonite porphyry indicates the simultaneous entrapment of fluid and melt, and records the process of the aqueous fluid exsolving from the crystallizing melt. The initial single-phase fluid has a salinity of 8.8 to 12.7 wt % NaCl equiv and homogenization temperatures of 566° to 650°C, corresponding to pressures of 680 to 940 bar and lithostatic depth of 2.5 to 3.5 km. The primary fluid inclusions in the pre-ore-stage garnet and pyroxene composed of coeval vapor-rich (V type) and halite-bearing (S-I and S-II types containing sylvite) inclusions (32->79 total wt % salts) share similar homogenization temperatures (450°-550°C), indicative of the occurrence of fluid unmixing under lithostatic pressures of ∼550 to 780 bar (>2.0-km depth). Primary fluid inclusions trapped in syn-ore quartz, calcite, and epidote show the common development of S-type inclusions (∼37.3 wt % NaCl equiv) with coexisting V-type, liquid-rich (L type), and CO2-bearing (C-I type) inclusions, all of which have homogenization temperatures of 300° to 400°C and trapping pressures of 100 to 400 bar (∼1.5-km depth). Brine inclusions homogenized by halite dissolution after vapor disappearance in both the pre- and syn-ore stages are interpreted to have been trapped under overpressured conditions (>1,520 bar). Oxygen isotope analyses were conducted on garnet, wollastonite, epidote, quartz, and calcite. The pre-orestage garnet and wollastonite have δ18Ofluidvalues of 5.6 to 8.1%, whereas the syn-ore-stage epidote, quartz, and calcite have more variable δ18Ofluidvalues in the range of 3.9 to 17.5%. The δ18Ofluidvalues of the postore-stage vein calcite (15.2-21.3%) are much higher than both the pre- and syn-ore stages.

Although the government has recently increased financial support for rural areas, and the policy guidelines have been steadily tilting toward rural areas, especially poor rural areas, rural poverty is still difficult to resolve. In order to reasonably determine the optimal layout direction of rural settlements in poor mountainous areas, and put forward some scientific guidance in the rural land remediation and new rural construction in mountainous areas, this paper took Xundian Hui and Yi Autonomous County, a former national poverty-stricken county that was out of poverty in 2018, as a research area, and used the methods of remote sensing interpretation, GIS analysis, landscape shape index model, buffer analysis, Kernel density estimation and Getis-Ord Gi* to study the evolution characteristics and influencing factors of rural settlements in Xundian County from 2001 to 2017 in terms of space, scale and form. The research results showed that: 1) During 2001-2017, there were some changes in the scale, density, shape and spatial distribution of rural settlements in Xundian County. The main changes were as follows: from 2001 to 2017, the overall scale of rural settlements had expanded significantly, the landscape shape tended to be regular, and the average patch size increased; the characteristics of rural settlements clustering in areas with superior terrain were becoming more and more obvious. The analysis results of kernel density and Getis-Ord Gi* showed that the spatial divergence characteristics of rural settlements patch scales were apparent, and the distribution patterns were gradually expanding from small-scale decentralization to large-scale clustering; 2) The natural geographical factors such as geological and topographical conditions were the basic factors that influencing the distribution pattern of rural settlements in mountainous areas. The basic pattern of spatial distribution of rural settlements in mountainous areas is the result of long-term adaptation to topographic and geomorphological conditions; 3) Socio-economic factors, location factors and policy factors were the important factors influencing the change of spatial distribution. As the urban-rural income gap increased, the rural population of Xundian County flew to urban areas, so rural settlements were more concentrated in urban areas; the results of the neighborhood analysis of towns and roads also indicated that rural settlements tended to be concentrated in the distribution of towns and roads. In addition, the precise poverty alleviation policy with relocation as the main means was another major factor leading to the concentration of rural settlements in the plain areas with superior terrain conditions. According to the study, for mountainous rural areas with scarce natural resources, the poverty alleviation in mountainous areas should rely mainly on industrial assistance rather than policy assistance in the future. The local government should focus on increasing the employment opportunities of farmers and improving the livelihood conditions of farmers. Only in this way can we really help the poor and achieve the rural revitalization. This study can provide a practical guidance for the poverty alleviation work in the rural areas of the southwestern frontiers with frequent geological disasters; also provide a scientific theoretical basis for the optimization of the spatial layout of rural settlements. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Lithofacies are rock types and assemblages formed in a certain sedimentary environment, and are important parameters in formation evaluation. The lithofacies classification of fine-grained sedimentary rocks is an important basis for the study of hydrocarbon source rocks, shale oil and gas and tight oil reservoirs. Anchored in the previous studies, the lithofacies classification scheme of fine grained sedimentary rocks in study area based on mineral composition was established in this paper. The results prove that the main lithofacies of Qiongzhusi formation in study area are mainly felsic clay rocks and clayey felsic fine-grained sedimentary rocks, and a small number of which are dolostone, limestone, felsic fine-grained sedimentary rocks, dolomitic felsic fine-grained sedimentary rocks, clayey felsic fine-grained sedimentary rocks, felsic dolostone, and dolomitic mixed fine-grained sedimentary rocks.

The alteration zones in the deposit transit upward and outward from early potassium-silicate, through quartz-sericite, to later propylitization. The wallrock near the porphyry stock was mostly changed into hornfels. The former two alterations host the main orebodies, constituting the core of mineralized zone; the later two alterations only develop weak mineralization surrounding the core. In this paper, various fractal indices, including the exponent of lacunarity, multifractal spectrum, correlation dimension and Hurst exponent, are applied to characterize the Cu spatial distribution in 114 drillcores in the Pulang ore deposit, with the aim to correlate the element spatial pattern with its dynamic drive. Compared to fractal indices in the propylitic zone and hornfels, the exponents of lacunarity in the potassium-silicate and quartz-sericite zones exhibit lower and more stable values, the correlation dimensions are higher and more consistent; yet the values of height difference of multifractal spectrum are lower and largely varied, and the Hurst exponents show little difference. Variations of the former three indices suggest that the core of mineralized zone has more homogeneity, stronger compactness of high concentrations, and greater proportion of high concentrations in the Cu distribution compared to the other parts of the deposit. More importantly, the correlation dimension, indicating the complexity of controls underpinning the system, is closely correlated to the exponent of lacunarity, which represents the homogeneity of spatial pattern. This correlation between those two indices implies a genetic link, that is to say the greater complexity of controls results in a more homogeneous spatial distribution of Cu in the porphyry deposit. The stability of the two indices is considered to reflect the development of thick orebody, providing a new perspective to understand the genesis of porphyry ore deposit. This interpretation from the fractal perspective is consistent with the geological understanding for the formation of porphyry deposits, which is considered to be subject to the complexity of ore fluid evolution with multifaceted physicochemical conditions. For a pragmatic use, these two fractal indices are successfully applied in the delineation of the core of mineralized zone in the plane view. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","83","Copper deposits","Deposits - Economic geology - Fractal dimension - Mineralogy - Ores - Potassium compounds - Quartz - Silicates - Spatial distribution","Correlation dimensions - Element distribution - Lacunarity - Multi-fractal spectrum - Physicochemical conditions - Porphyry copper deposits - Potassium silicates - Pulang","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 921 Mathematics",,"Number: 2015CB452600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB440903, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources; Number: K1411, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: 12120113093700, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: E1107, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 41172295, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate the valuable comments and careful revisions from two anonymous reviews and John Carranza.

From an environmental and public health standpoint, understanding Cd sources and cycling is critical to identifying potential hazards to humans. In this study, the Cd isotope compositions (expressed as δ114/110Cd) of secondary minerals such as anglesite (− 0.57 ± 0.03‰; 2 S.D.), granular smithsonite (0.04 ± 0.14‰; 2 S.D.), layered smithsonite (0.15 ± 0.40‰; 2 S.D.), hydrozincite (0.26 ± 0.01‰; 2 S.D.) and clay minerals (− 0.01 ± 0.06‰; 2 S.D.) from the Fule Zn-Pb-Cd deposit, Southwest China, are investigated to better understand the Cd sources and cycling in this area. Combined with our previous study (Zhu et al., 2017), the work herein elucidates the patterns of Cd isotopic fractionation during the formation processes of such secondary minerals and traces the weathering of these minerals into the ecosystem. The δ114/110Cd values of secondary minerals exhibit the following decreasing trend: hydrozincite > large granular smithsonite > small granular smithsonite > anglesite. Although different amounts of Cd were lost during the formation of equally sized samples, no or minor variations in Cd isotopic composition were observed. However, significant isotopic differences were observed between different size fractions. These results demonstrate that the particle size of secondary minerals and weathering products of sulfide significantly influence Cd isotope composition and fractionation during natural weathering. This systematic fractionation provides an initial foundation for the use of Cd isotopes as environmental tracers in ecosystems and in the global Cd isotope budget. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","","51","Cadmium alloys","Budget control - Cadmium sulfide - Clay deposits - Deposits - Ecosystems - Health hazards - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Particle size - Sulfate minerals - Ternary alloys - Weathering - Zinc alloys","Anglesite - Hydrozincite - Isotope fractionation - Natural weathering - Smithsonite","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.7 Health Care - 482.2 Minerals - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guizhou Science and Technology Department; Number: 41503011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41573007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41503011 , 41573007 ), Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province ( [2016]1159 ).

In this study, we carry out the inversion for finite-fault rupture process of the 2014 Ms 6.5 Ludian earthquake in a structural model with 3D velocity heterogeneity and surface topography. To ensure efficiency in calculating 3D synthetics during slip-distribution inversions, a database of strain Green’s tensors (SGTs) is established for the structural model. We then use the SGT database approach to perform the source slip-distribution inversion for the Ludian earthquake using regional broadband seismic records. The accommodation of lateral velocity heterogeneity and surface topography reduces modeling errors in source inversion. The finite-fault slip model indicates that the Ludian earthquake rupture initiated from the hypocenter and propagated southeastward and upward, reaching the ground surface with a surface rupture of ∼16 km in length and a maximum left-lateral slip of ∼1:2 m, in agreement with the findings of field surveys after the earthquake. © 2018, Seismological Society of America.

However, the evolution of the paleo-Red River is still under debate. This study presents new results from sedimentological analyses and detrital zircon U–Pb geochronologic data from fluvial sedimentary rocks of Paleocene to Oligocene age of the Simao Basin to constrain the nature of the paleo-drainage system of the Red River. The detrital zircon U–Pb results reveal multiple age groups at 190–240 Ma, 260–280 Ma, 450–540 Ma, 1700–1900 Ma and 2400–2600 Ma for the Paleocene to late Eocene Denghei Formation (Fm.), but only one conspicuous peak at 220–240 Ma for the late Eocene–Oligocene Mengla Fm. Provenance analyses illustrate that the former likely had source areas that included the Hoh-Xil, Songpan-Ganzi, northern Qiangtang, Yidun and western Yangtze Terranes, which are consistent with the catchments of the Upper and Lower Jinshajiang Segments, whereas the latter mainly transported material from a limited number of sources, such as the Lincang granitic intrusions west of the Simao Basin. Integrated with available detrital zircon U–Pb geochronologic and paleogeographic data, our study suggests the existence of a paleo-Red River during the Paleocene to late Eocene that was truncated and lost its northern sources after approximately 35 Ma, due to left-lateral strike-slip faulting of the Ailao Shan–Red River and clockwise rotation of the Lanping–Simao Terrane. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","","67","Rivers","Catchments - Drainage - Geochronology - Sedimentary rocks - Silicate minerals - Strike-slip faults - Zircon","Cenozoic - Detrital zircon - Provenance analysis - Red River - Sedimentological analysis - Strike slip faulting - Tibetan Plateau - Transported materials","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis",,"Number: XDB03020400, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2013CB956400, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFC0602803, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41620104002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41272185, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41672358, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (grant Nos. 2013CB956400 and 2017YFC0602803), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant No. XDB03020400), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant Nos. 41272185, 41672358 and 41620104002).

The mineralizing metals of the Qilinchang ore deposit, Pb and Zn, have only one source rock. The Pb isotope compositions of sulfides of the deposit are essentially the same as those of the Upper Proterozoic (i.e., lower Sinian) igneous rock suite, if the preferential migration of Pb isotopes during the leaching and the in situ radiogenic Pb back correction are taken into account. The 207Pb/206Pb ratios of sulfides in the deposit are notably high (0.850-0.851), which suggests that this ore deposit contains material with very old signatures. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic calculations of water/rock interaction, we obtain a value of about 0.745 of source rock 87Sr/86Sr for the mineralizing metals. This value is similar to that of the lower Sinian igneous rock suite at the time of mineralization. That the lower Sinian igneous rock suite served as the source is also favored by its characteristic of leachability and its content of metals in this and other geologic bodies.","","72","Geology","Calcite - Lead - Rocks - Strontium - Thermodynamics - Zinc","Kinetic calculations","804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 482.2 Minerals - 481.1 Geology","Theoretical (THR)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We infer that the volcanic rocks are part of the Paleotethyan Jomda-Weixi-Yunxian arc belt. The shaUow marine facies and the volcanic rocks showed the fault contact relationship, and the former overlaid on the latter. So the shaUow marine facies must be older than Early Triassic.

Scheelite is a typical hydrothermal mineral which can serve as mineralization process tracer and is significant for the hydrothermal deposit study. In this paper, we present in-situ LA-ICP-MS scheelite geochemical data from the different parts of the skarn mineralization in the Beiya deposit. The data indicate that the Beiya scheelite has high Mo (average: 38,943 ppm) and high LREE/HREE (average: 29.6), resembling typical skarn-type scheelite. The mechanism of REE substitution of Ca in the Beiya scheelite was probably 3Ca2 + = 2REE3 + + Ca, which implies that the scheelite inherited its REE composition from magma-derived ore-forming fluids. The scheelite from near the marble shows negative Eu anomaly (average δEu: 0.45), indicating an oxidizing condition, whereas that from near the porphyry shows positive Eu anomaly (average δEu: 3.58), indicating a reducing environment. Scheelite from the sandstone-hosted stratiform orebody shows slight and variable Eu anomalies (δEu: 0.66–1.47), indicating possible fluctuating physicochemical conditions. Our data demonstrate an increasing oxygen fugacity (fO2) trend from the ore-related intrusion to the surrounding carbonates at Beiya. The Rb/Sr, Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios of the Beiya scheelite suggest an addition of mantle-derived components to the ore-forming materials of the Beiya deposit. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","50","Gold deposits","Deposits - Europium - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Mass spectrometers - Mineralogy - Trace analysis - Trace elements - Tungstate minerals","Beiya - Himalayan Orogeny - La-ICP-MS - Sanjiang - Scheelite","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry",,"Number: 200805580031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015M582457, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1302233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40830425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41602067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41672071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40673045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1302233 , 41602067 , 41672071 , 40830425 , 40673045 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2015M582457 ), National Key Basic Research Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China (Grant No. 2015CB452604 ), Higher School Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program Funding Issue (Grant No. 200805580031 ), and the Project Supported by Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (Grant No. 2011 ).

However, information is still limited on the ecological processes that are represented by different measures of species diversity. In this study, the primary driving factors for richness and diversity indices were tested. The possible ecological processes represented by each index were analyzed. First, the type of ecological process that governed the phytoplankton community in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau lakes, either deterministic or stochastic, was identified by Caswell's neutral model. The results indicate that a deterministic process governs the phytoplankton community. Second, the driving factors of richness and diversity indices were screened with mixed models. The results suggest that the variation of phytoplankton richness in different lakes or sites was primarily related to bottom-up factors. The variations in evenness and other measures based on the relative abundance were driven by both top-down and bottom-up factors, such as zooplankton biomass, and pH and mean light, respectively. Finally, although the different measures of diversity may respond to specific bottom-up or top-down processes, the responses to the two processes were not independent of each other. These findings will increase our understanding of the relationships between ecological processes and diversity measures for freshwater phytoplankton. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The mineralization mainly occurs in skarn along the intrusive contacts between the alkaline porphyries and Middle Triassic limestone. In this paper, we present U-Pb age as well as major and trace element geochemistry of titanite from the Beiya deposit, and distinguish the titanite into a magmatic- and a hydrothermal suite. Our study indicates that the titanite from the ore-related porphyry and from the mineralized skarn is texturally and geochemically very different. The euhedral, envelope-shaped titanite from the ore-related porphyry has lower FeO, F, HFSEs, Nb/Ta and Lu/Hf, together with higher TiO2and Th/U than the subhedral titanite from the mineralized skarn. The titanite from the porphyry also displays higher LREE/HREE and more subtle negative Eu anomaly than its mineralized skarn counterpart. This suggests a magmatic- and a hydrothermal origin for, respectively, the titanite from the ore-related porphyry and from the mineralized skarn. In-situ magmatic titanite U-Pb dating has yielded an Eocene age of 36.0 ± 5.9 Ma, consistent with the porphyry zircon U-Pb age (36.07 ± 0.43 Ma) obtained in previous studies. Hydrothermal titanite has yielded a weighted average206Pb/238U age of 33.1 ± 1.0 Ma (MSWD = 2.0), which represents the age of the retrograde skarn alteration and the maximum age for the gold mineralization. Together with the previous molybdenite Re-Os age, we have further constrained the Beiya gold-polymetallic metallogeny to 33.1-34.1 Ma. The mineralization age is slightly younger than the porphyry emplacement, indicating that the Beiya metallogeny was likely to be a post-magmatic hydrothermal product of the Himalayan orogenic event. The REE characteristics of hydrothermal titanite also reveal that the ore forming fluids may have been derived from a highly oxidized magma. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","63","Gold deposits","Binary alloys - Deposits - Economic geology - Geochronology - Hafnium compounds - Iron oxides - Lime - Lutetium compounds - Mineralogy - Niobium compounds - Ores - Osmium alloys - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Tantalum compounds - Thorium compounds - Titanium dioxide - Trace analysis - Trace elements - Zircon","Beiya - Gold mineralization - Hydrothermal products - Major and trace elements - Molybdenite re-os ages - SW China - Titanite - U-Pb dating","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 200805580031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015M582457, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2009CB421006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: U1302233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40830425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40673045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40873034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

Due to the subduction of Meso-Tethyan oceanic crust and the evolution of the Neo-Tethys and the Himalaya orogen, a series of granites and related tin, lead-zinc polymetallic mineralization associated with plate convergence, subduction, and collision had been developed in this block since Triassic time. The disseminated molybdenum mineralization associated with granites was discovered as a new mineralization type in this area. Based on the studies on the zircon SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology, geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope system of the Xiaochang granite, some conclusions can be drawn as follows: (1) Xiaochang granite is medium to coarse-grained biotite-bearing monzonitic granite with porphyritic like texture, which is characteristic of high SiO2(73.96%-75.70%) and K2O (4.42%-5.13%) contents. Total alkali (K2O+Na2O) ranges from 5.44% to 8.03%, and the K2O/Na2O ratios vary from 1.37 to 2.00. Total content of the rare earth elements (∑REE) of the granite ranges from 155.12 to 191.75 μg/g, and LREE/HREE ratio shifts from 5.67-7.78, exhibiting medium negative Eu anomalies. On the mantle-normalized trace element distribution patterns, all the samples show pronounced negative anomalies in Ba, Sr, P, Ti and Nb but with significant positive anomalies in K, Rb, U, Th and Pb, indicating the features of silica-rich high potassium calc-alkaline S-type granite. (2) The zircon SHRIMP U-Pb dating results of the two granite-samples are 121.20±0.90 Ma and 121.60±0.70 Ma, respectively, which suggests that the rock forming age of this granite belongs to the late period of the Early Cretaceous. The Re-Os dating results of three molybdenum samples from the granite are 120.1±2.1 Ma, 124.5±2.6 Ma and 125.4±2.1 Ma respectively, showing that the ore-forming age approaches the rock forming age of this granite. (3) The contents of Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, major and trace elements imply that the granitic magma may have been formed from partial melting of graywacke-rich crustal materials under a probable crystallization temperature of 732-769°C as calculated by saturated Zr concentration. (4) On both of the Hf-Rb-Ta and R1-R2diagrams, almost all the samples fall within the field of syn-collision tectonic setting. (5) It is inferred that the granite and the related porphyry molybdenum mineralization may have been formed in a syn-collision tectonic setting during the westward subduction of the Nujiang oceanic plate beneath Tengchong block and continent-continent convergence and collision between Tengchong block and Baoshan block in the late period of the Early Cretaceous.","","50","Lead alloys","Binary alloys - Exploratory geochemistry - Geochronology - Granite - Hafnium alloys - Isotopes - Mica - Mineralogy - Neodymium alloys - Rare earths - Rhenium alloys - Rubidium alloys - Shellfish - Silica - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Strontium alloys - Structural geology - Tantalum alloys - Tectonics - Ternary alloys - Tin plate - Trace elements - Zircon","Disseminated molybdenum mineralization - Southwestern China - Sr-nd-pb isotopes - Syn-collision orogenic setting of Meso-Tethys - Tengchong Block","461.9 Biology - 481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy - 543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Taking the synthetic study of formation-tectonics-mineralization as the basic way of thinking, the paper is focused on establishing a new tectono-lithofacies prospecting model for the western part. With the Gejiu group of middle Trassic series as the sedimentary formational basis, the granitoid complex was developed in the late Cretaceous epoch. In the late stage of the Mesozoic Era, the orefield underwent large-scale magmatic hydrothermal metallogenic processes, probably lasting 70-90 Ma (mainly in 80 Ma), which formed the most important mineralization lithofacies. By the compilation of the tectono-lithofacies map of the orefield, the authors have figured out that the mineralization took place in the compression-extension transforming tectonic regime, and the original metallogenic model in both sides of the Gejiu fault zone should be consistent. The tectono-lithofacies interfaces became favorable spaces for the two major mineralization types, i.e., the tectono-magmatic-hydrothemal fluid filling and the metasomatic alteration types. The tectonism-stratigraphy-magmatism, i.e. tectono-lithofacies metallogenetic model has shown that because of the reformation caused by multi-stage and large scale activation of the Gejiu fault both in vertical and horizontal directions, the western part displayed the significant tectonic features of high upheaval and complicated disturbances. As a result, the mineralization of the western part demonstrates the characteristics of residue, complexity and deep levels. On the basis of above mentioned results combined with geological-geochemical-geophysical information, the prospecting direction and favorable segments for prospecting in the western part can be proposed. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

These migrant workers have limited access to subsidies and the local collective forest due to the household registration system in China called hukou. To assess how these policy-based restrictions on access affect wood consumption and local communities, a case study was conducted in Manlin village, Xishuangbanna, undertaking a household and weight survey with local and immigrant households. The results show no significant difference in firewood consumption between the subpopulations, despite predominantly more local than immigrant households have access to subsidised alternative energy sources. On the other hand, limited access to the collective forest is found to influence the choice of housing materials and living standards in immigrant households as they cannot access timber or afford brick houses. This paper highlights rural issues connected to the hukou system and suggests that rural energy and resource policies should take the growing population of immigrant workers into consideration in future to expand the reach of the polices to the de facto and not only de jure rural population and thus optimise policy efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","","33","Forestry","Land use - Rubber plantations - Rural areas - Wood","Access - Alternative energy source - China - Differentiated access - Energy - Hukou system - Registration systems - Rubber production","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 818.1 Natural Rubber",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Oticon Fonden; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the input of the I-REDD+ team who helped provide context and background information.

This paper reviews the fast rupture process inversion of the Ludian earthquake for rapid earthquake emergency response, which was completed 2.4 hours after the earthquake occurrence, and introduces the following revision works. From the revised rupture models, results of two nodal planes of double couple both indicate rupture propagations toward the ground surface and strike directions. Based on the consistencies between rupture area and intensities and aftershock distributions, it can be concluded that the Ludian earthquake was a left lateral strike-slip event ruptured on a nearly vertical fault with strike 162° and dip 86°. From the source time function determined in rupture process inversion, a large part of the seismic moment was released between 2 s and 5 s after the rupture initiation. The intensive moment release history may be associated with the relatively high surface wave magnitude and the serious disaster of this earthquake.","","18","Earthquakes","Fault slips - Signal to noise ratio - Strike-slip faults - Surface waves","Aftershock distributions - Earthquake emergency response - Earthquake occurrences - Rupture process - Rupture propagation - Source time functions - Surface wave magnitudes - Waveform inversion","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The deposit mainly occurs in the Jinding dome structure as tabular orebodies within breccia-bearing sandstones of the Palaeocene Yunlong Formation (autochthonous) and in the overlying sandstones of the Early Cretaceous Jingxing Formation (allochthonous). The deposit is not stratiform and no exhalative sedimentary rocks have been observed. The occurrence of the orebodies, presence of hangingwall alteration, and replacement and open-space filling textures all indicate an epigenetic origin. Formation of the Jinding Zn-Pb deposit is related to a period of major continental crust movement during the collision of the Indian and Eurasian Plates. The westward thrusts and dome structure were successively developed in the Palaeocene sedimentary rocks in the ore district, and Zn-Pb mineralisation appears to have taken place in the early stage of the doming processes. The study of fluid inclusions in sphalerite and associated gangue minerals (quartz, celestine, calcite and gypsum) shows that homogenisation temperatures ranged from 54 to 309 °C and cluster around 110 to 150 °C, with salinities of 1.6 to 18.0 wt.% NaCl equiv. Inert gas isotope studies from inclusions in ore- and gangue-minerals reveal 2.0 to 15.6% mantle He, 53% mantle Ne and a considerable amount of mantle Xe in the ore-forming fluids. The Pb-isotope composition of ores shows that the metal is mainly of mantle origin, mixed with a lesser amount of crustal lead. The widely variable and negative δ34S values of Jinding sulphides suggest that thermo-chemical or bacterial sulphate reduction produced reduced sulphur for deposition of the Zn-Pb sulphides. The mixing of a mantle-sourced fluid enriched in metals and CO2 with reduced sulphide-bearing saline formation water in a structural-lithologic trap may have been the key mechanism for the formation of the Jinding deposit. The Jinding deposit differs from known major types of sediment-hosted Zn-Pb deposits in the world, including sandstone-type (SST), Mississippi Valley type (MVT) and sedimentary-exhalative (SEDEX). Although the fine-grained ore texture and high Zn/Pb ratios are similar to those in SEDEX deposits, the Jinding deposit lacks any exhalative sedimentary rocks. Like MVT deposits, Jinding is characterised by simple mineralogy, epigenetic features and involvement of basinal brines in mineralisation, but its host rocks are mainly sandstones and breccia-bearing sandstones. The Jinding deposit is also different from SST deposits with its high Zn/Pb ratios, among other characteristics. Most importantly, the Jinding deposit was formed in an intracontinental terrestrial basin with an active tectonic history in relation to plate collision, and mantle-sourced fluids and metals played a major role in ore formation, which is not the case for SEDEX, MVT, and SST. We propose that Jinding represents a new type of sediment-hosted Zn-Pb deposit, named the 'Jinding type'. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The essence of this controversy is rooted in the relationship between the shearing and the magmatism in or near the shear zone. Diancang Shan complex lies in the north part of the ASRR shear zone, and is composed of three parts, i. e., the western high-grade metamorphic rocks, the eastern superimposed retrogressive metamorphism belt, and varying ages of magmatic rocks. In order to better constraint pre-, syn- and post-shearing granitic veins, the relationship between deformation and magmatism during shearing, and the initiation time of the shear zone, this study has carried out detailed macro- and micro-structural analyses and fabric study, which are helpful to reveal the flow structure and crystal plastic deformation structure, and also zircon U-Pb dating of granitic veins of syn-shearing. The results show that different stages of granitic rocks have different macro- and micro-structure and fabric features. Two zircon U-Pb ages of syn-shearing at 28. 54 ±0. 15Ma and 27. 31 ±0. 23Ma are dated. 28. 54 ±0. 15Ma represents the early shearing time, and 27. 31 ±0. 23Ma represents the late shearing age. This study reveals that the late shearing vein (the latter) is located in the high strain zone of progressive shearing and possesses more complex deformation structure, microstructure and fabric type, however, the early shearing vein (the former) in the low strain zone of progressive shearing has a simple structure, microstructure and fabric type, and still has the characteristics of magma crystallization fabric. ASRR shear zone experienced a progressive shearing of a higher temperature deformation in the early stage (∼ 700°C), medium-high temperature deformation in the middle stage (550 ∼ 600°C) and low temperature deformation in the late stage (lower than 400°C) from 28. 54Ma to 27. 31 Ma.","","40","Shearing machines","Binary alloys - Crystal structure - Fabrics - Geochronology - Granite - Lead alloys - Metamorphic rocks - Microstructure - Shear flow - Shearing - Silicate minerals - Structural geology - Temperature - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Crystal plastic deformations - Deformation Characteristics - Diancang Shan complex - High-grade metamorphic rocks - Low temperature deformations - Macroscopic structure - Red River Shear Zone - Zircon U-Pb geochronologies","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 603.1 Machine Tools, General - 604.1 Metal Cutting - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A series of sediment-hosted Himalayan Cu-Ag-Pb-Zn polymetallic deposits have been discovered in the western part of the basin, controlled by a thrust-nappe system. In the thrust-nappe system, the Cu orebodies mainly occur in the western and relatively deep part of the mineralization system (the root zone), whereas the Pb-Zn-Ag (± Cu) orebodies occur in the eastern and relatively shallow part of the system (the front zone), both as vein-type mineralization. In this paper we present new data, combined with existing data on fluid inclusions, isotopes and geologic characteristics of representative deposits, to provide the first study that contrasts mineralizing fluids in the Cu-Ag (Mo) and Pb-Zn-Ag (Cu) polymetallic deposits. Fluid inclusion and isotope studies show that the Cu-Ag (Mo) mineralization in the root zone formed predominantly from deep crustal fluids, with the participation of basinal brines. The deep crustal fluids are marked by high CO2content, relatively high temperatures (280 to 340°C) and low salinities (1 to 4wt.% NaCl equivalent), whereas the basinal brine shows relatively low temperatures (160°C to 220°C) and high salinities (12 to 22wt.% NaCl equivalent), containing almost no CO2. In comparison, hydrothermal activity associated with the Pb-Zn-Ag (±Cu) deposits in the front zone is characterized by basinal brine, with relatively low temperatures (130°C to 180°C), high salinities (9 to 24wt.% NaCl equivalent), and low CO2concentrations. Although evolved meteoric waters have predominantly been proposed as the source for deep crustal fluids, magmatic and metamorphic components cannot be completely excluded. The basinal brine was predominantly derived from meteoric water. The δ34S values of sulfides from the Cu-Ag (Mo) deposits and Pb-Zn-Ag (±Cu) deposits range from -17.9 to 16.3‰ and from 2.5 to 11.2‰, respectively. These ranges may relate to variations in physicochemical conditions or compositional variation of the sources. Lead isotope compositions indicate that the ore-forming metals were predominantly derived from sedimentary rocks of the Lanping basin. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","","78","Copper alloys","Binary alloys - Brines - Carbon dioxide - Cobalt deposits - Deposits - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Mineralogy - Molybdenum alloys - Ores - Sedimentary rocks - Silver alloys - Sodium chloride - Sulfur compounds - Ternary alloys - Zinc alloys","China - Compositional variation - Geologic characteristics - Ore-forming fluid - Physicochemical conditions - Polymetallic - Spatial-temporal evolution - Western Lanping basin","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,"Number: 41403038, Acronym: NYSF, Sponsor: National Youth Science Foundation; Number: 12120113094400, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 41173026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40930425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by, the National Natural Science Foundation for the Youth (no. 41403038 ), the 12th Five-Year Plan project of the State Key Laboratory of Ore-deposit Geochemistry , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 40930425 , 41173026 ), and the Comprehensive Research Project of China Geological Survey ( 12120113094400 ).

In this study, we report on mineralogy in recent discovered Damajianshan (DMJS) tungsten (-Cu-As-Mo-Bi) polymetallic deposit in the southern part of Sanjiang Tethyan domain related to Triassic quartz porphyry. Studies have shown that besides common ore minerals, such as native bismuth, bismuthinite, ikunolite, some specific minerals of Pb-Bi- and Pb-Sb-sulphosalts (e.g. izoklakeite, bournonite, cosalite, and boulangerite) have also been found. Based on paragenetic mineral assemblages, fluid inclusions, and thermodynamic studies, the physicochemical conditions were evaluated for the entire metallogenic process. The sulfur fugacity (logfS2) ranges from -9.7 to -37 with ore-forming temperatures between 190°C and 330°C, and the oxygen fugacity (logfO2) ranges from -37.5 to -38.5 when the temperature is 250°C. The sulfur fugacity and oxygen fugacity show strong fluctuations with broadly negative correlation, indicating that these variations in physicochemical conditions should be responsible for mineral assemblages, and are one of the most significant factors leading to the formation of the DMJS deposit.

Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the earliest domesticated crop species. Its genetic diversity has been declining as a result of natural and artificial selection. In this study, we performed the first analysis of the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation in rice genomes under on-farm conservation in Yunnan during a 27-year period of domestication. We performed large-scale sequencing of 600 rice accessions with high diversity, which were collected in 1980 and 2007, using ten unlinked nuclear loci. Diachronic analysis showed no significant changes in the level of genetic diversity occurring over the past 27 years’ domestication, which indicated genetic diversity was successfully maintained under on-farm conservation. Population structure revealed that the rice landraces could be grouped into two subpopulations, namely the indica and japonica groups. Interestingly, the alternate distribution of indica and japonica rice landraces could be found in each ecological zone. The results of AMOVA showed that on-farm conservation provides opportunities for continued differentiation and variation of landraces. Therefore, dynamic conservation measures such as on-farm conservation (which is a backup, complementary strategy to ex situ conservation) should be encouraged and enhanced, especially in crop genetic diversity centers. The results of this study offered accurate insights into short-term evolutionary processes and provided a scientific basis for on-farm management practices. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","60","Biodiversity","Crops","Artificial selection - Conservation measures - Evolutionary process - Genetic diversity - Nucleotide variation - Population structures - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) - Scientific basis","454 Environmental Engineering - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,"Number: NB2013-2130135-25-01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2010CB125904-5, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: PJ008685, Acronym: RDA, Sponsor: Rural Development Administration; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Rice University; Number: 2013BAD01B0101-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013BAD01B02-2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We thank the Chinese National Germplasm Bank for providing the landrace rice seeds.

Protomylonites, mylonites, and ultramylonites recorded differential Wm values, 0.19-0.73, 0.11-0.8, and 0.84-0.95 (even 0.99) respectively in the high-grade gneiss belt. Based on classical strain analysis and these kinematic vorticity evaluations, the shear zone is classified as a preliminarily bulk monoclinic symmetry. The pattern of vorticity path suggests that a previously undocumented transpressional setting and strain partitioning pattern in the southeast region of Tibet Plateau, characterized by steep-narrow domain of simple-shearing (Tertiary strike-slip shearing) deformation and wider domain of mostly pure-shearing (Tertiary contraction) to accommodate intracontinental deformation. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","","51","Shearing machines","Deformation - Kinematics - Shearing - Strain - Structural geology - Vorticity","Hyperbolic distribution - Kinematic vorticity - Monoclinic symmetry - Shear zone - Simple shearing - Strain analysis - Strain partitioning - Transpression","481.1 Geology - 603.1 Machine Tools, General - 604.1 Metal Cutting - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 931.1 Mechanics - 951 Materials Science",,"Number: 20070440065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 40802050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Received May 4, 2008; accepted July 30, 2008 doi: 10.1007/s11430-009-0065-4 †Corresponding author (email: zhangbo@mail.iggcas.ac.cn) Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40802050, 49802020, 40172074) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 20070440065)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Boron concentrations range from 0.036–472.4 ppm, and the δ11B values range from −16.0‰ to 13.1‰, indicating the non-marine origin for each geothermal system. We observed a clear binary mixing relationship between the B concentrations and B isotope compositions in Tibet geothermal area. This relationship can be well explained by two sources, i.e., marine carbonate rocks and magmatic rocks, for the Tibet geothermal water. No evidence supports a mantle contribution to B. In addition, we found that the precipitation only plays a dilution role for B of geothermal waters. δ11B values for the precipitation across the southern Tibetan Plateau area range from −6.0‰ to −6.8‰ at least. Due to data scarcity in Yunnan geothermal area, we observed possible different boron sources from the Tibet geothermal system. Comparing it with other geothermal systems in the world, we found that the samples from YTGB have the lowest δ11B values and the largest range of B concentration, which might be related to their special geological background. On the whole, the world geothermal δ11B-Cl/B relation suggests a mixing process between marine and non-marine sources. Additionally, we suggest that B source of B-enriched geothermal waters is mainly from B-enriched crustal country-rocks, instead of mantle. © 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","86","Geothermal springs","Boron - Geothermal fields - Geothermal wells - Hot springs - Isotopes - Mixing","Boron concentrations - Boron isotopes - Geochemical process - Geological background - Geothermal water - Isotope compositions - Marine carbonate rock - tracing","481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University; Number: -, Acronym: PKU, Sponsor: Peking University; Number: 1212011085524, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 41030317, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41203012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We gratefully acknowledge reviewers for constructive reviews and suggestions on an early draft, Charles B and Krysta B for revisions.

Gabbro xenoliths are characterized by 'open' texture represented by relatively abundant vesicles and ground-mass fillings, while pyroxenite xenoliths are characterized by equigranular and poikilitic texture. Their mineral compositions (clinopyroxene ± orthopyroxene ± plagioclase) are similar to those of phenocrysts in lavas, and their equilibration temperature (1000-1125°C) is consistent with the crystallization temperature of the phenocrysts (998-1108°C). Thus, the textures and compositions of these xenoliths are different from those of lower crustal and mantle xenoliths, and were derived from the magma chamber. Among them, the gabbroic xenoliths come from the crystal-bubble-liquid zone at the top of the magma reservoir, while the pyroxenite xenoliths come from the cumulates in the bottom of magma reservoir. The studied single lherzolite xenolith with porphyroclastic texture has similar mineral compositions to the mantle xenoliths from eastern China, and is considered to be of upper mantle origin. It was brought into magma reservoir by replenishment magma, and might have experienced a cooling event before eruption. The formation of xenoliths in trachyandesite flows largely reflects the ascent, storage, evolution and eruption processes of magma. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","29","Volcanoes","Earth sciences - Natural sciences","Barometry - Magma chamber - Tengchong - trachyandesite - xenoliths","484 Seismology",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fine&nbsp;Ceramics&nbsp;Opening&nbsp;Fund; Number: 200708-27, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors sincerely thank Mr. Ma Yuguang from the Electron Microprobe Laboratory, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Mr. Yin Jingwu from the Electron Microprobe Laboratory, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) for their enthusiastic support and kind help during electron microprobe analysis.

The preliminary target detection involved principal components and broad-band spectral analysis and led to the detection of two target areas characterized by argillic alteration, iron-oxide- and sulphate-bearing minerals. A focused hyperspectral study followed using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) techniques, which allowed mineral species to be discriminated and mapped in more detail. This combined broad-band and hyperspectral approach is feasible and advantageous for mineral exploration in remote areas where primary information is limited or unavailable. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","","18","Mineral exploration","Iron oxides - Minerals - Principal component analysis - Remote sensing - Spectrum analysis - Sulfur compounds","Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer - Hydrothermal minerals - Hyperspectral instrument - Hyperspectral remote sensing - Mixture tuned matched filtering - Mountainous regions - Principal Components - Spectral angle mappers","482.2 Minerals - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,"Number: -, Acronym: NERC, Sponsor: Natural Environment Research Council; Number: -, Acronym: NERC, Sponsor: Natural Environment Research Council; Number: -, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; ","This project was in collaboration with the China University of Geosciences, who provided the Hyperion dataset and some additional reference material.

Most deposits have characteristics similar to Carlin-type Au deposits and are spatially associated, on a regional scale, with deposits of coal, Sb, barite, As, Tl, and Hg. Sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits are disseminated stratabound and(or) structurally controlled. The deposits have many similar characteristics, particularly mineralogy, geochemistry, host rock, and structural control. Most deposits are associated with structural domes, stratabound breccia bodies, unconformity surfaces or intense brittle-ductile deformation zones, such as the Youjiang fault system. Typical characteristics include impure carbonate rock or calcareous and carbonaceous host rock that contains disseminated pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite-usually with μm-sized Au, commonly in As-rich rims of pyrite and in disseminations. Late realgar, orpiment, stibnite, and Hg minerals are spatially associated with earlier forming sulfide minerals. Minor base-metal sulfides, such as galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and Pb-Sb-As-sulphosalts also are present. The rocks locally are silicified and altered to sericite-clay (illite). Rocks and(or) stream-sediment geochemical signatures typically include elevated concentrations of As, Sb, Hg, Tl, and Ba. A general lack of igneous rocks in the Dian-Qian-Gui area implies non-pluton-related, ore forming processes. Some deposits contain evidence that sources of the metal may have originated in carbonaceous parts of the sedimentary pile or other sedimentary or volcanic horizons. This genetic process may be associated with formation and mobilization of petroleum and Hg in the region and may also be related to As-, Au-, and Tl-bearing coal horizons. Many deposits also contain textures and features indicative of strong structural control by tectonic domes or shear zones and also suggest syndeformational ore deposition, possibly related to the Youjiang fault system. Several sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the Dian-Qian-Gui area also are of the red earth-type and Au grades have been concentrated and enhanced during episodes of deep weathering. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the traditional educations (There are no online courses) are not able to ease the contradiction. It has been found that the online course can solve the conflict between working and learning of the adult students in evening university and correspondence education. Therefore, many academies which engaged in adult education brought in online courses model. However, how to ensure implementary quality of online course that has become a vital problem, in the paper, Online Course Quality Maturity Model Based on Evening University and Correspondence Education(OCQMM) was built. This model is not only for assessing the implementary quality of online courses in Evening University and Correspondence Education, more importantly, it can guide the institutions that engaged in adult education to meliorate the implementary process, so that the implementation quality of online course will be improved. © 2011 IEEE.","","10","E-learning","Education computing - Educational technology - Teaching","Adult education - Anecdotal evidences - Learning time - Maturity model - Online course - Traditional educations","901.2 Education",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
