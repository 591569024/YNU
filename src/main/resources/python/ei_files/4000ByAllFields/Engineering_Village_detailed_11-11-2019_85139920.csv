A central database and the interfaces and communication between the database and ACE will be established. After the vehicle is loaded, all openings of the tanker are sealed with disposable RFID tag seals. Then a RFID reader and GPS tracker wirelessly connected with the databases will serve as signal processing and testing grounds for the implementation of security measures that can help prevent future terrorist attacks and help in ensuring that the goods and products are not compromised while in transit.

Taking the short-hole blasting as research background for bench excavation of the main underground workshop with super-large section in Xiluodu hydroelectric power plant, located in the Jinsha River,at the junction of Sichuan and Yunnan in China, a model of rock blasting-induced damage taking initial damage into account was presented based on damage mechanics. The criterion for blasting-induced damage, which was related to the initial damage of rock, was also presented for determining the blasting-induced damage zone. The formula about the relation between the initial damage of rock and the integrity index of rock mass was proposed so that the presented model could consider the integrity of rock mass. The presented model was imported into the software FLAC3D by programming the numerical simulation for rock mass integrityion of blasting. Firstly, The analysis of the characteristics of rock blasting-induced damage zone of surrounding rock were made. Secondly, the maximum radius of blasting-induced damage zone in the horizontal-radial direction was considered as the characteristic parameter for the blasting-induced damage zone. The relations among the maximum horizontal radius of blasting-induced damage zone, the initial damage of rock, the blasting charge amount per delay interval and the peak particle velocity of vibration were also analyzed. As a result, the limited velocity of vibration and the safety charge amount corresponding to the rock damage under different initial damage were obtained. In the end, the results from tests on site including blasting tests, testing of peak particle vibration velocity and velocity of acoustic wave propagation in a borehole, were put forward. The rationality of numerical simulation was verified by the result comparisons between the tests on site and the numerical simulation. The results show that, for the short-hole bench blasting, the blasting-induced damage zone decreases with increment of blasthole depth in the horizontal-radial direction, and it expands to the maximum on the top free face of blasthole. The peak vibration velocity of particle located in the edge of blasting-induced damage on the top free face of blasthole can be used as the safety criterion for evaluating rock blasting-induced damage in the excavation monitoring process. The initial damage value of rock has remarkable influence on the maximum blasting-induced damage radius when the value is big. The results obtained from numerical simulation are in good agreement with those from tests on site. © 2016, Central South University Press.

Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (Type-2 FS) have a good prospect in image fusion field, because it can effectively address the uncertain and fuzzy problem in image fusion for selecting the high-quality pixels or coefficients of source images. We try to extend the application fields of Type-2 FS and improve the performance of MSIF; therefore, this paper presents a hybrid method by combining the local spatial frequency (LSF) with interval Type-2 FS in nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain. NSST is used to decompose source images, and interval Type-2 FS and LSF is employed to extract the regional features of source images; so it can extract and fuse the detailed features of different source images accurately. First, NSST is performed to decompose the source images into low frequency and high frequency sub-images. Second, LSF-based fusion rule is applied to fuse low frequency sub-images. Thirdly, a novel fusion process based on interval Type-2 FS is designed to fuse high frequency sub-images. At last, inverse NSST2 (INSST) is implemented to reconstruct the fused images. The experimental and contrastive results of different image sets show that the proposed method is an effective MSIF scheme, which can achieve better fusion effect than the existing representative methods. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","63","Image fusion","Fuzzy sets - Image processing - Inverse problems","Interval type-2 fuzzy sets - Multi-sensor information fusion - Multifocus image fusion - Shearlet transforms - Spatial frequency","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,"Number: 2017SE202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: -, Acronym: BIOINT, Sponsor: Biological Interactions Doctoral Programme; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received December 18, 2017; accepted December 30, 2017.

First, according to the characteristics of S-PCNN and the DNA primary sequence, the latter is encoded using Huffman coding method, and then using the former, the oscillation time sequence (OTS) of the encoded DNA sequence is extracted.

Bayesian networks have gradually become one of the hotspots and important achievements in artificial intelligence research. Establishing an effective Bayesian network structure is the foundation and core of the learning and application of Bayesian networks. In Bayesian network structure learning, the traditional method of utilizing expert knowledge to construct the network structure is gradually replaced by the data learning structure method. However, as a result of the large amount of possible network structures, the search space is too large. The method of Bayesian network learning through training data usually has the problems of low precision or high complexity, which make the structure of learning differ greatly from that of reality, which has a great influence on the reasoning and practical application of Bayesian networks.

Nodes running LGossiping data distribution technique use global positioning system to relay data throughout the network. Each node decides upon position knowledge of the others. This allows each sensor to send its data reliably to one of known neighbors instead of sending data blindly to one of neighbors which may not be near to source node and cause data lost. We outlined SystemC as simulation language and simulate and analyzed Gossiping and LGossiping protocols. In each experiment source node propagate data among nodes with the hope of reaching to sink node. This procedure is called data transmission. We found that LGossiping with transmission radius greater than or equal to 4 (TRgt;=4) is 30% more reliable than Gossiping for a specific number of experiments. LGossiping is an improvement of Gossiping in terms of reliability. Therefore reliability in this improved method is critical. Moreover, network energy consumption with respect to different TR is considered. We concluded that network energy consumption decreases as the transmission radius increases. As termination, increasing area during the experiment is mentioned. In order to have constant reliability with constant number of nodes in LGossiping method in immense areas, with each 600m2 increase of area, transmission radius should increases 1 meter. © 2009 IEEE.","10","Sensor nodes","Computer simulation languages - Energy utilization - Information dissemination - Mobile computing - Reliability - Wireless sensor networks","Data distribution - Gossiping - Rrouting Techniques - Simulation - SystemC","525.3 Energy Utilization - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 903.2 Information Dissemination",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The process of identifying the mapping relationship between the software features and source code is called feature location. Information retrieval feature location method is widely used in software maintenance, code search and other fields because of its high usability and low overhead. All the information retrieval feature location methods are based on semantic similarity calculation. However, there are two main problems: 1) There is a lot of noise data in the source code corpus. The noise data will interfere with the result of similarity calculation. 2) Different index methods' limitation will lead to the similarity calculation results being inaccurate. To solve these problems, a semantic similarity integration method for software feature location problem is proposed. This method introduces the Part-of-Speech filtering in the preprocessing process, effectively filtering the source code noise data, and improving the accuracy of similarity calculation. Then, different index methods are integrated to calculate similarities based on the source code's structured characteristics. Experiments are performed on the open data benchmarks. Compared with the existing methods, the POS filtering improves by an average of 30.88% on the mean reciprocal rank performance, while similarity integration improves an average of 10.28%.

We show that a new data set of Love and Rayleigh wave isotropic phase speeds and Rayleigh wave azimuthal anisotropy observed within and surrounding eastern Tibet can be explained simultaneously by modeling the crust as a depthdependent tilted hexagonally symmetric (THS) medium. We specify the THS medium with depth-dependent hexagonally symmetric elastic tensors tilted and rotated through dip and strike angles and estimate these quantities using a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion to produce a 3-D model of the crust and uppermost mantle on a 0.5° × 0.5° spatial grid. In the interior of eastern Tibet and in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, we infer a steeply dipping THS upper crustal medium overlying a shallowly dipping THSmedium in themiddle-to-lower crust. Such vertical stratification of anisotropy may reflect a brittle to ductile transition in which shallow fractures and faults control upper crustal anisotropy and the crystal-preferred orientation of anisotropic (perhaps micaceous) minerals governs the anisotropy of the deeper crust. In contrast, near the periphery of the Tibetan Plateau the anisotropic medium is steeply dipping throughout the entire crust, which may be caused by the reorientation of the symmetry axes of deeper crustal anisotropic minerals as crustal flows are rotated near the borders of Tibet. © The Authors 2017.","106","Anisotropy","Anisotropic media - Crystal orientation - Rayleigh waves - Structural geology - Surface waves","Azimuthal anisotropy - Brittle to ductile transition - Crustal structure - Crystal preferred orientations - Directional dependence - Seismic anisotropy - Surface waves and free oscillations - Vertical stratification","481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Nevertheless, biologists prefer to discover the correlations between protein attributes and functions. We introduce a multi-label supervised topic model into protein function prediction and investigate the advantages of this approach. This topic model can not only work out the function probability distributions over protein instances effectively, but also directly provide the words probability distributions over functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to apply a multi-label supervised topic model to the protein function prediction. In this paper, we model a protein as a document and a function label as a topic. First, a set of protein sequences is formalized into a bag of words. Then, we perform inference and estimate the model parameters to predict protein functions. Experimental results on yeast and human datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-label supervised topic model on protein function prediction. Meanwhile, the experiments also show that this multi-label supervised topic model delivers superior results over the compared algorithms. In summary, the method discussed in this paper provides a new efficient approach to protein function prediction and reveals more information about functions. © 2017 The Author(s).

Many new models are brought forward to identify and extract the geochemical weak anomalies from the complex background. How to compare the differences in aspect of the anomaly recognition effect of these different models? The authors advance the sample ranking method to discuss this problem. The gliding anomaly contrast and the local singularity analysis are applied to the Cu element data of the stream sediment samples from Gejiu area, Yunnan Province, China. The ranks for the raw data, contrast value and the local singularity exponents, denoted by RANK (Raw), RANK (CV) and RANK (Δα) respectively, are calculated by ordering the samples from the high anomaly to the low anomaly. Three ways are employed to compare the RANK (CV) and RANK (Δα) with the RANK (Raw): (1) The characteristics of ranks for samples with the strong background and the weak background; (2) The characteristics of ranks for samples where the Cu deposits occur; and (3) The spatial correlation between the locations of Cu deposits and the cumulative area with the same thresholds of the upper rank values. The results demonstrate that the local singularity analysis is a useful model for the weak geochemical anomaly recognition, whose effect corresponds with the gliding anomaly contrast model or even better. The prospective areas delineated by means of weights of evidence method on the basis of local singularity exponents can provide new information and may be significant for the prediction of the undiscovered mineral deposits, which is significantly superior to the results on the basis of raw concentration data. The local singularity analysis has the advantage of the perspicuous principle, convenience and effective performance, and we can substitute it for the gliding contrast value method for the anomaly recognition of geochemical data.","25","Analytical geochemistry","Copper - Copper deposits - Deposits","Exploratory data analysis - Gejiu area - Gliding contrast value - Local singularity - Weights of evidences","544.1 Copper - 801 Chemistry",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the pattern does not necessarily appear in the logs that satisfies local completeness. This research aims at finding ways to mine length-two loops without the pattern. It results in a new algorithm (αL+-algorithm) that is based on the α-algorithm. First, an order vector matrix is established by tasks in logs to abstract variant structures of length-two loops. Then, distinction between loops and concurrency structure is obtained by event's frequency and location in traces. Finally, proximity and circuit abstraction are used to eliminate the interference caused by the concurrent branches. The experimental results show that the αL+-algorithm can handle length-two loops with or without 'aba' pattern. In addition, the αL+- algorithm is implemented in the ProM tool. © Copyright 2018, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The representation of words needs to extract the similarity of words, and the similarity among words needs to be obtained by the meaning of words in texts. In order to improve the accuracy of text feature extraction, this paper uses the word2vec model to train the word vector in the corpus to obtain its semantic features.

However, most of MST-based methods are based on pixel operations, which require a large amount of data processing. Moreover, different fusion strategies cannot completely preserve the clear pixels within the focused area of the source image to obtain the fusion image. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method based on focus-region-level partition and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. A clarity evaluation function is constructed to measure which regions in the source image are focused. By removing the focused regions from the source images, the non-focus regions which contain the edge pixels of the focused regions are obtained. Next, the non-focus regions are decomposed into a series of subimages using NSCT, and subimages are fused using different strategies to obtain the fused non-focus regions. Eventually, the fused result is obtained by fusing the focused regions and the fused non-focus regions. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion scheme can retain more clear pixels of two source images and preserve more details of the non-focus regions, which is superior to conventional methods in visual inspection and objective evaluations. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",,"Image fusion","Data handling - Image enhancement - Neural networks - Pixels","Gaussians - Multifocus image fusion - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Pulse coupled neural network - Region partition","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, two distinct magmatic events, represented by diorite porphyry and quartz monzonite porphyry, have been revealed in the Hongshan deposit, with zircon SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 214 ± 2 Ma and 73.4 ± 0.7 Ma, respectively. The 73 Ma age is comparable to the Re-Os ages of 77 to 80 Ma of ore minerals from the Hongshan deposit, indicating that the mineralization is related to the Late Cretaceous quartz monzonite porphyries rather than Late Triassic diorite porphyries. The Late Triassic diorite porphyries belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series and show arc magmatic geochemical characteristics such as enrichment in Rb, Ba, Th and U and depletion in HFSEs, indicating that they were formed during the westward subduction of the Garzê-Litang Ocean. In contrast, the Late Cretaceous quartz monzonite porphyries show shoshonitic I-type geochemical characteristics, with high SiO2, K2O, LILE, low HREE, Y and Yb contents, and high LREE/HREE and La/Yb ratios. These geochemical characteristics, together with the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions (average (87Sr/86Sr)i= 0.7085; ΕNd(t) = -6.0;206Pb/204Pb = 19.064,207Pb/204Pb = 15.738,208Pb/204Pb = 39.733) suggest that the quartz monzonite porphyries originated from the partial melting of the ancient lower crust in response to underplating of mafic magma from subduction metasomatized mantle lithosphere, possibly triggered by regional extension in the post-collisional tectonic stage. The S isotopic compositions (δ34SV-CDT= 3.81‰ to 5.80‰) and Pb isotopic compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 18.014 to 18.809,207Pb/204Pb = 15.550 to 15.785, and208Pb/204Pb = 38.057 to 39.468) of ore sulfides indicate that the sulfur and metals were derived from mixed mantle and crustal sources. It is proposed that although the Late Triassic magmatic event is not directly related to mineralization, it contributed to the Late Cretaceous mineralization system through the storage of large amounts of sulfur and metals as well as water in the cumulate zone in the mantle lithosphere through subduction metasomatism. Re-melting of the mantle lithosphere including the hydrous cumulate zone and ancient lower crust during the post-collisional stage produced fertile magmas, which ascended to shallow depths to form quartz monzonite porphyries. Hydrothermal fluids released from the intrusions resulted in porphyry-type Mo-Cu ores in and near the intrusions, skarn-type Cu-Mo ores in the country rocks above the intrusions, and hydrothermal Pb-Zn ores in the periphery. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","76","Lead alloys","Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Deposits - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Isotopes - Melting - Mineralogy - Molybdenum alloys - Neodymium alloys - Ores - Osmium alloys - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Strontium alloys - Sulfur - Sulfur compounds - Ternary alloys - Zinc alloys - Zircon","Collisional - Cretaceous shoshonitic I-type intrusions - Mantle lithosphere - Polymetallic - Yunnan , China","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482 Mineralogy - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,"Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: 40772061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2009CB421005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41072069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40930423, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is jointly funded by NSFC ( 41072069 , 40930423 and 40772061 ) and the 973 Program ( 2009CB421005 ).

In this work, we synthesized a new kind of PDI and reported this aggregated PDI could quench the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-labeled fluorophores with a high quenching efficiency. The quenching efficiencies on the fluorescence of FAM, TAMRA and Cy5 could reach to 98.3%±0.9%, 97.2%±0.6% and 98.1%±1.1%, respectively. This broad-spectrum quencher was then adopted to construct a multicolor biosensor via a label-free approach. A structure-switching-triggered enzymatic recycling amplification was employed for signal amplification. High quenching efficiency combined with autocatalytic target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor with high sensitivity towards small analytes. For other targets, changing the corresponding aptamer can achieve the goal. The quencher did not interfere with the catalytic activity of nuclease. The biosensor could be manipulated with similar sensitivity no matter in pre-addition or post-addition manner.

The proposed method is based on an image patch that is decomposed into three different independent parts: contrast extraction, structure preservation, and intensity adjustment. For structure preservation and intensity adjustment, which are very important, this paper exploits three weight measurements, i.e., local weight, global weight, and saliency weight. Using those weights, the final fused image is better guided by not only the exposure level of a single image but also the relative exposure level between differently exposed images. Then, the three parts are fused, respectively. The desired patch is reconstructed and fed back to the fused image. Unlike the conventional patch algorithms, the proposed approach preserves more details of the input sequence images due to the three weight maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully produces pleasing fused images with better color appearance and more texture details than other existing exposure fusion techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","32","Image fusion","Color - Color image processing - Digital cameras - Flow visualization - Weighing","Dynamic range - global weight - Image color analysis - local weight - Multi-exposure images - patch - saliency weight",,,"Number: 61365001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61463052 and 61365001.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The rationale is that crop yield losses occur because the physiology of the growing crop is negatively affected by pests and diseases in a dynamic way over time as crop both grows and develops. Metapopulation dynamics can thus be used to model the resultant crop yield losses. The stochastic metapopulation process is described by using the Simplified Incidence Function model (IFM). Compared to the original IFMs, endogenous and exogenous periodicities are considered in the proposed model to handle the cyclical patterns observed in pest infestations, diseases epidemics, and exogenous affecting factors such as temperature and rainfalls. Agricultural loss data in China are used to fit the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Model with endogenous and exogenous periodicities is a better fit; (2) When the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are negatively correlated, EIL or the cost of loss is monotonically increasing; when the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an outbreak of pests and diseases might occur; (3) If the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an optimal patch size can be identified which will greatly weaken the effects of external environmental influence and hence inhibit pest infestations and disease epidemics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","53","Stochastic models","Crops - Epidemiology - Magnetic resonance - Signal to noise ratio - Stochastic systems","Crop disease - Econophysicss - Environmental fluctuations - Environmental influences - Incidence function - Metapopulation dynamics - Metapopulations - Stochastic resonances","461.7 Health Care - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,"Number: YC2012D15, Acronym: YUFE, Sponsor: Yunnan University of Finance and Economics; Number: 2015M572507, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: ZDZZD201408, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: C163005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 11225103, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Number: 11165016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71263056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11647078, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the grants from the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No.: 11225103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 11647078, 11165016, 71263056), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No.: 2015M572507), Yunnan Provincial Social Science Foundation Of China (Grant No. ZDZZD201408), Postdoctoral directional training project in Yunnan province (Grant No.: C163005), the Science Foundation of Yunnan University of Finance and Economics (Grant No. YC2012D15).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) is utilized to decompose the source image into a low-frequency coefficient and a series of high-frequency coefficients. Secondly, the low-frequency coefficient is fused by the CNN framework, where weight map is generated by a series of feature maps and an adaptive selection rule, and then the high-frequency coefficients are fused by DCSCM, where the modified average gradient of the high-frequency coefficients is adopted as the input stimulus of DCSCM. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse NSST.

However, for person re-identification, most deep learning methods minimize cross-entropy or triplet-based losses, thereby neglecting the fact that the similarities and differences between image pairs can be considered simultaneously to increase discrimination.

Fertilization can increase crop yield, but also can enhance emissions of greenhouse gas N2O. There is an important guiding significance to analyze the relationship between yield, soil N2O emissions under varied nitrogen levels for ensuring crop yield and reducing environment impacts. The potato is the fourth largest planting crops in the world, and China is the biggest producer. Effect of N application rates on soil N2O emission and crop yield have been intensively studied in the temperate zone with continental climate, and these studies simply focused on either yield or N2O emission, while it has never been reported in the north subtropical monsoon climate. In this study, field experiment was conducted in the Daheqiao experiment base (23°32'N, 103°13'E) of Yunnan agricultural university, in Xundian County, Yunnan province of China, from April to November in 2015. And four N application levels (unfertilized-N0, 0; low nitrogen application rate -N1, 67.5 kg/hm2; conventional nitrogen application rate-N2, 125 kg/hm2; high nitrogen application rate -N3, 187.5 kg/hm2) with three replications were compared based on potato cultivation of Huize 2. Aiming to study the effect of N application rates on potato yield and soil N2O emission at growing period, soil N2O emission was collected in situ by static chamber and analyzed using gas chronographs technique. Simultaneously, optimizing N application rates to increase yield and minimize N2O emission was analyzed. The results showed that fertilization increased the potato yield and cumulative N2O emission significantly. The soil was a source of atmospheric N2O emissions in whole potato growing season, and an obvious seasonal difference was monitored. Compared with N0, N1, N2, and N3 treatments increased by78.5%, 93.1% and 95.6% in yield. The cumulative N2O emission of N1, N2, and N3 treatments were 2.3, 4.4, and 6.7 times that of N0 treatment, respectively. The potato yield was largest when N application rates 125 kg/hm2, and no longer increased with the increasing N application rate. The first and secondary peaks of N2O emission were observed at the flourishing stage (23 May) and harvest stage (11 August), respectively. Meanwhile, N2O emission factor and yield-scaled N2O intensity significantly improved with the increase of N fertilizer. The proportion of the loss of nitrogen in the form of N2O significantly increased with the increasing N fertilizer. Nitrate intensity could effectively reflect the intensity of soil N2O emission. N2O emission flux was significantly correlated with soil temperature and humidity only at low N levels (N0, N1).Soil NO3--N content was the key factor for N2O emission at high N levels. Comprehensive considering the average N2O emission coefficient (1%) reported by IPCC as the fertilization standard of nitrogen and potato yield in farmland ecosystem,therefore, the reasonable N application rates were about 62.5 kg/hm2in potato production. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Sensors fabricated from CdO-Ag-ZnO nanocomposites were made based on indirect heating method, which showed superior sensing properties in detecting different concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast with singular ZnO, gas-sensing experiment results reveal that the addition of CdO and Ag effectively decreases optimum working temperature, increases gas response value and shortens response and recovery time. What's more, other gas-sensing properties including repeatability, sensitivity and long-term stability are also discussed in this research. Particularly, gas sensor based on 10 mol% CdO-Ag-ZnO shows modest gas-sensing performance to VOCs at the operating temperature of 200 °C, and its gas response values are 198.63, 156.07, 53.04, 64.23, 183.65 towards 100 ppm formaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, methanol and isopropanol, respectively, indicating it a promising candidate in detecting VOCs.

Since software engineers perform different evolving activities to respond to different kinds of requirements, ripple effect analysis has been globally recognized as a key factor of affecting the success of software evolution projects. The precision of most existing ripple effect analysis methods is not as good as expectation and lots of methods have their inherent limitations. This paper proposes a hybrid analysis method which combines the dynamic and information retrieval based techniques to support ripple effect analysis in source code. This combination is able to keep the feature of high recall rate of dynamic method and reduce the adverse effects of noise and analysis scope by the domain knowledge which is derived from source code by information retrieval technique. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have performed the ripple effect analysis and compared the analysis results produced by dynamic, static, text, historical evolving knowledge based methods with the proposed method on one open source software named jEdit. The results show that the hybrid ripple effect analysis method, across several cut points, provides statistically significant improvements in both precision and recall rate over these techniques used independently. © 2016, Science Press.

Firstly, an improved background elimination method is presented to solve the problem caused by different background color in a palm leaf. Then the classical Niblack's method is used to binarize image. But there are many noises on the result images obtained by the Niblack's method, so a morphology based method is applied to remove noise. Finally, a connected domain based method is described to delete superfluous lines.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach to modeling trustworthiness requirement-oriented software processes. First, based on the aspect-oriented modeling techniques, separation of concerns is used to separate the crosscutting activities and the core activities according to the different trustworthiness requirements and functional requirements. A goal-oriented modeling and reasoning method for trustworthiness requirements to find the crosscutting activities that satisfy multiple trustworthiness requirements is presented. Then, base processes are modeled for functional requirements. The crosscutting activities for trustworthiness requirements are decomposed into processes or tasks and encapsulated in aspects that are woven into the base processes. In the weaving procedure, correct weaving methods between multiple aspects and between aspects and base processes are designed. Errors or mistakes of aspect-oriented process modeling are prevented. Finally, trustworthy third-party certification authority software is studied systematically in a case study, and performance evaluations are conducted to show the cost and effect of the approach. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","68","Process engineering","Petri nets - Weaving","Aspect oriented modeling - Functional requirement - Goal oriented modeling - Performance evaluations - Separation of concerns - Software process modeling - Software trustworthiness - Third party certification","819.5 Textile Products and Processing - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,"Number: 2016FB106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015Z020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017HC012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015SE202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 18BJL104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 61502413, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61262025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61662085, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61379032, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61862063, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 61862063, 61502413, 61262025, 61379032 and 61662085; National Social Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 18BJL104; Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 2016FB106; Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Educational Committee, Grant/Award Number: 2015Z020; Natural Science Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 2015SE202; Data‐Driven Software Engineering Innovative Research Team Funding of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 2017HC012; Software Engineering Innovative Research Team Funding of Yunnan University",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, expansion relevance do not directly capture the dis-similarity over a pair of nodes. Existing submodular algorithms are sequential and not easy to take full advantage of the power of distributed cluster computing platform, such as Spark, to significantly improve the efficiency of algorithm. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a distance metric, which is defined by a sum function of personalized PageRank scores over the symmetry difference of neighbors of a pair of nodes, is first introduced to capture the pairwise dis-similarity over pairs of nodes. Then, the problem of diversified ranking on graphs is formulated as a max-sum k-dispersion problem with metrical edge weight. A polynomial time 2-approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Considering the computational independence of different pairs of nodes, a MapReduce algorithm is further developed to boost the efficiency of the process. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real network datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © Copyright 2018, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A modified Heston model and recycled noises are employed to describe the dynamics of stock price and capital flow in the ensemble, respectively. The mean escape times of two sub-markets with a cubic nonlinearity are calculated by using numerical simulation. The results evidence that (i) there is a worst delay time or rate of capital inflow concerning the minimal stability of stock price and an optimal delay time or rate of capital outflow concerning the maximal stability of stock price when λ ≤ 0 (λ denotes strength of correlation between two Wiener processes of the stock price and the volatility); (ii) when λ > 0, the stability of stock price is maximally enhanced by an optimal delay time or rate of capital inflow and reduced by a worst rate of capital outflow, but monotonously strengthened by delay time of capital outflow. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For a given positive integer d, the subdivision-constrained routing requests problem (SCRR, for short) is to find a directed subgraph D′=(V′,A′) of D, satisfying the two constraints: (1) Each request (si,ti;Bi) has a path Pifrom sito tiin D′ with length w(Pi)=∑eΕPiw(e) no more than Bi; (2) Insert some nodes uniformly on each arc eΕA′ to ensure that each new arc has length no more than d. The objective is to minimize the total number of the nodes inserted on the arcs in A′. We obtain the following three main results: (1) The SCRR problem is at least as hard as the set cover problem even if each request has the same source s, i.e., si=s for each i=1,2,.,k; (2) For each request (s,t;B), we design a dynamic programming algorithm to find a path from s to t with length no more than B such that the number of the nodes inserted on such a path is minimized, and as a corollary, we present a k-approximation algorithm to solve the SCRR problem for any k requests; (3) We finally present an optimal algorithm for the case where P contains all possible requests (si,ti) in V×V and Biis equal to the length of the shortest path in D from sito ti.
