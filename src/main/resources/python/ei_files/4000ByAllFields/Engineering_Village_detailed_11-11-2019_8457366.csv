This paper measures the discrepancies of medical service among different areas by using Theil Index Analysis, and finds that the total difference of basic health service among east, middle, west and south areas decrease gradually. However, the equity of health institutions and hospital beds is significantly better than health workers. Through Theil Index composition analysis, we find that in aspects of health institutes and health workers, the key element for the inequality of health institutions is the imbalance within middle area, however, for the hospital beds inequity, the main factor is the inequality between areas. Therefore, to facilitate the equity of medical resources, it is necessary to have clear development strategy, optimize the structure of health input, set reasonable layout of health institutions, strengthen the health infrastructure, and improve the quality of health workers. © 2016 IEEE.","13","Health","Equalizers - Hospital beds - Hospitals","Composition analysis - Development strategies - Health Resources - Health services - Key elements - Medical services - Theil indices - Yunnan province","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 462.2 Hospitals, Equipment and Supplies - 713.5 Electronic Circuits Other Than Amplifiers, Oscillators, Modulators, Limiters, Discriminators or Mixers",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Many strong earthquakes have taken place in the past, and some of which resulted in massive damages and great losses of human lives. In this study we attempt to estimate the seismic hazard potential using two different approaches. Our first approach follows Kagan and Jackson (1994) and uses earthquake catalog data to estimate the mid-to long-term spatial probability of strong earthquakes, based on the assumption that earthquake likelihood is proportional to the intensity and quantity of past events. A retrospective test shows that the model offers reasonable 'forecasts' statistically over the last 37 years, based on the catalog data of previous 470 years for model constraints. Our second approach is to use secular geodetic strain rate deduced from GPS velocity data to constrain earthquake probability model, assuming that likelihood of strong earthquakes is spatially proportional to the geodetic strain rate. A retrospective test of the model with earthquake occurrence of the past 30 years shows that the model 'forecasted' poorly, but did reasonably well when comparing with the catalog data of the past 500 years, suggesting that the geodetic strain rate obtained at the decade scale may still be a good indicator of long-term earthquake activity in the region, but only at a time scale of hundreds of years.","34","Earthquakes","Faulting - Geodesy - Hazards - Seismic response - Strain rate","Earthquake activity - Earthquake catalogs - Earthquake occurrences - Probability modeling - Seismic hazard analysis - Seismic hazards - Sichuan-Yunnan region - Strong earthquakes","405.3 Surveying - 484 Seismology - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Understanding the drivers behind CO2emission changes can help decouple economic growth from CO2emissions. However, previous studies on the drivers of CO2emissions in less-developed regions that focus on both production and final demand have been seldom conducted. In this study, a structural decomposition analysis-logarithmic mean Divisia index (SDA-LMDI) model was developed to find the drivers behind the CO2emission changes during 1997-2012 in Yunnan, based on times series energy consumption and input-output data. The results demonstrated that the sharp rise in exports of high-carbon products from the metal processing and electricity sectors increased CO2emissions, during 2002-2007. Although increased investments in the construction sector also increased CO2emissions, during 2007-2012, the carbon intensity of Yunnan's economy decreased substantially because the province vigorously developed hydropower and improved energy efficiency in energy-intensive sectors. Construction investments not only carbonized the GDP composition, but also formed a carbon-intensive production structure because of high-carbon supply chains. To further mitigate CO2emissions in Yunnan, measures should promote the development and application of clean energy and the formation of consumption-based economic growth. © 2016 by the authors.","51","Carbon dioxide","Carbon - Construction industry - Decomposition - Economic analysis - Energy efficiency - Energy utilization - Industrial emissions - Investments - Supply chains - Truck drivers","CO2 emissions - Less-developed regions - Low carbon - Structural decomposition analysis - Yunnan province","405 Construction Equipment and Methods; Surveying - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 912 Industrial Engineering and Management - 912.4 Personnel - 913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The water demand variation characteristics of tobacco during the growing season were analyzed. The spatial analysis of water demand, net irrigation requirement and net irrigation requirement index of tobacco was done by using the ordinary Kringing method of GIS. The results showed that as the change of tobacco's growing season, its net irrigation requirement index was gradually decreased. And the years with net irrigation requirement index which was larger than zero could be accounted for about 54% in the middle of Yunnan Province. It was indicated that tobacco needed artificial irrigation in normal years. The most positive and negative correlation factors for net irrigation requirement of tobacco was precipitation.

The geochemistry of the Mid-Jurassic basalts at east part of the melange may provide tectonic environmental evidence for the formation of the rocks. The basalts distribute in Fengpingzhen-Wanding (south basalt belt) and Nujiang { north basalt belt) areas, where the rocks from the Nujiang area are dark grey, massive, vesicular and amygdaloidal in structure, and inter granular in texture. They all underwent greensehists facies metamorphism, with mineral assemblage of altered chlorite, epidote, albite, zeolite, titanite, potassium-magnesium ferro-aluminosilicate and residual Ti-bearing augite. The rocks are classified as sub-alkaline tholeiitic series, with middle MgO (5. 09% ~ 6. 20% ), rich in Ti (Ti02 1.64%-2. 14% ), Fe ( FeOT 9. 19% ~ 12. 80% ), and Na.0 > K20. The magma of the basalts with Mg∗ values ( Mg = Mg2V( Mg2 4 + Fe'4 ) ) of 0. 51-0. 59, experienced pyroxene and olivine fractional crystallization. Meanwhile, iron-enriched (relative low silicate) fractional crystallization tendency at low oxygen fugacity may exist for the magna. The basalts are rich in REE (∑REE 78. 52 x 10 ~6 ~ 99. 41 x l0-6) and fractional between LREEs and HREEs ( ( La/Yb )N =4. 06 ~ 5.54), without obvious Eu anomaly (5Eu=0.91 ~ 1.00). Meanwhile, they possess relatively high LILE ( Rb, Ba, Th and U) and HFSE ( Nb, Zr and Ti), with week Nb, Zr and Ti negative anomaly. High Zr/Y ( 3.58 ~5. 88 ), Ta/Yb (0.29 ~0. 51 ) and Th/Yb (I. 15 ~ I. 45) ratios as well as ( La/Nb) ratios (1.03-1. 41) reflect their affinity with continent. Relative high Nb concentrations ( 8. 83 x 10 6-15. 60 x 10 6 ) and ∑REE distinguish them from those of island arc ; lack of ocean crust around them together with Nb negative anomalies show their difference from seamount/OIB. The week Nb negative anomalies for magma are resulted from crustal contamination during upwelling. High Ti02, FeOr, ( La/Yb )N ratios as well as low suggest the basaltic magma sou reed from enriched garnet peridotite mantle, with relative lower degree partial melting for the Hongqiqian and Linggangzhai basalts and higher degree partial melting for the Nujiangxian basalts. Upon the limited scale, spatial distribution and short activation time of the Mid-Jurassic basaltic magmatism, the Nujiang area on eastern Gaoligong tectonic zone may have been extensional and depressed, producing rift magma, which may arise from closure of the Paleo-Tethys. © 2019 Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Institute of Plant and Environment Protection.

The study area is in Yunnan province, South China and hosts some Gold deposits. Multi-fractal power spectrum analysis was carried out by means of a new Spectrum-Area (S-A) method to decompose geochemical element grid maps into background and anomaly maps. The method can be implemented by a new GIS called GeoDAS. The newly developed multi-fractal power-spectrum method allows for the geochemical distributions to be modeled by their multifractal Fourier-transformed power-spectrum characteristics. Geochemical grid maps for elements related to gold mineralization were decomposed into background and anomaly maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the anomaly maps to compress most of the information into the first component so that it can be used as a prediction map for gold deposits. The resulting decomposed maps and principal component map were interpreted in the light of the geology of the study area.","9","Principal component analysis","Analytical geochemistry - Deposits - Financial data processing - Fractals - Geology - Gold deposits - Power spectrum - Spatial variables measurement - Spectrum analysis","Geochemical anomaly - Geochemical elements - Gold mineralization - Power spectrum method - Principal Components - Spectrum characteristic - Stream sediments - Yunnan province","481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 801 Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Due to the enhancing southwest Asian monsoon and increasing precipitation, the lake-level of the Erhai Lake began to rise after ca. 10329 a BP. Climate in the catchment was warm and wet during the mid-Holocene, and the warmest stage appeared in ca. 8399-6371 a BP. The lake-level descended in the mid-Holocene because of the decrease of effective moisture in the basin. Human activities appeared in ca. 6371 a BP, and the initial manner mainly focused on deforestation.

The concentrations of pp′-DDE, HCB and HCHs were undetectable to 1.86 μg l-1 (mean 0.27 μg l-1), undetectable to 0.72 μg l-1 (mean 0.11 μg l-1), and 0.24-21.95 μg l-1 (mean 7.39 μg l-1) respectively in lakes; and those in rivers were undetectable to 0.23 μg l-1 (mean 0.08 μg l-1), 0.68-2.93 μg l-1 (mean 1.70 μg l-1), and 2.71-37.56 μg l-1 (mean 17.01 μg l-1) respectively. Notably, some residue levels of OCPs exceeded the US National Recommended Water Quality Criteria, implying Yunnan has levels of OCPs potentially harmful to human health. Further, the contamination by OCPs showed an obvious spatial distribution pattern. Amongst the lakes, Dianchi, Xingyun, Lugu and Yangzonghai had the highest OCP levels dominated by β-HCH, whereas among rivers, Nujiang and Lancang Rivers had the highest contents of OCPs dominated by α-HCH. This demonstrates that HCHs are the predominant contaminants and some point sources of HCHs may still exist in Yunnan. The pollution levels in Yunnan were compared with other studies, suggesting the PFU method is suitable for long-term on-line monitoring of trace OCPs in aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, continuous studies monitoring OCPs in lakes and rivers are needed to further understand the future trend of contamination. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimens of Boletus edulis, Boletus ferrugineus, Boletus tomentipes, Leccinum rugosiceps, and Xerocomus sp. were described based on the UV spectra. From the results, all the specimens were characterized by strong absorption at the wavelengths of 274 and 284 nm and showed the shoulder at 296 nm. However, changes could be seen in the peak heights at the same wavelength for different samples. After analyzing by chemometrics, visual discrimination among samples was presented and the relationships among them were also obtained. This study showed that UV spectroscopy combined with chemometrics methods could be used successfully as a simple and effective approach for characterization of these five wild-grown edible mushrooms at species and genus levels.

In this article, we report on the patterns of predation and economic losses from wild carnivores preying on livestock in three villages of northern Baima Xueshan Nature Reserve, northwest Yunnan during a 2-year period between January 2010 and December 2011. We analyzed claims from 149 households that 258 head of livestock were predated. Wolves (Canis lupus) were responsible for 79.1 % of livestock predation; Asiatic black bears (Selenarctos thibetanus) and dholes (Cuon alpinus) were the other predators responsible. Predation frequency varied between livestock species. The majority of livestock killed were yak-cattle hybrids or dzo (40.3 %). Wolves killed fewer cattle than expected, and more donkeys and horses than expected. Wolves and bears killed more adult female and fewer adult male livestock than expected. Intensified predation in wet season coincided with livestock being left to graze unattended in alpine meadows far away from villages. On average, carnivore attacks claimed 2.1 % of range stock annually. This predation represented an economic loss of 17 % (SD = 14 %) of the annual household income. Despite this loss and a perceived increase in carnivore conflict, a majority of the herders (66 %) still supported the reserve. This support is primarily due to the benefits from the collection of nontimber resources such as mushrooms and medicinal plants. Our study also suggested that improvement of husbandry techniques and facilities will reduce conflicts and contribute to improved conservation of these threatened predators. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","53","Agriculture","Losses - Rural areas","Conflicts - Livestock - Nature reserves - Northwest Yunnan - Predator","821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The feasibility of LAIMobile was tested by comparing with LAI-2200 and GF-1 satellite data (GF = high resolution) in a pest-invaded Yunnan pine forest area in Yunnan province of China. Results show significant correlation between LAI-2200 and LAI-Mobile data for forest plots with coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.706 and Root Mean Square Error (RSME) = 0.241, and GF-1 satellite images (R2= 0.659 and RMSE = 0.268). The linear regression shows a good agreement between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and the inverted GF-1 LAI, with R2= 0.649, RMSE = 0.795.

Our objective is to analyze velocity anomalies that can reflect fault shearing and regional dynamic process at depths. We also like to locate low-velocity zones within the crust that are associated with lower crustal flows. The results reveal a prominent difference of crustal velocity structures across the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault. Bordered by the fault zone, velocity anomalies in the central Yunnan are parallel to the N-S trending faults like the Xiaojiang fault, the Yuanmou Fault and the Chenghai Fault, which reflect the deep effect of the clockwise rotation of the eastern Tibetan crust. Velocity anomalies in the southeastern Yunnan are parallel to the NW-SE trending faults like the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault, the Wuliang Shan Fault and the Lancang River Fault, which show the effect of the southeastward extrusion of the Indochina Block; whereas low-velocity anomalies along the Nanting River Fault are related to tectonic activities of the eastward motion of the Indo-Burma Block. The low-velocity anomalies within the crust are distributed at various depths and in different regions. They are observed in the upper-mid crust between the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault and the Lancang River Fault, and in the mid-lower crust near the Xiaojiang Fault and the Yuanmou Fault. In the lowermost crust and near the Moho, they are distributed throughout the central Yunnan, but limited by the Xiaojiang Fault to the east and by the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault to the west. We estimate that the low velocities in the Panxi region is related to the intersection of the Xiaojiang Fault and the Yuanmou Fault, that would provide heat flow channels for the crust-mantle thermal exchange in the rifting period. In the Ailao Shan-Red River region, besides the southeastward extrusion of the Indochina Block, the collision and eastward subduction of the Indo-Burma Block has also played a certain role in deep crustal deformation. The induced mantle upwelling would lead to a penetration of heat flows into the crust through the fault systems and to create the low-velocity layers within the crust. Therefore, the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault is not only a simple geological boundary between the Indochina Block and the South China Block, but also a border to control the deep crustal deformation and the ductile flow in the eastern and western sides.","41","Faulting","Deformation - Extrusion - Heat transfer - Percolation (fluids) - Rivers - Seismic waves - Seismographs - Seismology - Velocity - Wave propagation","Crustal deformations - Crustal velocity structure - Geological boundaries - Low-velocity anomaly - P-wave velocity structure - Red River - Seismic tomography - Yunnan region","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 641.2 Heat Transfer",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

From the perspective of hydrothermal fluid activity in the regional strata, we analyze the geological processes by which coalbed methane is enriched and accumulated in this region. Our results demonstrate that two stages of regional thermal fluid activity occurred in the western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan regions. In the earlier stage, calcium fluid acted as the carrier, but in the later stage, it was replaced by siliceous fluid with a small amount of calcium fluid. The former resulted from thermal cycling of fluid through the strata, and the latter was caused by injection of deeply sourced high temperature fluids. We propose three geological mechanisms by which hydrothermal fluid affected coalbed methane accumulation: stimulation for hydrocarbon generation, transformation for physical properties and fluid supercharging. The hydrothermal fluid impels coalbed methane to generate and migrate at high intensity; it also produces dense swarms of tubular pores that coincide with tectonic stress. As a result, the coal body is broken, and there are changes to the porosity and permeability of the coal. Pressure development in the regional gas reservoir depends on the intensity of the fluid effect and the differential leakage of fluid pressure in the coal reservoir. The relatively closed and stranded hydrothermal fluid environment of coal measure strata tends to lead to a high pressure coalbed methane system. The platform uplift in northwestern Guizhou is one such environment, in which the geological configuration of the high temperature fluid provided favorable conditions for the enrichment and accumulation of coalbed methane. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","45","Methane","Calcium - Coal - Coal bed methane - Coal deposits - Firedamp - Geology","Enrichment and accumulations - Geological characteristics - Geological configuration - Hydrocarbon generation - Hydrothermal fluids - Methane accumulation - Pressure development - Western guizhou and eastern yunnan","481.1 Geology - 503 Mines and Mining, Coal - 522 Gas Fuels - 524 Solid Fuels - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,"Number: 2016ZX05044, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41530314, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41502157, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Number: 41272175, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41272175 ), the State Key Program of the National Natural Science of China (Grant No. 41530314 ), China National Major Science Project (Grant No. 2016ZX05044 ), National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No. 41502157 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It's proven gold reserves have exceeded 350t, and associated copper, lead and zinc, iron, silver, sulfur have reached medium-large scale. Abundant previous studies have focused on the genesis of Beiya deposit, but some controversies still remain regarding the relationship between alkali-rich porphyry diagenesis and goldpolymetallic mineralization. In this study, the major and trace element of apatite from the Beiya ore-bearing and ore-barren alkali-rich porphyries were analyzed, and their compositional differences would throw light on the diagenetic and mineralized information recorded in apatite. The results show that all apatites from the ore-bearing and barren monzogranite porphyries are rich in F (most of them > 2%) and lack of CI (most of them Nin apatites from the Beiya porphyries. Compared to apatites from the Beiya orebearing porphyries, apatites from the Beiya barren porphyries have lower Ce/Pb and higher Th/U, and this reflects that the fluid activity of barren porphyries is weaker, leading to inconspicuous magmatic differentiation. It is also suggested that F/Cl in apatite from the ore-bearing porphyries could constrain the tectonic setting of porphyry deposits. For example, the F/Cl of apatites from the Beiya and Yulong ore-bearing porphyries are much higher than that from the Pulang, Chundu and Tongchanggou ore-bearing porphyries.

The results show that the Qiongzhusi Shale pores range from ultra-large pore to micropore. The transitional pores and micropores enhance pore volume and pore specific surface area. The pressurized mercury porosity has the positive correlated relationship with TOC content, but has a negative correlation with mineral content. Based on the forms of mercury curves and pore size distribution, the shale gas reservoir pore structure in this area is divided into S type which has low efficiency of mercury-ejection, but has good pore connectivity and reversed S type which is just the opposite of S type. Because of the associated reaction of illitization of kaolinite, the illite inherits the pore structure characteristics of kaolinite. The pore volume of open interconnected mesopores, transitional pores and micropores increase rapidly, and lead to the increase of porosity. However, because of the recrystallization of dissolved silicon during the diagenetic process, the cemented quartz makes part of the pores closed and semi-closed. With the increase of quartz, porosity decreases. With the effect of the two aspects, Qiongzhusi Shale pore structure has S type and reversed S type in this area. © 2015, China Coal Society.

With the development of agriculture, industry, and mining, the potential factors that may result in catastrophic ground-water pollutions are increasing. A phosphorus groundwater pollution event and its subsequent emergency treatment at Penshuidong Cave in Songming, Yunnan Province on February 24, 2008 were analyzed in addition to water quality monitoring in the region. The results showed that concentrations of phosphates, fluoride, cyanides and volatile phenols in phosphorus sludge waste liquid to be 11,532, 252, 224, 200 times higher than that of the Environmental quality standards for surface water (GB 3838-2002) III, respectively. The element phosphorus concentration was 16,510 times higher than the limit set by the Water quality standard for fisheries (GB11607-1989). The addition of quicklime and water to the phosphorus sludge waste liquid dumping pit clearly decreased pollutant concentrations, which indicates that the quicklime can remove the phosphorus from the waste liquid. Peak values of pollutant concentration decreased along the flow direction, which suggests the highly concentrated polluted water mass may be diluted during its movement. After treatment with water, a pollutant concentration peak appears at the groundwater outlet indicating that washing may accelerate the moving speed of the pollutants in groundwater.

The arc suffered Jurassic to Cretaceous arc-continental orogenic collision and Cenozoic intracontinental strike-slip shearing. The Hongshan Cu (-Mo-Pb-Zn) deposit is potentially a large deposit and contains two ore types: 1) predominant layered skarn Cu-(Pb-Zn) ores along marble-hornfels contacts; and 2) minor crosscutting vein-type Cu-Mo mineralization. Previous research forwards a two-stage genetic model without sufficient dating evidence, supposing the skarn mineralization is related to the Triassic calc-alkalic intrusions and the vein-type mineralization related to Cretaceous quartz monzonite porphyries. Re-Os dating of molybdenite from vein-type ores and quartz monzonite porphyries and that of pyrrhotite from skarn ores are presented here to constrain the mineralization age and rebuild the genetic model. Analyses of eight molybdenite samples yield an isochron age of 79.7 ± 3.1 Ma (MSWD = 9.2) for the vein-type mineralization and a model age of 81.9 ± 1.1 Ma for the quartz monzonite porphyries. Isotope data on seven pyrrhotite samples from the skarn ores yield an isochron age of 79 ± 16 Ma z(MSWD = 8.4). The Re-Os ages for the two ore types are concordant within analytical errors, indicating that the Hongshan deposit was formed in the Late Cretaceous. Elevated Re contents in molybdenite (13.65 to 63.91 μg/g) and extremely radiogenic initial187Os/188Os ratios in pyrrhotite (0.7673 to 0.8184; weighted average 0.796 ± 0.038), together with elevated γOsvalues in pyrrhotite (507 to 547; average 528) imply a significant crustal component in the ore-forming materials that was likely derived from a lower crustal reservoir. Combined with the tectonic evolution of the Zhongdian area and geochemical characteristics of corresponding intrusions, the ages of mineralization obtained in this study indicate that the Hongshan deposit was formed in a post-collision setting with a genetic relationship to the emplacement of the quartzmonzonite porphyry. These results provide significant new information for the study and exploration of the Late Cretaceous metallogeny in the Zhongdian area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","80","Mineralogy","Binary alloys - Copper - Copper alloys - Copper deposits - Deposits - Iron ores - Molybdenum alloys - Quartz - Rhenium alloys","China - Collisional - Metallogeny - Polymetallic - Yunnan - Zhongdian area","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals",,"Number: 40772061, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41072069, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 40930423, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research is jointly funded by the Chinese National Natural Science Fund ( 41072069 , 40930423 and 40772061 ) and the National Key Basic Research Development Program (973 Program) ( 2009CB421005 ).

For its peculiar location, the Mengdong Group-Complex has the important scientific significance to understand the tectonics of SE Yunnan,and even of South China and Tethys. In order to probe the metamorphism and deformation characteristics,by means of microscale observation such as optical microscope, electron microscope and electron probe,etc.,the characteristics of metamorphic-deformation have been studied in details. The results show that the macro styles of the Mengdong Group-Complex contain fold bedding,syntectonic secrete crystal veins,asymmetric shear lens,decollement sub-ductile structures,and the micro structures consist of mica fish,kink,quartz rectangular bank. Microscopic structure statistics data indicate that the Mengdong Group-Complex experienced the squeezing and stressing process in the directions of NE-SW,SE-NW,E-W and S-N,of which the result is similar to macro and micro structure.Meanwhile,the temperature of garnet-biotite mineral pairs in schist is 429 in average and the pressure of the schist is 0.5GPa. The temperature of tourmaline-biotite temperature in gneiss is 546 in average,corresponding to typical assemblages of the high green schist-low amphibolites facies. The U-Pb dating of titanite and rutile mineral suggests that the major metamorphism and deformation events occurred around ca. 236Ma and 170Ma.The above evidence shows that the Mengdong Group-Complex has experienced many metamorphic-deformation, and the principal stress of metamorphic-deformation (SE-NW) controls macrostructure framework of metamorphic Group-Complex(236Ca.), but S-N and E-W may be the directions of the sub-strain matched with the principal stress and NE-SW may be another direction after main metamorphic-deformation and age is confined to 170Ma. On behalf of the Laojunshan dome of early Yanshanian extensional-shear activity. Combined with other geochronological data,the Mengdong Group-Complex had undergone successively the large-scale thrust events in early Indosinian,the extension-shearing events in later Indosinian and early Yanshannian,and the contact metamorphism in later Yanshannian. Based on the study above, it can be outlined that the dynamic background of these metamorphic-deformation events is the Indosinian event, which is controlled the main features of the Mengdong Group-Complex. Laojunshan uplift of the dome began to activate in 236Ma,in consistent with the time of Tethys closure and collision, and stretched to 170Ma,after collapse of dome. NE directions widely developed klippe and offsite rock in Indosinian Wenshan-Malipo imply that pre-Indosinian formation belongs to the Mengdong Group-Complex and should be a set of foreigner rocky Nappe from Northern Vietnam.

However, the area is believed to have considerable prospecting potential. Gold deposits mainly occurring in the wall of the rock mass have been found in the upper-middle section of the Pingdingshan Group to the lower-bottom section of the Yinming Group in relation to the intrusive action and development of sodium diorite. It has been determined that the core of the anticline complex and its nearby fault zone are the major ore hosting structures and that gold-deposit prospecting should be conducted around the N-S compressive shear zone.

It is important to understand its geological background since it is basic for discussing mineralization of Wenyu ore area. This paper reports petrology, geochemistry and zircon LA-ICP-MS chronology of volcanic rocks from Xiaodingxi Formation in the mining area. Results show that they are composed of basaltic rocks and a small amount of acidic rocks, with SiO2ranging from 47.94%-54.02% and 76.92%-84.16%, respectively, exhibiting the features of bimodal volcanic rocks. Zircon U-Pb age of rhyolite is 238.4±2.4 Ma( MSWD=1.4), showing that volcanic rocks in Xiaodingxi Formation formed at Middle Triassic, rather than Late Triassic. The basaltic volcanic rocks are characterized by low Mg and high Al, belonging to shoshonite-high K calc-alkaline-calc-alkaline series, with strong negative Sr, Ti, Nb and Ta anomalies, weak negative Eu anomalies, and lower (La/Yb)Nratio and Mg#, Cr and Ni contents. Acidic volcanic rocks belong to peraluminous high K calc-alkaline series, with strong negative Sr, Ti, P, Nb, Ta, Ba and Eu anomalies. Nb/Ta and Th/Ce ratios are relatively consistent with those of continental crust, displaying characteristics of high Th and low Mg#, which suggests that it formed in an extension setting during a margin of arc (continent)-continent collision in the early Middle Triassic, which is a result of oceanic crust subduction slab break-off. In combination with regional volcanism and metallogenesis research data, it is concluded that multi-stage volcanism in the collision extension environment occurred many times during the Middle Triassic, indicating a good prospect of volcanism mineralization. © 2018, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

A total of 120 modern pollen samples were collected throughout the study area. The surface pollen assemblage was divided into eight pollen zones (Zones I–VIII) based on vegetation types. We analyzed the palynology and determined the hemeroby levels of each zone in the area. Our results showed that human activity is one of the most important factors that can result in the damage of natural vegetation and increase anthropochory and secondary plants. The hemeroby levels of the surface pollen samples were mainly euhemerobic except for Zones I, II, and VI, which indicates a strong and continuous anthropogenic influence in the central and western regions of Yunnan Province in recent decades. The lowest hemeroby values were observed in Zone I samples, which were collected from Mengla and Jinghong. These areas are in the Xishuangbanna region, which is the most biodiverse region in China and has been well preserved since 1959. Therefore, the extent of human influence of a region can be estimated from the degree of hemeroby established from pollen data, which can be used in the future for nature conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","44","Vegetation","Conservation","Anthropogenic influence - Hemeroby level - Modern pollen - Northwest of China - Yunnan province",,,"Number: XDA19050103, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41230101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572331, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41372183, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19050103 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grant No. 41230101 , 41372183 and 41572331 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Therefore, this paper tries to clarify the water footprint and detail virtual water flow features of a water-rich province, namely Yunnan province in China, to pursuit for more enlightenment for water conservation of not only water scarce regions but also water abundant regions. Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) method was adopted for water footprint and virtual water flow calculation. Results showed that the total water footprint of Yunnan was 11.35 billion m3, with 7.98 billion m3 (70%) of internal water footprint, demonstrating that Yunnan was a high water self-sufficient province. Moreover, Yunnan was a net virtual water exporter with a value of 1.18 billion m3, which was not good for Yunnan but was good for water scarce provinces. As for the detailed virtual water flow trade, high water intensity Guangxi, Hunan, Xinjiang were the top three net importers of Yunnan, while low water intensity Guangdong, Shanghai and Zhejiang were the top three export provinces of Yunnan. This did not affect Yunnan, but was not a good phenomenon for water sustainability of whole China. Moreover, agricultural sector was found to be the dominant sector for both virtual water import and export, accounting for about 88% and 86%, respectively. To maintain sustainable water management of both Yunnan and China, policy insights on keeping Yunnan as a net virtual water exporter, making use of its advantage in green water, adjusting trade structure by considering provincial water intensity were proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","36","Flow of water","Commerce - Hydraulics - Sustainable development - Water conservation - Water management","Agricultural sector - Input-output - Sustainable water management - Virtual water trade - Virtual water-flow - Water footprint - Water sustainability - Yunnan","444 Water Resources - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 632.1 Hydraulics",,"Number: 2017ZX07202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment; Number: 71603165, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71690241, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71810107001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2017ZX07202) of China, the Open Fund Program of Yunnan Key Laboratory, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71603165, 71690241, 71810107001) and Shanghai Municipal Government grant (17XD1401800).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In recent years, an important breakthrough has been achieved in the Beiya poly-metallic gold deposit prospecting, which made the Au reserves rank the super-large-scale class. Through precise measurement of the large scale structural sections, we identified the mechanical properties of typical rock- and ore-controlling structures and analyzed the mechanism of the structural control of porphyry emplacement and ore-formation. The main constructional compressive stress in the Beiya orefield transited from near EW-trending to near SN-trending and to near EW-trending, forming the typical folds-faults-joints rock- and ore-controlling structures system since Late Yanshanian. The basic folding structural framework formed under near EW-trending principal compressive stress during Late Yanshanian to Early Himalayan period provided favorable structural environment for the emplacement of the porphyries. The principal compressive stress turned to near SN-trending in Middle Himalayan, which was accompanied by the ultra-shallow intrusion of the quartz syenite porphyry and porphyry-type poly-metallic gold mineralization. The ore-bodies occurred in the interlayered faulted fracture zones, faults and joints which were distributed in belts type, veins type and layers type, and porphyry-type disseminated ore-bodies were formed in the porphyry, some skarn-type gold-rich ore-bodies were formed in the contact zones of porphyry and surrounding rock. The ore bodies are hosted in the interlayered faulted fracture zones, faults, and joints, occurring as banded, vein-type, and strata-form ores. Disseminated ores are located inside of the porphyry while the skarn-type ores are found in the contacts. During Late Himalayan, the nearly EW-trending compression resulted in the destruction of ore-bodies and porphyry, and to the subsequent uplift and denudation. The oxidizing-leaching-type ore-bodies were formed mainly in this period. © 2016, Science Press.

Well developed structures in the Beiya gold polymetallic ore-field composed a typical folds-faults-joints rock-and ore-controlling structural system and controlled the formation of the so called “five in one” deposits which constituted two metallogenic systems. I-Porphyry metallogenic system: (1) the porphyry type Cu-Au-(Fe) deposit that controlled by faults, joints and explosion breccia pipes in porphyry; (2) the skarn type Au-Fe-(Cu) deposit that controlled by the contact zone structure between country rock and porphyry; (3) the hydrothermal vein type Au-Fe deposit that controlled by interlayer fracture zone, faults and joints in country rock; (4) the low-medium temperature hydrothermal type Pb polymetallic deposit that controlled by the boundary between Qingtianbao formation sand-mudstone and Beiya formation limestone and interlayer fracture zone in Beiya formation. II-Oxidation leaching metallogenic system: (5) the oxidized-leached-enriched type Au deposit that controlled by karst caves and unconformities. Through the analysis of geometry, kinematics and mechanical property of the typical rock-and ore-controlling structures, this paper dissects ore-field structural system and discusses its ore-controlling processes. Since the Late Yanshanian-Early Himalaya, affected by the continuous collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, the main constructional compressive stress has experienced the transition sequentially from the nearly EW-to nearly SN-to NW-and to nearly EW-trending in the Beiya ore-field, and formed the SN, EW and NE structure belts which belong to the Jinshajiang-Chenghai SN structure belt of the Sanjiang-Central Yunnan meridional structural system, the Tangdan-Heqing-Lanping EW structure belt of the Yunnan latitudinal structural system and the Lijiang NE structure belt, respectively. It is believed that the EW structure belt was the dominant structural system which controlled the large-scale porphyry metallogenic system in the middle Himalaya. The early SN structure belt, formed in the early Himalaya, provided a favorable structural setting for porphyry emplacement and gold polymetallic mineralization.

The pre-treatment methods for each dosage form were investigated and optimized. The HPLC separation was performed on a Shim-pack C18reversed-phase column in gradient mode with UV detection at 203 nm. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r2≥ 0.9981) within the test ranges. Precisions and repeatabilities of the methods were better than 4.22 and 4.78%, respectively. Recoveries were better than 90.5%, even in the analysis of the least abundant saponins in a complex YNBY plaster. HPLC-ESI-TOF/MS was used for definite identification of compounds in the preparations. This proposed method was successfully applied to quantify the 13 bioactive constituents in 27 commercial samples to evaluate the quality of YNBY preparations. The overall results demonstrate that this method is simple, reliable, and suitable for the quality control of YNBY.

We investigated the seismicity of the Yunnan region using the multidimensional stress release model (MSRM) to evaluate the long-term seismic hazard. MSRM combines three factors that affect earthquake occurrence, i.e., initial stress background, tectonic loading, and coseismic stress transfer, and can simulate and forecast the spatiotemporal seismicity. In this study, a complete catalog comprising 28 strong earthquakes (M ≥ 6.5) after 1900 in the Yunnan region was investigated using MSRM. We calculated the spatiotemporal variations of seismicity rates, and found that strong earthquakes occur at locations with higher seismic activity. Comparisons between the seismicity rates at the epicenter locations immediately before and after strong earthquakes show that the seismicity rates in the vicinity of the epicenters significantly decrease after strong earthquakes. The estimated seismicity rates at the ending time (January 1, 2025) suggest that strong earthquake potential in the section between Kunming and Huaning of the Xiaojiang fault and the northeastern section of the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault should receive more attention, while the seismicity in the southwestern part decreases and the seismicity in the middle segment of the Red River fault remains low. © 2019","43","Earthquakes","Faulting","Background seismicity - Coseismic stress transfer - Stress release - Tectonic stress - Yunnan region","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis",,"Number: 41804048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41804094, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC1503400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41804094), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41804048), and the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Computational Geodynamics of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

To obtain the best calculation methods and assess its adaptability, Yunnan Province was divided into three regions, including the mountain plateau and high mountain water abundance region in western and southwestern of Yunnan (I), the mountain plateau and river valley water middle region in northwestern and northeastern of Yunnan (II) and the plateau water middle and shortage region in central and northern of Yunnan (III), and the daily ET0was calculated in 36 stations from 1958 to 2013. Ten kinds of methods, such as FAO 56 Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves-Samani, Irmark-Allen, Pristley-Taylor, Makkink, 1948 Penman, Penman-Van Bavel, Turc, FAO 24 Radiation and Jensen-Haise, were used to calculate the daily ET0of each station of Yunnan Province. Penman-Monteith method was used as the standard method to calculate the daily ET0because of its accuracy, and the precision of other methods was evaluated by the linear regression coefficient, the daily relative root mean square error, the mean bias error and the coefficient of Nash-Sutcliffe. The results showed that 1948-Penman method had the strongest applicability and the highest calculation accuracy, and Radiation FAO 24 method and Jensen-Haise method had large error. Among all the methods, Hargreaves-Samani method was the best one in region I, and 1948-Penman method was the most appropriate from January to June while Priestley-Taylor method was the most suitable from July to December of each year for regions II and III. In the spatial distribution of relative error, the relative error of Hargreaves-Samani method, Irmark-Allen method and Priestley-Taylor method was below 20%, so the three methods were appropriate for region I, and the relative error of Priestley-Taylor method and 1948-Penman method was in the range of 0~20%, as the minimum in regions II and III, and the relative error of Irmark-Allen method was small in region II. When reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated in Yunnan Province, as a consequence, 1948-Penman method was recommended in the whole region, Hargreaves-Saman method was recommended in mountain plateau and high mountain water abundance region in western and southwestern of Yunnan, Priestley-Taylor method was recommended in mountain plateau and river valley water middle region in northwestern and northeastern of Yunnan. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

These annual cyclic movements exhibit a high degree of spatialuniformity as a whole, while some spatial differences exist across regions. GPS seasonalvertical time-series show strong consistency with GRACE (Gravity Recovery andClimate Experiment) data, providing further indication that regional deformation exerts adominant effect on the GPS vertical time-series. Over the period, the Yunnan area featuredsubstantial precipitation that shows significant annual periodicity and a strong correlationwith the GPS vertical time-series. The seasonal precipitation is therefore concluded to bethe regional dominant factor that governs vertical cyclic crustal movements in this area. Differencesin topography and precipitation between western and eastern Yunnan (i.e. acrossthe Jinshajiang-Red River Fault) result in a greater magnitude of SVCM in western Yunnancompared to that in eastern Yunnan.

One of the pressing requirements from the user community is an improved ability to detect small fires (less than 50 ha), whose impact on terrestrial environments is empirically known but poorly quantified, and is often excluded from global earth system models. The newest generation of BA algorithms combines the capabilities of both the BA and AF detection approaches, resulting in a general improvement of detection compared to their predecessors. Accuracy assessments of these products have been done in several ecosystems; but more complex ones, such as regions that are characterized by frequent small fires and steep terrain has never been assessed. This study contributes to the understanding of the performance of global BA and AF products with a first assessment of four selected datasets: MODIS-based MCD45A1; MCD64A1; MCD14ML; and, ESA's Fire_CCI in a mountainous region of northwest Yunnan; P.R. China. Due to the medium to coarse resolution of the tested products and the reduced sizes of fires (often smaller than 50 ha) we used a polygon intersection assessment method where the number and locations of fire events extracted from each dataset were compared against a reference dataset that was compiled using Landsat scenes. The results for the two sample years (2006 and 2009) show that the older, non-hybrid products MCD45A1 and, MCD14ML were the best performers with Sørensen index (F1 score) reaching 0.42 and 0.26 in 2006, and 0.24 and 0.24 in 2009, respectively, while producer's accuracies (PA) were 30% and 43% in 2006, and 16% and 47% in 2009, respectively. All of the four tested products obtained higher probabilities of detection when smaller fires were excluded from the assessment, with PAs for fires bigger than 50 ha being equal to 53% and 61% in 2006, 41% and 66% in 2009 for MCD45A1 and MCD14ML, respectively. Due to the technical limitations of the satellites' sensors, a relatively low performance of the four products was expected. Surprisingly, the new hybrid algorithms produced worse results than the former two. Fires smaller than 50 ha were poorly detected by the products except for the only AF product. These findings are significant for the future design of improved algorithms aiming for increased detection of small fires in a greater diversity of ecosystems. © 2017 by the authors.","83","Fires","Ecosystems - Radiometers","Burned areas - ESA CCI - Mountainous regions - Northwest Yunnan - Small fire","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments",,"Number: 2015FB157, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31560599, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31560118, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31560599 and 31560118), and Science Foundation of Yunnan (2015FB157).

Results show that the schists have Vpanisotropy (AVp) ranging from 16.4% to 25.5% and maximum Vsanisotropy [AVs(max)] between 21.6% and 37.8%. The mylonite has lower AVpand AVs(max) but slightly higher foliation anisotropy, which are 13.2%, 18.5%, and 3.07%, respectively, due to the lower content and CPO strength of mica. With increasing mica content, the deformed rocks tend to form transverse isotropy (TI) with fast velocities in the foliation plane and slow velocities normal to the foliation. However, the presence of prismatic minerals (e.g., amphibole and sillimanite) forces the overall symmetry to deviate from TI. An increase in feldspar content reduces the bulk anisotropy caused by mica or quartz because the fast-axis of feldspar aligns parallel to the slow-axis of mica and/or quartz. The effect of quartz on seismic properties of mica-bearing rocks is complex, depending on its content and prevailing slip system. The greatest shear-wave splitting and fastest Vpboth occur for propagation directions within the foliation plane, consistent with the fast Pms (S-wave converted from P-wave at the Moho) polarization directions in the west Yunnan where mica/amphibole-bearing rocks have developed pervasive subvertical foliation and subhorizontal lineation. The fast Pms directions are perpendicular to the approximately E-W orienting fast SKS (S-wave traversing the core as P-wave) directions, indicating a decoupling at the Moho interface between the crust and mantle beneath the region. The seismic data are inconsistent with the model of crustal channel flow as the latter should produce a subhorizontal foliation where vertically incident shear waves suffer little splitting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","104","Shear flow","Anisotropy - Crystallography - Feldspar - Metamorphic rocks - Mica - Mica deposits - Quartz - Seismic waves - Seismology - Shear waves - Silicate minerals - Structural geology","Schist - Seismic anisotropy - Shear wave splitting - Tibetan Plateau - Transverse isotropy - West Yunnan","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline Solids",,"Number: -, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for a discovery grant to Ji.

Warming trends of nighttime minimum temperature are more pronounced than those of daytime maximum temperature, especially during winter season. Consequently, a decreasing trend of diurnal temperature ranges (DTR = Tmax- Tmin) was observed. Five spatial patterns of temperature variability were objectively defined by rotated empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, which are associated with distinct temporal temperature variations and geographical area over the YP.

By the petrographical and petrochemical studies and the analyses using electron microprobe, scanning electron microscopy and energy spectrum, we confirmed that the connection was brought about by the deep geological processes and the action of ore-bearing mantle fluids. Microscopic traces and existing modalities of the deep processes and the mantle fluid action can be directly manifested as the following: Na-rich glass interpenetrated among deep xenoliths in a veined or disseminated manner; Fe-rich glasses interpenetrated in a veined, agglomerated or disseminated manner among the host rocks and various xenoliths; and iron-rich melt xenoliths as independent xenoliths existed in aegirine syenite porphyry. Both the Fe-rich glasses and iron-rich melt xenoliths are of submicroscpic crystalline texture under the electron microscope. Their main mineral compositions are silicate and quartz, as well as moissanite, native iron with chromium, specularite with titanium, ilmenite, apatite, etc. The unmixing texture, which is assumed to be caused by the unmixing of minerals between micro-metal and nonmetal, indicates that the mantle fluid has the properties of magmatic melt and is unmixing with alkali-rich magma. On the basis of synthesis analyses and in combination with the theory of metallogenesis by transmagmatic fluid, we may draw the following conclusions: the mantle fluid's properties were changed from magma-supercritical fluid→liquid by the changes of depth and environment, and corresponding changes of physical and chemical conditions, and the moving fluid carried, activated and enriched ore-material to suitable places; it was the deep process and the action of fluid that accelerated crust-mantle materials overlapping mineralization, facilitated the deep ore-forming and benefited the formation of large and supper-large deposits. © 2011 IEEE.","14","Ores","Chemical analysis - Deposits - Effluent treatment - Glass - Iron - Mineralogy - Phosphate minerals - Remote sensing - Scanning electron microscopy - Silicates - Silicon carbide - Structural geology - Supercritical fluids","Alkali-rich porphyry - Crust mantle - Mantle fluids - Unmixing - Western yunnan","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 545.1 Iron - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.3 Glass - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The Boyun ichnoassemblage is middle Anisian in age and is dominated by robust Rhizocorallium, while the JMC ichnoassemblage is of an early Anisian age and is characterized by the presence of Zoophycos. The ichnoassemblage horizons of the Boyun section represent an inner ramp environment, while the JMC section was likely situated in a mid-ramp setting near storm wave base as indicated by the presence of tempestites. The ichnofossil-bearing successions are usually highly bioturbated in both the Boyun (BI 3–5, BPBI 5) and JMC (BI 3–4, BPBI 3–4) sections. Three large, morphologically complicated ichnogenera: 1) Rhizocorallium; 2) Thalassinoides; and, 3) Zoophycos characterize the Anisian ichnocoenoses. Of these, Rhizocorallium has mean and maximum tube diameters up to 20.4 mm and 28 mm, respectively, while Thalassinoides mean and maximum tube diameters are 14.2 mm and 22 mm, respectively. Zoophycos is present in the early Anisian strata of the JMC section, and represents the oldest known occurrence of this ichnogenus following the latest Permian mass extinction. Similar to coeval ichnoassemblages elsewhere in the world, the Yunnan ichnocoenoses embrace a relatively low ichnodiversity, but their burrows usually penetrate deeply into the sediment, and include large and complex Rhizocorallium and Thalassinoides. All of these ichnologic features are indicative of recovery stage 4 after the latest Permian crisis. Anisian ichnoassemblages occur globally in six different habitat settings, and all show similar ecologic characteristics except for slightly different degrees of ichnotaxonomic richness, indicating that depositional environment is not a crucial factor shaping the recovery of the trace-makers, but may have an impact on their ichnodiversity. When compared with some important Early Triassic (mainly Spathian) ichnoassemblages worldwide, the Anisian ichnocoenoses examined for this study are slightly less diversified, and possess more or less the same maximum burrow sizes, but the penetration depth of burrows and the distribution of burrow sizes are much larger than those from the Early Triassic. It is worthy of note that the lower ichnodiversity of the Anisian ichnocoenoses may have resulted from intense bioturbation by deeper tiers, representing a taphonomic product that is totally unrelated to environmental stress. In addition, Anisian Rhizocorallium and Thalassinoides have much larger burrow sizes than the same ichnotaxa from the Lower Triassic, implying that ichnocoenoses may have recovered in Spathian, but did not stabilize until the Anisian. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","83","Recovery","Ecosystems - Penetration depth (superconductivity) - Stratigraphy","Burrow complexity - Burrow size - Depositional environment - Environmental stress - Ichnology - Recovery stages - Triassic biotic recoveries - Yunnan province","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 708.3 Superconducting Materials",,"Number: Wuhan, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: GPMR201302, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CSUF, Sponsor: California State University, Fullerton; Number: 41572091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41772007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: B08030, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","We thank both Richard Hofmann and Luis Buatois for their critical comments and constructive suggestions, which have improved greatly the quality of the paper.

How serious will the damage be if stronger earthquakes occur in similar regions in the future? In this study, we conducted a field investigation and analyzed the damage caused by earthquake-triggered geohazards. The geohazards were found to be determined by the geological setting of the earthquake-struck region, especially by lithology and tectonics. Two lithological types were limestone and argillaceous sandstone. The serious geohazards induced by collapses and landslides mainly occurred in the limestone region along the Luoze River. During the earthquakes, the brecciated limestone was scattered into collapses and landslides that resulted in serious hazards. Devastating mudflow resulting from heavy rains also occurred after the earthquakes. For disaster relief in similar situations, some reasonable measures should be adopted. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","11","Earthquakes","Disaster prevention - Engineering geology - Hazards - Landslides - Lime - Limestone - Lithology - Losses","Collapses and landslides - Disaster relief - Economic loss - Field investigation - Geo-hazards - Geological setting - Heavy rains - Yunnan province","481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
