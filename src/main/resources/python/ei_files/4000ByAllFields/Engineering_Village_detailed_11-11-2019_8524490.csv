Particularly, affected by the natural environment, cable phase error is produced, thus the traditional measurement method that depends on different environmental experience value to correct phase error is complex and inaccurate. According to the principle of low frequency antenna array phase measurement, this paper suggests a better method, which uses AD8302 to transfer the two calibration source signal phase difference of the receiver and transfer feeder to the corresponding direct voltage, then realizes single channel AD sampling with 12 bits quantization accuracy, finally does the error analysis and correction to achieve phase error correction. Through testing the precision of phase error of the cable given by the system under measuring conditions of low frequency (2MHz), high frequency (300MHz), etc. We can prove the system has a very high reliability, thus could be widely used in related antenna array error correction and cable error measurement. © 2016 IEEE.","6","Antenna arrays","Cables - Directional patterns (antenna) - Error correction - Phase measurement - Quantization (signal) - Radio astronomy - Signal receivers","AD8302 - Antenna array errors - Astronomical observation - Measurement technologies - Natural environments - Phase difference detections - Phase error correction - Quantization accuracy","657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 713.3 Modulators, Demodulators, Limiters, Discriminators, Mixers - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Globally mountainous areas occupy about one fifth of Earth's surface. However, few studies focused on landscape multifunctionality in mountainous areas. Taking Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, China, as a case study area, five typical landscape functions (net primary productivity, soil retention, water yield, crop production, and residential support) were quantified and mapped. Hotspots of multiple landscape functions were identified using spatial overlap tools, interaction between each landscape function pair was discussed through Spearman's rank correlation analysis, and development zoning was conducted based on landscape function bundle. The results showed that, about 61% of the study area had at least one kind of landscape function hotspot, with only 2.7% covering three or more kinds of landscape function hotspots. Significant trade-offs or synergies existed between all pairs of landscape functions, except the pair of net primary productivity and residential support. With the application of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) method, the study area was divided into four types of development zones (i.e. ecological shelter area, ecological transition area, suburban development area, and urban agglomeration area) which were all corresponding to different landscape function bundles. This study could provide spatial guidance for differentiated sustainable developing in mountainous areas according to local conditions of landscape multifunctionality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","72","Self organizing maps","Commerce - Conformal mapping - Cultivation - Economic and social effects - Ecosystems - Housing - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Zoning","Landscape functions - Multifunctional landscape - Net primary productivity - Northwestern Yunnan - Spearman's rank correlation analysis - Suburban development - Trade off - Urban agglomerations","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 741.1 Light/Optics - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 971 Social Sciences",,"Number: B14001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41322004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41322004 ), and the 111 Project ( B14001 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Secondly, we utilize the DEA model to solve this problem, and the DEA model is designed to calculate efficiency scores of Decision Making Units to obtain a weighted sum of either several inputs or several outputs without using the priori information. Because the performance of the DEA model greatly relies on input and output variables choosing, we propose a two stages DEA model to evaluate the operating performance of insurance companies.

There are two challenges in the traditional supervised machine learning. One is that the test data distribution always differs largely from the training data distribution in the real world, while another is that there is usually very few labeled data to train a machine learning model. In such cases, transfer learning, which emphasizes the transfer of the previous knowledge from different but related domains and tasks, is recommended to deal with these problems. Traditional transfer learning methods care more about the data itself rather than the task. In fact, there is no one universal feature representation can perfectly benefit the model training work. But different feature representations can discover some independent latent knowledge from the original data. In this paper, we propose an instance-based transfer learning method, which is a weighted ensemble transfer learning framework with multiple feature representations. In our work, mutual information is applied as the smart weighting schema to measure the weight of each feature representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three facial expression recognition data sets: JAFFE, KDEF and FERG-DB.

Next, the visible and background images are decomposed to a series of low-pass and band-pass images by NSCT, respectively. Then, fuse the obtained images to produce the fused background image by different strategies in each band, in which Gaussian fuzzy logic is used to produce the low-pass coefficient; the spatial frequency of each band-pass image is used to determine the linking strength β value of pulse coupled neural network structure, and the result is used to fuse the band-pass images. Eventually, the fused image is produced combining the target image and the fused background image.

Locally adaptive regression kernels (LARK), which is a method for rapid detection and localization of specific targets, is a kind of image analysis method without training, and can be used to search for specific target images quickly. It operates using a single example of an object as a query image to find similar matching in a target image. Firstly, features are preliminarily extracted from the query image using the local steering kernels as descriptors, and then salient features are further extracted using locality preserving projection (LPP). And then the comparison between the target image and the query image is done using the cosine similarity criterion to find all possible similar objects.

Based on the estimation, a blocking seeds mining algorithm for finite uncertain negatively influence sources is proposed to maximize expected influence blocking utility. Second, for the case of huge amount of negatively influence sources with uncertainty, a blocking seeds mining algorithm based on the sampling average approximation approach is proposed to balance the tradeoffs between scalability and effectiveness of the influence blocking maximization.

As a consequence, single organizations may be dealing with collections of hundreds or thousands business process models. In order to support this abundance of business process modeling flexibility and improve business process models reusability, separation of concerns is used to separate the crosscutting activities and basic activities in accordance with the different functions of these activities, and an aspect-oriented business process modeling framework is proposed. This framework provides a reusable process modeling method and also provided a flexible and controllable way to assure correctness of the whole business process models. In the framework, an aspect-oriented business process meta-model is defined first. The crosscutting concerns activities are encapsulated as crosscutting aspects, while the basic business activities are modeled in basic processes. Then, according to the correctness requirements of the business process model, based on the weaving characteristics of aspect-oriented approach, weaving correctness is defined. Weaving correctness criteria between multi-aspects and between aspects and basic processes are designed. Errors or mistakes of aspect-oriented business process modeling are prevented during the procedure of modeling. In addition, a detection method for errors or mistakes in process modeling is proposed to ensure error-free business process modeling. Based on the meta-model and the correctness criteria and the detection method, an aspect-oriented business process modeling approach is proposed. The corresponding correctness of the structures, properties and behaviors are proved. Thirdly, an aided tool TPAT (Trustworthy business Process Aided Tool) is developed to provide modeling support. Finally, the theory, the approach and the tool were used in the cases of two banking business processes. Through the case study and performance evaluation, the theory and the approach are proved to be feasible and the tool is proved to be effective. Aspect-oriented modeling is suitable for providing flexible and reusable business process modeling. By adopting the correctness criteria and detecting errors and mistakes during modeling, aspect-oriented business process modeling approach assures the correctness of process models and provides better process-oriented support and adaptability to the ever-change environment. © 2018, Science Press.

ZnO NPs-CGR was homogeneously dispersed in NF and dropped on the surface of GCE. ZnO NPs-CGR-NF possessed excellent conductivity, catalysis and biocompatibility which were attributed to the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs, CGR and NF. ZnO NPs-CGR-NF/GCE provided a hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of 126 μM, which was then oxidized to produce a detectable and fast response. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected chlorpyrifos and carbofuran ranging from 1.0 × 10-13to 1 × 10-8M and from 1.0 × 10-12to 1 × 10-8M. The detection limits for chlorpyrifos and carbofuran were 5 × 10-14M and 5.2 × 10-13M, respectively. The developed biosensor exhibited many advantages such as good sensitivity, stability, reproducibility and low cost, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors.

An experimental research on a 3-span prestressed continuous rigid frame model bridge with a superstructure made of CL50 HSLWC is presented in this paper. The prototype of the bridge model is located in the 14th section of the highway connecting Anning and Chuxiong in Yunnan province. The model bridge was designed by the scale of 1/4 and was tested under 10 different load cases. The test results showed that the prestressed HSLWC continuous rigid frame model bridge had good mechanical performance. Under a traffic load which was 1.0 to 1.5 times of its design load, all indices of the bridge model satisfied the requirement of design standard. And under 2 times of design load, parts of indices were beyond the standard requirement but the bridge still showed good ductility. And under very large overload situation, the bridge was damaged seriously but it still could maintain the load capacity and did not collapse.","11","Bridges","Deformation - Ductility - Light weight concrete - Prestressed concrete - Rigidity","High-strength-light-weight concrete - Model experiment - Residual deformation - Rigid frame bridge","401.1 Bridges - 412 Concrete - 421 Strength of Building Materials; Mechanical Properties - 951 Materials Science","Experimental (EXP)",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Existing influence blocking methods assume negative influence sources are definitely known or non-adversarial. However, in real applications, it is hard to obtain the accurate information of influence sources. In addition, adversarial spreader may strategically select the seeds to maximize negative spread. In this paper, we aim to tackle the problems of influence blocking maximization with uncertain and strategic negative influence sources respectively. First, in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms for mining blocking seeds, we discuss approximate estimation of the influence spread of negative seeds under the competitive linear threshold model. Based on the estimation, we propose a blocking seeds mining algorithm under the situation of finite uncertain and negative influence sources to maximize the expected influence blocking utility. In adversarial influence spread situations, one entity strategically attempts to maximize negative influence spread while the other one tries to block the negative propagation of its competing entity as much as possible by selecting a number of seed nodes that could initiate its own influence propagation. We model the interaction as a game and propose a polynomial time approximate algorithm for solving random blocking strategy based on min-max principle to decrease the worst negative influence spread. Finally, we make experiments on real data sets of social networks to verify the feasibility and scalability of the proposed algorithms. © 2016, Science Press.

However, whether this kind of earthquake behaviour can be extrapolated over long-time periods is not well addressed. Herein, we present about an 8000 yr earthquake record using palaeoseismological techniques from the Zemuhe fault (ZMHF) to assess the earthquake behaviour and show the complexity of faulting within the region of the Tibetan Plateau. The ZMHF along with the Anninghe (ANHF) and Xiaojiang (XJF) faults, form the N-S-striking active fault zone at the tectonic boundary of the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In the historical record, a large earthquake occurred in 1850 AD at M 7.5 along the ZMHF, with a coseismic left-lateral displacement of 3.6-4.8 m along the Daqingliangzi section where we excavated several trenches in a small triangular-shaped sag pond. We analyse the depositional sequences and deformation evidence in the trenches to recreate the sequence of earthquakes that occurred from the early Holocene until the present. From trenching and14C ages, five palaeoseismic events are identified and named Z through V from youngest to oldest at 1370 AD-present, 690-940 AD, 5900-1400 BC, 6590-6350 BC and 7380-7110 BC. We associate two young events Y and Z with the historical records of 814 AD M 7 and 1850 AD M 7.5, respectively. Moreover, integrated palaeoearthquake results on ages of one event occurred slightly younger than 1700-1100 BC and 1540-1270 BC from previous palaeoseismic studies, we further constrain the age of event X at 1700-1400 BC. The average recurrence interval of earthquakes at the Daqingliangzi section on the ZMHF is about 2300 yr. The recurrence interval of palaeoseismic events during the early Holocene and late Holocene is shorter than that of the middle-Holocene. The interval between event V and W is 1030-520 yr, 2514-2214 yr between X and Y and 1036 yr between Y and Z; however, the recurrence interval betweenWand X is much longer at 5190-4650 yr. Holocene surface-faulting events along the ZMHF appear to be unevenly spaced in time. The irregular recurrence intervals of earthquakes on the ZMHF might be related to complexity of fault interactions in the left-lateral fault system located along the eastern and northern boundaries of the Sichuan-Yunnan block and may indicate regional irregularities of large earthquakes within the southeastern region of the Tibetan Plateau. © The Authors 2013.

This work proposes a new scheme to fuse computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) images into a single image. A novel two-stage medical image fusion scheme, which is based on non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) and simplified pulse coupled neural networks (S-PCNNs), is proposed in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. Firstly, CT and MRI images are decomposed into a set of low and high frequency coefficients by NSST, PET images are transformed into the HSV color space, and then the V component of PET image in the HSV color space. Secondly, intersecting cortical models (ICMs) are utilized to extract the edges and outlines in a larger area from the high frequency coefficients, and S-PCNNs are employed to describe the subtly detailed information in a smaller area. Thirdly, different fusion rules are designed to fuse the corresponding low and high frequency coefficients. At last, the fused medical image is obtained by the inverse HSV and NSST transformation, successively. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective, and it can fuse more information into the final images than conventional methods. © 2018","56","Color image processing","Color - Computerized tomography - Image fusion - Inverse problems - Magnetic resonance - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging - Neural networks - Object recognition - Positron emission tomography","Color space - Intersecting cortical models - Multi-sensor information fusion - Multimodal medical image fusions - Pulse coupled neural network - Shearlet transforms","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741.1 Light/Optics - 746 Imaging Techniques",,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BIOINT, Sponsor: Biological Interactions Doctoral Programme; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this paper.

However, most of the acquired data are uncertain because of the gaps in data collection or to maintain subject privacy. Thus, we investigate co-location pattern mining problem in the context of uncertain data. The prevalent co-location pattern under uncertain environments has two different definitions. The first definition, referred as the expected prevalent co-location, employs the expected interest degree of co-location to measure whether this pattern is frequent. The second definition, referred as the probabilistic prevalent co-location, uses the probabilistic formulations to measure frequency. Here a novel system called UMine is proposed to compare this two different definitions with a user-friendly interface. The core of a system such as this is the mining algorithm, and UMine is integrated with the expected mining method, probabilistic mining method, and approximate mining method. In this paper, the system is introduced in detail, and the comparison between these two types of definitions is implemented. The experimental results show that the difference between these two definitions’ result sets changes as the threshold changes. By flexibly adjusting the parameters, users can observe interesting patterns in the data. In addition, the demonstration provides data generation and preprocessing function while showing its practicality for either real-world or synthetic data sets.

The high performance in detecting butane were achieved for the well-adhered products with unique porous surface appearance on the sensors fabricated using indirect heating method, which demonstrated the superiority of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) in synthesizing complex oxides. The possible explanations of the high butane gas-sensing characteristics of these sensors were based on the results of BET and XPS. The large surface area could provide sufficient interface between the materials and butane gas, and the adsorbed oxygen species having strong oxidation activity could break the butane molecules into CO2and H2O. The gas-sensing properties of Pt-modified AZO were investigated by testing the gas responses towards butane. The maximum response of the 5% Pt-AZO based gas sensor reached 56.52–3000 ppm butane at 200 °C. What's more, the sensor also exhibited good short- and long-term stability, repeatability and selectivity, which made it a potential candidate in the application of monitoring butane.

However, the most existing techniques in many cases cannot gain good fusion performance and acceptable complexity simultaneously. In order to improve image fusion efficiency and performance, we propose a lightweight multi-focus image fusion scheme based on Laplacian pyramid transform (LPT) and adaptive pulse coupled neural networks-local spatial frequency (PCNN-LSF), and it only needs to deal with fewer sub-images than common methods. The proposed scheme employs LPT to decompose a source image into the corresponding constituent sub-images. Spatial frequency (SF) is calculated to adjust the linking strength β of PCNN according to the gradient features of the sub-images. Then oscillation frequency graph (OFG) of the sub-images is generated by PCNN model. Local spatial frequency (LSF) of the OFG is calculated as the key step to fuse the sub-images. Incorporating LSF of the OFG into the fusion scheme (LSF of the OFG represents the information of its regional features); it can effectively describe the detailed information of the sub-images. LSF can enhance the features of OFG and makes it easy to extract high quality coefficient of the sub-image. The experiments indicate that the proposed scheme achieves good fusion effect and is more efficient than other commonly used image fusion algorithms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","38","Image fusion","Image enhancement - Image processing - Laplace transforms - Neural networks - Object recognition","Efficiency and performance - Fusion performance - Image fusion algorithms - Laplacian Pyramid - Multifocus image fusion - Oscillation frequency - Pulse coupled neural network - Spatial frequency",,,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: 61640306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

The drought indexes value in three reference periods (12 months, 6 months and 3 months) were calculated for each indexes, and the correlation between meteorological and hydrological drought in the basin were also analysed. The results show that there were increasing drought trend, especially, that represented by SPEI-6M and SPEI-3M since 2000s; the drought occurred with multi-scale periodic characteristics. After the mid-90s, the large-scale 25-30 years periodicity gradually moved down to the 10-15 years periodicity. After 2000s, the runoff drought has changed into a weakened drought period over 25 years; but on the mesoscale periodicity with 10-15 years, it is in a transition period from drought to semi humid. Runoff drought is closely related to meteorological drought. Meteorological drought index SPEI-6M could be used to predict annual runoff drought. © 2019 Peking University.","36","Drought","Climate change - Rivers - Runoff","Drought indices - Drought periods - Hydrological droughts - Meteorological drought - Meteorological station - Standard precipitation indices - Temperature data - Transition period","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
