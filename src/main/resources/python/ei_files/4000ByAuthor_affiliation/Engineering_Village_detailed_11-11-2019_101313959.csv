Recently, many researchers focused on mining disease diagnosis to innovate the hidden patterns and their relevant features. Mining bio-medical data is one of the predominant research areas where clustering techniques are emphasized in heart disease diagnosis. But few people deal with large heart disease datasets and then classify disease data sets according to heart disease feature. We propose a method of anomaly threshold based on multiple classifiers can be well suited to datasets containing abnormal data, and use XGBoost algorithm as a sub-classifier to process massive ECG data. This research focuses on the heart disease classification problem. The data set is divided into two categories, and then it was classified into more specific categories, experimental results show that this method can improve classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on massive instances of different heart disease obtained from the hospital actual cases and two data sets of UCI. In fact, we compared SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, Logistic, RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, and found that tree-based model classifier is the best fit to predict arrhythmia. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance to the processing and forecasting system of large medical data sets, and promote the development of wisdom medical care. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Here, we investigate the recently discovered retrograded eclogites from this suture zone in terms of their petrological, geochemical and geochronological features, with the aim of constraining the metamorphic evolution and protolith signature. Two types of metabasites are identified: retrograded eclogites and mafic schists. The igneous precursors of the retrograded eclogites exhibit rare earth element distribution patterns and trace element abundance similar to those of ocean island basalts, and are inferred to have been derived from a basaltic seamount in an intra-oceanic tectonic setting. In contrast, the mafic schists show geochemical affinity to arc-related volcanics with the enrichment of Rb, Th and U, and depletion of Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and Ti, and their protoliths possibly formed at an active continental margin tectonic setting. Retrograded eclogites are characterized by peak metamorphic mineral assemblages of garnet, omphacite, white mica, lawsonite and rutile, and underwent five-stage metamorphic evolution, including pre-peak prograde stage (M1) at 18–19 kbar and 400–420°C, peak lawsonite-eclogite facies (M2) at 24–26 kbar and 520–530°C, post-peak epidote–eclogite facies decompression stage (M3) at 13–18 kbar and 530–560°C, subsequent amphibolite facies retrogressive stage (M4) at 8–10 kbar and 530–600°C, and late greenschist facies cooling stage (M5) at 5–8 kbar and 480–490°C. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) U–Pb spot analyses of zircon show two distinct age groups. The magmatic zircon from both the retrograded eclogite and mafic schist yielded protolith ages of 451 ± 3 Ma, which is consistent with the ages of Early Palaeozoic ophiolitic complexes and ocean island sequences in the CMOB reported in previous studies. In contrast, metamorphic zircon from the retrograded eclogite samples yielded consistent Triassic metamorphic ages of 246 ± 2 and 245 ± 2 Ma, which can be interpreted as the timing of closure of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean. The compatible peak metamorphic mineral assemblages, P–T–t paths and metamorphic ages, as well as the similar protolith signatures for the eclogites in the CMOB and Longmu Co–Shuanghu suture (LCSS) suggest that the two belts formed part of a cold oceanic subduction system in the Triassic. The main suture zone of the Palaeo-Tethyan domain extends at least 1,500 km in length from the CMOB to the LCSS in the Tibetan Plateau. The identification of lawsonite-bearing retrograded eclogites in the CMOB provides important insights into the tectonic framework and complex geological evolution of the Palaeo-Tethys. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","189","Silicate minerals","Exploratory geochemistry - Gasoline - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Laser ablation - Mass spectrometry - Metamorphic rocks - Mica - Oceanography - Oxide minerals - Petrology - Rare earths - Tectonics - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Zircon","Eclogites - Geochemical affinity - Geological evolution - Laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometries - Metamorphic evolution - Ocean island basalts - Orogenic belts - Palaeo-Tethys Ocean",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Overall, American faculty exhibits high geographic mobility from their graduating institutions in terms of relocation distance and cross-MSA moves. History faculty members have the highest mobility while those in business show the lowest mobility. We further find that assistant professors show the highest mobility while full professors show lowest mobility.

How to scientifically to analyze the evolution characteristics of urban spatial form and demarcate the urban extension boundary scientifically and reasonably is of great significance to grasp the urban development context, construct a scientific and reasonable urban spatial form framework and guide the healthy and sustainable development of the city. This paper takes the Chenggong District of Kunming City, which has been developing rapidly in recent years, as the research object. It uses the Landsat remote sensing satellite image data onto different periods to extract the information on the land use type of the study area, and then combines the GIS technology to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the urban form evolution in the Chenggong District. Finally, qualitative analysis is carried out in the aspects of the natural environment, policy orientation, economy and society in combination with the evolution of urban form. After introducing the four types of indicators: Extended annual speed, extended dynamics, extended intensity and extended comprehensive index, the urban form evolution of Chenggong District was quantitatively analyzed. It was found that Chenggong District was in the stage of rapid development of urbanization in the past 15 years. There is obvious differentiation in the pattern, the southwest and northwest directions are the main expansion directions, and the southeast direction is the slowest. Natural factors have greatly restricted the expansion of Chenggong District.

In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov model (HMM)-based hybrid meta-clustering ensemble with bi-weighting scheme to solve the problems of initialization and model selection associated with temporal data clustering. To improve the performance of the ensemble techniques, the proposed bi-weighting scheme adaptively examines the partition process and hence optimizes the fusion of consensus functions. Specifically, three consensus functions are used to combine the input partitions, generated by HMM-based K-models under different initializations, into a robust consensus partition. An optimal consensus partition is then selected from the three candidates by a normalized mutual information-based objective function. Finally, the optimal consensus partition is further refined by the HMM-based agglomerative clustering algorithm in association with dendrogram-based similarity partitioning algorithm, leading to the advantage that the number of clusters can be automatically and adaptively determined. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, time series, and real-world motion trajectory datasets illustrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the selected benchmarks and hence providing promising potentials for developing improved clustering tools for information analysis and management. © 2018 IEEE.","65","Clustering algorithms","Cluster analysis - Data structures - Harmonic analysis - Hidden Markov models - Markov processes - Mathematical models - Time series analysis - Trellis codes","Agglomerative clustering algorithm - Automatic initialization - Data clustering - Ensemble learning - Intrinsic structures - Model Selection - Normalized mutual information - Partitioning algorithms",,"Number: 2017HC012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20160226191842793, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61663046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017HB005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; ","Manuscript received March 4, 2016; revised September 14, 2017, January 31, 2018, and February 12, 2018; accepted February 21, 2018.

These results suggested that astaxanthin content was increased by 2.17-fold compared to the control. The lipid content was enhanced by 1.22-fold. BHA treatment simultaneously reduced carbohydrates and protein and delayed the decay of chlorophyll. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis demonstrated that BHA upregulated and activated the bioprocesses involved in cellular basal metabolism and signalling systems, such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and the phosphatidylinositol signalling system, thus enhancing astaxanthin and lipid accumulation.

Further improvement of its performance requires a better charge transfer and more exposure of its active site in the enzymatic conversions, which can be achieved by immobilisation of MP-11 into functional materials. However, conventional immobilisation techniques always suffer from non-specific and uncontrolled weak interactions and energy level of two entities in the hybrid is not perfectly matched, thus resulting in limited improvement of the system. In this work, a hybrid material of layered MoO3 and MP-11 was synthesised by a self-assembly technique through a covalent interaction. Physicochemical characterisation indicated that there is a charge transfer from MP-11 to MoO3 and a covalent bond is formed in the hybrid. A notable enhancement of biocatalysis and photocurrent conversion were observed in the studies, which are due to a synergistic effect and band alignment of the two entities in the hybrid.

Recently much work has been done on real-time scheduling of parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). However, most of these studies assume tasks to have implicit or constrained deadlines. Much less work considered the general case of arbitrary deadlines (i.e., the relative deadline is allowed to be larger than the period), which is more difficult to analyze due to intra-task interference among jobs. In this paper, we study the analysis of Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) scheduling for DAG parallel tasks with arbitrary deadlines. We develop new analysis techniques for GEDF scheduling of a single DAG task, which not only outperform the state-of-the-art in general evidenced by empirical evaluation, but also guarantee a better capacity augmentation bound 2.41 (the best known result is 2.5). The proposed analysis techniques are also extended to and evaluated with the case of multiple DAG tasks using the federated scheduling approach. © 2019 EDAA.","19","Real time systems","Directed graphs - Embedded systems - Scheduling","Analysis techniques - Computation capacity - Directed acyclic graph (DAG) - Earliest deadline first - Empirical evaluations - Multi-core processor - Real - time scheduling - Real-time and embedded systems","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory","","This work is supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (GRF 15204917 and 15213818).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, to date, only a few tree-ring based climate reconstructions exist from this region. Here, we present a regional tree-ring chronology from the moisture-sensitive Zeravshan juniper (Juniperus seravschanica Kom.) from the Kuramin Range (Tajikistan) in western Central Asia, which is used to reveal past summer drought variability from 1650 to 2015 Common Era (CE). The chronology accounts for 40.5% of the variance of the June-July self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) during the instrumental period (1901 to 2012). Seven dry periods, including 1659-1696, 1705-1722, 1731-1741, 1758-1790, 1800-1842, 1860-1875, and 1931-1987, and five wet periods, including 1742-1752, 1843-1859, 1876-1913, 1921-1930, and 1988-2015, were identified. Good agreements between drought records from western and eastern Central Asia suggest that the PDSI records retain common drought signals and capture the regional dry/wet periods of Central Asia. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates the existence of centennial (128 years), decadal (24.3 and 11.4 years), and interannual (8.0, 3.6, 2.9, and 2.0 years) cycles, which may be linked with climate forces, such as solar activity and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The analysis between the scPDSI reconstruction and large-scale atmospheric circulations during the reconstructed extreme dry and wet years can provide information about the linkages of extremes in our scPDSI record with the large-scale ocean-atmosphere-land circulation systems. © 2019 by the authors.","67","Forestry","Atmospheric pressure - Climatology - Drought - Solar energy - Spectrum analysis","Atmospheric circulation - Climate reconstruction - Dendroclimatic studies - Kuramin Range - Self-calibrating Palmer drought severity indices - Synoptic climatology - Tajikistan - Tree rings","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena","Number: U1803341, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the reviewers very much whose comments greatly benefitted this manuscript.

A certain bearing with a spall on its outer race was chosen to be the studied object and the overall passing process of the rolling elements across the outer race spall area was deeply analyzed. On this basis, the time-varying deflection excitation function produced by the outer race spall was obtained, and then the formula including the ratio of ball diameter to spall length for calculating the impact force of the rolling elements striking the spall edge was developed. As a result, a novel dynamic model of the ball bearing with a localized spall on its outer race was proposed based on the Hertzian contact theory, which considers the time-varying displacement mechanism and the impact force excitation due to the outer race spall. The solution to the dynamic equations was carried out using the Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. The comparison of the simulated results and the experimental results of the hybrid ceramic ball bearing with an outer race spall shows good effectiveness of the proposed dynamic model which incorporates impact forces in predicting the dual-impulse time interval and the characteristic defect frequency. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

In particular, understanding how magnetic nanoparticles perturb neuronal calcium homeostasis is critical when considering magnetic nanoparticles as a nonviral vector for effective gene therapy in neuronal diseases. Here, we address the pressing need to systematically investigate the neurotoxicity of magnetic nanoparticles with different surface charges in primary hippocampal neurons. We found that unlike negative and neutral nanoparticles, positively charged magnetic nanoparticles (magnetic poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles, MNP-PLGA-PEI NPs) rapidly elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels in primary hippocampal neurons, mainly via extracellular calcium influx regulated by voltage-gated calcium channels. We went on to show that this perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis elicited serious cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. However, our next experiment demonstrated that PEGylation on the surface of MNP-PLGA-PEI NPs shielded the surface charge, thereby preventing the perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. That is, PEGylated MNP-PLGA-PEI NPs reduced nanoneurotoxicity. Importantly, biocompatible PEGylated MNP-PLGA-PEI NPs under an external magnetic field enhanced transfection efficiency (>7%) of plasmid DNA encoding GFP in primary hippocampal neurons compared to NPs without external magnetic field mediation. Moreover, under an external magnetic field, this system achieved gene transfection in the hippocampus of the C57 mouse. Overall, this study is the first to successfully employ biocompatible PEGylated MNP-PLGA-PEI NPs for transfection using a magnetofection strategy in primary hippocampal neurons, thereby providing a nanoplatform as a new perspective for treating neuronal diseases or modulating neuron activities.

Activated carbon adsorption is a classic process for toluene removal, nevertheless, common ordinary activated carbon usually suffered from high ash content, poor adsorption selectivity, uneven pore size distribution and limited surface functional groups. For the sake of acquiring higher efficiency and selectivity in adsorption of target substances, modification of activated carbon should be conducted inevitably. Numerous attempts have been made by researchers to figure out the optimal modification method, which concern the selection of the appropriate modification substance, processing technology, operating conditions and the dosage of modifier. At present, the primary modification methods of activated carbon mainly include acid and alkali modification, loading ofheteroatoms and compounds, low temperature plasma modification, and microwave modification etc. In terms of acid and alkali modification, it can reduce the ash content by removing the acid and alkali soluble substances in activated carbon, thus enlarging the specific area and pore volume of activated carbon. Different from acid modification, alkali modification can increase the number of basic functional groups on the surface of activated carbon, enhance the surface π-π dispersion force to further improve the overall non-polarity, which is beneficial to the adsorption of weakly polar toluene. Considering the loading of heteroatoms and compounds, it utilizes the complexation between heteroatoms/compounds and toluene to significantly improve the adsorption ability of activated carbon. However, excessive loading of heteroatoms and compounds will be likely to block the pore channels and reduce the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for toluene. The low temperature plasma modification features low energy consumption, higher efficiency and wide application range, which is regarded as a novel environment-friendly technique for toluene removal. It can not only improve the surface chemistry properties, but also affect the interfacial physical properties. Therefore, low temperature plasma modification exhibits a promising prospect in the field of toluene removal. Regarding to microwave modification, more active sites can be generated on the surface of activated carbon thanks to the microwave energy. With the introduction of reducing gas, the acidic functional groups on the surface of activated carbon could also be decomposed and the alkalinity can be enhanced as well. Microwave heating can remove impurities in the pores of activated carbon, whereas, with the increase of temperature, the carbon skeleton will shrink, which is not conducive to the adsorption. In particular, the power of microwave irradiation, the concentration of the modifier and the irradiation duration are the key factors to be controlled in microwave modification. In this article, the research progress of adsorption of toluene by activated carbon and modified activated carbon is reviewed. The adsorption performances and mechanisms of various modified activated carbon for toluene are investigated by comparing and analyzing their isothermal adsorption models. It is demonstrated that the specific surface area, channel structure and surface chemistry properties are the main factors that affect the adsorption performances. The influence of various modification methods on the physical and chemical properties of activated carbon are discussed, which is of great significance to improve the adsorption efficiency and lay a theoretical foundation for developing more efficient modified activated carbon in toluene removal. Finally, the problems remain to be solved and future trend for activated carbon modification are put forward, which provided a valuable information for further study and industrial application. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

When possible, the contribution of specific bioactive components is highlighted. While numerous studies with in vitro and animal models have hinted at the functionality of fermented soy foods, ascribing health benefits requires well-designed, often complex human studies with analysis of diet, lifestyle, family and medical history combined with long-term follow-ups for each subject. In addition, the contribution of the microbiome to the bioactivities of fermented soy foods, possibly mediated through direct action or bioactive metabolites, needs to be studied. Potential synergy or other interactions among the microorganisms carrying out the fermentation and the host's microbial community may also contribute to food functionality, but the details still require elucidation.

FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and zeta potential analysis were employed to characterize the prepared adsorbent. Three kinetic and isothermic equations were employed to investigate the selective adsorbing mechanism of Au(III) from an aqueous solution. The adsorbent had the highest adsorption rate in the pH range from 2 to 9, thus suggesting that PE-PGMA had a wide acid-base tolerance. The adsorbing equilibrium is attained in 10 min and the maximum adsorption capacity is 601.34 mg/g. The pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models well described the kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption process, respectively. The results certified that the adsorbing process was monolayer sorption and the rate-limiting step was chemical adsorption. After seven cycles of reusability experiments, the adsorbing rate of gold ions decreased from 99.06% to 96.72%, thus proving that the adsorbent has good reusability. Moreover, the adsorbent presented good selectivity for gold ions from the coexisting ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Ge4+ and Pb2+). The chelation interaction between phosphate groups and Au(III) played a significant role in the selective adsorption and higher uptake capacity. Furthermore, the column adsorption and the recovery experiment of gold from laboratory wastewater demonstrated that the PE-PGMA has good potential to recover gold. © 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","33","Gold compounds","Acrylic monomers - Adsorption - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gold - Ions - Isotherms - Mechanisms - Recovery - Reusability - Scanning electron microscopy - Solutions - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Adsorption capacities - Chemical adsorption - Laboratory wastewater - Poly(glycidyl methacrylate) - Polymeric microsphere - Pseudo second order - Selective adsorption - Zeta potential analysis",,"Number: 51664037, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1702252, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (Nos.

Source and optical composition of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in oligotrophic and deep lakes can display distinct properties, because of deep light penetration and long water residence time in these lakes. In this study, the optical properties and spatiotemporal distributions of CDOM were analyzed through monthly field investigation in 2017 in Lake Fuxian, an oligotrophic deep lake in Yunnan Province, China. The results showed that the average value of a(254) was 3.47±0.57 m-1, with the range of 1.82-5.22 m-1, indicating that CDOM abundance in the lake was relatively low compared with other mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Moreover, parallel factor analysis was performed to assess CDOM composition from excitation-emission matrix spectra and four components were identified: two tyrosine-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2) and one humic-like component (C4). The percentage of fluorescent intensity of C1+C3 was 65.81%±15.38%, and the proportion of C2+C4 was 34.19%±15.38%. The fluorescence index (FI), humification index (HIX) and biological/autochthonous index (BIX) was 1.73±0.14, 1.02±0.37 and 1.23±0.27, respectively. These results demonstrated that the CDOM was primarily originated from endogenous microbes in this lake. The average values of a(254) in spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November) and winter (January, February and December) were 3.20±0.47, 3.76±0.64, 3.67±0.50 and 3.23±0.38 m-1 respectively, with significantly higher values in summer and autumn than those in winter and spring. The abundance and spatial distributions of autochthonous and allochthonous CDOM exhibited seasonal heterogeneity, which might be correlated with land-use pattern, input of terrestrial materials, rainfall, water temperature and irradiance. © 2019 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","48","Lakes","Amino acids - Biogeochemistry - Dissolution - Factor analysis - Fluorescence - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Land use - Multivariant analysis - Optical properties - Organic compounds - Residence time distribution - Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy","Chromophoric dissolved organic matter - Lake Fuxian - Parallel factor analysis - UV visible spectroscopy - Yunnan Plateau","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 481.2 Geochemistry - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922 Statistical Methods",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to minimize the concentration of total phosphorus (TP), experiments were carried out using 33-factorial designs with three levels and three factors. A Box–Behnken design, which is the standard design of RSM, was used to evaluate the effects and interactions of three major factors (Fe:P (w/w) ratio, coagulation pH and fast mixing speed (FMS)) on the treatment efficiency. A multivariable quadratic model developed for studying the response indicated that the values for optimum conditions for Fe:P (w/w) ratio, coagulation pH and FMS were 2.40, 6.48 and 100 rev min-1, respectively. Under optimal process conditions, the TP concentration in the distillery effluent was reduced from 10 mg L-1 to 0.215 mg L-1, representing a removal efficiency of 97.85%. Based upon the statistical evaluation of results, it is inferred that RSM can be used as an appropriate approach to optimize the coag-flocculation process.

In this research, a series of novel color-tunable Eu2+/Mn2+ co-doped K2BaCa(PO4)2 phosphors were successfully prepared using a solid-state method. The crystal and electronic structures, Eu2+/Mn2+ site occupancy and luminescence properties were investigated for the first time. The Rietveld refinement indicates that both Eu2+ and Mn2+ tend to locate at M3 sites because of their compact coordinated octahedrons. Excitation and emission spectra together with decay lifetime variation consistently confirm the occurrence of efficient energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions that leads to an adjustable luminescence. Emitting colors can be tuned from blue to white to yellow, by varying the Eu2+/Mn2+ concentration in the K2BaCa(PO4)2:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphor. The external quantum efficiency of the optimized K2BaCa(PO4)2:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphor is ∼70%. LEDs fabricated by combining a 365 nm chip with the K2BaCa(PO4)2:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphor exhibit bright white light (correlated colour temperature (CCT) = 6787 K, colour rendering index (Ra) = 74.4) with excellent current stability of up to 300 mA.

In this approach, we first present a formal model for private processes and abstract the control flow of the model into four basic blocks. Then, we derive a set of refinement rules for the four basic blocks and present an approach that relies on the refinement rules for constructing correct private processes. Finally, we prove that the private process established by our approach is correct at the syntax and semantic levels, and thus a subsequent correctness verification is avoided.

It is demonstrated that the precession frequency f decreases dramatically with the increasing interlayer thickness of Ta (tTa) or Pt (tPt). By fitting the f ∼H curves of different tTa with the coherent precession model including the interfacial coupling interaction, the exchange coupling strength as well as the magnetization orientations of FePt and [CoNi]5 are determined. Meanwhile, it is found the magnetic damping constant α can be modulated considerably as well by adjusting the interlayer thickness. For the Ta interlayer, the α value decreases gradually with the increase in tTa as the result of decreased coupling strength, while it shows a monotonic increasing behavior for the Pt layer. The increased α with tPt can be attributed to the enhanced spin pumping contribution from Pt, which greatly exceeds the decreasing tendency caused by the reduced interfacial coupling. This study provides deep insights into the dynamic behaviors of the exchange-coupled magnetic system, which are valuable to achieve effective control of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics for spintronic applications. © 2019 Author(s).","42","Platinum alloys","Binary alloys - Cobalt alloys - Composite films - Curve fitting - Iron alloys - Magnetization - Optical Kerr effect - Platinum - Tantalum","Exchange coupling strength - Interfacial couplings - Interlayer modulation - Magnetization orientation - Magnetization precession - Spintronic applications - Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effects - Ultrafast magnetization dynamics","543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fudan University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 11874120, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","1Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Ultra-Precision Optical Manufacturing and Key Lab of Micro and Nano Photonic Structures (Ministry of Education), Department of Optical Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China 2School of Physics and Astronomy, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China a)Contributions: B.

The Ag amounts doped into grain boundary and cell lattice could be adjusted by changing the sintering temperature from 1000 °C to 1500 °C. The temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) of the obtained LCSMO:Ag ceramics were tested under cross magnetic field with directions parallel and perpendicular to the flat of bulk. The difference between TCR and MR values reached their maxima at sintering temperature of 1450 °C, meaning that degree of lattice distortion reached maximum value. The combined data from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that Ag was doped into the grain boundary and lattice cell, and Ag played an important role during the process. The influence of Ag-doping on TCR and MR suggested that degree of lattice distortion can be adjusted by doping, leading to change in isotropic ceramics into anisotropic ceramics without damage. Application of parallel magnetic fields shifted the application temperature to room temperature, and response sensitivity of the ceramics to magnetic field further increased.

Targeted poverty alleviation stratagem which aimed to fully eliminating regional overall poverty in 2020 was put into practice since 2013 in China. Since then, it achieved huge success and the number of people living in extreme poverty reduced sharply in China. But absolute poverty still existed in rural, for the increasing development disparity on account of regional variation; the urban-rural gap was prominent. According to research on rural poverty influencing factors, we found that it had significant differences at different areas and different scales, and lacked a common understanding. For it rarely thought about spatial effects of regional rural poverty for those current existing research on rural poverty influencing factors, it was necessary to study rural poverty influencing factors further. This paper analyzed spatial pattern of rural poverty and main influencing factors on county scale, by applying spatial econometric model and GIS spatial analysis based on the field trip and statistical data which including 15 factors that might influence rural poverty potentially for all of 129 counties in Yunnan province from 2010 to 2015, which intended to providing the theory basis for the formulation and implementation of scientific and effective regional macroscopic poverty reduction policy, and improving poverty reduction that combining poverty status and regional differences even more. This study carried out poverty alleviation and development zoning in Yunnan province, and proposed discrepant policy of regional rural poverty reduction. Results showed that: 1) The number of rural poverty population decreased year by year in Yunnan province, but which was still a high incidence area for rural poverty in China. Rural poverty demonstrated a 'center-periphery-edge' pattern which corresponded to low, medium and high poverty among the 129 counties in Yunnan. High poverty areas were concentrated on the northwest, northeast, southeast and south of Yunnan, which involved Jinsha river reaches, Lancang river valley, Nujiang river valley and Red river basin. 2) Regression results of spatial lag model (SLM) showed that the significant influencing factors which affected county rural poverty included terrain relief, traffic distance to municipal government, illiterate rate of population at 15 years old and above of rural, number of hospital beds per thousand people, rate of elderly population at 65 years old and above of rural in Yunnan for the past few years. The regression coefficients of the five significant influencing factors were 0.005, 0.044, 0.380, -1.257 and -2.132 respectively. It produced positive effects on rural poverty for factors of terrain relief, traffic distance to municipal government, illiteracy rate at 15 years old and above of rural in Yunnan province, and the other two factors produced negative effects. 3) Rural poverty had regional differences in Yunnan. In terms of poverty degree and major factors of poverty influencing, Yunnan province was divided into 6 poverty reduction areas which were high poverty area at northwest of Yunnan, high poverty area at northeast of Yunnan, medium-high poverty area at west frontier of Yunnan, medium poverty area at west of Yunnan, high poverty area at southeast of Yunnan and low poverty area at central area of Yunnan. Poverty reduction should be accurately implemented according to regional poverty and major factors of poverty influencing, and strengthened the join forces between adjacent counties to consolidate results of poverty reduction in Yunnan. The spatial effect is an important part of regional rural poverty research, and can provide references for scientific and rational policy setting of regional poverty reduction. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

First, the classical heat potential theory is applied to convert such problems to Volterra integral equations of the second kind via the heat layer potentials, where the unknowns are only on the space–time boundary. However, the heat layer potentials contain convolution integrals in both space and time whose direct evaluation requires O(NS2NT2) work and O(NSNT) storage, where NS is the total number of discretization points on the spatial boundary and NT is the total number of time steps. In order to evaluate the heat layer potentials accurately and efficiently, they are split into two parts—the local part containing the temporal integration from t- δ to t and the history part containing the temporal integration from 0 to t- δ. The local part can be dealt with efficiently using conventional fast multipole type algorithms. For problems with complex stationary geometry, efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations are constructed for the heat kernel and used for the evaluation of the history part. Here all local and history kernels are compressed only once. The resulting algorithm is very efficient with quasilinear complexity in both space and time for both interior and exterior problems. For problems with complex moving geometry, the spectral Fourier approximation is applied for the heat kernel and nonuniform FFT is used to speed up the evaluation of the history part of heat layer potentials. The performance of both algorithms is demonstrated with several numerical examples. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","44","Integral equations","Boundary value problems - Convolution - Fast Fourier transforms - Geometry - Heat transfer - Partial differential equations - Problem solving","Heat equation - Heat kernel - High-order methods - Integral equation methods - Sum of exponentials",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that emulsified asphalt can restrain the graphite shedding of copper/graphite composites to a certain extent. Many pores existed at the interface of copper/graphite composites and the combination mode between copper and graphite was mechanical combination, while thin layer of graphene-like microstructure was found at the interface of copper/EA/graphite composites. The mechanical properties test showed that the hardness of copper/graphite composites was improved by adding emulsified asphalt. After the friction and wear test, the wear loss, wear coefficient and wear morphology of the composites were calculated and analyzed. Copper/EA/graphite composites exhibited more stable friction coefficient and less wear loss. With the increase of load, the wear mechanism of copper/graphite composites gradually transformed from adhesive wear to abrasive wear, however, the wear mechanism of copper/EA /graphite composites was mainly adhesive wear.

While regarding to frequency-domain analysis, most risk spillover effects are observed only in short-term frequency at 1 to 3 months. Secondly, the static net EPU spillover effects indicates that US, in average, is the key spillover transmitter and UK as well as China are the major spillover receivers. Finally, the dynamic rolling-window results confirm that with time-varying domestic and global economic situations, no country is identified as a successive net EPU spillover contributor or receiver across both time and various frequency domains.

Solutions of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg, 0.2%, w/v) and mixtures containing 0.2% (w/v) β-Lg and 0–0.5% (w/v) sodium caseinate (NaCas) were pressurized at 400–800 MPa. NaCas suppressed the aggregation of β-Lg induced by pressure treatment, and this function was dependent on the concentration of NaCas. Furthermore, NaCas altered the aggregation process of β-Lg by suppressing the transition of the aggregate from the soluble phase to the insoluble phase and, as a result, the fraction of insoluble aggregates was decreased. During this process, NaCas formed stable complexes with the denatured β-Lg, and the formation of complexes prevented further aggregation of β-Lg. These results indicate that NaCas exhibits a chaperone-like activity under high pressure. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","25","Sodium","Agglomeration - Aggregates","Aggregation process - Chaperone-like activity - High pressure - Insoluble aggregates - Lactoglobulin - Molecular chaperones - Pressure treatments - Sodium caseinate",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The crystalline phase composition, micromorphology, ionic valence states, diffuse reflectance absorption performance and concentration quenching mechanism were solved in detail. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) behavior of the as-prepared samples is closely dependent on the doping Sm3+ concentration. The optimized PL strategy is as following: the strongest excitation line is located at 401 nm, and the optimal doping concentration is 7 mol%. NLP:7%Sm3+ displays intense orange-red visible luminescence with the dominant 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transitions located at 596 and 605 nm. The detailed investigation on CIE chromaticity coordinates, color purity (CP), correlated color temperature (CCT), internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and fluorescence lifetime suggests that we may use NLP:Sm3+ micropowder as alternative ingredient for phosphor-converted near UV-based warm white LEDs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","38","Samarium compounds","Citrus fruits - Lanthanum compounds - Light emitting diodes - Natural language processing systems - Phosphors - Photoluminescence - Sodium compounds - Synthesis (chemical)","Concentration quenching - Correlated color temperature - High-temperature solid-phase - Internal quantum efficiency - Lanthanum metaphosphate - Metaphosphate - Photoluminescence excitation - White LED","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 201804002, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 2018FB017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21761034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","This research was financially supported by the Program for Excellent Young Talents,Yunnan University, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21761034), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2018FB017), and Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Foundation of Yunnan University (201804002).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In recent years, many effective models have been proposed to propagate label information across domains. However, these models rely on large-scale labeled data in source domain and cannot handle the case where the source domain lacks label information. In this paper, we put forward a Graph Regularized Domain Adaptation (GDA) to tackle this problem. Specifically, the proposed GDA integrates graph regularization with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Hence GDA enables sufficient unlabeled source data to facilitate knowledge transfer by utilizing the geometric property of source domain, simultaneously, due to the embedding of MMD, GDA can reduce source and target distribution divergency to learn a generalized classifier. Experimental results validate that our GDA outperforms the traditional algorithms when there are few labeled source samples. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","47","Knowledge management","Artificial intelligence - Software engineering","Domain adaptation - Graph regularization - Manifold learning - Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) - Transfer learning","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.) is an ecologically important and economically valuable tree species which grows in the southern plains and mid-hills of Nepalese Central Himalayas. Detailed knowledge of growth response of this species provides key information for the forest management. This paper aims to assess the dendroclimatic potential of Shorea robusta and to understand climatic effects on its growth. A growth analysis was done by taking 60 stem disc samples that were cut 0.3 m above ground and represented different diameter classes (>10 cm to 50 cm). Samples were collected and analysed following standard dendrochronological procedures. The detailed wood anatomical analysis showed that the wood was diffuse-porous, with the distribution of vessels in the entire ring and growth rings mostly marked with gradual structural changes. The basal area increment (BAI) chronology suggested that the species shows a long-term positive growth trend, possibly favoured by the increasing temperature in the region. The growth-climate relationship indicated that a moist year, with high precipitation in spring (March-May, MAM) and summer (June-September, JJAS), as well as high temperature during winter (November-February) was beneficial for the growth of the species, especially in a young stand. A significant positive relationship was observed between the radial trees increment and the total rainfall in April and the average total rainfall from March to September. Similarly, a significant positive relationship between radial growth and an average temperature in winter (November-January) was noted. © 2019 by the authors.","73","Forestry","Rain","Community forest - Disc - Nepal - Shorea robusta - Tree rings - Tropical regions","443.3 Precipitation","","This research was funded by the APPEAR-Austrian Partnership Programme in Higher Education and Research for Development funded under 'Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD-GmbH) and the APC was funded by the OA publishing fund at BOKU library services.

Recently, some cyanobacteria species have been identified as a source of estrogenic effects in aquatic animals. To explore possible estrogenic effects of Microcystis aeruginosa (an often-dominant cyanobacteria species) on zooplankton, we examined effects of cyanobacteria exudates (MaE, 2 × 104 and 4 × 105 cells/ml) on reproduction in Daphnia magna. We analyzed physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics of exposed Daphnia via both chronic and acute exposures. MaE at both low and high cell density enhanced egg number (15.4% and 23.3%, respectively) and reproduction (37.7% and 52.4%, respectively) in D. magna similar to 10 μg/L estradiol exposure. In addition, both MaE of low and high cell densities increased population growth rate (15.8% and 19.6%, respectively) and reproductive potential (60% and 83%, respectively) of D. magna. These exudates promoted D. magna reproduction by stimulating 17β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) activity and production of ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and by enhancing vitellogenin biosynthesis via up-regulating expression of Vtg1 and Vtg2. However, increased expression (6.6 times higher than controls) of a detoxification gene (CYP360A8) indicated that MaE might also induce toxicity in D. magna. Reproductive interference of zooplankton by blooming cyanobacteria might negatively affect foodwebs because MaE-induced zooplankton population increase would enhance grazing and reduce abundance of edible algae, thereby adding to the list of known disruptive properties of cyanobacterial blooms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","98","Cell proliferation","Animals - Bacteria - Biochemistry - Climate change - Detoxification - Hormones - Population statistics","Cyanobacteria - Daphnia magna - Endocrine disorders - Estrogen analogue - Estrogenic effect - Microcystis aeruginosa","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry","Number: 2017M623078, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Canada Research Chairs; Number: C176240209, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018FY001-007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 31800433, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M623078 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31800433 ), the Yunnan Postdoctoral Science Foundation approved in 2018, the Training Project of Excellent Youth for Yunnan Province by Yunnan University (No. C176240209 ), Joint Grant of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department - Yunnan University Major Project ( 2018FY001-007 ), and NSERC Canada and the Canada Research Chairs program.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For such a V-trough photovoltaic module, all incident radiation within the angle θa arrives on solar cells after less than k reflections, and the azimuth angle of V-trough is daily adjusted M times about INSA to ensure incident solar rays always within θa in a day. Calculations and analysis show that two-dimensional sky diffuse radiation can't reasonably estimate sky diffuse radiation collected by fixed inclined north-south V-trough, but can for MP-VPVs. Results indicate that, the annual power output (Pa) of MP-VPVs in a site is sensitive to the geometry of V-trough and wall reflectivity (ρ), hence given M, k and ρ, a set of optimal θa and φ, the opening angle of V-trough, for maximizing Pa can be found. Calculation results show that the optimal θa is about 21°, 13.5° and 10° for 3P-, 5P- and 7P-VPV-k/θa (k = 1 and 2), respectively, and the optimal φ for maximizing Pa is about 30° for k = 1 and 21° for k = 2when ρ > 0.8. As compared to similar fixed south-facing PV panels, the increase of annual electricity from MP-VPVs is even larger than the geometric concentration of V-trough for ρ > 0.8 in sites with abundant solar resources, thus attractive for water pumping due to stable power output in a day. © 2019 by the authors.","33","Solar power generation","Geometry - Incident solar radiation - Photovoltaic cells - Solar cells","Calculation results - Design optimization - Incident radiation - Performance investigation - Photovoltaic applications - Photovoltaic modules - Sun-tracking - Three dimensional radiation","615.2 Solar Power - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 921 Mathematics","Number: 51466016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of funded program 51466016, financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Meanwhile, the unique hollow structures can make multiple reflections of light in the cavity, and thus enhance the utilization efficiency of light. Moreover, the L-cysteine offers amine groups and meanwhile is anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 during the synthesis process, and thus contributes greatly to the enhanced CO2 adsorption capability.

However, previous studies have shown that the heating mode depends on the transmission performance of refractory insulation materials. In this study, a commonly used refractory material (fused silica ceramics) for microwave heating was studied, according to the law of electromagnetic wave propagation in a single-layer plate, the power transmission coefficient (PTC) of the material at different thickness, temperature and frequency (915 MHz and 2360 MHz) was calculated and analysed, in order to design the refractory structure which has good microwave transmission performance in the whole microwave heating process. The results show that the transmission performance of fused silica ceramics fluctuates regularly with increasing thickness, and there are several microwave transmission peaks in the PTC patterns, the thicknesses corresponding to the transmission peaks at frequency 2360 MHz are in order 0.033 m, 0.065 m and 0.098 m; as the temperature increases, the position of the transmission peaks will shift to a smaller thickness, the transmission performance of fused silica ceramics decreases slightly with increasing temperature. Comparing the transmission performance of mullite, alumina (Al2O3) and fused silica ceramics, it was found that the fused silica ceramics have excellent transmission properties; especially it is at high temperature. The results of this study can provide guidance for the selection of refractory structure materials and sizes as well as the optimization of heating process parameters in high-temperature microwave heating. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","27","Fused silica","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Ceramic materials - Electromagnetic wave propagation - Microwave materials processing - Microwaves - Mullite - Refractory materials - Silicate minerals - Wave transmission","High temperature - High temperature heating - Increasing temperatures - Microwave heating process - Microwave transmission - Refractory structures - Silica ceramic - Transmission performance",,"Number: 2018ZE027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi; Number: KKZ3201752046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This work was supported by the Yunnan Science and Technology Major Project [grant number 2018ZE008 and grant number 2018ZE027 ]; Scientific Research Fund of Kunming University of Science and Technology [grant number KKZ3201752046 ].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Even though the transience of thyroid cancer is comparatively short, its rate of reappearance is moderately elevated, which is a major cause of the incurable disease of the thyroid gland. Consequently, we used natural component which restrains the cancer cell growth by amending precise molecular mechanisms. In this current study, we assessed sesame, which is a very active substance that inhibits cell proliferation by modulation of JAK/STAT-3 signaling in thyroid cancer cell lines (FTC-133). Results showed that sesame triggers cytotoxicity, ROS production and apoptosis in FTC-133 cell lines by time-dependent approach. Furthermore, Signal Transducer and Activating Transcription (STAT-3) is a novel oncogenic transcriptional factor which normalizes apoptosis and proliferation. The reticence of STAT-3 transcription was measured as an innovative approach to hamper thyroid cancer cell growth. In this current study, we established that sesame deactivates STAT-3 translocation, thereby reducing the elevated expression of, cyclin-D1, Bcl-2 and diminished expression of Bax, caspase-9 and 3 in FTC-133 cell lines.

By studying the model with and without explicit delays, the results indicate that the time delay of Mdm2 protein synthesis can well control the pulse shape but cannot induce p53 oscillation alone, while the time delay required for Wip1 protein synthesis induces a Hopf bifurcation to drive p53 oscillation. In addition, the synergy of the two delays will cause the p53 network to oscillate in advance, indicating that p53 begins the repair process earlier in the damaged cell. Furthermore, the stability and bifurcation of the model are addressed, which may highlight the role of time delay in p53 oscillations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology. 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

China contains the highest species diversity of these plants. Despite their widespread human use, how the species diversity patterns of Salicaceae plants formed remains mostly unknown, and these may be significantly affected by global climate warming. Using past, present, and future environmental data and 2673 georeferenced specimen records, we first simulated the dynamic changes in suitable habitats and population structures of Salicaceae. Based on this, we next identified those areas at high risk of habitat loss and population declines under different climate change scenarios/years. We also mapped the patterns of species diversity by constructing niche models for 215 Salicaceae species, and assessed the driving factors affecting their current diversity patterns. The niche models showed Salicaceae family underwent extensive population expansion during the Last Inter Glacial period but retreated to lower latitudes during and since the period of the Last Glacial Maximum. Looking ahead, as climate warming intensifies, suitable habitats will shift to higher latitudes and those at lower latitudes will become less abundant. Finally, the western regions of China harbor the greatest endemism and species diversity of Salicaceae, which are significantly influenced by annual precipitation and mean temperature, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, and the anomaly of precipitation seasonality. From these results, we infer water-energy dynamic equilibrium and historical climate change are both the main factors likely regulating contemporary species diversity and distribution patterns. Nevertheless, this work also suggests that other, possibly interacting, factors (ambient energy, disturbance history, soil condition) influence the large-scale pattern of Salicaceae species diversity in China, making a simple explanation for it unlikely. Because Southwest China likely served as a refuge for Salicaceae species during the Last Glacial Maximum, it is a current hotspot for endemisms. Under predicted climate change, Salicaceae plants may well face higher risks to their persistence in southwest China, so efforts to support their in-situ conservation there are urgently needed. © 2019 by the authors.

Flavonoids are important bioactive ingredients in lotus plumule. In this study, we proposed an efficient “fishing” strategy to profile and identify non-targeted flavonoids from lotus plumule aqueous extract based on a self-built mass data “pool” with an untargeted mass data acquisition method in order to acquire comprehensive structural information of flavonoids in lotus plumule. This mass data acquisition method was applied by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-orbitrap HRMS) executed in full MS/dd-MS2 mode with different collision energies in positive ionization mode. The self-built targeted data “pool” was constructed by the basic structure of flavonoids in lotus plumule, such as odd quasi-molecular ions, C6-C3-C6 skeleton, molecular weight limit. The “molecule lures” of fishing are characterized by molecular features, fragmental patterns, characteristic fragments ions, relative abundance and retention times. More importantly, the special “lures” of PredRet (the tool of predicting the retention times) and ClogP (the calculated lipophilicity parameter) were adopted to distinguish some isomers and some compounds whose mass spectra are difficult to determine with no reference substances. The “fished” flavonoids were further confirmed by their molecular features and fragmental patterns. This developed analysis method was successfully applied to profile 29 flavonoids compounds in the aqueous extract of lotus plumule, and 3 of them were recognized for the first time in lotus plumule.

However, the fabrication of these semiconductor SERS-active substrates commonly requires complicated processes, and these methods normally result in non-uniform and isolated particles/flakes, which have fundamental difficulties in meeting the practical needs in high performance and reliable SERS substrates. Herein, we demonstrate that SnSe2 nanoplate arrays (NPAs) via self-assembled growth can serve as uniform, highly sensitive and reliable SERS substrates. The cavity formed by the SnSe2 NPAs can trap light efficiently (∼96%) and thus improve the enhancement factor. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the charge-transfer process and enhanced light trapping, the resulting SERS substrates based on pure SnSe2 NPAs show an ultralow detection limit (1 × 10-12 M), a high enhancement factor (6.33 × 106) and excellent uniformity (relative standard deviations down to 7.7%), demonstrating one of the highest sensitivities amongst the reported semiconductor SERS substrates. Furthermore, the effects of different SnSe2 structural configurations (planar vs. cavity), the height and tilt angle of the SnSe2 NPAs on the performance of SERS detection are systematically investigated. It is discovered that the SERS performance is strongly dependent on both the light-trapping ability and the absorption loss. We believe that our results not only provide an effective strategy to obtain tunable, uniform and high performance SERS substrates, but also lead to further understanding of designing 3D light trapping architectures. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","24","Substrates","Architectural acoustics - Architecture - Charge transfer - Electromagnetic waves - Nanostructures - Raman spectroscopy - Selenium compounds - Semiconductor materials - Tin compounds","Charge transfer process - Multiple reflections - Relative standard deviations - Scattering of electromagnetic waves - Self-assembled growth - SERS-active substrates - Structural configurations - Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy","402 Buildings and Towers - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 751.3 Architectural Acoustics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, the distribution of REY in different size and density fractions, their mode of occurrence, and the insight they provide on the sediment source region of the Reshuihe coal in southern China are studied. The results show that the physical separation method caused light-REY (LREY) to be enriched in the low-density and large-sized coal particles, whereas medium-REY (MREY) and heavy-REY (HREY) are enriched in small-sized and high-density fractions. In addition, LREY are more closely associated with organic matter, while MREY and HREY occur more often in aluminosilicate minerals. Moreover, the sediment source of the Reshuihe coal was mainly derived from the felsic–intermediate rocks at the top of the Emeishan basalt sequence. Further, REY in the feed coal are generally not enriched, though REY are enriched in density fractions of 1.4 kg/L.

Specifically, the core work is to train a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based controller, which can focus its attention on the discriminative parts. Then, the glimpsed feature is extracted by a typical short text level convolutional neural network (CNN) from the focused group of words. The controller locates its attention according to the context information, which consists of the coarse representation of the original document and the memorized glimpsed features. By glimpsing a few groups, the document can be classified by aggregating these glimpsed features and the coarse representation.

The bonding strength of poplar plywood glued with different urea-formaldehyde resins of varying molar ratios was also investigated. The wettability and resin penetration of the veneer treated with DBD plasma were dramatically improved, especially for the UF resin with a higher formaldehyde to urea (F/U) molar ratio. The apparent contact angle of the veneer-treated plywood decreased and the resin penetration content increased as well. The bonding strength of the plywood increased in different degrees, and the wet bonding strength in particular sharply increased; when the F/U molar ratio was 1.3, the strength was improved by 138.2%. However, when the F/U molar ratio increased, the wet bonding strength improvement declined. The veneer surface image before and after the DBD treatment was invested via scanning electron microscopy, the surface was rougher and looser, which was beneficial for resin penetration. These all indicated that the balance between the characteristics of the resin and the penetration of the veneer surface is critical for an improvement in the bonding strength of plywood. © 2019 North Carolina State University.","24","Molar ratio","Atmospheric pressure - Contact angle - Dielectric devices - Dielectric materials - Diffusion bonding - Electric discharges - Flow control - Formaldehyde - Metabolism - Plasma applications - Plywood - Resins - Scanning electron microscopy - Urea - Urea formaldehyde resins - Veneers - Wood products","Apparent contact angle - Bonding strength - Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas - Penetration behavior - Plasma treatment - Poplar plywoods - Resin penetration - Surface feature","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: -, Acronym: NEFU, Sponsor: Northeast Forestry University; ","The authors are grateful for the support from the Key Laboratory of Bio-based Material Science & Technology (Northeast Forestry University) and the Ministry of Education.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Adverse natural environment in this region has delayed studies on Late Cretaceous tectono-magmatic activities in Late Yanshan, with focuses mainly on geochronology, petrogenesis, geodynamic background, fluid characteristics and source of ore-forming materials related to the Late Cretaceous alkali-rich granite, etc. However, discussion on structural stress field and dynamic mechanism is still rare. In this paper, we investigated in detail the structures and alteration-lithofacies of key sections and gallery in the east and west districts, Xiuwacu W-Mo deposits. Taking into account the zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf and O isotopic characteristics, we believe that the Xiuwacu granitic pluton is a two phase complex pluton divided into east and west ore districts with a near S-N F4 fault as the boundary. The east district is dominated by Late Triassic (212-201 Ma) porphyritic biotite granite, while mainly Late Cretaceou porphyritic quartz monzogranite and monzogranitic porphyry are in the west district. The situ-zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf and O isotopic analysis on the porphyritic quartz monzogranite suggests that the monzogranite formation age is 80.18±0.80 Ma (LA-ICP-MC U-Pb) (negative zircon ΕHf(t)=-4.49--8.07, variable δ18O ranged 5.98‰-7.45‰). Hf isotopic TDM2 model age is 1432-1239 Ma. Together with known geochemical characteristics, they show that the magmatic-mineralization material source of Late Cretaceous porphyritic quartz monzogranite was derived from the partial melting of thickened lower crust. Furthermore, Late Cretaceous regional tectonic stress field is characterized by NE-SW extension in the Yidun-Geza Area by regional structural analysis on 135 typical Late Cretaceous quartz monzogranite dykes and scheelite-molybdenite quartz veins. In summary, we believe that Late Cretaceous magmatic metallogenesis in this region is formed by the NW-SE extension of Neo-Tethys oceanic subduction resulting in partial melting of pre-existing thickened crust decompression. © 2019, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

The feasibility and efficiency of phosphorus removal using ferric chloride are reported. The factors that influence the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates formed during the phosphorus removal process (including temperature, pH, coexisting ions, fast mixing speed (FMS), and fast mixing time (FMT)) were studied in detail. Results show that ferric chloride can efficiently remove phosphorus, and Fe-P coprecipitate exhibits high stability. In a water temperature range of 10–35 °C and pH range of 3–11, the phosphorus in the Fe-P coprecipitates is stable and is not released. The maximum phosphorus release efficiency is 9.2% at a pH of 3, and 16.10% at a pH of 11. The presence of Ca2+ and CO32− has little effect on the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates, and the differences in fast mixing speed and time have little effect on the stability of Fe-P coprecipitates. Furthermore, on the basis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, adsorption and ligand exchange were identified as the main phosphorus removal mechanisms by ferric chloride.

According to constraints of positions between the blank and mold, the shape of bending deformation which is called intermediate configuration is calculated. Meanwhile, a method based on pre-stress membrane element for constructing an intermediate configuration is also proposed in this paper. In this method, the contact states of the blank nodes are determined by the contact algorithm. The contact zone of blank is determined by the shape of mold, the non-contact zone is calculated with iterations for equilibrium equations by the pre-stress membrane element. The result shows that the proposed algorithm could obtain the appropriate intermediate configurations quickly and provide precise surface sliding constraint for tensile deformation. © 2019, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press.

The technology of hyperspectral remote sensing is an important method to estimate SOM content efficiently and accurately. This study researched the best hyperspectral estimation model for SOM content in Shangri-La forest soil. The spectral reflectance of soils with sizes of 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.50 mm, and 0.25 mm were measured indoors. After smoothing and de-noising, the reciprocal reflectance (RR), logarithmic reflectance (LR), first-derivative reflectance (FR), reciprocal first-derivative reflectance (RFR), logarithmic first-derivative reflectance (LFR), and mathematical transformations of the original spectral reflectance (REF) were carried out to analyze the relevance of spectral reflectance and SOM content and extract the characteristic bands. Finally the simple linear regression (SLR), multiple stepwise linear regression (SMLR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for SOM content estimation were established. The results showed that: (1)With the decrease of soil particle size, the spectral reflectance increased. The smaller the soil particle sizes, the more obvious was the increase in spectral reflectance. (2) The sensitive bands of SOM were mainly in the 580-690 nm range (correlation coefficient (R) > 0.6, p-value (p) v 2) = 0.91, root mean square error of validation (RMSEv) = 13.41, the ratio of percent deviation (RPD) = 3.33). The results provide a basis for monitoring SOM content rapidly in the forests of Northwest Yunnan, and provide a reference for forest SOM estimation in other areas. © 2019 by the authors.","56","Soils","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Estimation - Forestry - Least squares approximations - Mathematical transformations - Mean square error - Organic compounds - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Reflection - Regression analysis - Remote sensing","Coefficient of determination - HyperSpectral - Hyperspectral remote sensing - Northwest Yunnan - Partial least squares regressions (PLSR) - Soil organic matters - Soil particle size - Stepwise linear regression","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.
