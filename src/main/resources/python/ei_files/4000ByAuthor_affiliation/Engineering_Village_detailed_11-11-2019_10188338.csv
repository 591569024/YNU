Arabidopsis ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) is a central transcription factor of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling that represses those processes. ABI5 is precisely modulated at post-translational level; however, whether it interacts with other crucial transcriptional regulators remains to be investigated. In this study, VQ18 and VQ26, two members of the recently-identified VQ family, were found to interact with ABI5 in vitro and in vivo. Phenotypic analysis showed that VQ18 and VQ26 are responsive to ABA and negatively mediate ABA signaling redundantly during seed germination. Simultaneously decreasing VQ18 and VQ26 expression levels enhanced ABA signaling to suppress seed germination, whereas overexpressing these two VQ genes resulted in the germinated seeds being less ABA-sensitive. Consistently, the expression levels of several ABI5 targets were modulated by VQ18 and VQ26. The increased ABA signaling of plants in which VQ18 and VQ26 were simultaneously suppressed required ABI5. Additionally, VQ18 and VQ26 acted as negative inter-actors of the ABI5 transcription factor. Our study reveals a previously unidentified regulatory role of VQ proteins, which act antagonistically with ABI5 to maintain the appropriate ABA signaling level to fine-tune seed germination and early seedling establishment. © 2018 The Authors.","78","Seed","Cultivation - Life cycle - Proteins - Signaling - Transcription - Transcription factors","Abscisic acid - Arabidopsis thaliana - Seed germination - Vq18 - Vq26","461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association; Number: 2017HB067, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014HC017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; Number: 31670281, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (31670281 to Yanru Hu; 31671274 to Diqiu Yu), the Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (2017FA005 and 2016FB026 to Yanru Hu), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (to Yanru Hu), Candidates of the Young and Middle Aged Academic Leaders of Yunnan Province (2017HB067 to Yanru Hu), and the program for Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province (2014HC017 to Diqiu Yu).

Trypsin-like serine proteases have many physiological and pathophysiological functions. There is therefore extensive interest in generating specific inhibitors for pharmacological intervention in their enzymatic activity. We study here if it is possible to use halogenated compounds as the P1 group to bind to the S1 specificity pocket of trypsin-like serine proteases to avoid the low bioavailability of the amidine or guanidine P1 group that is typically used in many inhibitors. We used 4-chlorobenzylamine (ClBA), 4-bromobenzylamine (BrBA) and 4-iodobenzylamine (IBA) as probes to test their binding modes to a trypsin-like serine protease, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which has been recognized as a marker for breast cancer and an important target for inhibitor development. The results showed that these compounds inhibited uPA with stronger efficacies compared with their non-halogenated analogues. We also determined the high-resolution crystal structures of uPA in complex with BrBA and IBA, respectively. The structures revealed that BrBA bound to the S1 pocket of uPA via halogen bonds, but IBA did not make halogen bonds with uPA, demonstrating that the iodine may not be the best choice as a target moiety for serine proteases. These results advocate halogen bonding, especially bromine bonding, as an efficient strategy for the future design of novel inhibitors against trypsin-like serine proteases to provide strong potency and promote bioavailability. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","59","Enzyme activity","Amino acids - Binding energy - Biochemistry - Crystal structure - Halogenation","Efficient strategy - Enzymatic activities - Halogenated compounds - High resolution crystal structure - Pathophysiological - Specific inhibitors - Trypsin-like serine protease - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)","461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2017T010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFE0103200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018J01729, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Department of Education, Fujian Province; Number: -, Acronym: ESRF, Sponsor: European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; Number: 31370737, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31670739, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31400637, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31570745, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and the scientists at beam line BL17U for assistance with X-ray data collection.

When the tunnel is not properly treated after large deformation, it is likely to cause secondary disasters such as arches multiple replacement or tunnel collapses. With the self-designed excavation device and the internal displacement-measuring device for surrounding rock, a physical model test system was used to investigate the tunnel progressive failure, deformation and stress variation during tunnel excavation and buried depth increasing, thus revealing the key supporting parts to prevent large deformation of tunnels. Furthermore, the failure characteristics of the primary lining during large deformation treatment was also studied, and the supporting measures for large deformation treatment were defined. The results are summarised as follows. During the large deformation of the tunnel, the deformation of the vault and the arch bottom are larger than that of the arch waist and arch foot, and the difference increases gradually with the increase of buried depth. The radial and tangential stresses of the vault of tunnel decrease during the large deformation, while the tangential stress of the arch foot increases sharply. When the deformed arch frame is replaced, there may be tension failure at the lining arch near the replacement position, and shear failure at the lining arch waist. Therefore, it is necessary to retain the temporary steel support when the large deformation is observed, and the bottom horizontal support or the temporary inverted arch should be added. This study is helpful to obtain the key prevention and control location during and after the large deformation, which provides guidance and reference for the prevention and safe treatment of large deformation. © 2018, Science Press.

Because phosphate rock was chosen as the raw material from the phosphorus chemical process, its application can reduce the desulfurization cost. In addition, the produced sulfuric acid in the present desulfurization system can provide replacement of sulfuric acid required in typical phosphorus chemical activity. Accordingly, this desulfurization technology is of environmental and economic importance and also exhibits potential in treating other industrial SO2 pollution processes.

To fit an image with the target resolution, certain unimportant regions need to be deleted or distorted, and the key problem is to determine the importance of each pixel. Existing methods predict pixel-wise importance in a bottom-up manner via eye fixation estimation or saliency detection. In contrast, the proposed algorithm estimates the pixel-wise importance based on a top-down criterion where the target image maintains the semantic meaning of the original image. To this end, several semantic components corresponding to foreground objects, action contexts, and background regions are extracted. The semantic component maps are integrated by a classification guided fusion network. Specifically, the deep network classifies the original image as object or scene oriented, and fuses the semantic component maps according to classification results. The network output, referred to as the semantic collage with the same size as the original image, is then fed into any existing optimization method to generate the target image. Extensive experiments are carried out on the RetargetMe data set and S-Retarget database developed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art image retargeting methods. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","59","Semantics","Agriculture - Display devices - Flow visualization - Image resolution - Mobile phones - Pixels - Silicon - Sun","Background region - Classification results - Foreground objects - Image retargeting - Optimization method - Prediction algorithms - Saliency detection - Semantic components",,"Number: -, Acronym: BUAA, Sponsor: Beihang University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems; Number: Y6Z0021102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: Y7Z0241102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: AQ-1701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1149783, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NEC, Sponsor: National Engineering College; Number: U1536203, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61572493, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received July 17, 2017; revised January 3, 2018 and April 6, 2018; accepted April 27, 2018.

Histogram equalization method is one of the most popular image enhancement techniques for improving quality of digital images. However, a single histogram equalizer is not able to detect details of contrast existing in the whole image and enhanced results are often distorted. Inspired by machine learning ensemble, a strategy using multiple histogram equalizers on local windows has been applied on enhancing natural images. In this paper, this strategy is investigated further again and applied on MR brain images for contrast enhancement. Each single histogram equalizer on local patch of MR brain image is considered as a single classifier or predictor in machine learning ensemble. A global normalization is used for enhancing the whole image from multiple histogram equalizers. The effect of noise amplification of accelerated MR data acquisition on image enhancement is also studied. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances contrast among brain tissues (like white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) of MR brain images, but also outperforms other image enhancement methods for improving image quality. © 2018 IEEE.","14","Image enhancement","Artificial intelligence - Brain - Brain mapping - Cerebrospinal fluid - Data acquisition - Equalizers - Graphic methods - Learning systems - Magnetic resonance - Robotics","Contrast Enhancement - Digital image - Effect of noise - Global normalization - Histogram equalizations - Low contrast - Natural images - Pulse sequence","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 713.5 Electronic Circuits Other Than Amplifiers, Oscillators, Modulators, Limiters, Discriminators or Mixers - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 731.5 Robotics","Number: -, Acronym: UH, Sponsor: University of Houston; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 81729003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61563055, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","*Corresponding author ： Haifeng Wang, email: hf.wang1@siat.ac.cn.

Unfortunately, little is known about how AgNPs' toxicity affects the mechanisms of metabolite shift in aquatic organisms. The aim of this work is thus to study systematically the cellular metabolism of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa upon exposure to AgNPs by using metabolomics based on non-targeted liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results reveal that a total of 97 biochemical metabolites and 16 specific metabolic pathways are significantly altered by exposure to AgNPs, many of which are associated with cellular stress response. Importantly, a metabolic analysis identified some novel metabolic pathways that are specifically regulated by AgNPs, including arginine and proline metabolism, indole alkaloid biosynthesis, and phospholipid metabolism (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Further examination revealed that exposure to AgNPs elevates superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde generation, damages the thylakoids, and interrupts the endocytosis process in algae cells. Together, the manifestation of differential metabolic profiles combined with the perturbation of physiological indicators upon AgNP exposure is taken as evidence of damage to photosynthesis and membranes. These results provide holistic information about complex disturbances in metabolite profiles of M. aeruginosa upon exposure to AgNPs and provide new insights into the mechanisms of AgNPs' toxicity in the aquatic environment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","45","Metabolism","Amino acids - Aquatic organisms - Bacteria - Biochemistry - Biomolecules - Enzymes - Health risks - Liquid chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites - Metal nanoparticles - Phospholipids - Physiology - Silver nanoparticles - Toxicity","Cellular stress response - Ecological environments - Microcystis aeruginosa - Nanoparticle toxicity - Phosphatidylinositol - Physiological indicators - Silver nanoparticles (AgNps) - Superoxide dismutase activities","461.7 Health Care - 461.9 Biology - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 21307105, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21567029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21567029 and 21307105).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Furthermore, the elastic anisotropy is also discussed by plotting both the 3D contours and the 2D planar projections of Young's modulus and shear modulus. The predicted elastic anisotropy factors indicate that the degree of elastic anisotropy of Pd is significant, while Ru has the smallest elastic anisotropy. By using the Clarke’s model, the minimum thermal conductivities of these metals have also been analyzed, and the results indicate that the low minimum thermal conductivity is proportional to the Debye temperature ΘD.

JsPRP1 protein inhibited pathogenic fungi. JsPRP1 overexpression in tobacco conferred strong resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Abstract: Walnut (Juglans sigillata Dode) is one of the important sources of nuts and timbers in the world. With the expansion of walnut cultivation area, its disease hazards have become a serious problem. In this study, a novel hybrid proline-rich cell-wall protein gene JsPRP1 was investigated and isolated from Juglans sigillata Dode induced by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) analysis showed that JsPRP1 transcriptional level was up-regulated in J. sigillata Dode following jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene, and hydrogen peroxide treatments, and C. gloeosporioides inoculation. The JsPRP1 gene was further fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in a plant expression vector and transferred into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. Laser scanning confocal microscope confirmed that JsPRP1 was expressed in the cell wall. Moreover, the JsPRP1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein purified by Ni–NTA column showed in vitro antifungal activity to C. gloeosporioides, Gibberella moniliformis, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and Fusarium solani. Furthermore, the plant overexpression vector of JsPRP1 was constructed and transferred into tobacco. The T2 transgenic tobacco showed high tolerance to drought, CdCl2, and C. gloeosporioides infection, meanwhile the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transgenic tobacco was significantly lower than wild-type plant under stress. The above results indicate that JsPRP1 is an important defense gene in J. sigillata Dode against drought, CdCl2 stress, and C. gloeosporioides infection. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","27","Recombinant proteins","Cadmium chloride - Chlorine compounds - Cytology - Drought - Escherichia coli - Ethylene - Fungi - Salicylic acid - Tobacco - Transcription","Colletotrichum gloeosporioides - Juglans sigillata dode - Proline-rich proteins - Stress tolerance - Transgenic tobacco",,"Number: 2011BAD46B00, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; ","This study appreciates the fund from Supporting Plan Issue of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2011BAD46B00).

Recently, with the accessibility of a massive number of physiological signal data, emotion analysis by using physiological signals is attracting an increasing attention and many methods have been reported by using electroencephalogram (EEG) or peripheral physiological signals. Although the prominent online learning methods can predict the emotion status with time varying physiological signals, it does not consider the reward of current operation in each iteration. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement online learning (ROL) method for real-time emotion state prediction by exploiting the reward to modify the predictor during the online training iterations. In each iteration, we evaluate the reward and then select some specific instances into predictor learning. It gains both significant time reduction and prominent performance. We apply the reinforcement online learning to least squares (LS) and support vector regression (SVR) for Emotion Prediction, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on artificial dataset and real-world physiological signal dataset (DEAP dataset) and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","37","E-learning","Electroencephalography - Forecasting - Iterative methods - Physiology - Reinforcement learning","41A05 - 41A10 - 65D05 - 65D17 - Emotion predictions - Online learning","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 Biology - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 14CX02203A, Acronym: CUPB, Sponsor: China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61671480, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61671480, 61572486; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Petroleum (East China), under Grants 14CX02203A.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, existing context-based word embeddings such as Word2vec and GloVe typically fail to capture sufficient sentiment information, which may result in words with similar vector representations having an opposite sentiment polarity (e.g., good and bad), thus degrading sentiment analysis performance. To tackle this problem, recent studies have suggested learning sentiment embeddings to incorporate the sentiment polarity (positive and negative) information from labeled corpora. This study adopts another strategy to learn sentiment embeddings. Instead of creating a new word embedding from labeled corpora, we propose a word vector refinement model to refine existing pretrained word vectors using real-valued sentiment intensity scores provided by sentiment lexicons. The idea of the refinement model is to improve each word vector such that it can be closer in the lexicon to both semantically and sentimentally similar words (i.e., those with similar intensity scores) and further away from sentimentally dissimilar words (i.e., those with dissimilar intensity scores). An obvious advantage of the proposed method is that it can be applied to any pretrained word embeddings. In addition, the intensity scores can provide more fine-grained (real-valued) sentiment information than binary polarity labels to guide the refinement process. Experimental results show that the proposed refinement model can improve both conventional word embeddings and previously proposed sentiment embeddings for binary, ternary, and fine-grained sentiment classification on the SemEval and Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets. © 2014 IEEE.","71","Natural language processing systems","Binary trees - Classification (of information) - Data mining - Linguistics - Sentiment analysis - Vectors","Embeddings - Intensity scores - Low dimensional - Refinement process - Sentiment classification - Sentiment lexicons - Vector representations - Word vectors","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.1 Algebra","Number: 105-2221-E-155-059-MY2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Number: 105-2218-E-006-028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Manuscript received September 12, 2017; revised December 11, 2017; accepted December 11, 2017.

In this study, we analyzed iron species, redox-sensitive trace elements, and S-N-C isotopes of deepwater black shales in the Silikou section in the continental-margin Nanhua Basin (South China), which represent extensive clastic input mainly from the Cathaysia Block during the early Cambrian (~541–509 Ma). Integrated data reveal a continuous shift in bottom-water redox conditions at Silikou from euxinic in the lowermost black-shale interval (BS1, 0–37.4 m) to oxic in the uppermost black-shale interval (BS4, 296–372.9 m) accompanying a progressive movement of the O2/H2S redoxcline into the sediment. In between, most importantly, the BS2 interval (91–154 m) accumulated under manganous-ferruginous conditions (i.e., Fe-Mn reduction zone) characterized by an active Fe-Mn particulate shuttle, and the BS3 interval (204–260 m) under nitrogenous conditions (i.e., nitrate reduction zone) characterized by strong denitrification processes, suggesting highly complex redox conditions in early Cambrian oceans. The observed sequence of redox conditions supports a strong lateral and depth-related redox stratification in the early Cambrian ocean, including (from surface to deep and from nearshore to offshore) oxic, nitrate reduction, Fe-Mn reduction, and euxinic zones, which were sequentially recorded at Silikou likely due to secular expansion of the oxic surface layer and/or long-term relative sea level fall. Our study highlights the need for continued paleo-redox studies to explore the redox heterogeneity of early Cambrian oceans. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

However, with the decrease of zinc concentrate grade and increase of the impurity ions in the electrolyte, the corrosion consumption of the cathode material increases gradually. To further improve the corrosion resistance and electrocatalytic activity of the aluminum cathode, the electrochemical behavior of manganese as an additive for pure Al cathode material, such as Al-Mn alloy, was studied herein. Using the analysis methods of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cathodic polarization, galvanostatic polarization, and Tafel curves, the effect of Mn content on the electrochemical behavior of Al-Mn alloy in 40 constant temperature conditions and a solution containing Zn2+ at 65 g•L-1 and H2SO4 at 150 g•L-1 was investigated. The results show that the corrosion resistance of Al alloy containing Mn increases obviously compared to that of pure Al electrodes, and the increase of the Mn content could decrease the corrosion current. Moreover, the corrosion potential and the Mn content do not exhibit obvious change trends. When the Mn content reaches 1.5%, the corrosion current reaches the lowest value of 1.11 mA•cm-2 and the corrosion potential reaches the minimum of -1.0954 V. When the electrical potential of cathode becomes zero, the exchange current density is influenced by the Mn content and the exchange current density i0 exhibits an initial increasing trend and then declines with the increase of the Mn content. When the Mn content is 1.5%, the exchange current density of the Al alloy cathode reaches the maximum of 3.7462×10-16 mA•cm-2; this value is much higher than that of the pure Al electrode (4.8027×10-33 mA•cm-2). The overall change amplitude is obvious, and the electrocatalytic activity of the Al-Mn electrodes is much improved compared with a pure Al electrode. The electrochemical process is controlled by the electrochemical mass transfer. Considering the corrosion resistance and electrocatalytic activity of the electrode material, the Al-Mn alloy containing 1.5% of Mn can be used as an ideal electrolytic zinc cathode. © All right reserved.","20","Aluminum corrosion","Aluminum alloys - Binary alloys - Cathodes - Cathodic polarization - Corrosion resistance - Corrosion resistant alloys - Current density - Electrochemical corrosion - Electrochemical electrodes - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Electrolytes - Electrowinning - Manganese alloys - Mass transfer - Zinc","Al-Mn alloys - Electrocatalytic activity - Electrochemical behaviors - Electrochemical characteristics - Electrochemical process - Exchange current densities - Galvanostatic polarization - Kinetic process","539.1 Metals Corrosion - 541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 702 Electric Batteries and Fuel Cells - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The design process of a dual-frequency microstrip antenna was described in detail. Our simulation showed that the return loss was less than −10 dB, and the antenna had three resonance points, namely, 0.69, 1.55, and 1.78 GHz, with working frequency bands of 0.68–0.70, 1.54–1.58, and 1.77–1.79 GHz, respectively. These results proved that the dual-frequency microstrip antenna could simultaneously receive GPS and DTMB signals, and that the antenna was a circularly polarized antenna with single-point feeding and excellent radiation characteristics and strong practicability. In addition, the particle filter (PF) algorithm was applied to the combined positioning scheme, and the dynamic tracking effect of such an algorithm was simulated under different particle numbers. Simulation results showed that the filter tracking trajectory was close to the real trajectory, and that the higher the number of particles, the higher the positioning accuracy.

We next solve the four resulting light intensity equations after digital image processing of the four digital holograms to obtain the residual stress. A comparison of our experimental results with those of the drilling method (the conventional approach to determine residual stress) indicates that our digital holographic photoelasticity method can be suitably applied to the nondestructive evaluation of residual stress in transparencies. © 2018, The Optical Society of India.","24","Holograms","Elasticity - Image processing - Nondestructive examination - Photoelasticity - Physical optics - Polarization - Residual stresses - Transparency","Conventional approach - Digital holograms - Drilling methods - Holographic method - Non destructive evaluation - Photoelasticity method - Polarization direction - Residual stress fields",,"Number: 61565010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this study was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. : 11762009; 61565010)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Compared with single-scale segmentation, multiscale segmentation can obtain different structure information and shows good performance in classification. Nonetheless, in the previous multiscale algorithms, different scales are regarded as having equal contributions to classification, thus, multiscale segmentation can contain some unsuitable scales, which affects the classification accuracy. To overcome this drawback and sufficiently utilize structural information, a weighted multiscale region-level sparse representation classification (WMRSRC) algorithm is proposed. In the WMRSRC algorithm, different weights are utilized for the region-level features of different scales. The weights are determined by the segmentation quality, which is evaluated by interregion and intraregion heterogeneity measures (Local Moran's I and variance, respectively). Once the region weights on different scales are determined, the weighted joint sparse representation model is used to classify the multiscale regions. Through three classification experiments based on high-spatial resolution remote sensing images, we find that the proposed WMRSRC algorithm gives better results than other state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","49","Classification (of information)","Feature extraction - Image classification - Image resolution - Image segmentation - Remote sensing - Scales (weighing instruments)","Classification accuracy - Classification of remote sensing image - High spatial resolution - High spatial resolution images - Multi-scale - Multiscale segmentation - Sparse representation - State-of-the-art algorithms","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Pavia; Number: 41622109, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41371017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41661082, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017YFB0504205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Plan (Grant No. 2017YFB0504205) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41622109, 41371017, and 41661082).

Since its inception, lots of co-location pattern mining algorithms have been developed, but the computational cost remains prohibitively expensive with large data size. In this work, we propose to parallelize joinless algorithm on MapReduce framework. Our approach partitions computation in such a way that each machine independently executes joinless algorithm to finish a group of mining tasks. Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies and reduces communication cost between machines. Moreover, a novel pruning technique is suggested to improve mining performance. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets show that the parallel joinless algorithm is efficient and scalable. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","10","Data mining","Information systems - Information use - Location - Parallel algorithms - Systems engineering","Co-location patterns - Computational costs - Group-dependent shards - Map-reduce - Mapreduce frameworks - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining - Spatial dependencies","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018HC019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: YDY17110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61662086, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762090, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgement.

The mass and structure of AGN central black hole are studied by observing the change of AGN spectral line. We designed an optical system with dual channels, changing the focal length ratio of telescope from f/8.429 to f/5 through the lens, and divide the optical path into red and blue channels through the beam splitter. The red waveband is 650nm1000nm and the blue waveband is 400nm-650nm. Each channel has a CCD camera. We set up focusing lens before the camera of blue channel to compensate the difference focusing length between red and blue channel after the red channel being focused by adjusting the telescope. For the realization of three groups of broadband photometry and twenty-four groups of narrowband photometry, an automatic filter wheel system is designed to switch the filter. At the same time, in order to reduce the influence of temperature drift of the filter, a constant temperature adjusting system for filter wheel box is carried out. In order to overcome the issue that the telescope itself does not have enough tracking accuracy, a guiding system for the imaging system is designed and implemented. Finally, we designed and implemented a multi-level software control system so that the users can remotely control the telescope. © 2018 SPIE.","6","Imaging systems","Airborne telescopes - CCD cameras - Focusing - Industrial electronics - Lenses - Optical beam splitters - Optical systems - Photometry - Servomechanisms - Wheels","Aperture telescope - Astronomical imaging - Constant temperature - Electronic controls - Focusing device - Guiding systems - Software control systems - Temperature drifts","601.2 Machine Components - 705 Electric Generators and Motors - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 746 Imaging Techniques - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: 1508085MA07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; Number: -, Acronym: ThEP Center, Sponsor: Thailand Center of Excellence in Physics; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 11603023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11773026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Particle Detection and Electronics; Number: WK2030040064, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Support Program for Longyuan Youth and Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Gansu Province; Number: WK2360000003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Support Program for Longyuan Youth and Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Gansu Province; ","We acknowledge the financial support by the National Natural Science Funds of China under Grant No: 11603023, 11773026, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2360000003, WK2030040064), the Natural Science Funds of Anhui Province under Grant No: 1508085MA07, the Research Funds of the State Key Laboratory of Particle Detection and Electronics, the CAS Center for Excellence in Particle Physics, the Research Funds of Key Laboratory of Astronomical Optics & Technology, CAS.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Results of the cluster and outlier analysis revealed that Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian and Guangdong were core areas of H7N9 epidemic during the study period, which was consistent with the results of the hot spot analysis in this study. Consequently, the eastern and the southeast coast of China could be regarded as the key regions of epidemic surveillance of A(H7N9) human infections in China in the future.

In order to explore the morphological characteristics of gully systems and watersheds in the Dry-Hot Valley [South West (SW) China], gullies are interpreted from online Google images with high resolution and watersheds are extracted from digital elevation model at a scale of 1:50,000. The results show that: (1) There are 17,382 gullies (with a total area of 1141.66 km2) and 42 watersheds in the study area. (2) The average gully density of the study area (D) is 4.29 km/km2, gully frequency (F) is 14.39 gullies/km2, the branching ratio (B) is 5.13, the length ratio (L) is 3.12, and the coefficient of the main and tributary gullies (M) is 0.06. The degree of gully erosion is strong to extremely strong, the main development intensity of gully erosion ranges from intense to moderate, and the type of gully system is tributary. (3) The watershed areas (A) are between 0.39 and 96.43 km2, the relief ratio (R) is from 0.10 to 0.19, the circularity ratio (C) is from 0.30 to 0.83, the texture ratio (T) is from 0.82 to 39.35, and the dominant geomorphological texture type is fine. (4) There is a quantitative relationship between F and D:F = 0.624D2 (R =0.84) and T is closely related to D, F, M (R2 > 0.7). A, R and C are related to M (R2 > 0.5). The development of gully systems is the result of coupling effects between multiple factors. In this area, the degree of erosion and the condition of the main and tributary gullies can be controlled by the degree of topographic breakage in the watershed, which provides some theoretical basis for the evaluation of gully erosion by the latter. In addition, the scale, relief, and shape have a significant impact on the locations of the main and tributary gullies. For tributary gullies, attention should be paid to the interception and control of runoff and sediment in the small confluence branches in order to prevent gully expansion and head advance. These features can inform the development of targeted measures for the control of soil erosion. © 2018, Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","39","Landforms","Erosion - Online systems - Soil conservation - Watersheds","Degree of erosion - Digital elevation model - Dry-hot valleys - Gully system - Morphological characteristic - Multiple factors - Quantitative relationships - Runoff and sediments",,"Number: ESP201301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Sichuan Province; Number: 16ZB0182, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Sichuan Province; Number: 17YC105, Acronym: CWNU, Sponsor: China West Normal University; Number: 2017JY0189, Acronym: SPDST, Sponsor: Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province; ","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful for financial support from the Meritocracy Research Funds of China West Normal University (17YC134, 17YC105), Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and Ecological Security Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (ESP201301), the Project of Science & Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2018SZ0337, 2017JY0189), the Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education (16ZB0182, 18TD0025, 18ZA0465).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Due to the low binding capacity of protein A affinity materials compared to other ion exchange materials, protein A affinity materials are often discussed to be the bottleneck among current purification processes and diseases treatment. In this study, the heterofunctional amino and epoxy agarose was used to immobilize the recombinant protein A (rSpA). The immobilization courses of rSpA and the effect of pH and ionic strength and amino density of the heterofunctional supports on the coupling efficiencies of rSpA were investigated. The optimum conditions for rSpA immobilized on the heterofuntional supports were determined as pH 8.0, the ionic strength of 5 mM borate buffer, and the amino density of 15 μmol g-1. Moreover, the 3D structure of B domain from protein A was analyzed by PyMol software and the web-based program MemBrain. The most likely immobilization sites of B domain were located at the Lys-49 and Lys-50, exposing the IgG-binding pocket to the medium. After immobilization, the remaining epoxy groups were blocked with the ethanolamine to obtain the rSpA affinity materials with different ligand density for antibody adsorption from the human plasma. The static and dynamic IgG-binding capacities were determined to be 42 and 32 mg g-1, respectively. The high IgG-binding capacities could be attributed to the oriented attachment of rSpA on the heterofunctional supports, and these results demonstrate that the heterofunctional amino and epoxy agarose is very promising to permit the oriented covalent attachment of rSpA, and that way to prepare affinity materials with high binding capacity. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) pretreatment is a method for biochar modification, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this work, biochars and the raw biomass were treated by H3PO4 prior to pyrolysis. Due to an acid catalysis and crosslink, the micropores of the pretreated particles were much more than those without H3PO4 pretreatment, resulting in the dramatical enhancement of specific surface areas of the pretreated particles. Crystalline cellulose (CL) exhibited a greater advantage in the formation of micropores than of amorphous lignin (LG) with H3PO4 modification. The formation mechanisms of micropores were: (a) H+ from H3PO4 contributes to micropores generation via H+ catalysis process; (b) the organic phosphate bridge protected the carbon skeleton from micropore collapse via the crosslinking of phosphate radical. The sorption capacities to carbamazepine (CBZ) and bisphenol A (BPA) increased after H3PO4 modification, which is ascribed to the large hydrophobic surface areas and more abundant micropores. Overall, H3PO4 pretreatment produced biochars with large surface area and high abundance of porous structures. Furthermore, the H3PO4 modified biochars can be applied as high adsorbing material as well as P-rich fertilizer. H3PO4 pretreatment enhances the sorption of organic pollutants on biochars by generation of micropores. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","49","Microporosity","Amides - Carbon - Catalysis - Hydrophobicity - Organic pollutants - Phosphoric acid - Sorption - Specific surface area - Surface chemistry","Biochars - Carbon sequestration - Crystalline cellulose - H3PO4 treatment - Hydrophobic surfaces - Micropores - Organic contaminant - Sorption capacities",,"Number: 41663013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2016FA040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research was supported by National Natural Scientific Foundation of China ( 41663013 , U1602231 and 41703121 ), and Yunnan applied basic research project ( 2016FA040 ).

We have recently proposed that endothelial cells can serve as innate immune cells, but the molecular mechanisms involved still await discovery. Here, we investigated whether human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) could be transdifferentiated into innate immune cells by exposing them to hyperlipidemia–up-regulated DAMP molecules, i.e. lysophospholipids. Performing RNA-seq analysis of lysophospholipid-treated HAECs, we found that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) regulate largely distinct gene programs as revealed by principal component analysis. Metabolically, LPC up-regulated genes that are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, presumably through sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2 (SREBP2). By contrast, LPI up-regulated gene transcripts critical for the metabolism of glucose, lipids, and amino acids. Of note, we found that LPC and LPI both induce adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all classic markers of endothelial cell activation, in HAECs. Moreover, LPC and LPI shared the ability to transdifferentiate HAECs into innate immune cells, including induction of potent DAMP receptors, such as CD36 molecule, T-cell costimulation/coinhibition receptors, and MHC-II proteins. The induction of these innate-immunity signatures by lysophospholipids correlated with their ability to induce up-regulation of cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, lysophospholipids such as LPC and LPI induce innate immune cell transdifferentiation in HAECs. The concept of prolonged endothelial activation, discovered here, is relevant for designing new strategiesfor managing cardiovascular diseases. © 2018 Li et al.","59","Endothelial cells","Biochemistry - Chemical activation - Cytology - Genes - Molecules - Phospholipids - Principal component analysis - Proteins - T-cells","Cardio-vascular disease - Human aortic endothelial cells - Lysophosphatidylcholine - Major histocompatibility complex - Molecular mechanism - Reactive oxygen species - Sterol regulatory elements - Trans differentiations","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 17SDG33671051, Acronym: AHA, Sponsor: American Heart Association; Number: DK104116, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Number: DK113775, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Number: HL110764, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: HL117654, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: HL130233, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: HL131460, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: HL132399, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: HL138749, Acronym: NHLBI, Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Number: -, Acronym: NIDDK, Sponsor: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Number: -, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; ","This work was supported by Grants HL131460, HL132399, HL138749, HL130233, HL110764, and HL117654 from the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health and Grants DK104116 and DK113775 from the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (to X.-F.

Furthermore, electrovalent and covalent bonds were observed in both c-CuO and m-CuO. The linear optical properties were calculated and analyzed along different polarization directions of the incident light. The results indicated that m-CuO possesses optical anisotropic properties.

Therefore, a dynamic cold-start recommendation algorithm would be highly helpful in such quick-changing social networks. In this paper, a novel user group-based collaborative method, called UCFRA (User group-based Cold-start Friend Recommendation Algorithm) is proposed. UCFRA integrates a graphical model and statistical population characteristics into a user group model and then combines this extended user group model with cold-start information to generate a new recommendation algorithm. Moreover, a content popularity model based on user groups and a user rating matrix is designed. In order to improve recommend precision, a user group Top-N recommendation model based on k-nearest neighbors is provided.

The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, the addition of H2O2and the addition of water-quenched slag on arsenic removal rate were systematically investigated. The reaction temperature of 70°C, reaction time of 1 h, H2O2addition of 10.8 mL/L and water-quenched slag addition of 17.8 g/L are identified as the best technical parameters. At the optimum conditions, the arsenic (III) with high concentration (As 4.13 g/L) is efficiently removed (arsenic removal rate > 99%). The filtrate (Fe 1.21 mg/L, As 1.53 mg/L) with low concentrations of arsenic and iron and the stable filter residue are also obtained successfully.

The theoretical model is built based on the Maxwell-Bloch formulism accounting for two-way propagations of electric field and polarization as well as the couplings among the electric field, polarization, and population inversion. The pulse evolution in time-spatial domains is simulated by the finite-difference method with prior nondimensionalization, which is necessary for a convergent solution. Results predict that the SHB could broaden the QCL gain bandwidth and induce additional side modes closely around the central lasing mode with an intensity more pronounced than that of GVD associated side modes.

Here, we introduce a parameter δ to control the range of link weight. Through numeric simulations, we find that coevolution setup can promote the evolution of cooperation.

However, few studies have focused on the problem of class imbalance in protein subnuclear localization. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the class imbalance problem based on the oversampling method. Firstly, the features of protein are captured by PSSM, and then the KPCA is used to extract the valuable information of protein in PSSM. Next, the proposed method named M-SMOTE is used to generate new samples of minority class and eliminate the imbalance in different class. Finally, the processed samples are input into the Random Forest classifier to predict the protein subnuclear localization. The experiments results obtained by jackknife test indicate that the M-SMOTE can effectively solve the class imbalance problem and improve the classification performance in protein subnuclear localization. © 2018 IEEE.","21","Proteins","Biomedical engineering - Decision trees - Image processing - Principal component analysis","Class imbalance - Class imbalance problems - Classification models - Classification performance - Kernel principal component - Over sampling - Random forest classifier - Subnuclear localization","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61863036, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015SE101, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61863036), the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province (No. 2015SE101) and the Scientific Research Fund of Education Department of Yunnan Province in China (No. 2017YJS108).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, our understanding of the spatial interactions among ESs is relatively limited, particularly in mountainous areas. Using the global biodiversity hotspot known as the Three Parallel Rivers Region in Southwest China as a case study, this paper systematically investigated the spatial trade-offs and synergies among 8 ESs (i.e. crop production, livestock-raising, water supply, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, soil retention, habitat support and nature recreation). We mapped the township-level distributions of the 8 ESs and measured their relationships using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and overlap analyses of ES hotspots/coldspots. Four types of ES bundles were identified by applying the K-means clustering analysis to the 8 ESs. Our results revealed high to moderate levels of interactions among most pairs of ESs. Most provisioning services showed trade-offs with ESs of the other categories, whereas most regulating services demonstrated synergies with other ESs. The ES bundles presented a reasonable set of ecological zones that were characterized by the provisions of different ESs. The spatial patterns of ESs and their interactions corresponded well to the regional socio-ecological gradients in topography, climate and human activities. Our results should have important applications in regional decision-makings on economic development and environmental conservation.

We present a multiwavelength study of an atypical submillimeter galaxy, GH500.30, in the GOODS-North field, with the aim to understand its physical properties of stellar and dust emission, as well as the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. Although it is shown that the source is likely an extremely dusty galaxy at high redshift, its exact position of submillimeter emission is unknown. Methods. We use NOEMA observation at 1.2 mm with subarcsecond resolution to resolve the dust emission, and precisely localize the counterparts at other wavelengths, which allows us to better constrain its stellar and dust spectral energy distribution (SED) as well as redshift. We carry out the new near-infrared (NIR) photometry of GH500.30 observed with HST, and perform panchromatic SED modelling from ultraviolet (UV)/optical to submillimeter. We derive the photometric redshift using both NIR and far-infrared (FIR) SED modeling, and place constraints on the stellar and dust properties such as stellar mass, age, dust attenuation, IR luminosity, and star-formation rate (SFR). The AGN properties are inferred from the X-ray spectral analysis and radio observations, and its contribution to the total IR luminosity is estimated from the broadband SED fittings using MAGPHYS. Results. With the new NOEMA interferometric imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy. It has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR images observed with HST at λ 1.4 μm. Photometric-redshift analyses from both stellar and dust SED suggest it to likely be at z 4, though a lower redshift at z 3.1 cannot be fully ruled out (at 90% confidence interval). Explaining its unusual optical-to-NIR properties requires an old stellar population (∼0.67 Gyr), coexisting with a very dusty ongoing starburst component. The latter is contributing to the FIR emission, with its rest-frame UV and optical light being largely obscured along our line of sight. If the observed fluxes at the rest-frame optical/NIR wavelengths were mainly contributed by old stars, a total stellar mass of ∼3.5 × 1011 M™ would be obtained. An X-ray spectral analysis suggests that this galaxy harbors a heavily obscured AGN with NH = 3.3+2.0-1.7 × 1023 cm-2 and an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of Lx ∼ 2.6 × 1044 erg s-1, which places this object among distant type 2 quasars. The radio emission of the source is extremely bright, which is an order of magnitude higher than the star-formation-powered emission, making it one of the most distant radio-luminous dusty galaxies. Conclusions. The combined characteristics of the galaxy suggest that the source appears to have been caught in a rare but critical transition stage in the evolution of submillimeter galaxies, where we are witnessing the birth of a young AGN and possibly the earliest stage of its jet formation and feedback. © 2018 ESO.","121","Galaxies","Cosmology - Dust - FIR filters - Infrared devices - Luminance - Photometry - Spectrum analysis - Stars - X rays","Galaxies : active - Galaxies: starbursts - Galaxies:high-redshift - Submillimeter: galaxies - X rays:galaxies","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 703.2 Electric Filters - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: 694343, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB857005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: ERC, Sponsor: European Research Council; Number: 11822301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11573001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: ERC, Sponsor: European Research Council; Number: QYZDJ-SSW-SLH006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1608085QA06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NSFC-11473026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NSFC-11421303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB857004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgements.

Many related models and theories of electrical breakdown have been proposed. However, a widely recognized understanding on the following phenomenon is still lacking: impulse breakdown strength which varies with waveform parameters, decrease in the breakdown strength of AC voltage with increasing frequency, and higher impulse breakdown strength than that of AC. In this work, an improved model of activation energy absorption for different electrical breakdowns in semi-crystalline insulating polymers is proposed based on the Harmonic oscillator model. Simulation and experimental results show that, the energy of trapped charges obtained from AC stress is higher than that of impulse voltage, and the absorbed activation energy increases with the increase in the electric field frequency. Meanwhile, the frequency-dependent relative dielectric constant rand dielectric loss tanδ also affect the absorption of activation energy. The absorbed activation energy and modified trap level synergistically determine the breakdown strength. The mechanism analysis of breakdown strength under various voltage waveforms is consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, the proposed model of activation energy absorption in the present work may provide a new possible method for analyzing and explaining the breakdown phenomenon in semi-crystalline insulating polymers. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","36","Activation energy","Crystalline materials - Dielectric losses - Electric breakdown of liquids - Energy absorption - Insulating materials - Insulation - Oscillators (mechanical) - Polymers","Electric field frequency - Electrical breakdown - Electrical equipment - Frequency dependent - Harmonic oscillator model - Insulating polymer - Relative dielectric constant - Waveform parameters","413 Insulating Materials - 601.1 Mechanical Devices - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 2015CB251003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFB0902702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This paper is supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2015CB251003) and National Key Basic Research Program of China (2017YFB0902702).

The accessibility of rescue can be expressed as the ratio between the rescue distance and the speed of rescue, that is, the time to save the cost. At present, the rescue distance is calculated by the traditional Euclidean distance, which is ignoring the problem of barriers in the path, resulting in the error of the rescue distance in some areas neither. Therefore, the accessibility result of the rescue is also not very exactly accurate. To solve this problem, this paper takes the South China Sea as an example, and proposes a Cellular Automaton (CA) based on computing method. Combined with the spatial analysis function of GIS, we get the accessibility of 9 rescue stations in the South China Sea and analyze their spatial distribution characteristics. By comparing the traditional accessibility calculation method, it is proved that the method is feasible and the result is more accurate. The results show that the CA based accessibility analysis method can demonstrate the computation process of rescue accessibility through the state of cells, and solve the problems of barrier reefs in the process of rescue distance calculation. According to the rescue accessibility calculated, we can draw the conclusion that the northern waters of the South China Sea rescue gets higher accessibility, the Zhongsha, Xisha and Dongsha Islands relief accessibility is mostly within 2 hours. The accessibility of the Spratly Islands sea area is low, and it is necessary to increase the construction of the rescue base there. © 2018 IEEE.","15","Spatial variables measurement","Calcium - Decision making - Problem solving - Spatial distribution","Computation process - Distance calculation - Distribution characteristics - Rescue accessibility - Rescue distance - Search-and-rescue capabilities - South China sea - Spatial analysis","549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements","Number: 41501436, Acronym: NYSF, Sponsor: National Youth Science Foundation; Number: 41501436, Acronym: NYSF, Sponsor: National Youth Science Foundation; ","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation’s Youth Science Fund Project (No. 41501436).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the solid-phase synthesis of NCA cathode material is carried out by mixing two types of raw materials via stirring or sand milling. The effects of different particle sizes on the structure and morphology of NCA materials are analyzed. Owing to the different particle sizes of the raw materials, the diffusion path of Li+between the solid phases differs greatly.

Recently, some of the works have explored neural networks to do an in-depth understanding of textual item content and achieved impressive effectiveness by generating more accurate item latent models. Nevertheless, there remains an open issue as how to effectively exploit description documents of both users and items in matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed dual-regularized matrix factorization with deep neural networks (DRMF) to deal with this issue. DRMF adopts a multilayered neural network model by stacking convolutional neural network and gated recurrent neural network, to generate independent distributed representations of contents of users and items. Then, representations serve to regularize the generation of latent models both for users and items in matrix factorization. We propose the corresponding algorithm for learning all parameters in DRMF. Experimental results proved that the dual-way regularization strategy significantly improves the matrix factorization methods on the accuracy of rating prediction and the recall of top-n recommendations. Also, as the components of DRMF, the new neural network model works better than the single convolutional neural network model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","54","Deep neural networks","Convolution - Factorization - Matrix algebra - Recommender systems - Recurrent neural networks","Convolutional neural network - Distributed representation - In-depth understanding - Matrix factorizations - Multilayered neural networks - Neural network model - Regularization - Regularization strategies","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra","Number: C6153001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2016M592721, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2017YDJQ06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: WX173602, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61562090, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61402398, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61562090 , 61472345 , 61402398 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project ( 2016M592721 ), the Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province ( 2014FA023 ), the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province, Program for the second Batch of Yunling Scholar of Yunnan Province (C6153001), the Special Funds for Science and Technology Research Project of Yunnan University (2017YDJQ06) and Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University ( WX173602 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
