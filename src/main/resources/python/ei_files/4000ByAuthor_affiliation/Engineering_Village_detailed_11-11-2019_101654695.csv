Elemental composition changes to the surfaces of pine wood and birch wood that had undergone high-temperature heat treatment were investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The O/C (oxygen/carbon) ratios of the wood surfaces were reduced after the thermo-vacuum and superheated steam heat treatments, which indicated a decrease in the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups. The content of C1(carbon atoms bonded to carbon or hydrogen atoms) increased, and that of C2(carbon atoms bonded to one oxygen atom) decreased after the thermo-vacuum and superheated steam heat treatments. The results also indicated that the relative lignin content increased and the hydroxyl group (-OH) content in the cellulose and hemicellulose decreased. The ratio of O2(oxygen atoms bonded to carbon atoms with a double bond) to O1(oxygen atoms bonded to carbon atoms with a single bond) increased remarkably. Thus, the content of carbonyl groups in the lignin increased.","47","Heat treatment","Atoms - Carbon - Cellulose - Chemical bonds - Lignin - Oxygen - Photodegradation - Photoelectrons - Photons - Pyrolysis - Steam - Wood - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Cellulose and hemicellulose - Chemical compositions - Elemental compositions - High temperature heat treatment - Mechanical strength loss - Oxygen-containing functional groups - Superheated steam - Vacuum treatment","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 2017, Acronym: SWFU, Sponsor: Southwest Forestry University; Number: 2015Y291, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2015Y293, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2017YFD0600202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31360157, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National key technology research and development project (No. 2017YFD0600202) , Scientific Research Start-up Project of Southwest Forestry University (No. 2017), Yunnan Provincial Education Department Projects (No. 2015Y291, 2015Y293) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31360157).

Given its close relationship with the in situ stress state, the presence and features of core disking can be used to interpret the stresses when traditional in situ stress measuring techniques are not available. The core disking process was simulated in this paper using the three-dimensional discrete element method software PFC3D(particle flow code). In particular, PFC3D is used to examine the evolution of fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence associated with core disking under various stress states. In this paper, four unresolved problems concerning core disking are investigated with a series of numerical simulations. These simulations also provide some verification of existing results by other researchers: (1) Core disking occurs when the maximum principal stress is about 6.5 times the tensile strength. (2) For most stress situations, core disking occurs from the outer surface, except for the thrust faulting stress regime, where the fractures were found to initiate from the inner part. (3) The anisotropy of the two horizontal principal stresses has an effect on the core disking morphology. (4) The thickness of core disk has a positive relationship with radial stress and a negative relationship with axial stresses. © 2018, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","41","Numerical methods","Computer simulation - Finite difference method - Fracture - Numerical models - Stresses - Tensile strength","Axial stress - Core disking - Fracture initiation - Maximum principal stress - Particle flow code - Principal stress - Radial stress - Three-dimensional Discrete Element Methods",,"Number: 51774020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: Z151100000315014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Outstanding Talent Training Foundation; ","Acknowledgements The support received from Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of China (51774020) and Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talent in S & T (Z151100000315014) is gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The target detection framework-the single shot multi-box detection (SSD) based on deep learning is improved, and a multi-target detection framework adaptive perceive SSD is proposed, which is specially used for the multi-target detection in complex and large traffic scenes. A feature convolution kernel library composed of multi-form Gabor and color Gabor is designed. The optimal feature extraction convolution kernel group is trained and screened to replace the low-level convolution kernel group of the original network, and effectively improves the detection accuracy. A single image detection framework is combined with a convolution long-short-term memory network, and the temporal association of network frame-level information is realized by extracting the characteristic mapping between propagation frames with a bottleneck-long-term and short-term memory layer. And the calculation cost is reduced, and the tracking and identification of targets affected by the strong interference in the video are realized. An adaptive threshold strategy is added to reduce the rate of missing and false alarms. The experimental results show that compared with other target detection frameworks based on deep learning, the average accuracy of various target recognition is increased by 9%~16%, the average accuracy is increased by 14%~21%, the multi-target detection rate is increased by 21%~36%, and the detection frame rate reaches 32 frame•s-1, which achieves a balance between the accuracy and real-time performance of the algorithm and achieves better detection and recognition results. © 2018, Chinese Lasers Press.

However, the shape of pulse wave is affected because the propagation velocity (PV) and amplitude of the reflected wave changes with vascular wall elasticity. We assess the performance of the TT-based local PWV estimation for different PVs with four timing methods, i.e. the maximum value of the second derivative (M2D), the intersecting tangent (IT), the 20% threshold (TH20) and the maximum value of the first derivative (M1D) methods, for time fiduciary point detection. The wall distension waveforms propagating along a segment of CCA are modelled by a synthesization of the estimated incident and reflected waves for different PVs. The performance of the estimation based on the four methods is evaluated by measuring relative errors (REs). The results show that for the PVs below 6 m/s, the M2D, IT and TH20 methods exhibit good precision with REs less than 11%; for the PVs over 6 m/s, the M2D method is the most accurate than other three methods for the PWV estimation. The M2D method is the most suitable for the PWV estimation under a wide range of PV conditions. It may provide us with useful suggestions for improving the PWV estimation in clinical measurements. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","10","Acoustic wave velocity","Bioinformatics - Wave propagation","Carotid artery - Clinical measurements - Common carotid artery - Incident and reflected waves - Propagation velocities - Pulse wave velocity - Reflected - Second derivatives","461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 751.1 Acoustic Waves",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, a rapid method using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopies coupled with data fusion was established for the discrimination of Boletus mushrooms from seven different geographical origins with pattern recognition method. Initially, the spectra of 332 mushroom samples obtained from the two spectroscopic techniques were analyzed individually and then the classification performance based on data fusion strategy was investigated. Meanwhile, the latent variables (LVs) of FT-IR and UV spectra were extracted by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and two datasets were concatenated into a new matrix for data fusion. Then, the fusion matrix was further analyzed by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with single spectroscopic technique, data fusion strategy can improve the classification performance effectively. In particular, the accuracy of correct classification of SVM model in training and test sets were 99.10% and 100.00%, respectively.

Based on the experimental investigation, a coupled elastoplastic damage model is developed within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. The coupling effects between the plastic and damage dissipations are described by introducing an isotropic damage variable into the elastic stiffness and yield criterion. The novelty of the model is in the description of the thermodynamic force associated with damage, which is formulated as a state function of both elastic and plastic strain energies. The latter gives a full consideration on the comprehensive effects of plastic strain and stress changing processes in rock material on the development of damage. The damage criterion and potential are constructed to determine the onset and evolution of damage variable.

Secondly, on this basis, the rate effect of rock materials is analyzed. The rate effect of stiffness is considered in the elastic modulus and the rate effect of strength is taken into account in the Drucker-Prager criterion, and then the dynamic constitutive model for subloading surface of rock materials is established. Finally, through the self-programming, the dynamic constitutive model for the sub-loading surface of the rock materials is implanted, and the mechanical response of the rock materials under dynamic loads is simulated. The results show that the stress path model, compared with the Drucker-Prager criterion, can describe the Massing effect and the ratchet effect of basalt under cyclic loading, and reveal the developmental pattern of basalt. Through the simulation of dynamic uniaxial loading and cyclic loading by using the dynamic model, it is found that the larger the strain rate is, the larger the elastic modulus is and the smaller the strain is, which is in accordance with the mechanical properties of the rock during dynamic loading. Under the seismic load, the stress-strain curve of the rock also exhibits the hysteresis loop and rate effect. The seismic load has the equivalent cyclic load and the form of dynamic load, and the dynamic constitutive model for subloading surface is feasible to simulate the mechanical properties of the rock materials under seismic loads. © 2018, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.

The phenological information from rubber plantations was found effective in rubber mapping. Previous studies have mostly applied rule-pixel-based phenology approaches for rubber plantations mapping, which might result in broken patches in fragmented landscapes. This study introduces a new paradigm by combining phenology information with object-based classification to map fragmented patches of rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna. This research first delineated the time windows of the defoliation and foliation phases of rubber plantations by acquiring the temporal profile and phenological features of rubber plantations and natural forests through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. To investigate the ability of finer resolution images at capturing the temporal profile or phenological information, 30 m resolution Landsat image data were used to capture the temporal profile, and a phenology algorithm to separate rubber plantations and natural forests was then defined. The derived phenology algorithm was used by both the object-based and pixel-based classification to investigate whether the object-based approach could improve the mapping accuracy. Whether adding the phenology information to the object-based classification could improve rubber plantation mapping accuracy in mountainous Xishuangbanna was also investigated. This resulted in three approaches: rule-pixel-based phenology, rule-object-based phenology, and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology. The results showed that the rule-object-based phenology approaches (with overall accuracy 77.5% and Kappa Coefficients of 0.66) and nearest-neighbor-object-based phenology approach (91.0% and 0.86) achieved a higher accuracy than that of the rule-pixel-based phenology approach (72.7% and 0.59). The results proved that (1) object-based approaches could improve the accuracy of rubber plantation mapping compared to the pixel-based approach and (2) incorporating the phenological information from vegetation improved the overall accuracy of the thematic map.","53","Rubber plantations","Classification (of information) - Forestry - Mapping - Maps - Pixels - Radiometers - Rubber - Satellite imagery - Vegetation","Hevea brasiliensis - LANDSAT - Object based - Phenology - Pixel based approach - Xishuangbanna","405.3 Surveying - 655.2 Satellites - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 818.1 Natural Rubber - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Universit&auml;t Hohenheim; Number: -, Acronym: FSC, Sponsor: Financial Services Commission; Number: -, Acronym: DAAD, Sponsor: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Number: NNX14AD78G, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BMZ, Sponsor: Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung; Number: -, Acronym: DAAD, Sponsor: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Number: -, Acronym: JSU, Sponsor: Jiangsu University; Number: 2013M540722, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: NAU, Sponsor: Nanjing Agricultural University; Number: 13.1432.7-001.00, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 01LL0919A, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: QYZDB-SSW-DQC005, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: QYZDY-SSW-SMC014, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: BMZ, Sponsor: Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung; Number: -, Acronym: NAU, Sponsor: Northern Arizona University; Number: 31760181, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41401647, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31400493, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31300403, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: This work is funded in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41401647, 31300403, 31400493, 31760181), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2013M540722), Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB-SSW-DQC005 and QYZDY-SSW-SMC014), and the NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change program (NNX14AD78G).

Therefore, when the inverter has faults of the AC system, it is very easy to cause the failure of the commutation of the DC system and even the failure of the continuous commutation. The 100 Hz protection with a delay of 3 s is continuously adopted in Yongfu HVDC, so it is urgent to analyze and predict the risk of mal-operation of DC system protection under AC system failure. Based on the simulation model and the protection logic of valve group used in the field practice, the operation characteristics of current valve group protection under different fault types, different fault phases and different operation modes of the inverter side system were simulated and analyzed, and the probability of their action was also counted. Based on this, the risk probability of the mal operation of the converter differential protection was given. The analysis results show that, while the single-phase grounding, two-phase grounding and three-phase faults occur on the inverter side AC system, there is a risk of mal-operation of the valve group differential, while the bridge differential protection will not be in maloperation. When a single-phase grounding fault occurs on the inverter side AC system, the protection of the valve differential is in mal-operation under different operation modes of the DC system, while the bridge differential protection will not be in maloperation. Therefore, an improved strategy is proposed, which uses AC fault characteristic quantity to lock valve difference protection and delay to ensure selectivity of protection, and its validity is verified by simulation experiments. © 2018, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

This work focused on performance comparison and effects of major operating parameters under two most common thermal boundary conditions regarding to low-grade heat sources, by employing a modified Shear-Stress Transport model where a variable turbulent Prandtl formulation was incorporated. Results show that in the pseudo-critical region thermal boundary condition obviously affected the performance of supercritical carbon dioxide gas heater. Compared with the uniform heat flux condition, at convective boundary condition impairment occurred in both the local enhancement at high mass flux and local deterioration at low mass flux, due to the self-regulation in local heat input. A nearly uniform thermal field under convective boundary condition was achieved by increasing the mass flux of heat source fluid, while increasing the inlet temperature of source fluid was ineffective to that end. Opposite to constant-property fluid heater, flow arrangement dramatically affected axial profiles of local heat transfer coefficient while had a much weaker effect on local heat flux in supercritical gas heater. Temperature distribution of supercritical carbon dioxide along the heater was insensitive to the flow arrangement. Further studies reveal that thermal boundary effect was closely related to the buoyancy effect. Thermal boundary condition has a minimal effect on heat transfer of supercritical carbon dioxide when buoyancy effect is negligible. Under heavy influence of buoyancy, thermal boundary effect was obvious in the form of much weaker local deterioration under convective boundary. Finally, the Jackson Nusselt correlation was found applicable to the prediction of overall heat transfer rate under convective boundary condition, with relative deviations within ±15%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","34","Supercritical fluid extraction","Boundary conditions - Buoyancy - Carbon dioxide - Deregulation - Deterioration - Gas heating - Gases - Heat convection - Heat flux - Rankine cycle - Shear flow - Shear stress","Buoyancy effect - Gas heaters - Self regulation - Supercritical carbon dioxides - Thermal boundary conditions","522 Gas Fuels - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2016YFB0600201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FB087, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","Financial support from the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB0600201 ) and Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2017FB087 ) is gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Our data show that the different abundances of A. adenophora altered species and functional diversity by changing the species composition and abundance in the understory community because of its higher specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf phosphorus concentration compared with native species. Meanwhile, the presence of A. adenophora led to changes in the patterns of species co-occurrence, with a shift from random to segregated patterns as the invasion intensity increased. Furthermore, the order of species loss under invasion was nonrandom. The LNC could be an indicative functional trait predicting the order of species loss, suggesting that species with a lower LNC were lost first with increasing invasion intensity. In addition, a high abundance of the invader A. adenophora suppressed the growth of the seedlings of native canopy trees. Our results indicate that the effect of the invasive herb A. adenophora on the understory community is associated with the nonrandom loss of species with different LNCs and that invasion also suppresses the growth of native canopy dominants. © 2018 The Japanese Forest Society.","55","Forestry","Biodiversity - Plants (botany)","Ecosystem functions - Functional diversity - Functional traits - Invasion - Segregated patterns - Species composition - Understory communities - Understory plant communities","454 Environmental Engineering","Number: 2017HC015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FD040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31360152, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31360152), Open Foundation of Yunnan Engineering Laboratory for Agro-environment Pollution Control and Eco-remediation, and The Innovation Team for Farmland Non-pollution Production of Yunnan Province National Key Sciences and Technology Program for Water Solutions (2017HC015), and Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (2014FD040).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the present study, we examined its function by overexpressing the gene in Nicotiana tabacum. We found that overexpression of MsDUF reduced seed vigor and germination percentage under normal conditions or osmotic stress. The reduced seed vigor and germination was associated with an increased ABA content in the overexpressor seeds. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of MsDUF resulted in up-regulation of transcript levels of ABA biosynthesis genes (ZEP, NCED1 and NCED6) in the seeds. Compared with wild type, MsDUF-overexpression seedlings displayed significantly lower chlorophyll content and reduced soluble sugar content under normal conditions. MDA content was significantly higher in MsDUF-overexpressors compared to wild type under ABA treatment, while soluble sugar content and peroxidase activities were significantly lower in MsDUF-overexpressors.

The derivatives were investigated as functional monomers in molecularly imprinted polymeric solid-phase microextraction (MIP-SPME) fiber coatings. The coatings, with a layer thickness of 250 μm, were immobilized onto stainless steel using a capillary tube as a mold. This study employed a simple, easy, and reproducible method to prepare uniform coatings for polychlorophenols extraction. The combination of molecular inclusion effects and the molecular imprinting sites was expected to enhance the molecular recognition ability for polychlorophenols. Compared with non-imprinted polymer coatings and MIP coatings with methacrylic acid as the functional monomer, the β-cyclodextrin MIP-SPME coatings exhibited significantly higher extraction amounts and excellent selectivity to the template of triclosan. The MIP-SPME coatings exhibited a favorable synergistic extraction capacity resulting from the β-cyclodextrin cavity and molecularly imprinted binding sites. The method of β-cyclodextrin MIP-SPME coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for triclosan and polychlorophenols analysis in real water samples was developed. The limit of quantification was 1 μg/L for the three polychlorophenols. The recovery for three analytes ranged from 83.71% to 109.98%, with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.83% to 12.19%. The β-cyclodextrin MIP-SPME fiber coatings could be used for at least 100 cycles.

First, we give the concept of influence degree to describe the influence of new data on the existing BN by measuring the variation of BN's probability parameters w.r.t. the likelihood of the new data. Then, for the nodes ordered decreasingly by their influence degrees, we give the scoring-based algorithm for revising BN's subgraphs iteratively by hill-climbing search for reversing, adding or deleting edges. In the incremental revision, we emphasize the preservation of probabilistic conditional independencies implied in the BN based on the concept and properties of Markov equivalence.

However, changes in wind speed and pressure gradient force (PGF) at higher elevations have received little attention. In this paper, the spatio-temporal changes of wind speed and PGF at different heights were explored in eastern China during the period 1980–2011, and the potential causes inducing the changes of wind speed were analysed. The results included that the reduction in wind speed emerged from the near surface to 300 hPa, while the PGF also exhibited a synchronous reduction. The influence of PGF on the decrease of wind speed was relative smaller at near surface than that at higher levels (850–300 hPa). At the near surface, 71.8% of changes in annual mean SWS could be attributed to the changes of PGF, in which the seasonal difference of the influence of PGF on wind speed was less than 7.0%. At the higher levels, most of the changes in wind speed (>90%) was induced by PGF, in which the seasonal difference of the influence of PGF was less than 1.0%. Furthermore, the changes of PGF in eastern China could be mainly influenced by both the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Traditionally, this problem is modeled by a submodular optimization objective, and solved by applying a cardinality constrained monotone submodular maximization. However, the existing submodular objectives do not directly capture the dis-similarity over pairs of nodes, while most of algorithms cannot easily take full advantage of the power of a distributed cluster computing platform, such as Spark, to significantly promote the efficiency of algorithms. To overcome the deficiencies of existing approaches, in this paper, a generalized distance metric based on a subadditive set function over the symmetry difference of neighbors of pairs of nodes is introduced to capture the pairwise dis-similarity over pairs of nodes. In our approach, DRG is formulated as a Max-Sum k-dispersion problem with metrical edge weights, which is NP-hard, in association with the proposed distance metric, a centralized linear time 2-approximation algorithm GA is then developed to significantly solve the problem of DRG. Moreover, we develop a highly parallelizable algorithm for DRG, which can be easily implemented in MapReduce style parallel computation models using GA as a basic reducer. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real network datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","36","Clustering algorithms","Cluster computing - Constrained optimization - Data mining - Efficiency - Genetic algorithms - Parallel processing systems - Problem solving","Distance metrics - Diversified ranking - Effectiveness and efficiencies - Generalized distances - Graph algorithms - Map-reduce - Parallel computation model - Submodular optimizations","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 913.1 Production Engineering - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2012SE303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012SE205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FB110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XT412003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61663046, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61562091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the following foundations: National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61562091 , 61472345 , 61663046 ), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province , China ( 2014FA023 , 2016FB110 , 2016FB104 ), Foundation of Backbone Teacher Development of Yunnan University , China ( XT412003 ), Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University , China ( XT412003 ), and Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering , China, Yunnan Province ( 2012SE303 , 2012SE205 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This manuscript addresses the development of a process of roasting spent catalyst with microwave heating. In the present investigation, desulfurization and decarburization of the spent catalyst were studied by treating with microwave heating for the recovery of molybdenum. We also studied the effect of various reaction conditions (temperature, holding time, microwave power, and granularity of the spent catalyst) on desulfurization and decarburization, and the leaching of molybdenum. The maximum desulfurization (96.7%) and decarburization (99.7%) were achieved when the spent catalyst (200 mesh) was treated using microwave power (960 W) at a temperature of 650 °C for 45 min. The results show that no complex metal oxides such as CoMoO4 were found in the XPS and XRD spectra of the samples after desulfurization and decarburization and that >96% of molybdenum is leached with a sodium carbonate solution. This method not only promotes rapid desulfurization and decarburization but also does not produce any complex metal oxides, thereby promoting the recovery of valuable metals in spent catalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","51","Metal recovery","Catalysts - Decarburization - Desulfurization - Leaching - Metals - Microwave generation - Microwave heating - Molybdenum - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium compounds - Sulfur compounds","Complex metal oxides - Industrial catalyst - Microwave power - Microwave treatment - New approaches - Reaction conditions - Recovery of valuable metals - Spent catalyst","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 642.1 Process Heating - 713.2 Oscillators - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 10988833, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 10988804, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: U1402274, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 51562018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U51564033, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U51664035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51464924, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Commission Yunnan Joint Foundation of China (No. U1402274 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51562018 , No. U51564033 , No. U51664035 & No. 51464924 ).

First, the original FT-IR spectra of 230 samples with different species were preprocessed and optimized by second derivative (2D), Savitzky–Golay filter (15:1) and standardized normal variate. Second, the datasets of FT-IR spectra and ICP–AES were integrated, and the low-level data fusion strategy was used to classify different species mushrooms. Third, the latent variables of elements concentration and FT-IR spectra were extracted by partial least square discriminant analysis and two datasets were fused into a new matrix. Finally, the classification models were established by SVM. Compared with single spectroscopic technique, the mid-level data fusion strategy can provide better result. Especially, the accuracy of correct classification of samples in calibration and test sets were 100.00% and 98.68%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the mid-level data fusion of FT-IR and ICP– AES can provide higher synergic effect for the discrimination of different species Boletaceae mushrooms, which could be benefited for the further authentication and quality control of edible mushrooms. © 2018 Sen Yao, JieQing Li, Tao Li, HongGao Liu, and YuanZhong Wang.","46","Quality control","Atomic emission spectroscopy - Data fusion - Discriminant analysis - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Fungi - Inductively coupled plasma - Support vector machines","Boletaceae mushrooms - Classification models - Data fusion strategy - Discrimination - Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy - Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry - Partial least square (PLS) - Spectroscopic technique","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801 Chemistry - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922 Statistical Methods - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: 21667031, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31660591, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 31660591, 21667031], Science Foundation of the Yunnan Province Department of Education: [Grant Number2016ZZX106], and University Key Laboratory of Development and Utilization of Edible Mushroom Resources in Yunnan Province.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Inspired by the success of ensemble methods and the flexibility of tree-based methodology, we propose random projection forests, rpForests, for kNN search. rpForests finds kNNs by aggregating results from an ensemble of random projection trees with each constructed recursively through a series of carefully chosen random projections. rpForests achieves a remarkable accuracy in terms of fast decay in the missing rate of kNNs and that of discrepancy in the kNN distances. rpForests has a very low computational complexity. The ensemble nature of rpForests makes it easily run in parallel on multicore or clustered computers; the running time is expected to be nearly inversely proportional to the number of cores or machines. We give theoretical insights by showing the exponential decay of the probability that neighboring points would be separated by ensemble random projection trees when the ensemble size increases. Our theory can be used to refine the choice of random projections in the growth of trees, and experiments show that the effect is remarkable. © 2018 IEEE.","46","Nearest neighbor search","Big data - Data mining - Forestry - Machine learning - Motion compensation - Text processing - Unsupervised learning","ensemble - Exponential decays - K nearest neighbor (KNN) - K-nearest neighbors - Low computational complexity - Neighboring point - Random projection trees - Random projections","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results indicated that the addition of nano CuO incorporating PVA 17-99 separated the gel point and vitrification point in the curve of tan δ, which is related to the delaying of moisture loss in modified PF resin during the curing process. The modification showed adverse effect on tensile strength but only a minimal influence on MOR and MOE. Additionally, PVA 17-99 reduced the water resistance of cured PF resins. However, with the test conditions of dipping in 100 °C water for 6 h, then drying for 20 h at 63 °C in air, followed by dipping in 100 °C water for 4 h, PVA consolidated the re-curing effect on the PF resin and compensated the strength loss from hydrolysis.

As the major gangue mineral in this deposit, calcite can be divided into four types based on their formation time: pre-mineralization, main metallogenic epoch, late stage of mineralization, and post-mineralization. All types of calcites have distinct features such as field occurrence, physical typomorphic characteristics and trace elements characteristics. The pre-mineralization calcites have the highest REE contents (∑REE=29.70-40.10 μg/g), which are characterized by the most enriched LREE (LREE/ HREE=1.96-3.03), a distinct positive Eu anomalies (δEu=3.83-5.02), and almost no Ce anomalies (δCe=1.02-1.05). The calcites of the main metallogenic epoch have relatively low REE contents (∑REE=10.76-15.53 μg/g), and are characterized by the most enriched HREE (LREE/HREE=0.11-0.23), almost no Eu (δEu=0.73-1.20) and Ce anomalies (δCe=0.88-1.25). The calcites of the late stage of mineralization have the lowest REE contents (∑REE=2.82-4.34 μg/g), and are characterized by enriched HREE (LREE/HREE=0.26-0.86), weakly negative Eu (δEu=0.67-0.83) and Ce anomalies (δCe=0.55-0.81), which are similar to those of the calcites of the main metallogenic epoch. The post-minera¬lization calcites have relatively low REE contents (∑REE=6.92-10.91 μg/g), characterized by enriched LREE (LREE/HREE=1.83-2.34), weakly negative Eu anomalies (δEu=0.72-0.74) and moderately negative Ce anomalies (δCe=0.41-0.50). In addition, the Fe and Mn contents of ore-forming stage calcites are obviously higher than that of the calcites unrelated to mineralization, and negatively correlated with LREE/HREE ratio, which illustrates that the HREE concentrations of calcites are controlled by the incorporation of Fe and Mn.

It attracts extensive attention and researches in computer vision community because of its application and challenge. An effect way to tackle the problem is to learn a useful distance metric from training examples. Then the learned metric could be used for distance calculations between a probe image and images from the gallery. For a real application, the labeled training samples usually increase gradually along the time. To keep the performance of a system for re-identification tasks, the learned model needs to be updated according to the newly added training sets. Although the learned model can be retrained with the whole dataset, the procedure is usually time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an incremental metric learning method based on the widely used XQDA metric for person re-identification. The key idea is that the covariance matrices of similar and dissimilar example pairs can be effectively updated incrementally in the XQDA metric learning algorithm. Then the final metric could be deduced in an incremental way. The proposed approach method is validated on two public available datasets, and the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. © 2018 IEEE.","33","Learning systems","Covariance matrix - Learning algorithms","Automatically match - Covariance matrices - Distance calculation - Incremental learning - Metric learning - Person re identifications - Re identifications - Vision communities","921 Mathematics","","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science of Foundation of China (No. 61501177, No. 61572486, No. 61772455), Guangzhou University's training program for excellent new-recruited doctors (No. YB201712), Guangzhou Key Laboratory (No. 201605030014), Guangdong provincial scientific and technological project (ID: 2017B020210005), the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University under Grant WX069051.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the three-dimensional model of a stagger-arranged battery pack was developed to investigate the effects of cooling channel size and air supply strategy on the thermal behavior of battery pack. The thermal resistance model of single irregular air passage was used to validate the numerical scheme. It was found that the appropriate cooling channel size of 1 mm for 18650 lithium-ion battery was achieved based on the three key parameters, namely, the maximum temperature, the space utilization and the energy efficiency factor. The numerical results illustrate that the best cooling performance can be achieved when airflow inlet and outlet are located on the top of battery pack. The cooling energy efficiency β decreases markedly with the increase of battery numbers along horizontal direction. As the ratio of the length of batteries along horizontal direction to battery diameter equals to 36.10, the lowest value of β is still acceptable.

By the hydrothermal method, we successfully grown the precursor nanosheets (i.e. Co(OH)2NSs) under the regulate and control of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) weak base. Through a simple nitridation process in NH3atmosphere at 400 °C, the as-prepared smooth Co(OH)2NSs were thoroughly transformed into the mesoporous Co2N0.67NSs modified by pyrolytic carbon of HMT. Thanks to a synergistic effect between the metallic character of Co2N0.67phase and good electroconductibility of carbon, the as-prepared hybrid Co2N0.67NSs can boost electron transfer from catalyst surfaces and then form abundant Co4+active sites on electrode surfaces in electrochemical reaction processes. Meanwhile, vast mesoporous structures appeared in Co2N0.67NSs further promoted the dispersion of Co4+active sites and enhanced the mass transfer rate. Benefitting from the above mentioned factors, Co2N0.67NSs therefore exhibit excellent glucose oxidation ability than another two control samples (i.e. Co(OH)2NSs and Co3O4NSs). When used for glucose detection after the electrochemical activation process, the optimal Co2N0.67NSs display excellent detection parameters: a wide linear range of 0.01–8.0 mM, a large sensitivity of 921.18 uA cm−2mM−1glucose, a low detection limit of 0.1 μM, a response time within 3 s, good reproducibility, considerable long-term stability, and excellent anti-interference to electroactive molecules and Cl−. Upon utilized for measuring glucose concentrations in serum samples, the detection results on Co2N0.67NSs are similarly satisfying and accurate.

When Nb2O5 and CaCO3 doping content were 0.5mol%, the TiO2-Nb2O5-CaCO3 varistor ceramics doping with 1.0 mol% Ge exhibited high α (10.6), low EB (8.7 V/mm), and highest ΦB (1.73 eV), superior to previous published findings.

Numerous simulations show that two moderate parameter pairs favor cooperation, in addition, when the contribution of all immediate neighbors’ payoffs to the environment is negative, the cooperation is promoted remarkably. The generality of this mechanism is verified on different networks and more games.

We have compared the PPSO method and genetic algorithm (GA) on reaching the desired peak value of the current I-{m} and the maximum time rate of change of current (di/dt)max. The results show that the parameters of Heidler function evaluated by the PPSO method can achieve more accurate values of I-{m} and (di/dt )maxthan those evaluated by GA. Also, we have compared the PPSO method, the Nelder-Mead particle swarm optimization (NMPSO) method, and PSO method using the measured channel-base current. The results show that the PPSO method is better than the NMPSO and PSO method to determine the channel-base current function parameters. The PPSO method is an efficient method to identify the channel-base function parameters, which can improve the digitalization of lightning monitoring equipment.

We obtained the effective dielectric properties of the random particle-filled binary composite materials under various parameters by the simulation based on Monte Carlo finite element method (MC-FEM), and by the calculation based on the proposed MGEM formula, respectively. Moreover, we also conducted calculations based on some typical theoretical formulas and collected experimental data in some previously published works.

In this study, we prepared soil samples with different contact angles by adding repellent agents (octadecylamine) and found that the more the content of the water repellent agents, the greater the contact angle between the soil particles and the pore water. Contact angle measurement test were designed at the same time, drying-wetting cycles of soil were reflected in the test. Droplet 1 was the initial state of the droplet, droplet 2 was a little drop formed after droplet 1 evaporation immediately, and droplet 3 was a little drop formed 24 hours after droplet 2 evaporation. The test results showed that, the contact angles of sand were greater than the clay with the same water repellent agents content, this was mainly because of the geometrical shapes of the soil particles. In all of the soil samples, the contact angles of soil particles and the pore water decreased continuously during the evaporation process, until the contact angle became 0. At this time, the droplets were completely vaporized. The change of the contact angle on clay surface had a linear relation with time, but it was a nonlinear on sand surface. In the same samples, the evaporation time of droplet 1 was longer than droplet 2 and droplet 3 with the same liquid volume, the time spent in droplet 2 and droplet 3 complete evaporation was relatively close, but droplet 3 took a little more time to evaporation than droplet 2, this meant initial contact angle may affect the evaporation velocity of the soil. The larger the initial contact angle, the longer the evaporation time of the droplet would be. Either sand or clay, the contact angle of droplet 1 was greater than droplet 2 and droplet 3. This was because that the contact angle of droplet 1 was measured on the fully dry sample surface. The contact angle of droplet 2 was measured on the sample surface when soil particles were covered by water films from the droplet 1. The contact angle of droplet 3 was measured on the state in which the free water was evaporated completely. The initial contact angle of the three droplets reflected the contact angle of the soil under different initial conditions of wetting drying cycles. The water films of soil particles which the droplet 1 correspond to were the thinnest and droplet 2 correspond to be the thickest. There were three stages of droplet evaporation on a continuous solid surface: Initial stage, pinning stage and slipping stage. The evaporation mode of soil particles only existed in the initial stage and pinning stage, and there was no slip stage. That was, no matter how lager the initial soil contact angle was, by the end of the droplet evaporation, contact angle would be 0. In the whole evaporation process, the three-phase contact line did not move, and the solid-liquid area remained unchanged. The experiment confirmed that it was reasonable to suppose the contact angle was zero during soil drying, the contact angle hysteresis was one of the reasons why SWCC hysteresis loops became small during wetting-drying cycles. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The original spectra of 96 samples collected from different growing regions were preprocessed by multiplicative signal correction (MSC), standard normal variate (SNV) and second derivative (2D) to decrease the noise interference. The spectral information about the fingerprint characteristics was chosen for low-level data fusion, and the spectral information of variables important in projection greater than 1 was selected by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for mid-level data fusion. Then the single and fused spectral data were analyzed by PLS-DA and support vector machine (SVM). The prediction performance of PLS-DA and SVM was compared. The results showed that based on FTIR, UV, low-level data fusion and mid-level data fusion data matrixes, the prediction accuracies of PLS-DA were 56.25%, 56.25%, 62.50% and 81.25%, respectively, and the prediction accuracies of SVM were 90.63%, 65.63%, 87.50% and 96.88%, respectively, suggesting that mid-level data fusion was better than the other data sources and SVM was better than PLS-DA.

As a consequence, single organizations may be dealing with collections of hundreds or thousands business process models. In order to support this abundance of business process modeling flexibility and improve business process models reusability, separation of concerns is used to separate the crosscutting activities and basic activities in accordance with the different functions of these activities, and an aspect-oriented business process modeling framework is proposed. This framework provides a reusable process modeling method and also provided a flexible and controllable way to assure correctness of the whole business process models. In the framework, an aspect-oriented business process meta-model is defined first. The crosscutting concerns activities are encapsulated as crosscutting aspects, while the basic business activities are modeled in basic processes. Then, according to the correctness requirements of the business process model, based on the weaving characteristics of aspect-oriented approach, weaving correctness is defined. Weaving correctness criteria between multi-aspects and between aspects and basic processes are designed. Errors or mistakes of aspect-oriented business process modeling are prevented during the procedure of modeling. In addition, a detection method for errors or mistakes in process modeling is proposed to ensure error-free business process modeling. Based on the meta-model and the correctness criteria and the detection method, an aspect-oriented business process modeling approach is proposed. The corresponding correctness of the structures, properties and behaviors are proved. Thirdly, an aided tool TPAT (Trustworthy business Process Aided Tool) is developed to provide modeling support. Finally, the theory, the approach and the tool were used in the cases of two banking business processes. Through the case study and performance evaluation, the theory and the approach are proved to be feasible and the tool is proved to be effective. Aspect-oriented modeling is suitable for providing flexible and reusable business process modeling. By adopting the correctness criteria and detecting errors and mistakes during modeling, aspect-oriented business process modeling approach assures the correctness of process models and provides better process-oriented support and adaptability to the ever-change environment. © 2018, Science Press.

The structure and morphology of GO, GA and 3DGP were characterized and analyzed by SEM, Raman and FTIR. The thermal stability and piezoresistive characteristics were tested by means of TGA-DSC and self-made piezoresistive test platform. The results demonstrated that when GO (6 g/L aqueous solution) was reduced by ethylenediamine (EDA), GO layers interconnected to form a regular honeycomb three-dimensional network with a pore size about 0.8 mm. Thus, PU and GA could be well occluded in 3DGP. Besides, the continuity of the three-dimensional network skeleton provided a good channel for the phonon of heat transport carrier, which remarkably enhanced the thermal stability of 3DGP. The decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss of 3DGP was higher 45 than that of PU.

In this study, the photodegradation of A-DOM, extracted from the blooming cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu, is investigated by UV-Vis spectrum and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC). In addition, the effects of the light intensity, light wavelength, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and the initial A-DOM concentration on the photodegradation are studied. Four PARAFAC components are identified, including C1 (UVC humic-like substance), C2 (UVA humic-like substance), C3 (tryptophan-like substance) and C4 (tyrosine-like substance) with the relative abundances of 22.2%, 8.6%, 68.1% and 1.1%, respectively.

The photoreactivities of the three PARAFAC components follows C3>C2>C1. Increase in the light intensity and DO concentration is helpful for the photodegradation of A-DOM. The increase of UV light contributes most photodegradation of A-DOM.

At the same time, the influence of the value of the JRC(joint roughness coefficient), fill strength, interface, and fill thickness on the mechanical behaviour have been analysed. The detailed results are as follows: (1) The normal stress has a significant influence on the peak shear stress, contact condition, and contact force of the joint. With higher stress, the bond break at the joint surface becomes apparent; (2) The joint peak shear stress increases with an increase in the JRC value, and the shear strength parameters for cohesion and friction angle exhibit linear and nonlinear increases with the increase in the JRC value, respectively; (3) The joint peak shear stress increases with the strength of filling material. However, the strength of filling material has a different influence on the cohesion and friction angle of the fill joint. Cohesion increases with an increase in material strength. The friction angle decreases as the fill strength ratio changes from 0.1 to 0.3, and increases when the fill strength ratio exceeds 0.3; (4) When the normal constant load is small, the interface has a significant influence on the peak shear stress, but when the normal constant load is large, the influence is weaker. Joint shear-strength parameters for cohesion increase with the increase in the strength of interface, but the friction angle shows the opposite trend with cohesion; (5) With increasing fill thickness, the mechanical parameters of the joint model exhibit an obvious downward trend. However, with a further increase in thickness, the decrement in the mechanical parameters is less pronounced. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University.

The effect of Sb doping on the microstructure and luminescent properties of Si-QDs films was discussed. The results show that the Sb-doping films exhibit obvious Sb-induced crystallization effect in annealing process. The doping of Sb contributes to the diffusion of Si atoms in the Si3N4matrix and formation of Si-QDs. With the rise of Sb doping amount, the size of Si-QDs gradually is enlarged, and the crystallinity Xcof the films increases effectively. As Sb doping amount rises, the intensity of the PL peaks of the Si-QDs films enhances, and the full width at half maximum of the peaks becomes narrower. Meanwhile, due to the rise of the Si-QDs size, a red-shift is observed in the films with higher Sb doping density. © 2018, Science Press.

The SST configuration orientated in northwest–southeast direction exerts its impact on the summer rainfall coming into the CLLH via modifying the activity of cold air in the northeast CLLH. When SST is warmer than normal in the GS and colder than normal around the NASR, a teleconnection with an anomalous cyclone over the Europe, an anomalous anticyclone around the Lake Baikal and an anomalous cyclone over the East Asia will be forced out by the dispersion of Rossby wave on the spherical surface of the earth. The teleconnection traversing Europe–East China is favourable to transportation of cold air from the East Siberian southwestwards to the CLLH and thus gives rise to the increase of summer rainfall in the CLLH. When SST is colder than normal in the GS and warmer than normal around the NASR, the similar teleconnection with opposite phase is forced out, causing a less than normal summer rainfall in the CLLH. © 2018 The Authors.

A continental-scale, westward-flowing axial river, or paleo-Middle Yangtze, formed following the Mesozoic collision between the North China and South China blocks. The river later flowed to the east as a result of the Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, but its reversal history remains largely unknown. Changes in detrital zircon U-Pb ages of Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata in the Three Gorges region identify a vital provenance shift in the sediments of the paleo-Middle Yangtze. Combined with paleocurrent measurements and petrography, our results indicate that the paleo-Middle Yangtze initially reversed during the late Cretaceous, followed by progressive westward capturing in the Eocene. This conclusion provides a paleogeographic explanation for the limited exposures of Upper Cretaceous to Cenozoic rocks in the Sichuan Basin and refutes the 'drainage divide' hypothesis for the Three Gorges. © 2018 The Authors.","44","Rivers","Binary alloys - Catchments - Geochronology - Lead alloys - Petrography - Silicate minerals - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Cenozoic tectonics - Continental scale - Detrital zircon - Late cretaceous - South China block - Three Gorges Region - Tibetan Plateau - Upper Cretaceous","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys","Number: 40830107, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41030318, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41102104, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41572154, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XDB03020300, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","Feng Pan, Tangjun Gao, Kai Wang, Mingqing Hu, Xiaochun Wei, Lin Chen, Xinya Yao, Yingfeng Xu, and Yuliang Chen helped to collect the paleocurrent data and samples in the field.

Conventional assays are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. This paper proposes a rapid and low-cost strategy for detecting genome-editing induced deletion which works by integrating rapid-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with a dual-lateral flow nucleic acid biosensor (LFNAB) cascade in a single-copy case. A rapid-MLPA was first introduced to the LFNAB system as a replacement for the conventional PCR for enhanced specificity and accuracy. A dual-LFNAB was applied for the detection of genome-editing induced deletion without any additional instrumentation or complex operation. After optimization, we achieved the specific detection of wildtype alleles and deletion alleles in spiked samples with a detection limit of 0.4 fM, which is comparable to that of electrophoresis-based detection assays and fluorescent biosensors. To confirm the validity and feasibility of our strategy, we assayed two pork samples from two WUZHISHAN pigs successfully. By comparing the detection results from next-generation sequencing analysis, we found that the proposed cascade demonstrates at least 20-fold shorter assay time and at least 100-fold less assay cost. To this effect, the proposed method is a rapid and low-cost solution to sample-to-answer detection of genome-editing induced deletion and shows remarkable potential in regards to international trade, transparency, and freedom of choice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","27","Cost benefit analysis","Assays - Biosensors - Costs - Electrophoresis - Gain control - Genes - International trade - Nucleic acids - Polymerase chain reaction - Probes","Complex operations - Lateral Flow - Low-cost solution - Low-cost strategies - Next-generation sequencing - Probe amplification - Specific detection - WUZHISHAN pig","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 801 Chemistry - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics","Number: 31671922, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2018ZX08012001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was financially supported by the National GMO Cultivation Major Project of New Varieties (Grant No. 2018ZX08012001 ) and Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31671922 ).

To develop a process which could simultaneously remove most hemicellulose and lignin in biomass, in this study, oxygen-assisted ethanol organosolv pretreatment (O2-EOP) of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was carried out. The effects of temperature, time, oxygen pressure and ethanol concentration on the pH of the hydrolysate, the solubilization and the chemical composition of SCB were investigated. Compared with autocatalytic EOP and acid-catalyzed EOP, O2-EOP could remove most xylan and lignin from SCB at much milder conditions. At optimized conditions (40/60 ethanol/water (v/v), 1.5 MPa O2, 160 °C and 80 min), 82.9% xylan and 83.3% lignin were removed. Glucan content in the residue reached 86.3%, much higher than results obtained by autocatalytic EOP and acid-catalyzed EOP.

Which considers only the expressions of words that are same in all texts, such as ASCLL, without considering that they could be represented by their synonyms. Separating words with the same or similar meanings will result in the loss of partial information when text feature were extracted. The representation of words needs to extract the similarity of words, and the similarity among words needs to be obtained by the meaning of words in texts. In order to improve the accuracy of text feature extraction, this paper uses the word2vec model to train the word vector in the corpus to obtain its semantic features. After excluding words with low TF-IDF value, the density clustering algorithm is used to cluster the remaining words according to word vector similarity. As a result, similar words are clustered together and can be represented to each other. Experiments show that using the TF-IDF algorithm again, constructing a VSM (vector space model) with these clusters as feature units can effectively improve the accuracy of text feature extraction. © 2018 IEEE.","16","Clustering algorithms","Extraction - Feature extraction - Semantics - Text processing - Vector spaces - Vectors","Clustering - Semantic features - Text feature - TF-IDF - Word vectors","802.3 Chemical Operations - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through numerical tests, it is found that both the SVM and FSVM models are effective in the prediction of the magnitude of RTE with high accuracy, provided that sufficient samples are collected. While the results of FSVM which is extended from SVM by introducing a fuzzy membership to reduce the influence of noises or outliers are found to be slightly less accurate than those of SVM in the current analysis of RTE cases.

A total of 136, 134, and 142 conserved miRNAs and 105, 112, and 119 novel miRNAs were identified in the diploid, triploid, and tetraploid fish, respectively. The genes targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified and were enriched in the GO term cell surface receptor signaling pathway, cellular process, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, and metabolic process. KEGG pathway enrichment was also assessed to evaluate the target genes with differentially expressed miRNAs and these genes were enriched in four pathways (synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, cyanoamino acid metabolic process, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism). Nine differentially expressed miRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qPCR). The upregulated miRNAs in triploids, including miR-101a, miR-199-5p, miR-214, miR-222, and miR-193a, showed the same results with high-throughput sequencing. Among the selected downregulated miRNAs, miR-7b and miR-153b had significantly lower expression levels in triploids. Dnah3 and Tekt1 genes targeted by miR-199-5p showed lower expression in triploids by qPCR. These verified differentially expressed miRNAs may participate in testicular development and sperm activity by targeting functional genes, which were identified with differential expression in the triploid.

Some analytes were used to evaluate the separation performance of the two CSPs packed column. Moreover, the two CSPs also were tested under normal phase (NP), reverse phase (RP) and polar organic phase (POP) chromatography conditions and showed high column efficiency and selectivity especially for α-amino acids. Which seventeen and thirteen racemates were separated by the two CSPs (CSP-1, CSP-2). In contrast, only five and eight chiral compounds were separated in the CSP-3 and CSP-4, respectively. The experimental results showed that the HMOF [Nd3(D-cam)8(H2O)4Cl]n based novel CSPs possessed of good recognition ability for chiral separation in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","35","Column chromatography","Cams - Chirality - Crystalline materials - High performance liquid chromatography - Organic polymers - Organometallics - Polymerization - Separation - Silica - Silica gel","Chiral - Chiral stationary phasis - Enantioseparations - Homochiral metal-organic frameworks - Interfacial polymerization",,"Number: 21675141, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 21675141, 21665030].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
