However, there is less attention on the problem that the instantaneous growth rate (or metabolic rate) and equilibrium growth rate were un-synchronous for anammox bacteria due to their long generation time and self-immobilization of the granular sludge which could lead to the inaccurate estimation. In this study, the anammox process was firstly divided to four typical feast-famine (starvation, satiation, tolerance and poison) states based on the combination of both off-site and in-situ anammox reaction kinetics. Then, four respective lab-scale bioreactors were operated at each state for over a year to achieve stable anammox performance. The results showed that the nitrogen removal rates of bioreactors were 0.53, 2.24, 9.30 and 12.96 kg N/(m3·d); and the specific anammox activities of granular sludge were 188.94 (48%), 313.29 (79%), 397.50 (100%) and 198.60 (50%) mg N/(g VSS·d) which could reflect the reactivity of each feast-famine state. The stable microbial communities of bioreactors were cultured and analyzed, whose species diversity went down with the decrease of Shannon and ACE index. The relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased from 11% to 57% from starvation to poison state. Candidatus Brocadia/Nitrospira, Candidatus Kuenenia and Brocadiaceae_unclassified were revealed to be the distinctive functional bacteria, which could serve as the indicator of each state. The setting up of the typical feast-famine states could be regarded as the landmark to help the design, control and optimization of anammox process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","54","Nitrogen removal","Bacteria - Bioconversion - Bioreactors - Food supply - Granular materials - Reaction kinetics - Wastewater treatment","ANAMMOX - Feast famines - Microbial communities - Process performance - Sludge activity","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 822.3 Food Products - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2017xzzx010-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 2018C03031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province; Number: 2015C03013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51778563, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51578484 and 51778563 ) and Research Funds for Central Universities ( 2017xzzx010-03 ).

From the kinetic behavior results, it was found that the end dissolution degree of original pulps is almost fully controlled by the time-dependent TEMPO and especially NaOCl concentration.

During the unidirectional isothermal compression experiment, when the strain rate is reduced, the deformation duration is prolonged, generating a high dynamic recrystallization nucleation rate. When the strain capacity increases, the internal deformation storage energy and dynamic recrystallization nucleation rate all increase. The distribution of Sn element during deformation process has a great influence on dynamic recrystallization, and the recrystallization is preferentially nucleated at location where the content of Sn element is high.

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, a huge amount of genomic data generates at every second which offer many valuable cancer information and meanwhile throw a big challenge to those investigators. As the major characteristic of cancer is heterogeneity and most of alterations are supposed to be useless passenger mutations that make no contribution to the cancer progress. Hence, how to dig out driver genes that have effect on a selective growth advantage in tumor cells from those tremendously and noisily data is still an urgent task. Results: Considering previous network-based method ignoring some important biological properties of driver genes and the low reliability of gene interactive network, we proposed a random walk method named as Subdyquency that integrates the information of subcellular localization, variation frequency and its interaction with other dysregulated genes to improve the prediction accuracy of driver genes. We applied our model to three different cancers: lung, prostate and breast cancer. The results show our model can not only identify the well-known important driver genes but also prioritize the rare unknown driver genes. Besides, compared with other existing methods, our method can improve the precision, recall and fscore to a higher level for most of cancer types. Conclusions: The final results imply that driver genes are those prone to have higher variation frequency and impact more dysregulated genes in the common significant compartment. © 2019 The Author(s).","41","Gene expression","Diseases - Random processes","Biological properties - Genomic alterations - Genomic expression - High-throughput sequencing - Prediction accuracy - Random Walk - Subcellular localizations - Variation frequency","461.9 Biology - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: 31560317, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472133, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61502166, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61502214, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560221, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate Dr. Shi supported the Diffusion algorithm's source code and related datasets.

This culture is well-known for its important role in studies on early rice domestication. Studying samples from the Tianluoshan Site provides a good opportunity to understand regional paleoenvironmental changes and their impact on Neolithic settlement. In this study, 263 cm samples were obtained from the T005W profile in the Tianluoshan Site Museum. The profile samples were subjected to lithologic stratigraphic description, accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS)14C dating, high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, elemental scanning (2 mm/ sample), diatom (20 cm/sample) and particle size analysis (2 cm/sample). The paleoenvironmental changes reflected by this profile could be divided into three stages based on multi-proxy analysis. (1) In the first stage (263-211 cm, about 7.0-6.5 cal ka BP), or the first and second cultural periods of Hemudu, the cultural layer was stacked and mixed with high contents of sand, gravel, and pottery pieces, thereby showing obvious disturbance from human activities. The diatom assemblage was dominated by aerophilous species, such as Hantzschia amphioxys, which live in shallow swamp. These findings indicated that this period was dominated mainly by a freshwater swamp environment. The geomorphic condition provided Neolithic people with a suitable environment to colonize and develop rice cultivation. (2) In the second stage (211-28 cm, around 4.2-4.0 cal ka BP), the layer had a thickness of approximately 180 cm. However, five AMS 14C dates from this stage were between ca. 4.2 and 4.0 cal ka BP, and the lithology of these overlying strata were inconsistent with the cultural layer underneath. As such, a hiatus existed between the two stages. The lithological feature of this stage mainly consisted of a parallel layer with a couplet of interbedded clay silt and white-gray sand layer, which represented deposition under hydrostatic conditions after flooding. This part also contained multiple yellow oxide layers, possibly indicating transient exposure. The intensity of Ca between 211 and 166 cm was low, but this value increased rapidly above 166 cm and stabilized at a higher level than that of the first period. The dominant diatom assemblage changed from a freshwater group (H. amphioxys) at the bottom of this part to a marine and brackish group (e.g., Cyclotella striata var. striata and Actionptychus undulates). In this period, the rapid deposition of flooding events likely occurred as initiated by heavy precipitation (211-166 cm), which was indicated by low Ca and freshwater aerophilous diatom assemblage. Afterward, multiple storm surges resulted in sedimentation (166-50 cm) with marine-brackish characteristics. (3) In the third stage (28-0 cm, no date), the layer was characterized by a mixture of brown clay, silt, sand, and gravel with low contents of water, iron, and manganese oxide spots. Ca was weak, and clay content was high. This period was mainly dominated by freshwater epiphytic diatom species, such as Pinnularia vividis and Navicula cuspidate, and affected by modern farming. This study revealed the background of the hydrological environment during the first and second cultural periods of the Tianluoshan Site and the flooding events around 4.2-4.0 cal ka BP, which were essential for the understanding of the environmental background of Neolithic people and the extreme regional events in the Tianluoshan Site. The stratigraphic deposits of different sections in the site varied because of the influence of microtopography. Therefore, studies on the paleoenvironment of the Tianluoshan Site should involve a systematic analysis of multiple sections and cores around this site. © 2019, Science Press.

The particle-scale investigation of the heterogeneous reaction rate of the biomass particles along with the essential aspects (including fluid force, collision force, dispersion) of the solid phase is presented. The results indicate that biomass particles behave with larger horizontal and vertical distance especially in the freeboard region than the sand particles. Strong backmixing of the solid material exists near the sidewall, and large fluid force on the particles appears in the lower bed. Similar trends of the particle-scale fluid force, velocity and dispersion can be observed for the biomass and sand particles, though the magnitudes are larger for the biomass. Chemical reactions result in the axial segregation of the biomass particles. Among all the heterogeneous chemical reactions, the char oxidation is fastest while the hydrogenating reaction is the slowest. Increasing the temperature, and steam-to-biomass ratio and equivalence ratio values all enhance the particle-scale behaviors of both the biomass and sand particles. Also, the temperature improves nearly all the reaction rates.

However, spatially and temporally detailed information on land conversion and forest disturbance does not exist in this area. The aim of this study is to map and analyse spatiotemporal changes in forest disturbance from 1991 to 2016 along the China–Laos border using annual Landsat time series images. Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr), based on a temporal segmentation algorithm, was used with the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) as a disturbance index in this study. The results show that the overall accuracy of forest disturbance is 89.72% ± 0.67% and that the estimated forest disturbance area between 1991 and 2016 reaches 4366.14 km2 ± 887.17 km2 (at the 95% confidence interval). This accounts for 16.73% of the total area of forest cover in 1991, which is based on the error-adjusted estimator of area. The trend in the forest disturbance area increased from 1991 to 1995 and then continued downward. The forest disturbance area across the China–Laos border is closely related to global rubber prices as well as the policies and economies of the two countries and cooperation between China and Laos. Compared to Laos, the percentage of disturbed forest area is higher within China, except for some individual years (e.g., 1998–1999, 2004–2005, 2009 and 2016). The average annual disturbed forest area is 98.44 km2 (0.76%) within China and 69.49 km2 (0.53%) within Laos. Large disturbed patches are much more common within China than within Laos. This study highlights the merit of using dense Landsat time series for mapping the human-induced processes of forest disturbance in tropical areas, and the role of economic globalization and regional geopolitics in cross-border forest management. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","73","Forestry","Biodiversity - Image segmentation - Mapping - Time series - Tropics","Atmospherically resistant vegetation indices - Confidence interval - Economic globalization - Forest disturbances - Landsat time series - Overall accuracies - Spatio-temporal changes - Temporal segmentations",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that: The average eco-safety index of the Qilu Basin was 2.59 and the ecological safety was mainly dominated by a lower degree of safety, accounting for 36.33% of the total area of the basin; Then it is followed by the levels of moderate safety and insecurity, accounting for 23.36% and 22.53% of the total basin area, respectively; the safest area was the smallest, accounting for only 17.77% of the total basin area; the lower safety zones were mainly distributed in the northwest, southeast and southwest, and ecological protection construction in these areas should be strengthened; Regarding as the ecological source, the slope, elevation, vegetation coverage, land cover type, distance from water body, distance from construction land, distance from residential area, distance from road were selected as indexes. The ecological source which was the area of the natural forest land, important reservoir and lake buffer within 100m. These factors combined with the MCR model and the cost-distance analysis module of GIS, generated the minimum cumulative distance of consumption surface and it was divided into five levels; based on the characteristics of the frequency of cumulative resistance changes, five ecological functional zones were identified: ecological buffer zone, ecological transition zone, ecological marginal zone, agricultural cultivation zone and human activity zone. The total area of ecological resources in the Qilu Lake basin was 126.87km2, accounting for 35.74% of the total area of the basin. Ecological sources have large differences in area, number, and spatial distribution. The spatial distribution pattern of ecological sources was concentrated around the corners but scattered in the middle. The ecological corridor is continuous and compact, with a scattered and fragmented space in the middle. There was a big difference in the spatial resistance values of ecological nodes, and some ecological nodes have a relatively large accumulated resistance. Those nodes are located in the area which had the largest basin's landscape cumulative resistance value and have a great influence on the flow security of ecological flows. Based on the minimum cumulative resistance surface, combined with the Hydrology module of GIS, a structured watershed landscape ecological security pattern was constructed with an ecological source, 19ecological nodes, and 23ecological corridors.

Most frequently, engineering geology and geotechnics focus on the bearing capacity and settlement in connection with loess, which are the basic factors considered in foundation engineering. However, the natural conditions bring other hazards in the form of various geodynamic processes. Surface runoff, which is the main subject matter of the article, is often neglected in engineering-geological or geotechnical studies. The case study describes measures that have been implemented to control surface runoff as a hazardous process in Bravantice (Czech Republic). Surface runoff on the impermeable bedrock and extensive surface areas on slopes is a frequent hidden hazard of engineering geology and geotechnics, which means that relevant research and investigations must be carried out to take the phenomenon into better consideration.

In experiments, when the zone speed was increased from 5 to 30 mm/min at a zone width of 40 mm, and the zone refining were controlled 5 to 20 passes. The experiment result showed that impurities content was significantly affected by the difference in the number of zone passes. In addition, with the decrease of the moving speed of the melting zone, the content of impurities in the product was also gradually decreased by GDMS analysis. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","27","Zone melting","Aluminum - Glow discharges - Mass spectrometry - Refining","Aluminum material - Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry - High purity aluminum - Impurities contents - Impurities in - Impurity transport - Melting zones - Purification process","533.2 Metal Refining - 541.1 Aluminum - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry","Number: 51734006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Science Foundation of China (No. 51734006), Science and Technological Talent Cultivation Plan of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2017HB009), the Cultivating Plan Program for the Leader in Science and Technology of Yunnan Province under Grant (No. 2014HA003) and the Program for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant (No. 2014RA4018).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The concepts of fixed-Time H∞ control, fixed-Time stability region (or region of attraction), and fixed-Time stability boundary are presented in this paper, and the criterions of globally fixed-Time attractivity of a prespecified locally fixed-Time stability region are obtained. Combining the locally fixed-Time stability of an equilibrium point and the globally fixed-Time attractivity of a prespecified fixed-Time stability region, the globally fixed-Time H∞ control problem of PCH system is effectively solved. Two novel control laws are designed to deal with the globally fixed-Time H∞ control problem, and the conservativeness in estimating the settling time is also briefly discussed.

Due to the deposition of extra-thin Ge film on Si surface, the capabilities of discharge power and rate performance are improved obviously in the lithium insertion and extraction processes. It indicates that the optimal thickness of Si and Ge film in LIBs are 75 and 27 nm, respectively. The Ge/Si electrode exhibits excellent performance that the capacity retention of 78% after 500 cycles at a 4 A/g current density in the voltage range of 0.01–2.0 V, and the average lost of capacity is as low as 0.53 mAh/g per cycle.

The electronic structure is modeled by means of the sp3d5s∗ tight-binding method within the nearest-neighbor approximation. Both bulklike and edge states appear in the energy spectrum. The bulklike states in quantum rings exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in magnetic field, whereas no such oscillations are found in quantum dots, which is ascribed to the different topology of the two systems. When magnetic field varies, all the edge states in square quantum dots appear as quasibands composed of almost fully flat levels, whereas some edge states in quantum rings are found to oscillate with magnetic field. However, the edge states in hexagonal quantum dots are localized like in rings. The absorption spectra of all the structures consist of numerous absorption lines, which substantially overlap even for small line broadening. The absorption lines in the infrared are found to originate from transitions between edge states.

During the processes of landslides enter into accelerative deformation stage from constant deformation stage, the variation rate of kinetic energy increases from zero to a larger positive value.

Based on the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, this paper reduces the loss of the invisible factor item attribute information by merging the similarity of the item on the loss function. At the same time, the cold start strategy is introduced into the model to complete the recommendation. The algorithm is implemented on the Spark distributed platform and single node by using the Movie Lens dataset published by the GroupLens Lab.

XPS measurement revealed that surface modification with ammonia prior to Na2S addition increased the amounts of zinc sulfide species formed on the mineral surface and altered the chemical environment of sulfidization products. Furthermore, the activation mechanism of ammonia modification for enhancing the adsorption of sulfide species onto the smithsonite surface was studied by solution chemistry calculations. Zinc ammonia complexes were found to interact with hydrophilic species coated on the smithsonite surface. This interaction increased the number of zinc sites on the surface of ammonia-modified smithsonite and thus enhanced its sulfidization flotation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","45","Surface treatment","Adsorption - Ammonia - Chemical modification - Flotation - II-VI semiconductors - Minerals - Sodium sulfide - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","Activation mechanisms - Ammonia complexes - Chemical environment - Hydrophilic species - Solution chemistry - Sulfide species - Sulfidization - Surface adsorption","482.2 Minerals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2018T111000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 51804144, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge the Projects funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51804144), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018T111000), and Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (Nos. 2018FD035 and 2016FD121).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Empirically, it not only helps to figure out the level of public health and the ability of community to deal with the health hazards, but also promotes health equity and community health governance. As for the theoretical contribution, it is innovative to apply community resilience at a micro-scale and public health perspective in China. The study constructs theoretical frameworks of community resilience based on social-ecosystem resilience theory in the basic unit of Guangzhou's communities. A community resilience evaluation model with gray correlation TOPSIS method is established, which contains 23 indicators and 32 variables from five dimensions, including natural environment, built environment, social capital, economic capital and political institution. Conclusions are drawn as follows: Firstly, the community resilience of Guangzhou was identified into five ranks (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor and Fail), and the overall structure turns out to be an olive-shaped pattern, while the community resilience for the urban area is superior to the rural communities. Secondly, the spatial features of community resilience show the trend of gradient decline (from center to edges, from middle-east to west and from south to north). It is indicated that subsystems differ significantly in spatial pattern while communities in all ranks are clustered geographically. There are four types of spatial distribution, which are 'double centers type', 'core-periphery type', 'extensive dispersion with localized concentrations type', and 'edge extension type'. Finally, the safe area of public health is distributed in the central and southern parts of the city while the dangerous area is in the west, which should be the focus of the defense area of public health security. © 2019, Science Press.

Compared with ZnO catalysts, the threshold wavelength of Fe3+-doped ZnO nanostructure was shifted to the full visible light region (red shift) and their absorption in the visible region increased with increasing of Fe3+-doping concentration from 0 to 5.0%(atom). The content of iron ion was found to be significant to the photocatalytic efficiency of Fe-ZnO nanostructures. The results demonstrated that the most optimal Fe3+-doping concentration was 1.0% (atom), and its photocatalytic activity was increased by 102% compared with ZnO under visible light. The enhanced photoactivity of the Fe3+-doped ZnO nanostructure was mainly due to the improved visible photon harvesting achieved by Fe3+ doping. © All Right Reserved.","48","Iron compounds","Catalysis - Chlorine compounds - Crystal structure - Doping (additives) - Eutectics - II-VI semiconductors - Light - Metal ions - Nanostructures - Oxalic acid - Photocatalysis - Photocatalytic activity - Photodegradation - Precipitation (chemical) - Red Shift - Zinc oxide - Zinc sulfide","Anti-solvent precipitations - Deep eutectic solvents - Fe-doped - Hexagonal wurtzite structure - Photocatalytic efficiency - Preparation - Ultraviolet-visible spectra - Visible-photocatalytic activities","531.1 Metallurgy - 531.2 Metallography - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the reported methods are less efficient, especially no continuous process was reported to prepare porous polymeric microspheres. Therefore, there is a need to develop a time-saving method with high yield for producing porous polymeric microspheres. This paper reports a continuous process to prepare porous polymeric microspheres via the solvent evaporation method in foam phase, being efficient and of high yield. Preparation of porous poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) [P(MMA-BA)] microspheres was carried out in a customized continuous reaction device. At a certain stirring rate and reaction temperature, the oil phase and the aqueous phase were pumped continuously into the reactor. Foam phase gradually generated and flowed out from the outlet of the reactor. Porous P(MMA-BA) microspheres were obtained after collecting the bubble phase followed by defoaming, washing, filtration and drying. The average foam flow rate, the microspheres' yield, the average particle size and the pore structure were investigated as a function of the experimental conditions including the feed rate of the oil phase, the reaction temperature, the stirring rate and the concentration of PVA. The results showed that the reaction temperature was 45, the stirring rate was 500 r/min, the oil phase solution feed rate was 30 g/min, the PVA concentration was 1.0% (mass), and the oil phase solution P (MMA-BA): DCM:HT is 10:53:6 respectively, the yield of the porous P(MMA-BA) microspheres was up to 92% and the average particle size is 130 µm. The temperature and the residual amount of the aqueous phase left in the customized continuous reaction device are critical for the foam behavior and the yield of the porous P(MMA-BA) microspheres. This work validates that the customized continuous reaction device is capable to produce porous polymeric microspheres continuously, based on the method to prepare porous polymeric microspheres via solvent evaporation method in foam phase, with improved efficiency and yield. In addition, the method reported in this work is able to use continuously on an industrial scale potentially. © All Right Reserved.","33","Microspheres","Acrylic monomers - Esters - Evaporation - Foams - Particle size - Polymers - Pore structure","Average particle size - Experimental conditions - Methyl methacrylates - Polymeric microsphere - Porous microspheres - Preparation - Reaction temperature - Solvent evaporation method","802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to search for appropriate forest management, it is necessary to evaluate litter production, its temporal variation, and nutrient return of these ecosystems. In this study therefore, we investigated litterfall production, standing litter and litter quality for 5 years in a tropical seasonal rainforest (TSR), tropical secondary forest (TSF), tropical anthropogenic forest (TAF), and a rubber monoculture (RM) in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Results showed that the annual mean litterfall was significantly higher in TSF (14.83 Mg ha−1 year−1), followed by TAF (12.69 Mg ha−1 year−1), TSR (11.20 Mg ha−1 year−1) and RM (9.21 Mg ha−1 year−1). Both precipitation and temperature exerted greater impacts on litterfall amount in TSR and TSF than that in TAF and RM. The peak litterfall occurred in the cool and dry season for all four forest sites. Average standing litter for 5 years followed the order of TAF (3.08 Mg ha−1) > RM (2.91 Mg ha−1) > TSR (2.52 Mg ha−1) > TSF (2.04 Mg ha−1). Total returns of C, N, P, and K to mineral soil showed a decreasing trend of TSF > TAF > TSR > RM, which had a variation pattern similar to that for litter production. Nutrient-use efficiency varied with the mineral elements involved, and they differed significantly across the four forest types. Overall, litter production and nutrient returns increased after conversion of tropical primary forest to secondary forest and anthropogenic forest, but both responses decreased after conversion to the rubber monoculture. Therefore, establishing a multilayered community on degraded tropical land or introducing native species into ageing rubber forest offers a promising way to maintain the sustainable use and management of local forest resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","58","Forestry","Land use - Magnesium - Minerals - Nutrients - Rubber - Sustainable development - Tropics","Anthropogenic forest - Forest conversion - Litterfall production - Litterfalls - Nutrient-use efficiencies - Soil fertility - Temporal variation - Tropical secondary forests","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443 Meteorology - 482.2 Minerals - 542.2 Magnesium and Alloys - 818.1 Natural Rubber","Number: 2014HB042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31570622, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017XTBG-F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31570622 ), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2014HB042 ), and the CAS 135 Program (No. 2017XTBG-F01 ).

In this work, we propose a kind of active chiral metamaterial absorber (ACMA) composed by planar anisotropic chiral metamaterials (PACMs) and a metal layer. Our in-depth theoretical analysis indicates that the circular conversion dichroism (CCD) from PACMs plays a crucial role to achieve the active chiroptical effect. The CCD effect can enable a differentiated microcavity-interference effect between the left and right circular incident lights and results in a chiroptical effect related to the equivalent optical length between the PACMs and the metal layer. In simulations, a high-performance ACMA, which are composed by the ‘Z’-shaped PACMs, is designed, and the maximum reflection CDR from ACMA can reach 0.882. Meanwhile, the minimum reflection CDR can reach to 0, resulting a very large adjustable range of from 0 to 0.882. The maximum modulation sensitivity, which is defined as Mn = ∂CDR ∂n and Md = ∂CDR ∂d , can reach to about 1368.252 for d = 100 um and 0.06157 nm−1 for n = 4.5, respectively. In addition to the active chiroptical effect, the designed ACMA also shows excellent performance as a sensor, such as when it is being used as a highly-sensitive temperature sensor. In that case, the minimum detected precision can reach approximately 3.067 * 10−8 °C, if VO2 is used to fill the FP cavity. © 2019 Optical Society of America.","42","Metamaterials","Anisotropy - Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits) - Display devices - Plasmonics - Vanadium dioxide","Adjustable ranges - Chiral metamaterial - Chiral metamaterials - Interference effects - Modulation sensitivity - Perfect absorber - Polarization-sensitive devices - Research interests","703.1 Electric Networks - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science","Number: 11604227, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 20181504, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of Sichuan University; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (11604227); International Visiting Program for Excellent Young Scholars of SCU (20181504).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As a result, the ZnO films were annealed at 150 °C for 30min under O2 atmosphere and following sulfurized at 260 °C for 50min, which could obtain the best performance of Zn(O,S)film. The morphologies of Zn(O,S)films were more compact and uniform due to the reduction of oxygen loss. Meanwhile, the optimal sulfurization temperature could decrease the amounts of traps, which resulted in reducing the recombination and improving the transport of charge carriers.

In this work, a novel ensemble learning framework called by Tri-ensemble was proposed to integrate different classifiers, which selected three weak classifiers and trained these classifiers by continually adding the samples that are predicted to have abnormally high or abnormally low properties by the other two classifiers.

In terms of the electronic property, regardless of the compressive strain or tensile strain applied in any direction, the band-gap of the monolayer GeP exhibits a decreasing tendency, and it remains semiconductivity in the range of −10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain. As for the optical property, it is anisotropic. When GeP is subjected to a strain, regardless of the directions, the optical property of monolayer GeP is significantly affected more by tensile strain than by compressive strain. When the monolayer GeP is subjected to a tensile strain, its optical absorption and reflectivity in the visible light region to some extent increase, while its transmittance reduces. When it is subjected to a compressive strain, the main change in optical properties such as absorption and reflectivity occurs in the deep ultraviolet region. In particular, the monolayer GeP is most susceptible to deformation by the strain in a direction, and only compressive strain in a direction will cause GeP to undergo a transition from an indirect band-gap semiconductor to a direct band-gap semiconductor, which results in the improvements of absorption efficiency and reflectivity efficiency in the low energy region. Our calculated results indicate that the electronic and optical properties of monolayer GeP can be efficiently and regularly regulated by strain. In the future, it can be a suitable 2D materials used in optically polarized devices, blue light-emitting diode devices, and strain-tunable photoelectric nanodevices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","34","Tensile strain","Anisotropy - Calculations - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Germanium compounds - Light - Light absorption - Monolayers - Optical properties - Reflection - Semiconducting germanium compounds","Absorption efficiency - Blue light emitting diodes - Deep-ultraviolet regions - Direct band gap semiconductors - Electronic and optical properties - Electronic and structural properties - First-principles calculation - Two Dimensional (2 D)","712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921 Mathematics - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 61751405, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502272, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1502272 and 61751405), Precious Metal Materials Genetic Engineering Major Project of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2018ZE006, 2018ZE023 and 2018IC058), Program of high-end scientific and technological talents in Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2013HA019), Program for Yunling Scholars in Yunnan Province, Program for Donglu Scholars in Yunnan University, New Academic Researcher Award for Doctoral Candidates of Yunnan Province.

Study on influences of physicochemical properties of coals on their pore morphology and CH4 adsorption performance is important for effectively recovering CH4. In this review, the influences of physicochemical properties of coals on their pore structure and CH4 adsorption, and the future research trend were addressed. The results showed the positive linear correlation between coal micropore parameters and their CH4 adsorption capacity. The meso- and macropores of coal mainly influenced the adsorption/diffusion rate of CH4 within coals. The coals rich in ink-shaped pores or vitrinite always exhibited superior CH4 adsorption performance. In general, the minerals and moisture decreased coal adsorption ability. The extraction of small organic compounds from coal matrix was helpful to increase pore surface area and volume of coals and further enhance their adsorption performance. To gain further insight into coal physicochemical properties dependences of pore morphology and CH4 adsorption, the coupling relationship between coal pore structure parameters and fluid adsorption/desorption, and the elaboration of coal complex pore morphology based on multi-fractal theory were needed to study. Furthermore, to accurately estimate pore structure parameters of coal, the BET model and BJH model fully considering coal heterogeneity were needed. Study on occurrence space regarding oxygen-containing functional groups on coal matrix in coal pore space to address the cooperative effect of functional groups and pore morphology on CH4 adsorption was also required.

Previous study has shown that shale gas in gas shale reservoirs mainly exists in adsorbed state. The adsorption performance of gas shales depends on both physicochemical properties of shales and external reservoir conditions. Among them, the moisture contained in shales significantly affects the adsorption/desorption of shale gas. Therefore, based on literature review, this work analyzed the occurrence and distribution of moisture in gas shales, summarized the analysis method of moisture in shale reservoirs, and pointed out the research trend regarding moisture occurrence and distribution. The results showed that the moisture in gas shales mainly existed in pore structures, and the moisture contained in inorganic pores was higher than that of organic pores; the water molecules were mainly adsorbed to the hydrophilic sites of the organic pores through hydrogen bonds, and the hydrogen bonds and surface forces combined with clay particles or pore surface; the moisture content was related to both clay mineral content and TOC content of gas shales; hitherto, the experimental methods for determining the occurrence and distribution of water molecules in shales comprised water vapor isothermal adsorption, low temperature difference scanning calorimetry, low field nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared thermal imaging, and low-temperature plasma ashing. Although study on moisture in gas shales had gained broad attention, it was still insufficiently compared with that on moisture in coals. Thus, the following aspects need to be further concentrated on. To start with, it was necessary to determine content distribution and spatial distribution characteristics of moisture in inorganic minerals and organic matter, furthermore, to examine water dependence of CH4 adsorption/desorption within shales, and finally, to address the mechanism of water dependence of CH4 adsorption/desorption in shales using experiment and simulation approach. © 2019, Chemical Industry Press.

A thermal desorption acetone-assisted photoionization miniature ion trap mass spectrometer was developed for on-site and rapid identification of illegal drugs at checkpoints. Acetone was chosen for dopant-assisted photoionization, and the sensitivity of selected drugs was further enhanced with protonated analyte molecular ions [M + H]+. For example, the sensitivity of ephedrine was improved by as high as 22-fold. The mass discrimination effect, which was usually considered as a shortcoming of ion trap mass analyzer, was ingeniously utilized to eliminate the protonated acetone reagent ions and maximize the trapping efficiency of analyte ions in mass analyzer. Twenty-seven drugs were analyzed, and the limits of detection (LODs) of selected illegal drugs were at the nanogram level with analysis time of 2 s. Analyte/dopant ion peak intensity ratios in mass spectra could be used for quantitation to improve the quantitative analysis performance of miniature ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface (DAPI) with the prerequisite that dopant ions and analyte ions could be simultaneously and effectively trapped by the ion trap. The RSD of signal intensity was reduced from 25.3% to 8.5%, and the linear range was extended from 0.5-25 to 0.5-100 ng/μL for methamphetamine.

It shows that there are two localized surface plasmon absorption peaks, which are induced from the outside LSPRs and the inside LSPRs, respectively. The positions of these two peaks can shift by changing core radius and shell thickness. By varying the core radius and thickness of the shells, the LSPRs are modulated with the IBTs, leading to the strong interactions between the LSPRs and the IBTs. It is found that the LSPRs and IBTs can couple with each other and the new resonance absorption peaks can be observed. Our results show that the LSPRs are enhanced by the IBTs.

Appropriate tillage practices are beneficial to soil conservation and avail against soil erosion. Currently, how tillage contributes to soil erosion of EG at the catchment scale is still unclear. To quantify EG erosion and analyze the effects of tillage practice on EG erosion in a typical farmed dry-hot valley catchment, EGs under five tillage practices including conventional tillage (CT), contour ridge tillage in sugarcane land (CRT-40S), vegetable land (CRT-40 V) and in orange land (CRT-25), and without tillage in abandoned land (CK) were investigated. Five field surveys were conducted during two growing seasons from April 2013 to February 2015. The results showed that EG erosion was most serious after crops being harvested, followed by that before crops being planted, after crops being planted subsequently. The average EG erosion modulus of two growing seasons was 231.85 t km−2 a−1. Considering the effect of tillage practices, EG erosion modulus was the largest under CK, followed by CT, CRT-25, CRT-40 V and CRT-40S subsequently, indicating that contour ridge tillage practice would benefit for controlling EG erosion. We found that farmlands with conventional tillage practice had to be abandoned when EGs were developed intensively. But EG erosion did not terminate after being abandoned. The redundancy analysis further confirmed that tillage practice was the dominant control on EG erosion in the dry-hot valley. Our results suggested that appropriate tillage practice such as contour ridge tillage can efficiently restrain EG erosion in the dry-hot valley. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","74","Erosion","Catchments - Crops - Landforms - Redundancy - Runoff - Soil conservation - Soils","Contour ridge - Conventional tillage - Ephemeral gullies - Redundancy analysis - Soil erosion","442.1 Flood Control - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 41401614, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41101267, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41561063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank Dr. Kathryn B.

Sulfidation is an important process to recover zinc from oxidized zinc ores in flotation. Although some studies have reported on the sulfidation-flotation of smithsonite, the effect of sulfide ions on sulfide film thickness remains unknown when the oxidized zinc ores start floating and achieve excellent flotation. In this work, the influence of sulfur ions on smithsonite flotation in a dodecylamine system were investigated by micro-flotation experiments, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Micro-flotation experiment results show that smithsonite starts floating after treatment with a low S concentration of 5 × 10−5 mol/L, while excellent flotation was obtained following treatment with a high S concentration of 5 × 10−4 mol/L. Compared to the low S solution, excellent hydrophobicity of smithsonite was obtained owing to the adsorption of more sulfide ions, making the mineral surface potential more negative, and forming a thicker heterogeneous zinc-sulfide film that primary consists of zinc monosulfide and zinc polysulfide. The zinc-sulfide film thickness on the smithsonite surface was approximately 7.79 nm when the smithsonite started floating, while excellent floatation was obtained as the zinc-sulfide film thickness reached about 12.13 nm. © 2019","33","Zinc sulfide","Atomic emission spectroscopy - Film thickness - Flotation - II-VI semiconductors - Inductively coupled plasma - Ions - Ores - Organic polymers - Oxidation - Secondary ion mass spectrometry - Sulfur compounds - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy - Zinc ore treatment","Dodecylamine systems - Flotation performance - Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry - Smithsonite - Sulfidation - Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry - ToF SIMS - Zeta potential measurements","533.1 Ore Treatment - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: 51764021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51764022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 51764021 & 51764022).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Aiming at the effects of random noise and impulse noise on acoustic signal from pipeline blockage, a noise reduction method based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), wavelet transform (WT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed. First, the continuous mean square error criterion is introduced to judge the dominant high-frequency intrinsic mode component obtained by CEEMD. Then wavelet soft threshold is used to denoise and reconstruct the signal, which avoids the loss of high frequency useful signals. Secondly, to achieve the further purpose of suppressing noise, the phase space reconstruction and SVD of the signal are carried out, and the reconstruction order of the signal is determined by using the larger peak position of the singular value energy difference spectrum. Through the analysis of the noise reduction effect of simulation signal and pipeline blockage signal, the results show that this method not only can improve the problem of the modal mixture well, but also can effectively extract the useful features of the signal. Meanwhile, the noise reduction performance is better than the noise reduction method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition. © 2019 Computer Society of the Republic of China.

In addition to hydrological regime, revegetation has also occurred in this water-level fluctuation zone. However, how the hydrological regime and revegetation regulate soil prokaryotic community remains unclear. Here, we investigated soil prokaryotic community structure, diversity and environmental parameters in different flooding zones from two soil layers (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) at 6 locations along the water-level fluctuation zone from upstream to downstream. The soil prokaryotic diversity tended to decrease from upstream to downstream, and the alpha diversity was higher in the topsoil than in the deep soil at all sites. Flooding significantly enhanced the prokaryotic diversity compared to the control (i.e., permanent dry zone). The soil prokaryotic composition underwent deterministic processes in the upstream sites and stochastic processes in the downstream sites, with stronger stochastic processes in the topsoil than in the deep soil across all sites and elevations. As expected, the soil pH, moisture, NH4+-N, organic carbon and nitrogen were proven to be determinants of the prokaryotic community composition. Changes in plant traits (plant biomass, richness, and carbon content) after revegetation induced by submergence also played an important role in structuring the prokaryotic community. The prokaryotic community exhibited a shorter average path distance (GD) in the flooding zones compared to the control, with the shortest average degree (avgK) and the lowest levels of stability in the longer periodic inundation zones. Overall, our results suggest that soil properties and plant functional traits are critical controls of the prokaryotic community's ability to develop at regional scales and water submergence can likewise be an important factor for variations in the prokaryotic community composition in riparian zones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","57","Reservoirs (water)","Biodiversity - Floods - Organic carbon - Random processes - Revegetation - Rivers - Soil conservation - Stochastic systems - Structure (composition) - Underwater soils - Water levels - Wetlands","Community composition - Community structures - Deterministic process - Environmental parameter - Microbial composition - Three gorges reservoir - Vegetation type - Water-level-fluctuation zones","441.2 Reservoirs - 442.2 Land Reclamation - 454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 951 Materials Science - 961 Systems Science","Number: 31470557, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31770563, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XDB15010200, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program B of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15010200) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470557, 31770563).

The formation of pure M phase for samples sintered at 900 °C with sufficient BBSZ was confirmed from XRD patterns analysis. Large saturation magnetization (69.02 emu/g) and relatively low magnetic anisotropy field (7.4 kOe) were obtained simultaneously when sample was synthesized with 2.5 wt% BBSZ dosage.

Comparison of GVD effects on the two kinds of typical QCL cavities, i.e., FP and ring cavities, brings insight into the interaction between the GVD and the spatial hole burning (SHB) effect which is only supported by FP cavities but not ring cavities. The theoretical model is built based on the Maxwell-Bloch formulism accounting for two-way propagations of electric field and polarization as well as the couplings among the electric field, the polarization, and the population inversion. The pulse evolution in time-spatial domains is simulated by the finite difference method with prior nondimensionalization, which is necessary for a convergent solution. Results predict that the SHB could broaden the QCL gain bandwidth and induce additional side modes closely around the central lasing mode with an intensity more pronounced than that of GVD associated side modes. Moreover, owing to the SHB, the lasing instability caused by GVD is weaker in a FP cavity than a ring cavity. © 2019 SPIE.","20","Group velocity dispersion","Dispersions - Electric fields - Fabry-Perot interferometers - Finite difference method - Infrared devices - Light velocity - Optoelectronic devices - Polarization - Quantum cascade lasers","Dispersive media - Laser dynamics - Mid-infrared quantum cascade - Nondimensionalization - Population inversions - Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) - Spatial hole burning - Theoretical investigations","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 744.1 Lasers, General - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 941.3 Optical Instruments - 951 Materials Science","Number: ECCS-1232273, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; ","Jing Bai's research is partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant No. ECCS-1232273.

The values of the first coordination numbers (Zi and Zj) were set as 10, and the molar volume of the component i in the liquid state (Vmi) was replaced by its molar volume in the solid state (Vi). The activities of the components of Pb-based alloys (Pb–Sn, Pb–Sb, Pb–Ag, Pb–Cu, Pb–Bi, and Pb–Cd) were predicted by using the simplified MIVM (SMIVM). The prediction deviations of SMIVM were overall smaller than those of MIVM, indicating that the simplification of the MIVM is reasonable and the SMIVM is reliable for predicting the activities of the components of Pb-based alloys. The biggest advantage of the SMIVM lies in its simplicity in calculation and higher prediction accuracy than MIVM. Vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) phase diagrams for the Pb–Sn, Pb–Sb, Pb–Cu, Pb–Ag, and Pb–Bi alloy systems in vacuum distillation were calculated based on the SMIVM and VLE theory.

CSGC is an effective novel inhibitor, and shows higher inhibition efficiency than either CS or AA. The adsorption of CSGC on aluminium surface obeys Langmuir isotherm. CSGC is a mixed-type inhibitor, while mainly retards the anodic corrosion. EIS consists of a large capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a small inductive one at middle frequencies and the second capacitive loop at low frequency values, and the impedance strengthens with the concentration of CSGC. SEM and AFM confirms the corrosion of aluminium surface is prominently retarded after adding CSGC to the media.

The hydrophobic soils with different DMDCS volume by soil mass, water content and clay content were obtained respectively. Mixtures of sandy soils (DMDCS volume by soil mass were 2 mL:100 g and 3 mL:100 g, i.e., 2% and 3%, the same below) with 3%, 5%, 7%, 11% and 13% water content were prepared respectively. Meanwhile, the mixtures of clay and sandy soils (3% DMDCS) according to the clay mass fraction of 0, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40% and 50% were prepared respectively. Then the unsaturated direct shear tests were carried out by unsaturated direct shear apparatus. Four samples in each group were prepared under the normal pressure in 100, 200, 300 and 400 kPa, respectively. The horizontal shearing ratio was 0.8 mm/min and the shearing test lasted 6 min. The results showed that: 1) The mixtures of sandy soils and DMDCS presented extreme hydrophobicity. 2) The water repelling of mixtures of clay and sandy soils was affected by both DMDCS and clay content. The water repelling of mixtures was degraded with the increasing of clay content, and improved with the increasing of DMDCS volume by soil mass. 3) The Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion could be adopted to describe the shear strength of hydrophobic sandy soils with different DMDCS and water content. With the increasing of DMDCS volume by soil mass, the shear strength index of the hydrophobic soil was decreased to different extents. The cohesive force showed a steep-drop shape from soil without DMDCS addition to that with 1% DMDCS and a slow decline up to stabilize finally. The effect of DMDCS on the cohesive force of modified sandy soils was much greater than on the internal friction angle. The hydrophobic soils' cohesion with the increasing of water content was decreased gradually, while the internal friction angle was increased firstly and decreased finally. The water content had a much effect on the shear strength of the hydrophobic sandy soils. The shear strength index were decreased with the increasing of DMDCS volume by soil mass: the cohesion was declined rapidly from 19.6 kPa (no DMDCS) to 10.4 kPa (1% DMDCS) and slowly from 10.4 kPa (1% DMDCS) to 9.3 kPa (3% DMDCS). The internal friction angle was declined slowly from 16.2° (no DMDCS) to 11.8° (3% DMDCS). The cohesion was decreased with the increasing of water content: the cohesion was declined from 15.5 kPa (3% water content) to 7.5 kPa (13% water content) with 2% DMDCS and from 15 kPa (3% water content) to 5.2 kPa (13% water content) with 3% DMDCS respectively; the internal friction angle was increased from 12.7° (3% water content) to 15.2° (11% water content) with 2% DMDCS and from 11.7° (3% water content) to 14.6° (7% water content) with 3% DMDCS, then decreased to 13.9° (13% water content) with 2% DMDCS and 11.9° (13% water content) with 3% DMDCS respectively. 4) The Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion could also be adopted to describe the shear strength of hydrophobic mixed soils with different clay content. The cohesion was increased remarkably with the increasing of clay content. The cohesion of sandy soils without clay was 9.3 kPa, then suddenly increased to 27.2 kPa and 55.1 kPa mixed with 5% and 50% clay mass fraction, respectively. The internal friction angle was increased from 12.1° (5% clay mass fraction) to 16.2° (15% clay mass fraction), and then decreased to 9.7° (50% clay mass fraction).

The spent hybrid catalysts could be effectively recovered from the resulting reaction mixture and reused 5 times with little deactivation after plain regeneration treatment. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","42","Furfural","Aldehydes - Catalysts - Energy efficiency - Hydrogenation - Precious metals","Acid-catalyzed conversions - Catalytic process - Catalytic transfer hydrogenation - Direct production - High yield synthesis - Process economics - Process Variables - Regeneration treatment",,"Number: 21566019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21566019).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Many methods have been reported to detect Klebsiella pneumonia; however, a simple, rapid, and visual method remains to be developed. Here, we developed a rapid, visual detection method employing a nanoparticle immunosensor (NPIS) with a sensitivity of 8 CFU mL−1. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing different antigenic determinants on the surface of Klebsiella pneumonia were screened by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and mass spectrometry assay. The mAb 1E6 was conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate the immuno-magnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs), whereas the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mAb probe was synthesized by conjugating the mAb 2F1 with HRP. Thereafter, the NPIS was developed based on the IMNPs and the HRP-mAb probe, and the total assay time for the detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae was ∼60 min. A rapid, sensitive method was developed for screening Klebsiella pneumoniae in clinical samples. The NPIS developed in this study can detect Klebsiella pneumoniae without the enrichment of bacteria and the extraction of the genome; therefore, it can be used as a primary screening method to compliment other methods in the detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

However, limited studies have been conducted to systematically examine the mineral influence on the decomposition of plant residuals at a molecular level. In this study, pine needles and chestnut leaves were mixed with kaolinite at the weight ratio of 5:1. The controls were plant tissues without kaolinite. All the samples were incubated in the laboratory for one year. Molecular markers, including lignin-derived phenols (e.g. Vanilly units, syringyl units and cinnamyl units) and solvent-extractable lipids (e.g. n-alkanoic acid, n-alkanols and n-alkanes), were analyzed. The concentrations of lignin-derived phenols and lipid compounds were higher in the presence of kaolinite than without kaolinite. Lower degradation indexes, such as (Ad/Al)V (ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin) and CPI (carbon preference index of n-alkanoic acid and n-alkanes), were found in the kaolinite system. These results indicate that kaolinite reduced the OM decomposition. The addition of kaolinite also stabilized some carbohydrates from plants. Furthermore, the degradation of OM led to the generation of persistent free radicals, indicated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. The EPR signals were higher with than without kaolinite. We hypothesize that the adsorption of semiquinone or quinone radicals on kaolinite may limit their reaction with other OM moieties and thus extended their lifetimes. In addition to embedding OM in soil aggregates, our results provide direct evidence of another mineral protective mechanism of soil OM. © 2018","43","Kaolinite","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Carboxylic acids - Electron spin resonance spectroscopy - Free radicals - Lignin - Lipids - Paraffins - Paramagnetic resonance - Phenols - Plants (botany) - Solvents","Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR) - Lignin-derived phenol - Molecular levels - Molecular marker - Organic matter decomposition - Organo-mineral complexes - Syringyl units - Vanillic acids","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 482.2 Minerals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives","Number: 2017YFD0801000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: YNG2017002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41725016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41663013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1602231, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFD0801000 ), and National Natural Scientific Foundation of China ( U1602231 , 41725016 and 41663013 ).

A bentonite-humic acid (B-HA) mixture was applied at a single rate of 30 Mg ha−1 to a sandy degraded soil of China for improving soil physical properties and hydric regime, and productivity of maize (Zea mays L.). Measurements of soil aggregate distribution, soil bulk density (BD), soil water storage (SWS), and yield of maize and associated water use efficiency (WUE) helped to evaluate the effect of the B-HA 1 to 7 years after B-HA application. The addition of B-HA increased soil health by improving soil structure thereby facilitating the rapid formation of macro-aggregates, decreasing soil BD and increasing SWS in the top 100 cm. B-HA addition also increased maize growth and grain yield and WUE by 50%, 5 years after B-HA application. Linear regression and Principal Component analysis indicated that three macro-aggregate fractions and SWS were highly correlated with maize biomass and grain yield. Improvement of soil structure and hydric regime significantly increased maize grain and biomass yield and WUE.

Taking medical big data as an example, this paper analyzed the risk of security and privacy leakage in the collection, transmission, storage, use and sharing of medical big data, and established a medical big data security and privacy leakage risk indicator system with 4 primary indicators and 35 secondary indicators. In addition, the weight of each indicator was calculated by GI method and entropy weight method.

The results show that the risk of medical big data security and privacy leakage in the Grade II Level A hospitals is higher than that in the Grade III Level A hospitals, and in the life cycle of medical big data, the two stages of data storage, data use and sharing may cause more prominent problems of data security and privacy disclosure, while the data collection and data transmission are slightly less.

DJOA is consisted of three operations, e.g., a) Offensive operations: DJOA adopts the same mechanism of joint operations algorithm (JOA) to achieve a global exploration; b) Deep defensive operations: DJOA introduces two deputy officers (currently sub-optimal solutions) to achieve a deeper local exploitation through a cooperation between the officer and two deputy officers; c) Shuffled regroup operations: DJOA employs the mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to effectively prevent the algorithm from trapping at a local optimum. Three cases are carried out, including step change of wind speed, low-turbulence stochastic wind variation, high-turbulence stochastic wind variation and robustness test. Simulation results demonstrate that DJOA can extract the maximum wind power and require just minimal control costs compared to that of quantum genetic algorithm (QGA), biogeography-based learning particle swarm optimization (BLPSO) and JOA, as well as the greatest robustness in the presence of generator parameter uncertainties. © 2019, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

The neurobehaviors of C. elegans, including their body bends, relative move length, defecation, touch response and chemical index, were investigated after 24h-exposed in biochars, the washed biochars and biochar supernatants. The contents of metallic and non-metallic elements, biochar physicochemical properties and the environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) were characterized. The results showed a hormesis behavior of C. elegans when exposed in biochar particles with high EPFRs intensity. No significant effect to C. elegans was observed when exposed in supernatants.

Here, we fabricated La-doped nano-Pt-based catalytic membrane electrode using ion beam sputtering method. The effect of La on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the catalytic membrane electrode was investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. Compared with pure Pt-based sample, the electrochemical activity specific area of the La-doped sample increases by 74.59%, with 63.95% increase in exchange current density. The results also show that La2O3 enhances oxygen enrichment of the membrane electrode and reduces interfacial energy among Pt grains while pinning the grain boundaries.

The proposed feature screening procedure has three key merits. First, it is computationally efficient, and can be used to screen significant covariates in the presence of missing responses. Second, it does not require estimating respondent probability and is robust to the misspecification of respondent probability models. Third, the univariate kernel smoothing method is adopted to estimate nonparametric functions, and is employed to impute estimating equations with missing responses at random, which avoids the well-known “curse of dimensionality”. The ranking consistency property and the sure screening property are shown under some regularity conditions. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed screening procedure.

In this study, we focus on four typical urban underlying surfaces, asphalt, cement, pervious brick, and lawn. Based on the theory of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, we establish a solar radiation model and a rainfall convection model to analyze the heat transfer process of thermal radiation, thermal conduction, and thermal convection of urban underlying surface under different meteorological conditions. The fitting effects of both models are good: For solar radiation model, 0.89 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99, 1.93 °C ≤ RMSE≤2.45 °C, 1.87 °C ≤ MAE ≤ 2.17 °C. For rainfall convection model, 0.95 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.96, 0.17 °C ≤ RMSE≤0.21 °C, 0.15 °C ≤ MAE ≤ 0.2 °C. Results show that: 1) In the absence of rainfall, the land-surface temperature of asphalt, cement, and pervious brick underlying surface is higher than air temperature, which has a positive effect on urban near-surface air temperature. In addition, the lawn underlying surface with the lowest temperature and the lowest temperature difference has a negative impact on the urban surface temperature. 2) In the rainfall, the underlying surface transfers heat to the runoff in the form of convection, forcing the runoff temperature to rise. Asphalt has the most obvious heating effect on runoff and lawn has the least effect on runoff temperature. The study proposes that the land-surface temperature can be lowered by paving lawn in hot places, and the pervious underlying surface should be adopted in the areas adjacent to the water bodies to reduce the influence of the underlying surface on runoff temperature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","43","Land surface temperature","Asphalt - Atmospheric temperature - Brick - Cements - Fluid mechanics - Heat convection - Heat radiation - Radiation effects - Rain - Runoff - Solar radiation - Surface measurement - Surface properties - Thermoanalysis","Meteorological condition - Near surface air temperature - Runoff temperature - Temperature differences - Thermal environment - Thermo dynamic analysis - Urban surface temperature - Urban underlying surfaces","411.1 Asphalt - 412.1 Cement - 414.2 Brick Materials - 442.1 Flood Control - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 931.1 Mechanics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41761084 , 41761037 ), the China High Technology Research and Development 863 Program ( 2012AA121402 ), and the Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China ( 2016FD020 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Neurotrophins are promising therapeutic agents for neural regeneration in the damaged CNS. However, their penetration across the blood–brain barrier remains a formidable challenge, representing a bottleneck for brain and spinal cord therapy. Herein, a nanocapsule-based delivery system is reported that enables intravenously injected nerve growth factor (NGF) to enter the CNS in healthy mice and nonhuman primates. Under pathological conditions, the delivery of NGF enables neural regeneration, tissue remodeling, and functional recovery in mice with spinal cord injury. This technology can be utilized to deliver other neurotrophins and growth factors to the CNS, opening a new avenue for tissue engineering and the treatment of CNS disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
