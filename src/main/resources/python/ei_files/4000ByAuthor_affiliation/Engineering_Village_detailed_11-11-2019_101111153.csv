The GGA + U method was used to correct the self-interaction error (SIE) that was encountered in first principles calculations. With the increasing of Ag, energy band gaps (Ei or Ed) of LAMO ceramics and the JT effect decreased, while the DE effect was enhanced. LAMO polycrystalline ceramics (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) were prepared by conventional sol−gel method in order to verify the calculation results. The X−ray diffraction revealed that the structure of LAMO ceramics transformed from single phase to multiphase as x was increased. The ρ−T curves suggested that the metal to insulator transition temperature (Tp) and DE effect were improved as x increased, which was in good agreement with the first principles calculations. In addition, the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) at the peak temperature (Tk) and magnetoresistance (MR) at the peak temperature (Tm) were obtained with different x. For x = 0.5, the value of TCR and MR reached 8.58% K−1 and 21.6%, and the Tp, Tk and Tm were 304, 291 and 298 K, respectively, implying that the electrical and magnetic devices of LAMO ceramics could operate at room temperature (300 K). XPS results indicated that the concentration of Mn4+ ion increased with increasing x. The ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ reached 1 2, which had the strongest DE and magnetoelectric coupling effect for x = 0.5. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","37","Calculations","Ceramic materials - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Lanthanum compounds - Magnetic properties - Magnetoresistance - Manganese compounds - Metal insulator transition - Silver compounds - Sols - Temperature","Electrical and magnetic property - Experimental methods - First-principles calculation - Magnetoelectric couplings - Metal-to-insulator transitions - Polycrystalline ceramics - Self-interaction error - Temperature coefficient of resistance","641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.1 Ceramics - 921 Mathematics","Number: 20180179, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11674135, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11674135 ), the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant no. 2018M20172130001 ), and the I nnovation Training Program for College Students , (Grant no. 20180179 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The degradation of exudate ligands can be fundamental to controlling the complexation of heavy metals. However, this process remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between the transformation of glycine, a representative amino acid exudate, and cadmium/lead mobility in soils. Two 48-h incubation experiments were conducted after glycine addition to the soils. Parameters related to glycine distribution and degradation, Cd/Pb mobility, and the formation of glycine-Cd complex were analyzed. Glycine addition gradually decreased the Cd and Pb mobility throughout the 48-h incubation. By the end of the experiment, the CaCl2-extracted Cd and Pb concentrations decreased by 63.5% and 43.6%, respectively. The glycine mineralization was strong in the first 6 h, as indicated by a sharp decrease in CO2 efflux rates from 10.04 ± 0.62 to 3.51 ± 0.07 mg C–CO2 kg−1 soil h−1. The mineralization rates notably decreased after 6 h. The comparisons of dissolved organic carbon and hydrolyzable amino acid contents indicated that glycine mineralization in solution (95.6%) was much stronger than that in soil solids (49.3%). At the end of incubation, 0.22 mmol kg−1 glycine remained in soil solids. The remaining glycine provided sufficient sorption sites for Cd2+ and Pb2+, resulting in enhanced metal fixation via complexation. Comparisons of zeta potentials supported the formation of the glycine-Cd complex. The Cd and Pb immobilization processes could be attributed to metal-glycine complex formation, sorption re-equilibrium, and glycine degradation. These findings emphasize that the biogeochemical processes of glycine, derived from root exudates or protein degradation products, increased the sorption of heavy metals to soils and thus reduced their toxicity to plants. Reducing the metal mobility in soil using glycine could be a self-defense strategy of plants. © 2019","43","Soil pollution","Amino acids - Cadmium compounds - Carbon dioxide - Carrier mobility - Degradation - Detoxification - Heavy metals - Ligands - Mineralogy - Organic carbon - Plants (botany) - Soils - Sorption","Biogeochemical process - Cadmium and leads - Dissolved organic carbon - Heavy metal stress - Pb concentration - Pb immobilization - Protein degradation - Root exudates","482 Mineralogy - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2015BAD05B05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFD0801004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41877117, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the three anonymous reviewers for critical comments&nbsp;and suggestions on the manuscript.

Platelet membrane (PLTM) biomimetic DDSs are expected to enhance retention in vivo and escape uptake by macrophages, as well as minimizing immunogenicity, attributing to the CD47 protein in PLTM sends 'don't eat me' signals to macrophages. In addition, P-selectin is overexpressed on the PLTM, which would allow a PLTM-biomimetic DDS to specifically bind to the CD44 receptors upregulated on the surface of cancer cells. Results: In this study, porous nanoparticles loaded with the anti-cancer drug bufalin (Bu) were prepared from a chitosan oligosaccharide (CS)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymer. These were subsequently coated with platelet membrane (PLTM) to form PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs. The PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs bear a particle size of ~ 192 nm, and present the same surface proteins as the PLTM. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results revealed a greater uptake of PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs than uncoated CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs, as a result of the targeted binding of P-selectin on the surface of the PLTM to the CD44 receptors of H22 hepatoma cells. In vivo biodistribution studies in H22-tumor carrying mice revealed that the PLTM-CS-pPLGA NPs accumulated in the tumor, because of a combination of active targeting effect and the EPR effect. The PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs led to more effective tumor growth inhibition over other bufalin formulations. Conclusions: Platelet membrane biomimetic nanoparticles played a promising targeted treatment of cancer with low side effect. © 2019 The Author(s).","38","Targeted drug delivery","Biomimetics - Controlled drug delivery - Diagnosis - Diseases - Macrophages - Mammals - Membranes - Multilayers - Nanoparticles - Particle size - Platelets - Proteins - Tumors","Antitumor drug deliveries - Antitumor drugs - Biomimetic nanoparticles - Bufalin - Chitosan oligosaccharide - Drug delivery system - Platelet membranes - Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 16410723700, Acronym: STCSM, Sponsor: Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; ","This investigation was supported by grant 16410723700 from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, the Biomedical Textile Materials "111 Project" of the Ministry of Education of China (No. B07024), and the UK-China Joint Laboratory for Therapeutic Textiles (based at Donghua University).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Some 20 A. alpina communities were distributed in two traditional smelting tailing piles of Minbingyingjiying (TST) and Shangduoduo village (SDD) with different Pb smelting history. The morphological characteristics (plant height, branch number, basal leaf length, basal leaf width and root morphology) of A. alpina, contents and accumulation characteristics of eight potentially toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Al, Fe) in soil and plants were analyzed. The results showed that the morphological characteristics of A. alpina were mean plant height 12.25 cm, the basal leaf length 17.69 cm, leaf width 5.40 cm, the total root length 117.86 cm plant−1, the root diameter 0.90 mm. The leaves of A. alpina in SDD were longer and narrower with higher plant height compared with in TST. The main companion plants of A. alpina were Sporobolus fertilis (Steud.) W. D.

Microwave drying is being explored in the present work as an effective upgradation technique. The effects of operating variables such as sample mass, particle size and sample thickness were investigated. The work also attempts to compare the quality of lignite dried using conventional hot air and microwave drying utilizing characterization techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, BET. The SEM analysis demonstrate a considerable increase in number of pores, fractures and cracks in the upgraded lignite structure after microwave drying as compared to hot air drying. The FT-IR analysis indicate an overall reduction in the number of absorbance peaks and a significant reduction in the oxygen-containing functional groups with microwave drying as compared to hot air drying. The BET analysis reveal a 30 fold increase in specific surface area with microwave drying as compared to hot air drying. The major proportion of pores in the lignite after microwave drying were either mesopores or micropores, while that dried with conventional hot air were macropores. Microwave drying as compared with hot air drying is more effective having higher fixed carbon content. The moisture re-adsorption capacity weakened after microwave drying, while it increased with increase in particle size. ©2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","35","Drying","Lignite - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Pore structure - Potential energy - Solar dryers","Absorbance peak - Adsorption capacities - Characterization techniques - Hot air drying - Microwave drying - Operating variables - Oxygen-containing functional groups - Sample thickness","524 Solid Fuels - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, we parameterized shrubland in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) as its fifth plant functional type. We then used CLASS to simulate the hydrological processes in water-stressed shrub-covered sites in the US Southwest and the Mediterranean. CLASS overestimates evapotranspiration (ET) and underestimates runoff at the annual time scale. Rainy season ET overestimation is attributable to the overestimation of soil evaporation. In the CLASS base run, in the Mediterranean, plant transpiration demonstrates low sensitivity to water stress during dry summers. Overly early depletion of soil water leads to the consequent underestimation of ET at the end of dry seasons. In addition, the ratio of transpiration to total ET is underestimated compared with observations. We calibrated the hydrological processes in CLASS accordingly, with the aim of reducing soil evaporation (which dominates ET in the wet seasons) and increasing the sensitivity of plant transpiration to water stress. The newly introduced parameterization is able to capture well the hydrological dynamics in these four study sites at the monthly time scale. Still, our proposed parameterization for soil evaporation demonstrates high sensitivity to soil composition and needs further calibrations in other regions to guarantee its general applicability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","101","Transpiration","Evapotranspiration - Parameterization - Soil moisture - Surface measurement","ET partitioning - Hydrological process - Land surface scheme - Monthly time scale - Plant functional type - Plant transpiration - Shrub - Soil evaporations","461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements","Number: -, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 2019J0017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; ","The initial work was carried out at the Climate Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada by Shanshan Sun as a postdoctoral researcher funded under the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Visiting Fellowship in Canadian Government Laboratories program.

Carbonaceous slate is prone to large deformation and partial collapse during tunnel excavation, and even causes major economic losses and casualties. Taking the Haibaluo Tunnel of the Xiangli expressway as an example, the mechanical characteristics of the large deformation section of the carbonaceous slate tunnel during different stages of the whole construction were investigated based on field monitoring of the displacement of surrounding rock and the internal force of the primary and secondary linings. The research results show that the excavation of the upper step is the main deformation stage of the surrounding rock, and that the deformation of the surrounding rock presents an asymmetrical deformation mode of ”smaller at the left and larger at the right” with a maximum settlement(208.9 mm) at the right shoulder. The stress distribution of steel supports along the circumference is “larger at the upper and smaller at the lower”, and the maximum compressive stresses of the upper and lower steps are respectively 550.4 MPa and 134.9 MPa. The safety factors of the vault, the left and right arch shoulders of the primary support and the left invert arch of the secondary lining concrete are less than the limit values.

In the present work, rare earth metal oxide-supported iron catalysts were effectively prepared via a simple co-precipitation method, and their catalytic activity for methane decomposition was evaluated for the first time. The structural, textural and redox properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized using different analytical methods. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts indicated the presence of CeO2 and Fe2O3 as different phases in the fresh Fe/CeO2 catalyst and La(OH)3, Fe2O3, and LaFeO3 as different phases in the fresh Fe/La2O3 catalysts. However, large amounts of cerium and lanthanum orthoferrites were identified in the reduced samples. The nitrogen sorption analysis indicated the presence of a mesoporous texture due to the homogeneous aggregation of catalyst particles. The catalysts showed high catalytic activity and stability for methane decomposition, and no deactivation was observed for a period of 360 min of time on stream. A maximum hydrogen yield of 66 ± 1% was observed for both of the catalysts at 800 °C. However, the Fe/CeO2 catalyst showed high catalytic stability, where the highest initial and final hydrogen yield was found to be almost constant for the Fe/CeO2 catalyst. However, a substantial drop in the hydrogen yield was noticed for the Fe/La2O3 catalyst during the course of the reaction. The improved surface stabilization and fine dispersion of iron nanocrystals on the ceria matrix made it highly active and stable compared to the lanthanum-based catalyst for the methane decomposition reaction. The encapsulation of metallic iron by carbon deposited on the Fe/La2O3 catalyst could be responsible for the low catalytic stability. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes with different shapes were deposited on the catalysts with respect to the support material. A set of spiral-shaped multi-walled carbon nanotubes with a double helical-shaped chain-like structure were deposited on the Fe/La2O3 catalyst, that is rarely formed in methane decomposition. The nanocarbon deposited on the Fe/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a high degree of crystallinity and graphitization, as shown by the Raman spectroscopy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","69","Catalyst supports","Catalysis - Catalyst activity - Cerium oxide - Coprecipitation - Hematite - Hydrogen production - Iron - Lanthanum compounds - Methane - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN) - Rare earth elements - Rare earths - Surface reactions - Yarn","Catalytic decomposition of methanes - Degree of crystallinity - Iron catalyst - Powder X ray diffraction - Rare-earth metal oxide - Structural characterization - Surface catalysis - Thermocatalytic decomposition","482.2 Minerals - 522 Gas Fuels - 545.1 Iron - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 819.4 Fiber Products","Number: PKT 6/2012, Acronym: UKM, Sponsor: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; ","The authors would like to thank Yayasan Sime Darby, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (PKT 6/2012) and Sime Darby Research (KK-2014-014) for the financial support.

Because the characteristics of the working transmission structure of the PMLSM are relatively special, the thrust ripple and load disturbance will yield in the operation, and they will directly affect the control accuracy and positioning precision. Simultaneously, the thrust of the PMLSM directly acts on the object, and the thrust disturbance of the PMLSM will appear in the payload of the vibration absorber. Based on the actuator, the Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is investigated, and the transfer function of the actuator is obtained. Then, the thrust disturbance of the PMLSM is theoretical studied by analyzing the current flows through the PMLSM. A new method of trajectory overlay planning is presented, where the original input is divided into two inputs with different amplitudes and they suppress each other. Based on the method, the PID control can restrain the disturbance to achieve a predesigned output.

The direct current (DC) arc plasma is an effective method for preparing nanomaterials with high purity. Specifically, high temperature can be generated by arc discharge between two electrodes, then the gas in the reaction chamber turn into plasma state, and the raw material is evaporated into gaseous atoms. The supersaturated vapor flows to the low temperature part of the reaction chamber, re-nucleates and grows into the desired nanoparticles. The preparation of nanomaterials by DC arc plasma show many advantages, including simple operation, low cost, high synthesis efficiency, high purity of the product, and environmental friendliness. However, in the process of preparing nanomaterials by the arc discharge, changing the relevant experimental parameters will affects the particle size and morphology of the products. Especially, in the preparation of carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanomaterials with diverse morphology, like carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbon nanohorns can be acquired by varying the experimental conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the optimum synthesis conditions of different nanomaterials from the growth mechanism of nanocrystalline particles and to realize their controllable preparation. Nowadays, the research focus of preparing nanomaterials by arc process has turned from simple preparation methods study into the investigation of the formation mechanism and controllable synthesis parameters, for the sake of realizing the large scale preparation of nanomaterials with controllable particle size and uniform size distribution. In addition, since the arc process is superior to other methods, it is also popular for developing novel nanomaterials by employing arc process. In recent years, fruitful results have been made in the preparation of nanomaterials by the arc discharge. In the field of carbon nanomaterials, not only the preparation of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, but also the synthesis of high quality monolayer graphene and carbon nanohorns have been realized successfully. In terms of metal nanomaterials, high quality silver and nickel nanopowders have been obtained. In addition, nanomaterials of refractory metals are difficult to prepare by other methods because of their high melting point. While the temperature of arc zone can reach 104 K, hence the nanomaterials of various refractory metals such as Mo, Cr, V, and W can be achieved by this method. Considering the ceramic nanomaterials, high performance ceramic nanomaterials like SiC and TiC have been successfully prepared. Besides, the formation and growth mechanism of nanoparticles should be explored deeply in order to realized the controllable preparation of nanomaterials by arc discharge. Recently, researchers use numerical simulations and other auxiliary methods to simulate the arc process, and temperature, pressure, and velocity distribution of the arc zone can be obtained. The simulated experimental results play a crucial role in explaining the growth mechanism of nanomaterials. This review introduces the research progress of preparing carbon, metallic, and ceramic nanomaterials by the DC arc plasma. The formation mechanism of nanoparticles is analyzed in depth. The problems existing in the preparation of nanomaterials by arc plasma method are described, and corresponding solutions are put forward. Finally, the prospect of large scale, low cost, controllable preparation of nanomaterials by the DC arc discharge is illustrated. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

By analyzing the metabolic curves and some quantitative thermo-kinetic parameters obtained from these curves with the help of principle component analysis (PCA), the antibacterial effects of gallic acid on S. aureus were rapidly and accurately evaluated. Growth rate constant k2 of the second exponential phase and the maximum heat flow output power P2 for S. aureus growth were selected as the two main parameters for the antibacterial evaluation. Results showed that 10 μg mL−1 of gallic acid began to inhibit the growth of S. aureus, and high concentrations (more than 20 μg mL−1) of this compound exhibited strong anti-S. aureus effects. 63.51 μg mL−1 of gallic acid resulted in a 50% inhibitory ratio on S. aureus. All these illustrated that the anti-S. aureus effects were enhanced with increasing the concentration of this compound. Gallic acid can be used as a new natural and safe antibacterial drug for treating multidrug-resistant S. aureus.

However, the interaction of VOCs with pulmonary surfactant (PS) that directly comes into contact with inhaled VOCs is unknown. Here, simulated PS extracted from porcine lungs (EPS) was used to study the interaction with BTEX (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-xylene) as representatives of VOCs. Surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherms showed that in the presence of individual BTEX, EPS monolayer's phase conversion from gas to liquid expanded phase was dramatically influenced and its collapse pressure decreased greatly compared to those of EPS alone, which was attributed to the alteration of EPS monolayer's microstructure characterized by atomic force microscopy and Brewster angle microscopy. Solubilization experiments manifested that EPS and its major components (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, DPPC; bovine serum albumin, BSA) exhibited obvious solubilization effects on individual BTEX. The solubilization capacity followed an order: EPS > DPPC > BSA, which was positively correlated with hydrophobicity of individual BTEX. Synergistic solubilization test unveiled that the mixed phospholipid components were largely responsible for the solubilization capacity of EPS. These findings indicate that VOCs exposure may induce potential pulmonary health risk due to the alteration of gas-liquid interfacial properties of PS. © 2019","55","Phase interfaces","Atomic force microscopy - Biological organs - Body fluids - Gas chromatography - Health risks - Liquids - Mammals - Monolayers - Phospholipids - Solubility - Surface active agents - Volatile organic compounds","Brewster angle microscopy - Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine - Gas-liquid interface - Pulmonary surfactants - Solubilization - Solubilization capacities - Surface pressure-area - Surface pressures","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.7 Health Care - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 1411909411, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 2017T20160073, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 41761072, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21777064 , 41761072 , and 21707058 ), the High-Level Talent Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 1411909411 ), and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2017T20160073 ).

It has been reported that major known bioactive compounds in green tea, e.g. epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and theanine, decreased during fermentation. Then which components account for the benefits of Pu-erh tea? Phenolic acids are aromatic secondary metabolites and possess various biological properties. In this research, phenolic acids in Pu-erh tea were investigated qualitatively and quantitatively to reveal the influence of fermentation and their potential effects using 5-(diisopropylamino)amylamine (DIAAA) derivatization-ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) approach. A total of 33 phenolic acids were determined, and most of them were detected in Pu-erh tea for the first time. Moreover, gallic acid and theogallin were the major components in ripened and raw Pu-erh tea, respectively. Dynamic profiling revealed the increase of simple phenolic acids and the decrease of most of phenolic acid esters during Pu-erh tea fermentation. These results provided firm basis for practical fermentation and quality control of Pu-erh tea. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","50","Liquid chromatography","Fermentation - Flavonoids - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites - Organic acids","Derivatizations - Dynamic Profiling - Epigallocatechin gallate - Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometries - Phenolic acids - Pu-erh teas - Quadrupole-time of flights - Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies","801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effects of EOs from S. aromaticum buds and fruits on the growth of pathogenic mycelia were determined with in vitro antifungal experiments using the Oxford cup method. The results suggested that S. aromaticum EOs had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of pathogenic fungi. At a dose of 50 mg/mL, the inhibitory effects of S. aromaticum buds EOs was greater than those of S. aromaticum fruits. Then the chemical constituents of the S. aromaticum EOs were analyzed by GC–MS. The results indicated that the eugenol content was the highest, accounting for 57.95% of the total constituents in the S. aromaticum buds EOs and 39.26% in the S. aromaticum fruits EOs. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EOs, the major constituents, and hymexazol were evaluated. In addition, the antifungal effect of their combination was also determined by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC). When the buds EOs were combined with hymexazol, they had a synergistic effect in inhibiting Pythium aphanidermatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The combination of S. aromaticum fruit EOs with hymexazol showed an additive effect on Fusarium solani, P. aphanidermatum, and B. cinerea. The preventive effect of S. aromaticum bud EOs combined with hymexazol was up to 60.77% in in vivo experiments. Overall, S. aromaticum EOs had a broad spectrum of antifungal activities against pathogenic fungi influencing the growth of P. notoginseng, which would provide a scientific basis for the ecological control of P. notoginseng disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","40","Fungi","Chemical analysis - Disease control - Essential oils - Fruits","Anti-fungal - Chemical constituents - Colletotrichum gloeosporioides - Inhibitory concentration - Minimum inhibitory concentration - Panax notoginseng - Pathogenic fungi - Syzygium aromaticum","804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 2017YFD0201402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2017FF116, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018FB139, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81660626, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China "Research and Development of Comprehensive Technologies on Chemical Fertilizer and Pesticide Reduction and Synergism" ( 2017YFD0201402 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81660626 ), Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department-Applied Basic Research Joint Special Funds of Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine [ 2017FF116 (-014) ] and Yunnan Applied basic Research Program-Youth Project ( 2018FB139 ),",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This system primarily consisted of a precision fluid metering pump, a water pump, a static mixer, a premixing tank and a buffer tank. The required amounts of water and chemical concentrates were accurately pumped into the premixing tank through a static mixer. The mixture was then transferred into a buffer tank for additional mixing process and for the spray pump to discharge to variable flow-rate nozzles. When the buffer tank neared empty, this process was repeated automatically to maintain the same chemical ratio for all nozzles regardless of their spray output differences and variations. Accuracy of the metering pump was verified with simulated pesticide concentrates (tap water, turpentine oil, prime oil, and four different viscous sucrose solutions)at viscosities between 0.9 and 32.0 mPa·s. With addition of a fluorescent tracer, the sucrose solutions were also used to evaluate the uniformity of spray mixtures discharged from the premixing in-line injection system. Test results demonstrated that the fluid metering pump could accurately dispense desired volume (10–300 mL)of simulated pesticides at different pump rotational speeds with relative errors between measured and desired volumes below 5%. The uniformity of spray mixtures at different chemical-to-water ratios (0.1%–2.0%)was consistent, and the highest relative error and coefficient of variation were 7.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The experimental premixing in-line injection system was proven to have stable and accurate performance, and thus would have great potentials to improve spray application efficiency with minimized tank mixture leftovers for future variable-rate sprayers. © 2019","36","Spray nozzles","Automation - Flowmeters - Mixers (machinery) - Mixtures - Orchards - Pesticides - Precision agriculture - Reciprocating pumps - Sugar (sucrose) - Tanks (containers)","Accurate performance - Air blast - Coefficient of variation - Fluorescent tracers - Injection systems - Simulated pesticides - Spray application - Variable flow rate","618.2 Pumps - 619.2 Tanks - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 822.3 Food Products - 943.1 Mechanical Instruments","Number: 2015-51181-24253, Acronym: NIFA, Sponsor: National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Number: -, Acronym: USDA, Sponsor: U.S. Department of Agriculture; ","Mention of company or trade names is for description only and does not imply endorsement by the USDA.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key enzyme in the central and peripheral nervous system associated with neurotoxicity. In this study, a spectroscopic method and computer simulation were applied to explore the mode of interaction between AChE and enantiomers of nicotine (S/R-nicotine). Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the quenching mechanism of endogenous fluorescence of AChE by S/R-nicotine was static, as confirmed by the time-resolved steady-state fluorescence. The binding strength of both nicotine to AChE was weak (S-AChE: Ka = 80.06 L mol−1, R-AChE: Ka = 173.75 L mol−1). The main driving forces of S-AChE system interaction process were van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding, whereas that of R-AChE system was electrostatic force. Computer simulations showed that there were other important forces involved. S/R-Nicotine had a major binding site on AChE, and molecular docking showed that they bound mainly to the cavities enclosed by the active sites (ES, PAS, OH, AACS, and AP) in the protein. UV-vis spectroscopy and 3D spectroscopy indicated that nicotine significantly affected the microenvironment of Trp amino acids in AChE. The CD spectra indicated that S-nicotine increased the α-helical structure of AChE, but the overall conformation did not change significantly. By contrast, R-nicotine significantly changed the secondary structure of AChE. 5,5′-Dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) method indicated that S and R nicotine produced different degrees of inhibition on the catalytic activity of AChE. Both experimental methods and computer simulations showed that R-nicotine had a significantly higher effect on AChE than S-nicotine.

The calculated lattice constant, the charge, the bond order, the cell volume and the bond length of CeO2 are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results. For co-doped CeO2 systems, the calculated results show that the lattice constants, the bond order of Ce–O as well as the cell volume increase, while the charge of Ce decrease. Due to co-doping, the energy gap (Eg) between valence band and conduction band becomes narrower than that of pure CeO2. Meanwhile, the electron structures of the co-doped CeO2 are changed, which may lead to transformation of optical properties. Nonmetallic atomic orbital (C 2p, N 2p, P 3p, S 3p) and metal atomic orbital (Ce 4f and 5d) are hybridized, except for the hybridization between Ce (4f and 5d) and O (2p). Compared with CeO2, Eg between Ce 4f and Ce 5d becomes smaller. Further, the optical absorption, refractive index and reflectivity of them are investigated. The calculated results reveal that their absorption edges have a red shift. Co-doping enhances visible light photocatalytic activity, which is related to the transition of valence band → conduction band, and Ce 4f → Ce 5d.

The empirical results show that, firstly, there are significant multifractality in the cross-correlations among the four energy futures markets, and the cross-correlation behavior of small fluctuations is more persistent than that of large fluctuations. Secondly, the connectedness among the four energy markets is much stronger in short term than those in longer time horizons. Thirdly, in terms of the static connectedness measurement without time frequency and on time horizon of 4 to 10 days, electricity futures market dominates other energy markets by contributing the largest positive net connectedness in the system. Finally, when the dynamic connectedness is considered, we find that at different time periods, the four energy markets play various roles in the system by offering time-varying positive or negative net connectedness to other markets. The electricity futures market, however, transmits the largest positive net connectedness in recent years, especially on time horizons longer than 4 days. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","58","Power markets","Commerce - Correlation methods - Financial markets - Fractals - Petroleum analysis","Cross correlations - Detrended cross-correlation analysis - Electricity futures market - Energy future - Frequency connectedness - MF-DCCA - Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MF DCCA) - Variance decomposition","921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 17XJA790002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; Number: 17YJA790015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; Number: 18XJA790002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; Number: 18YJC790132, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; Number: 71371157, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71671145, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to show our sincere gratitude to anonymous reviewers, as well as Professor Eugene Stanley, Editor of Physica A, whose comments and suggestions greatly improved the quality of this paper.

Using a self-consistent tight-binding approach combined with the standard Kubo formula, we show that the optical conductivity and the linear dichroism of few-layer phosphorene can be modulated by a perpendicular electric field. We find that the field-induced charge screening plays a significant role in modulating the optical conductivity and the linear dichroism. Distinct absorption peaks are induced in the conductivity spectrum due to the strong quantum confinement along the out-of-plane direction and to the field-induced forbidden-to-allowed transitions. The field modulation of the linear dichroism becomes more pronounced with increasing number of phosphorene layers. We also show that the Faraday rotation is present in few-layer phosphorene even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This optical Hall effect is induced by the reduced lattice symmetry of few-layer phosphorene. The Faraday rotation is greatly influenced by the field-induced charge screening and is strongly dependent on the strength of perpendicular electric field and on the number of phosphorene layers. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","28","Dichroism","Absorption spectroscopy - Electric fields - Faraday effect - Light modulators - Modulation - Optical conductivity - Optical lattices - Optical signal processing - Rotation","Electric field modulation - Electrooptical modulators - few-layer phosphorene - Linear dichroism - Self-consistent calculation - Telecommunication devices - Tight binding methods - Tight-binding approaches","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: TRANS-2D-TMD, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was financially supported by the Flemish Science Foundation (FWO-Vl) and by the FLAG-ERA project TRANS-2D-TMD.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), the mainly effective components of PS, was used as a mimic of PS employed to explore its surface activity in the exposure of VOCs. The results showed that the surface tension of DPPC decreased significantly with the addition of VOCs. On a basis of structure-activity assessment, hydrogen-bond basicity and dispersion/cavity interaction of VOCs are responsible for the decreasing capacity of VOCs for DPPC's surface tension. Surface pressure-molecular area (π-A) isotherms demonstrate that the phase conversion of DPPC monolayer from gas to liquid expanded phase was greatly impacted by VOCs. The collapse pressure of DPPC monolayer in VOCs exposure are lower compared to that of DPPC alone, which can be attributed to the lowest surface tension of DPPC solutions mixed with VOCs. Atomic force microscopy analysis elucidates that the presence of VOCs led to bigger apertures area of DPPC monolayer than that of DPPC alone, which is indicative of microstructure changes of DPPC monolayer in the exposure of VOCs.

It is even hard for experts, let alone computer-aided diagnosis systems. Recently, some deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) based methods have been introduced to tackle this problem, achieving much impressive performance. However, these methods always tend to miss segmented results for the important regions of colon gland or make a wrong segmenting decision. In this paper, we address the challenging problem by proposed a novel framework through conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator in the framework is trained to learn a mapping from gland colon image to a confidence map indicating the probabilities of being a pixel of gland object. The discriminator is responsible to penalize the mismatch between colon gland image and the confidence map. This additional adversarial learning facilitates the generator to produce higher quality confidence map. Then we transform the confidence map into a binary image using a fixed threshold to fulfill the segmentation task. We implement extensive experiments on the public benchmark MICCAI gland 2015 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our method achieve a better segmentation result in terms of visual perception and two quantitative metrics, compared with other methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","17","Image segmentation","Binary images - Biochemistry - Bioinformatics - Computer aided diagnosis - Deep neural networks - Neural networks - Semantic Web - Semantics - Textures","Adversarial learning - Adversarial networks - Colon gland - Computer aided diagnosis systems - Convolutional neural network - Quantitative metrics - Segmentation results - Semantic segmentation","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 801.2 Biochemistry - 903 Information Science","","This work is supported by the innovative research program of Yunnan University (nos.

Here, responses of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seedlings of the cultivars YM5 and BM to the stress of different concentrations of NaCl and Na2CO3 were investigated to explore the salt tolerance of hemp. Results showed that the plant height, dry weight and root length of YM5 and BM seedlings gradually decreased as the concentration of NaCl or Na2CO3 increased. Although physiological indices such as EC (Electrical conductivity), SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and Pro (Proline) increased as the salt concentration increased, the increase extent was significantly greater in YM5 than in BM. Under the conditions of 100 and 200 mM NaCl, BM had greater dry weight and root length, and lower Pro content than YM5. However, under the stress of 100 and 200 mM Na2CO3 the opposite results were recorded, with the exception for lower chlorophyll content and higher SOD activity in BM than in YM5. These findings indicated that BM had a stronger NaCl tolerance than YM5. Moreover, morphological indices of the two cultivars under Na2CO3 stress were stunted more than under NaCl stress, and the seedlings died when Na2CO3 concentration increased up to 300 mM. Some up-regulation of salt-tolerant genes were observed in the two hemp cultivars, a higher expression under NaCl stress than under Na2CO3 stress, and a higher expression in YM5 than in BM were recorded. Findings from the study indicated that hemp seedling is more sensitive to Na2CO3 stress, and the tolerance of hemp to salt stress varies with salt type and salt concentration, although both cultivars can withstand moderate doses of NaCl and Na2CO3. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","33","Hemp","Enzymes - Gene expression - Gene expression regulation - Physiological models - Physiology - Plants (botany) - Seed - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium chloride","Cannabis sativa - Chlorophyll contents - Electrical conductivity - Physiological indices - Physiological response - Salt concentration - Seedling growth - Super oxide dismutase","461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: CARS-16-E15, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; Number: 31871671, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31371678, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China "Mechanism of salt-tolerant in industrial hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.)

The leaching behavior of contaminant metals and the phase composition of leaching residues are investigated. The results show that the removal rates of V, Fe, and Ni are as high as 32.7, 28.2, and 17.5%, respectively, after leaching under microwave using 5 wt% concentration HCl solution at L/S ratio of 10:1 at 80 °C for 30 min. Under these conditions, the peak intensity of zeolite-Y and the formation of the active γ-Al2O3 are enhanced, while the BET surface area of the SFCC spent catalyst increases from 91.94 to 197.11 m2 g-1. The leaching kinetics results indicate that the leaching kinetics of aluminum and contaminant metals in acid solution under microwave follows the shrinking core model which can be expressed as 1-(1-x)1/3 = kt, and the overall leaching processes are controlled by the surface chemical reactions of metals with HCl. The apparent activation energies of V, Fe, Ni, and Al during acid leaching under microwave heating are calculated to be 5.25, 8.36, 9.58, and 12.52 kJ mol-1, respectively. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","33","Leaching","Activation energy - Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Catalysts - Catalytic cracking - Chlorine compounds - Contamination - Hydrochloric acid - Kinetics - Metals - Microwave heating - Microwave irradiation - Nickel compounds - Process control - Surface reactions - Zeolites","Apparent activation energy - Contaminant metals - Leaching behavior - Leaching kinetics - Removal efficiencies - Shrinking core model - Spent FCC catalysts - Surface chemical reactions","711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Dynamic VM consolidation is a promising consolidation approach in this direction, which aims at using least active physical machines (PMs) through appropriately migrating VMs to reduce resource consumption. The resulting optimization problem is well-acknowledged to be NP-hard optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel merge-and-split-based coalitional game-theoretic approach for VM consolidation in heterogeneous clouds. The proposed approach first partitions PMs into different groups based on their workload levels, then employs a coalitional-game-based VM consolidation algorithm (CGMS) in choosing members from such groups to form effective coalitions, performs VM migrations among the coalition members to maximize the payoff of every coalition, and finally keeps PMs running in a high energy-efficiency state. The simulation results based on three scenarios clearly suggest that our proposed approach outperforms traditional ones in terms of energy-saving, and also achieve a fair level of load balance. © 2013 IEEE.","37","Virtual machine","Balancing - Distributed computer systems - Energy efficiency - Game theory - Optimization - Power management","Coalitional game - Consolidation methods - Consolidation techniques - Energy aware - High energy efficiency - Load balance - Optimization problems - Resource consumption","525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 601 Mechanical Design - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Vacuum metallurgy has become a promising emerging technology contributing to refining primary metals and the recovery of secondary nonferrous metal wastes. The technology is therefore relevant in the context of a transition to a more environmentally friendly circular economy. There is a growing interest in using vacuum distillation for extraction of Pb and valuable metals recovery from lead-rich secondary materials including crude lead, waste Pb-Sn alloy (WPSA) and lead anode slime (LAS). Results indicated that vacuum extracted lead (99.5% Pb) was obtained from crude lead (92.88%) using the two stage high-low temperature vacuum distillation process. Removals of 99.99% for Cu, 99.50% for Sn, and 98.00% for Ag, were achieved respectively. The valuable metals of Ag, Cu and Sn were recovered and concentrated in the final residue. Vacuum separation results of WPSA demonstrated that the purity of Pb reached 99.4% and recovery of Sn was above 86.0%. A novel integrated smelting-vacuum method is proposed here to reuse LAS. Copper and Ag were successfully enriched in the residues whilst Pb was collected in volatiles. The appropriate vacuum process effectively extracted Pb whilst recycling valuable metals, in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","35","Metal recovery","Distillation - Extraction - Lead alloys - Metal refining - Metals - Secondary recovery - Smelting - Sustainable development - Temperature - Tin alloys - Vacuum applications","Emerging technologies - Exhausted resources - Extraction process - Secondary materials - Vacuum distillation - Vacuum distillation process - Vacuum separations - Valuable metal recovery","511.1 Oil Field Production Operations - 533.2 Metal Refining - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 633.1 Vacuum Applications - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: 20180050, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This project was funded by the Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. U1502271), the construction of high-level talents of Kunming University of Science and Technology (EmpNo. 20180050), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant No. 2016YFC0400404), the Leader in Science and Technology of Yunnan Province (grant No. 2014HA003), and the Program for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology (grant No. 2014RA4018).

Moreover, it has been discovered that latency delays are essential for the function of WSNIVs and can drive instability and periodic oscillations, enhance complexity, and even lead to multistability and chaotic motion. However, the precise roles of such delay during the regulation process are still not completely understood. Here, the primary objective of this paper is to study oscillatory behaviors of WSNIVs with latency delay. In particular, the sufficient conditions for local stability and existence with Hopf bifurcation are obtained. Moreover, we further discuss the properties of Hopf bifurcation by using the normal form and the center manifold theorem. The obtained results show that the latency delay can drive the WSNIVs to be oscillatory even when the network is at a stable state, suggesting that such delay might be a potential hazard to the security of wireless sensor systems. Our findings highlight the importance of considering delays when developing safer and more effective wireless sensor networks. Finally, we test and analyze the above research results through numerical calculation with Matlab and simulation experiments with OPNET, and the conclusions are verified to be correct and effective in experiments. © 2019 Totem Publisher, Inc.","29","Wireless sensor networks","Hopf bifurcation - Leaching - MATLAB - Time delay - Viruses","Biological process - Center manifold theorem - Network congestions - Numerical calculation - Oscillatory behaviors - Periodic oscillation - Security strengths - Wireless sensor system","461.9 Biology - 713 Electronic Circuits - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Number: 13YJCZH233, Acronym: MEYS, Sponsor: Ministry of Education, Youth and Science; Number: 2013, Acronym: MEYS, Sponsor: Ministry of Education, Youth and Science; Number: 61561055, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Fund Project (No. 61561055), the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Youth Fund Project (No. 13YJCZH233), and the Applied Basic Research Plan on the Project in Yunnan Province (No. 2013).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

And the dielectric properties are of great importance to characterize the electrical and insulation performances of electrical insulation materials. So it is supposed to pave the way for the utility of terahertz wave technology in power system if the dielectric properties of materials on terahertz band can be detected. Firstly, the platform of terahertz wave transmission mode was set up and the flat samples of electrical porcelain were customized with certain thickness. Secondly, the propagation law of terahertz wave in the light path of test was derived based on the fundamental electromagnetic principles, and the dielectric properties of materials were then retrieved according to their relationship with the optical parameters (such as refractive index) in the normal method and also a novel detecting method was proposed. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this method were verified by experiments. In conclusion, the dielectric properties detected in this method are on a relatively broad frequency band rather than a single frequency point to provide massive information about the structural characteristics of materials. Besides, the proposed new method is proved to achieve better precision of parameters on certain conditions. © 2019 IEEE.","5","Dielectric materials","Dielectric properties - Electric variables measurement - Insulating materials - Insulation - Materials properties - Nondestructive examination - Optical variables control - Porcelain - Refractive index - Terahertz wave detectors - Terahertz waves - Wave transmission","Detecting methods - Electrical parameter - Insulation performance - Optical parameter - Precision of Parameters - Single frequency - Structural characteristics - Wave technologies","413 Insulating Materials - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 741.1 Light/Optics - 812.1 Ceramics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Importantly, B doping improves the electronic properties of RuAl2 by shifting the Al 3p and Ru 4d states from the Fermi level (EF) to the valence band. Although B doping weakens the resistance to volume and shear deformation as well as the elastic stiffness of RuAl2, it improves the ductility due to the formation of Ru-B and Al-B bonds.

The probe molecule (Rhodamine B or rhodamine 123) had a strong fluorescence signal, and its fluorescence was quenched by CX6@RGO, based on FRET. When the target molecule was added to CX6@RGO, the probe molecule was displaced by resveratrol, and a host-guest complex, CX6@RGO-resveratrol formed, turning-on the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence intensity of the CX6@RGO-probe complex increased linearly with increased resveratrol concentrations (2.0–40.0 μM).

The variations of these observed decadal changes are assessed by the comparison between the present day (PD) of 1994-2011 and the early period (EP) of 1964-81. The compound HWs change most remarkably in all three aspects, with frequency averaged over China in the PD tripling that in the EP and intensity and spatial extent nearly doubling. The daytime and nighttime HWs also change significantly in all three aspects. A set of numerical experiments is used to investigate the drivers and physical processes responsible for the decadal changes of the HWs. Results indicate the predominant role of the anthropogenic forcing, including changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions in the HW decadal changes. The GHG changes have dominant impacts on the three types of HWs, while the AA changes make significant influences on daytime HWs. The GHG changes increase the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of the three types of HWs over China both directly via the strengthened greenhouse effect and indirectly via land-atmosphere and circulation feedbacks in which GHGchange- induced warming in sea surface temperature plays an important role. The AA changes decrease the frequency and intensity of daytime HWs over Southeastern China through mainly aerosol-radiation interaction, but increase the frequency and intensity of daytime HWs over Northeastern China through AAchange- induced surface-atmosphere feedbacks and dynamical changes related to weakened East Asian summer monsoon. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","75","Greenhouse gases","Aerosols - Gas emissions - Greenhouse effect - Oceanography - Surface waters","Aerosol-radiation interactions - Anthropogenic aerosols - Anthropogenic effects - Anthropogenic forcing - Decadal variability - East Asian summer monsoon - Observational analysis - Sea surface temperature (SST)","444.1 Surface Water - 451 Air Pollution - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 471.1 Oceanography, General","Number: 41505037, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 41505037 and U1502233, by the Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FB078), and by the UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through theMet Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund.

The artificial crack geometry of the conceptual rock bridge model is a combination of two edge-notched artificial cracks and imbedded artificial cracks with different intermittent artificial crack densities. By numerical shear-box tests, deep insight into the mesoscopic mechanism of crack evolution is gained, and the simulated failure patterns are in accordance with experimental results. Three types of failure patterns are identified: shear mode, mixed shear/tensile mode, and tensile mode. The RFPA simulations demonstrate that macroscale shear cracks form as damage belts consisting of many tensile/shear mesocracks, as typically observed in microscopic experimental work. The failure pattern is mostly influenced by the intermittent artificial crack density, whereas the peak shear strength is related to the failure pattern. As the intermittent artificial crack density increases, the failure pattern changes from shear mode to mixed shear/tensile mode and then to tensile mode, resulting in a decrease in the peak shear strength. The regression analysis shows that the relationship between the peak shear strength and intermittent artificial crack density can be expressed by an exponential decay model. Furthermore, digital image processing and box-counting fractal analyses are performed on the shear fracture surfaces of the physical and numerical models to describe the fractal behavior. The relationships between the fractal dimension and peak shear strength are analyzed, and strong correlations that display an exponential decay function are found. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","50","Cracks","Fractal dimension - Fracture - Image processing - Regression analysis - Rocks - Shear strength - Tensile strength","Artificial cracks - Experimental and numerical studies - Exponential decay functions - Exponential decay models - Fractal analysis - Peak shear strength - Rock failure process analysis - Shear box tests","921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The enrichment of Li, Rb, Cs, W is the most significant, with the values of Li, Rb, Cs and W in hot springs averaged at 2895.1 μg/L, 839.8 μg/L, 417.9 μg/L and 61.74 μg/L, respectively, which are generally higher than those of Cu, Pb, Zn (13.6 μg/L, 0.24 μg/L and 6.83 μg/L respectively). The contents of precious metals and rare earth elements such as Au, Ag are very low, which are basically below the detection limit. In addition, the content of rare metals in spring water with higher temperature also increases, and helium isotope data show that there is not only the supply of mantle-derived materials in hot springs, but also the content of rare metals increases with the contribution of mantle-derived components. Therefore, hot spring activity can lead to the enrichment and mineralization of rare metals. In view of the extensive and intense hydrothermal activity in Tengchong area and the relatively stable content of Li in hot springs in recent 20 years, it can be concluded that hot springs can not only form rare metal deposits, but also have a relatively fast speed. The amount of lithium that comes out of hydrothermal activity can reach more than 500 tons a year. The ore-forming effect of rare metals by hot spring is better than that of precious metals, rare earth, copper, lead and zinc.

Firstly, the timed colored Petri net models of roads, intersection and signal control system are established, and then an optimization formula for traffic flow with the minimum number of vehicles at the intersection is proposed. Using the number of vehicles on the input and output sections of intersections acquired in 15 phase cycles, the phase timing that satisfies the optimization goal is solved to ensure that the number of output vehicles at the intersection is the largest and the average number of vehicles to be passed on the input road section is the minimum. The simulation results show that the traffic capacity at the intersection is significantly improved, and the average number of vehicles on each output road section increased by 13.3%, 9.7%, 9.8% and 4.3%, respectively. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

The results showed that the shear stress at the mortar-rock interface was much smaller than that at the anchor-mortar interface, while these two shear stresses extended in opposite directions from the neutral point on the anchor rod. In addition, the shear stress distributed unevenly and mutated near the neutral point. With the increase of the seismic response of the slope, the anchorage interface in the unstable rock was first debonded, and then the anchorage interface in the bedrock was also debonded. Meanwhile, the debonding propagated toward the anchor head and the anchor root, respectively, until the pull-out section or the anchorage section was completely debonded and destroyed. We obtained the shear stress, the distribution of shear stress, and the debonding failure process at two anchorage interfaces of the slope under earthquake. The shearing interaction and anchorage failure mechanism at the anchorage interface were revealed and verified by experiments.

In this paper, hexagonal structure 1T-ZrS2 quantum dots (QDs) having a monodisperse grain size of around 3.1 nm is prepared by the ultrasonic exfoliation method. The preparation includes the following steps: ZrS2 powder is ground, followed by ultrasonic exfoliation in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and 1T-ZrS2 QDs are collected after centrifugation. The structure, morphology and optical properties of the QDs are studied in detail. The structure, morphology, size distribution, and elemental composition of 1T-ZrS2 QDs are studied by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical bonds of 1T-ZrS2 QDs are characterized by X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The TEM and AFM results show that the 1T-ZrS2 QDs are spherical in shape with uniform size distribution. The sizes of the 1T-ZrS2 QDs follow a Gaussian fitted distribution with an average diameter of WC=3.1 nm and the FWHM is 1.3 nm. The XRD diffraction pattern of 1T-ZrS2 QDs show wide dispersed diffraction peaks, which is the characteristic of QDs. The diffraction peak at 2θ=32.3°(d=0.278 nm) corresponds to the (101) crystal plane, and the weak diffraction peak at 2θ=56.8°(d=0.167 nm) belongs to the (103) crystal plane. The grain size is also calculated by using the Debye-Scherrer formula, and the calculated value (2.9 nm) is consistent with the result of TEM (3.1 nm). Two Raman vibration modes (E1g and A1g) are observed. The E1g (507.3 cm-1) and A1g (520.1 cm-1) modes relate to the in-plane and out-of-plane vibration respectively. The Raman intensity of the A1g vibration mode is stronger than that of E1g. The UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL and PLE) characterizations exhibit that the 1T-ZrS2 QDs have two UV absorption peaks at 283 nm and 336 nm, respectively. The Stokes shift is ~130 nm, the fluorescence quantum yield reaches up to 53.3%.

The optimal complementary conservation areas are often identified by implementing two approaches in systematic conservation planning, i.e., unlocking or locking existing PAs. However, evidence-based studies are lacking for clarifying the efficiencies of these two planning approaches. With Sichuan in southwest China – part of a global biodiversity hotspot – as one case, this study first assessed the ecological representativeness of existing nature reserves (NRs). Using 32 natural vegetation types as the conservation features, we then implemented a systematic conservation planning process by running Marxan software with NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. A human disturbance index was also included as a penalty function in Marxan for achieving cost-effective planning. We finally investigated the efficiencies of the unlocking and locking planning approaches by comparing the outcomes of the NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. We found that existing NRs were geographically biased towards the western mountainous regions with high elevations and low human disturbance levels. For achieving the same quantitative conservation targets, the total area of the NR-locked priority conservation areas was 18.6% larger than that of the NR-unlocked areas, whereas the area of NR-locked complementary areas to existing NRs was 15.3% smaller than that of NR-unlocked ones. Moreover, the NR-locked priority conservation areas had higher ecological representativeness than NR-unlocked areas. The results suggest that if a completely new PA system is to be established without considering existing PAs, the unlocking approach could more efficiently achieve the full conservation targets at lower costs of land area and with better connected habitats. When existing PAs must be used as focal areas for expansion, the locking approach is more cost-effective for filling conservation gaps by requiring smaller amounts of complementary areas. Our analysis provides evidence-based support for expanding the current PA systems in a cost-effective manner. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","55","Locks (fasteners)","Biodiversity - Conservation - Cost benefit analysis - Cost effectiveness - Ecology - Efficiency - Environmental protection - Planning - Public address systems","Conservation areas - Ecological representativeness - Marxan - Nature reserves - Sichuan - Systematic conservation planning","454 Environmental Engineering - 752 Sound Devices, Equipment and Systems - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 912.2 Management - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: 2016YFC0502103, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 31670539, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41701110, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","We thank the Sichuan Forestry Inventory and Planning Institute for providing the data on vegetation map and roads, and are also grateful to the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RESDC) for providing data on human population density, land uses and gross domestic product.

Appreciable improvement in catalytic performance of this catalyst is of importance regarding its further applications, but investigations of the interaction between Ce and Cr species and the effects of Ce modification on the dispersion and distribution of the active Cr phases have seldom been concerned in the previous works. In this work, M/Al2O3 (M: Cr, Ce, and Ce-Cr) catalysts were synthesized and the Ce-modified catalyst exhibited enhanced activity. It was shown that modification of Ce on the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst decreased the amount of inactive isolated Cr(VI) sites. Meanwhile, the increased amount of oxygen vacancy was observed over the Ce-Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, which promoted the interaction between Ce and Cr species. The above results can be confirmed by the characterization results of X-ray diffraction, UV-vis, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which provide meaningful information for improving catalytic performance of the commercial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","57","Chromium compounds","Binary alloys - Catalyst activity - Cerium - Cerium alloys - Dehydrogenation - Propane - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Catalytic performance - Ce modifications - Commercial catalyst - Dehydrogenation of propanes - H2 temperature-programmed reduction - Modified catalysts - Non-oxidative - Propane dehydrogenation","547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Its chemical constituents are closely related to those of C. sinensis var. assamica, a widely cultivated tea plant. In this study, the α diversity and phylogeny of endophytic fungi in the branches of C. taliensis were explored for the first time. A total of 160 fungal strains were obtained and grouped into 42 species from 29 genera, which were identified based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis. Diversity analysis showed that the endophytic fungal community of the branches of C. taliensis had high species richness S (42), Margalef index D′ (8.0785), Shannon–Wiener index H′ (2.8494), Simpson diversity index DS (0.8891), PIE index (0.8947) and evenness Pielou index J (0.7623) but a low dominant index λ (0.1109). By contrast, that in the branches of C. taliensis had abundant species and high species evenness. Diaporthe tectonigena, Acrocalymma sp. and Colletotrichum magnisporum were the dominant endophytic fungi. The phylogenetic tree was established by maximum parsimony analysis, and the 11 orders observed for endophytic fungi belonging to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were grouped into 4 classes.

For the above problems, a novel tunnel rock burst prediction probability model is proposed based on actual rock burst cases analysis. Firstly, six quantitatively characteristic parameters, namely the maximum tangential stress, the uniaxial compressive strength, the uniaxial tensile strength, the stress coefficient, the rock brittleness coefficient and the elastic energy index were extracted from rock burst cases, and the probability distribution function and correlation of those parameters were determined. Secondly, the multi-dimensional joint probability distribution function of six characteristic parameters was constructed under the framework of Copula theory, and then the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) which was optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm served as the intelligent response surface model to reflect the nonlinear mapping relationship between six parameters and the tunnel rock burst prediction level. Subsequently, the Copula-LSSVM rock burst prediction probability model was established, and the Weibull distribution function of rock burst prediction grade was obtained with the application of the Monte Carlo simulation method. Lastly, six rock burst cases of the Jinping II Hydropower Station are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and analysis was done on the influence of parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty on the prediction results.

We also characterized the effects of daily rainfall, vapour pressure deficit, and photosynthetically active radiation on the daily SFD of individual trees. We found a large fluctuation in rainfall in the wet seasons of 2012 to 2015 (1,159 mm in 2012, 778 mm in 2014, and 727 mm in 2015).

Namely, reduced wet season rainfall reduced the total stand-level transpiration of teak at the study site.

Accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal pattern of urban greenspace is important to fully understand its ecosystem services provision. While numerous studies have investigated the spatial pattern of urban greenspace and its change, few studies have explored how the spatial pattern of urban greenspace differ in urban areas developed in different years. Here, we chose Shenzhen as the study area, compared the spatial pattern of urban greenspace in urban areas developed in different years. We found urban areas developed in more recent years tend to have higher percent cover of greenspace than older ones. The proportion of greenspace (55.62%) in the most recently developed urban areas (2015–2017) was more than three times greater than that (17.24%) developed in and before 1979. We also found significant variation in spatial configuration of greenspace. The size of the largest patch in more recently developed urban areas tend to increase. Additionally, more recently developed urban areas tend to have larger variations in patch size and more edges of greenspace. In addition to the general trend, we also found clear patterns of changes in certain time periods, which are likely results of the implementation of urban management and planning policies. For example, percent cover of greenspace in areas built after 2010 is significantly higher than that in many other years. The results of this study revealed how pattern of urban greenspace varied along with the process of urbanization, which can help us review the achievements of urban development and provide useful information for better urban planning and management. © 2019 The Authors","45","Ecosystems","Gradient methods - Urban growth","Developed age - Pattern of greenspace - Shenzhen - Urban areas - Urban expansion",,"Number: COBO1709281935 F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Number: 2017YFC0505801, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41601180, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The supports of the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0505801 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41601180 ), the Human Settlements and Environment Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (Grant No. COBO1709281935 F01 ), and the Shenzhen Environmental Monitoring Center (Grant No. SZCG2018161442 and SZCG2017158233 ) are gratefully acknowledged.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Its availability is closely related to calcium (Ca) in calcareous soils and sediments, but their relations are unclear. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes in P and Ca fractionation and distribution in a karst farmland-wetland ecosystem were investigated. The results showed that total P concentrations were 1.25–3.19 g kg−1, with higher concentrations in paddy soil than in sediment. Total Ca concentrations were 3.93–10.2 g kg−1, with higher Ca being accumulated in sediments than in soils. The P fractionations varied seasonally, with Ca-bound P being dominant. The moderately-stable Fe/Al-bound P showed temporal variation, while Ca was dominant in acid-soluble fraction, both probably playing an important role in controlling P availability. Correlation analysis showed seasonal relation between Ca and P distribution in soil/sediment. This study suggests that P migration from farmland to wetland may be a major source for P accumulation in sediments in a karst farmland-wetland system. © 2018","38","Soil pollution","Aquatic ecosystems - Availability - Calcium - Eutrophication - Farms - Phosphorus - Sediments - Soils - Wetlands","Acid-soluble fractions - Correlation analysis - Critical elements - Fraction - Karst - Spatial and temporal changes - Temporal variation - Wetland ecosystem","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control","Number: 31560237, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31560237 , 31560147, 51469030 , and 41867066 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The inhibition on biohydrogen by vanillin and syringaldehyde was much stronger than growth, which was different with other inhibitors.

The lag phase of biohydrogen production was significantly prolonged by 0.3 g/L p-coumaric acid (7.5 times higher than control). Metabolite analysis showed that the metabolic flux had been redirected by vanillin and syringaldehyde. The increased lactate production and decreased production of acetate and butyrate contributed to a lower biohydrogen production.

The community structure is a key structural law of complex networks, so the association of complex networks is accurately analyzed. Structure is a very important topic in the study of complex networks.This paper studies the problem of complex network community structure extraction, and proposes the DHNN algorithm. This algorithm shows that from the arbitrary initial value, after several iterations, it finally converges to an attractor or a limit loop of length 2, giving the energy of DHNN. The relationship between function and modularity function proves that the stable point of the network corresponds to a very large modular function Q value, and the example verification work is carried out. For the DHNN algorithm proposed in this paper, the simulation experiment is carried out on the actual network. The results show that the eigenvalue eigenvector algorithm of DHNN community structure extraction algorithm Newman has a large Q value. At the same time, the DHNN algorithm does not need to calculate the eigenvalue eigenvectors, and only needs a simple addition multiplication operation to extract the community structure in the network. Therefore, the proposed algorithm, especially the DHNN algorithm, has powerful computing power.

The original land use patterns changed significantly by the formation of the WLFZ, which possibly affected the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and local carbon cycle. However, little is known about the effects of land uses before dam construction on the SOC stocks in the WLFZ. To address this, we chose the Nuozhadu mega reservoir built in 2014 in the upper Mekong River basin as our study area. We established five sampling transects around the reservoir and sampled them in 2015. Each transect contained three vertical sampling lines representing three land-use types: natural forest, farmland, and rubber plantations. SOC stocks were determined in the WLFZ and in the infralittoral reference zone (IRZ), and the interactions among SOC, land uses, soil erosion, inundation, and other soil physicochemical properties were analyzed to establish the factors controlling SOC in the WLFZ. The average soil organic carbon density (SOCD) was not significantly different between the WLFZ and IRZ, but it differed significantly among the three types of land uses. The SOC stocks in natural forests of the WLFZ and IRZ were significantly greater than those in the other land use types. The SOCD decreased with increasing elevation in the natural forest and rubber plantation in the WLFZ, while no significant trend was found in farmland. These results indicated that the construction of a large dam in southwestern China may not lead to significant changes in regional SOC stocks, but it can result in the redistribution of SOC in the large-scale and high-dropout WLFZ. Land use before dam construction can affect the background concentrations of SOC, soil physicochemical properties, and soil erosion rate in the WLFZ, which controlled the redistribution of SOC. © 2019","69","Land use","Dams - Erosion - Forestry - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants - Organic carbon - Physicochemical properties - Reservoirs (water) - Rubber - Rubber plantations - Soils - Water levels","Background concentration - Hydropower base - Mekong river basins - Soil erosion - Soil organic carbon - Soil organic carbon densities - Soil physico-chemical properties - Water-level-fluctuation zones","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 441.1 Dams - 441.2 Reservoirs - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 818.1 Natural Rubber","Number: 41561063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41867029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers: 41867029 and 41561063).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For instance, an image-based intelligent technology, such as image classification of diseases, is widely used in daily life. However, the image in real life is mostly unlabeled, so the performance of many image-based intelligent models shows limitations. Therefore, how to use a large amount of unlabeled image data to build an efficient and high-quality model for better urban life has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised image feature extraction method that is referred to as a stacked multi-granularity convolution denoising auto-encoder (SMGCDAE). The algorithm is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), yet it introduces a multi-granularity kernel. This approach resolved issues with image unicity by extracting a diverse category of high-level features. In addition, the denoising auto-encoder ensures stability and improves the classification accuracy by extracting more robust features. The algorithm was assessed using three image benchmark datasets and a series of meningitis images, achieving higher average accuracy than other methods. These results suggest that the algorithm is capable of extracting more discriminative high-level features and thus offers superior performance compared with the existing methodologies. © 2013 IEEE.","64","Image processing","Convolution - Extraction - Feature extraction - Neural networks - Signal encoding - Unsupervised learning","Auto encoders - Benchmark datasets - Classification accuracy - Convolutional neural network - High-level features - Image feature extractions - Intelligent solutions - Intelligent technology","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations","","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61876166 and Grant 61663046",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although the ecological impacts of roads are now well recognised, there remains a lack of certainty regarding how roads in general and roads with different widths affect vital ecosystem services such as above-ground biomass (AGB) in tropics. Using a non-destructive sampling method, we investigated disturbance effects of roads on AGB and related attributes in Xishuangbanna, China. We surveyed woody plants in natural forests, rubber plantations, and tea plantations up to 100 m from the edge of three different road widths and estimated AGB using allometric equations at 10 m intervals. Two sample t-test results confirmed that natural forests stored more AGB than rubber and tea plantations, and less AGB at edges of wider road than at edges of narrower road. Linear mixed effects models revealed that land use, road width, and distance from edge significantly explained 68% (both fixed and random factors) variation in AGB. We observed two results that indicated wider roads altered more AGB than narrower road types in natural forests. First, AGB declined at road edges; second, the disturbance effects on AGB by wider road types went deeper than narrower roads did in natural forests. Our results suggest that both widening the existing roads and construction of new roads will degrade ecosystem productivity. We recommend that impacts assessments of roads on AGB should be considered and taken serious while planning and designing roads to avoid serious damages to many ecosystem services that AGB provides. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","58","Highway planning","Damage detection - Ecosystems - Forestry - Land use - Roads and streets - Rubber - Rubber plantations - Tropics","Anthropogenic disturbance - Ecosystem productivity - Ecosystem services - Edge effect - Linear mixed-effects model - Planning and designings - Road ecology - Tropical forest",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Cyclic loading tests on three specimens were conducted to analyze the mechanical properties and the energy dissipation of the new type of BRBs. The results indicate that the structure of BRBs is reasonable and all specimens exhibit a full hysteretic curve and stable energy dissipation performance. The ultimate ductility coefficients of specimens were greater than 15. The strain hardening coefficients were between 1.21 and 1.29. The equivalent damping ratios were between 0.442 and 0.465. The cumulative plastic deformations were more than 500 times the yield displacement. The fatigue loading was analyzed. All performance parameters were able to meet the requirements in JGJ 297-2013 'Technical specification for seismic energy dissipation of buildings', indicating excellent low-cycle fatigue behavior of the BRBs. © 2019, Engineering Mechanics Press.

In this study, phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignments revealed that characterized β-xylosidases of glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 39 were classified into the same subgroup with conserved amino acid residue positions participating in substrate recognition. Protein-ligand docking revealed that seven of these positions were probably essential to bind xylose-glucose, which is linked by a β-1,2-glycosidic bond. Amino acid residues in five of the seven positions are invariant, while those in two of the seven positions are variable with low frequency. Both the wild-type β-xylosidase rJB13GH39 and its mutants with mutation at the two positions exhibited β-1,2-xylosidase activity, as they hydrolyzed o-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside and transformed notoginsenosides R1 and R2 to ginsenosides Rg1 and Rh1, respectively. The results suggest that all of these characterized GH 39 β-xylosidases probably show β-1,2-xylosidase activity, which should be assigned an EC number with these β-xylosidases as representatives. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","29","Sugars","Amino acids - Hydrolases","Enzyme commissions - Glycoside hydrolase family 39 - Multiple sequence alignments - notoginsenosides - Phylogenetic analysis - Protein-ligand docking - Substrate recognition - Xylosidase","804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2017YFB0308401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2014 1782, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: YNHRSS 2018 73, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions of Anhui Province; Number: 201810681017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program; Number: 31660445, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015HB033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","*J.Z.: tel, +86 871 65920830; fax, +86 871 65920952; e-mail, junpeizhou@ynnu.edu.cn, junpeizhou@126.com\. *Z.H.: e-mail, huangzunxi@163.com.
