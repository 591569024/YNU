The data is sent to the Hamming window function IP core created under vivado HLS through the AXI bus. After the data is processed by Hamming window function, it is sent to ARM1 again through AXI bus. OCM acts as the shared memory for ARM0 and ARM1 communication. The Linux system runs on ARM0. The processed data is sent to the upper computer through ethernet through UDP protocol.

Firstly, a general colored community network model is proposed, where the isolated nodes can interact through different kinds of connections in different communities and the interactions between different pair of communities can also be different, and moreover, the nodes in different communities can have different state dimensions. Then, an adaptive aperiodically intermittent control strategy combined with pinning scheme is developed to realize cluster synchronization of such colored community network. By introducing a novel piecewise continuous auxiliary function, some globally exponential cluster synchronization criteria are rigorously derived according to Lyapunov stability theory and piecewise analysis approach. Based on the derived criteria, a guideline to illustrate which nodes in each community should be preferentially pinned is given. It is noted that the adaptive intermittent pinning control is aperiodic, in which both control width and control period are allowed to be variable. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results obtained. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","58","Adaptive control systems","Stability criteria - Synchronization","Cluster synchronization - Community networks - Intermittent controls - Nodes of different state dimensions - Pinning scheme","731.1 Control Systems - 961 Systems Science","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Core; Number: -, Acronym: JSU, Sponsor: Jiangsu University; Number: 11402100, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11572278, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11402100 and 11572278) and Young Core Teachers Training Project of Jiangsu University.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We propose a linearized and decoupled compact finite difference scheme for the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii system, which means that only three tri-diagonal systems of linear algebraic equations at each time step need to be solved by using Thomas algorithm. New types of mass functional, magnetization functional and energy functional are defined by using a recursive relation to prove that the new scheme preserves the total mass, energy and magnetization in the discrete sense. Besides the standard energy method, we introduce an induction argument as well as a lifting technique to establish the optimal error estimate of the numerical solution without imposing any constraints on the grid ratios. The convergence order of the new scheme is of O(h4+τ2) in the L2norm and H1norm, respectively, with time step τ and mesh size h. Our analysis method can be used to high dimensional cases and other linearized finite difference schemes for the two- or three-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger/Gross–Pitaevskii equations.

In this work, to catch the challenge, we propose an Integrated IoT service model for distributed sensors. By modeling sensors into information resources, a RESTful service model is applied to each sensor. By using IoT based service adapter, information resources are integrated into service center which is feasible be accessed by electrical power and wireless network.

As for the choosing of pricing benchmark, 'per kilometer investment unit' and 'per MW-km investment unit' are taken into consideration.

We propose a novel framework via convolutional network modeling, which directly learns a focused score map through source images. Further, the score map will be refined using some simple posttreatment. Finally, a high quality all-in focus image could be generated based on the score map and source images. The benefits of this work are three-fold: first, different from the most previous work which always adopt a manual feature extraction method to accomplish the fusion task, we leverage recent advances in convolutional network, which is a learning representation that can learn useful features automatically for various missions, to model the multi-focus image fusion task. Second, because of the scarcity of the label of nature focus-image, to train the model efficiently, we synthesize sufficient pairs of multi-focus image patches as the training set. Third, the trained model has high capacity that can distinguish which region is focused and which is not in the source images and therefore can produce an accurate score map for the fusion task. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only has a richer detail on the visual quality but also has a superior performance on the objective assessment, compared with those of recent several representative methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","15","Image fusion","Convolution - Image processing","All-in-focus image - Convolutional networks - Feature extraction methods - Learning representation - Multifocus image fusion - Multifocus images - Objective assessment - Synthesize","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This makes them excellent candidates for organic linkers in the construction of photochromic coordination polymers. Such a photochromic two-dimensional coordination polymer has been prepared using N,N′-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (DPMNI). In crystallization tubes, upon slow diffusion of an MeOH solution of cadmium perchlorate into a CHCl3solution of DPMNI, the complex poly[[bis[μ2-2,7-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)benzo[imn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetrone-κ2N:N′]bis(perchlorato-κO)cadmium(II)] chloroform tetrasolvate], {[Cd(C26H16N4O4)2(ClO4)2]·4CHCl3}n, (I), was obtained. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd2+cation, two DPMNI ligands, two coordinated ClO4-anions and four CHCl3solvent molecules. Each Cd2+cation is interconnected by four DPMNI linkers to generate a neutral two-dimensional naphthalenediimide coordination network with all the ClO4-anions above or below this plane. Strong interlaminar anion-π interactions between the coordinated ClO4-anions and the imide rings of an adjacent layer lead to a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Compound (I) exhibits reversible photochromic behaviour and photocontrolled tunable luminescence properties, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the DPMNI ligand. © 2018 International Union of Crystallography.","49","Cadmium compounds","Chlorine compounds - Crystal structure - Electron transitions - Free radical reactions - Inorganic compounds - Ligands - Luminescence - Naphthalene - Negative ions - Organic polymers - Photochromism - Positive ions","Coordination networks - Coordination Polymers - naphthalenediimide - Photo-induced electron transfer - Photochromic behaviour - Photochromic properties - Supramolecular structure - Tunable luminescences","741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017FD144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Funding for this research was provided by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (award No. 51764048); Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The current intensity versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of GaIn/n-c-Si/SiOx/n+-poly-Si/Al structures shows a linear Ohmic characteristic, while a non-Ohmic behavior is observed in the samples without the n+-poly-Si contact layer. Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM) images reveal some current spikes on the surface of the samples, which could be related to the transport through pinholes. The simulation results show that 1) a rectification characteristic is obtained when only the tunneling mechanism is included, 2) both the reverse saturation current and the forward current increase when a small amount of transport through pinholes is introduced, and 3) finally a linear Ohmic behavior is observed when the pinhole transport component reaches a certain level. Furthermore, the simulation for whole TOPCon solar cells provides some useful results. For very thin SiOx (x (> 1.2 nm) without the transport through pinholes, the TOPCon solar cell shows a poor fill factor (FF) with a high series resistance (Rs) because the tunneling does not provide a sufficient high transport channel for carrier transport, and the introduction of a small number of transports through pinholes improves the FF and reduces the Rs, hence improves the PCE. However, a high possibility for carrier going through pinholes reduces all of the performance parameters and degrades PCE for all the cases simulated. Therefore, an optimized pinhole density and size distribution is critical engineering for solar cell performance optimization. However, the establishment of an optimized method to precisely control the pinhole formation and characterization is still on the way. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","34","Passivation","Atomic force microscopy - Carrier transport - Cell engineering - Electric rectifiers - Electric resistance - Electron tunneling - Polycrystalline materials - Silicon compounds - Silicon oxides - Silicon solar cells - Solar cells","Conductive atomic force microscopy - High series resistances - Pinhole - Reverse-saturation currents - TOPCon - Transport - Tunneling probabilities - Ultrathin silicon oxide","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 539.2.1 Protection Methods - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 2016B10004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: LR16F040002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; Number: 2014B10026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YFB0700202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017A610020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo; Number: 2015D10021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: ZJUAMIS1704, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61574145, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51502315, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61704176, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors greatly acknowledge Zilei Wang for his help in the preparation of the artwork.

The Notch negative regulatory region (NRR) is critical for Notch signaling, and cleavage at the S2 site in the NRR ultimately leads to the activation of Notch signaling. To study the function of human NRR1, we expressed the recombinant human NRR1 (rhNRR1) domain in Escherichia coli. After purification, rhNRR1 was obtained with approximately 94% purity according to SDS-PAGE analysis. Furthermore, the polyclonal anti-rhNRR1 serum raised by immunizing mouse with the purified rhNRR1 was able to reduce the generation of active form of Notch1 intracellular domain in HeLa cells, which implied the raised antibody could recognize and bind the natural conformation of Notch1 NRR. Preparation of rhNRR1 by this way is convenient, time-consuming, and could be used to the preparation of anti-NRR1 therapeutic antibody. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","29","Antibodies","Escherichia coli - Immunization - Lanthanum compounds - Purification - Signal transduction","Intracellular domain - Low-phosphate induced expression - Multicellular organisms - Polyclonal antibody - Regulatory regions - SDS-PAGE analysis - Soluble expression - Therapeutic antibodies",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Two important hemp cultivars in China, Yunma 5 (YM5, fiber hemp) and Bamahuoma (BM, seed hemp), were germinated under the conditions with four kinds of salts (NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaHCO3) at 0–300 mM for seven days to test the seed germination responses to salt stress. The germination indexes decreased with the increase of salt concentration for each salt, especially in 300 mM Na2CO3, showing the most toxic effect on germination. However, a low concentration (50 mM) of neutral salt stimulated seed germination, showing a higher germination rate and longer radicles and hypocotyls than the control. The growth of radical and hypocotyl was more salt-sensitive than seed germination. Upon transfer to distilled water, the non-germinated seeds restored germination ability and the recovery percentage increased with the increase of salt concentration. YM5 showed stronger salt tolerance than BM, with higher threshold salinity of 150 mM NaCl and Na2SO4(100 mM NaCl and 50 mM Na2SO4for BM), and higher critical salinity of 150 mM Na2CO3and 250 mM NaHCO3(100 mM Na2CO3and 200 mM NaHCO3for BM) for germination rate.

Therefore, the herbal samples from different cultivated locations were evaluated with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) in terms of two chemical components, quercetin and erianin. In addition, two markers in leaf and stem also were used for support vector machine regression (SVMR) prediction. Samples from different harvesting periods were also classified using attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with random forest model. The results indicated that Pu'er and Menghai in Yunnan Province were suitable places for the herb cultivation and the leaf of the herb was also an exploitable resource just in light of the content of two components. What's more, combination of suitable spectra pretreatment and grid search method efficiently improved the prediction performance of the regression model. The results of random forest model indicated that important variables combination between stem and leaf was an effective tool to predict the harvesting time of the herb with 94.44% accuracy in calibration set and 97.92% classification correct rate in validation set.

Here, pilot-scale comparisons of three duckweed species (Spirodela polyrhiza K1, Lemna minor K2 and Landoltia punctata K3) in monoculture and polyculture were investigated. Results showed that the TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total phosphorus) in wastewater decreased from 6.0 and 0.56 mg L-1to below 0.5 and 0.1 mg L-1, respectively. Namely, the water quality improved to Grade II under the Chinese standard. The highest TN and TP removal efficiencies were found to be 99.1% and 90.8% in the polyculture. Besides, the starch content of S. polyrhiza K1, L. minor K2, L. punctata K3 and the polyculture reached 24.8%, 32.3%, 39.3% and 36.3%, respectively. Accordingly, their average starch accumulation rates were 1.65, 2.15, 3.11 and 2.72 g m-2d-1, respectively.

Wheat straw has been considered to be a promising biomass resource due to its low price and easy availability. However, most of the products obtained from wheat straw pyrolysis are usually of low quality. Hot soda extraction has the advantage of selective dissolution of lignin whilst retaining the carbohydrates. This can selectively convert biomass into high-quality desired products and suppress the formation of undesirable products. The aim of this study was to investigate the pyrolysis properties of wheat straw under different hot caustic pretreatment conditions. Results: Compared with the untreated straw, a greater amount of gas was released and fewer residues were retained in the extracted wheat straw, which was caused by an increase in porosity. When the NaOH loading was 14%, the average pore size of the extracted straw increased by 12% and the cumulative pore volume increased by 157% compared with the untreated straw. The extracted straw obtained from the 14% NaOH extraction was clearly selective for pyrolysis products. On one hand, many lignin pyrolysis products disappeared, and only four main lignin-unit-pyrolysis products were retained. On the other hand, polysaccharide pyrolysis products were enriched. Both propanone and furfural have outstanding peak intensities that could account for approximately 30% of the total pyrolysis products. However, with the excessive addition of NaOH (i.e. > 22% w/w) during pretreatment, the conversion of bio-gas products decreased. Thermogravimetric and lowerature nitrogen-adsorption analysis showed that the pore structure had been seriously destroyed, leading to the closing of the release paths of the bio-gas and thus increasing the re-polymerisation of small bio-gas molecules. Conclusions: After suitable extraction (14% NaOH loading extraction), a considerable amount (25%) of the soluble components dissolved out of the straw. This resulted in an increase in both pore size and volume. This condition appeared to be optimally selective for the release of value-added pyrolysis products such as furfural, ketones and lignin monomer units. However, excessive addition of alkali (22%) for extraction could change the original interior structure, resulting in a decrease in both pore size and volume. This interior structure modification limited the release of pyrolysis products, and greater carbonisation occurred. © 2018 The Author(s).","31","Pyrolysis","Acetone - Aldehydes - Biogas - Biomass - Carbonization - Extraction - Furfural - Gas adsorption - Gases - Lignin - Pore size - Sodium hydroxide - Straw - Temperature - Thermogravimetric analysis","Highly selective - Interior structure - Low temperatures - Nitrogen adsorption - Pretreatment conditions - Pyrolysis products - Selective dissolution - Wheat straws","641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes - 951 Materials Science","Number: 21276119, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (21276119).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Among various methods in the attempt to address this issue, the most attractive is the physically-based method, which does not require abundant, and often unobtainable, data. This paper develops a physically based K-factor method, in the form of a generalized Manning equation, for discharge estimations in ice-covered channels. The main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice-affected seasons by a K-factor adjustment of the stage-discharge relationship developed in the open-water seasons. The results of parameter estimation show that the K-factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio, which is parameterized by two exponents of the two-power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile. Experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula, and to compare its relative accuracy with the Sabaneev and Larsen formulae. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice-covered channels than these two widely-used formulae based on traditional two-layer hypothesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","44","Ice","Estimation - Forecasting - Ice problems - Stream flow","Discharge predictions - Ice-covered - Manning coefficient - Stage-discharge - Two-layer","407.2 Waterways - 921 Mathematics","Number: No.2013ZX07102-006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51439007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51109165, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this work was provided by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No.2013ZX07102-006), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51439007 ), and the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51109165 ).

In the SFMD-HE technology applied in this work, no excessive water was introduced into the system, which can reduce the loss of flavonols and proanthocyanidins in the subsequent extraction process, avoid the generation of hydrosol and improve essential oil yield. Furthermore, no drying was required, which can reduce the energy consumption. The homogenate process can reduce the production of dust and environmental pollution, meanwhile, avoid the degradation and deterioration of some thermo-sensitive compounds. Through comparison, solvent-free microwave distillation was selected as the optimal method, and the 71% ethanol volume fraction was chosen for homogenate extraction. Based on the yields of essential oil, flavonols and proanthocyanidins, the process parameters (microwave irradiation power and time for essential oil distillation; homogenate time, liquid-solid ratio, and ethanol volume fraction for flavonol and proanthocyanidin extraction) were optimized. Due to the combined effects of these parameters, greater advantages were found for the proposed process compared with traditional methods.

The distance parameter is set to retain multiple valuable global optimal solutions and partial optimal solutions, which can provide a multiple global optimal scheme at one time. Test results of eight typical multimodal functions show that the FTO algorithm has strong ability of global optimization and high accuracy. Cutting parameters are optimized using the FTO algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a plurality of optimal results of cutting parameters that meet the multi-constrain.

It is also a place where landscape has experienced dramatic evolution during the Holocene when both sea level and climate changed, such that it is an ideal place for studying human-environment interaction. This study investigated over 2000 sites of pre-history and Shang and Zhou Dynasties, with 655 of which being Neolithic ages, by using DEM and GIS methods. The results suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of Neolithic sites has largely been controlled by landscape evolution (particularly changes in coastal line), which ultimately governed by sea level changes. During early Holocene, Neolithic sites sparsely distributed in the intermountain basins of east Zhejiang Province, far from the influence of ocean. Over the period of 9–7 ka, the coastal plain (including the shelf) was largely submerged, only the feet of low hills to the south and southwest of the study area, and islands protruding the estuary, cradled limited number of settlements with characteristic “maritime components”. At about 7 ka, sea level rise decelerated prominently, while sediments supply in the drainage remained high value, the combination of which led to land formation and propagation. Vast space during this period facilitated the growth of settlements in both size and number. In the mean time, however, the coastal plain was vulnerable to extreme environmental events such as storms and flooding owning to its geomorphic nature, which exerted great influence on the rise and fall of Neolithic culture. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","68","Sea level","Landforms - Spatial distribution","Coastal plain - Geomorphic evolution - Neolithic - Sealevel change - Spatial and temporal distribution","471.1 Oceanography, General - 481.1 Geology - 921 Mathematics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The structures and energies of three doped systems indicate that the formation of Ge doped Aluminum is minimum and the structure is the most stable. The impurity formation of Ge is −2.4070 eV and the system will release maximum heat, while doping with Pb will absorb heat. What's more, compared with pure aluminum, the charge distributions of central aluminum, which directly surround the impurities, are transformed from square to triangle. And this phenomenon leads that there is no covalent bond between central aluminum along the [110] direction. The charge density differences illustrate the interaction between Al and M (M = Ge, Sn and Pb) is covalent bonding. The amount of accumulated electrons shows that the system of Al–Ge possesses the strongest covalent bonding, followed by Al–Sn and final by Al–Pb. So the stability of Al-M (M = Ge, Sn and Pb) is Al–Ge > Al–Sn > Al–Pb. Additionally, according to Mulliken population analysis, it has been found that due to the incorporation of impurities elements, there are stronger repulsive effects between AlI and the bonds between AlI and AlII is the most covalent. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","56","Iodine compounds","Aluminum - Aluminum compounds - Calculations - Electronic properties - Electronic structure - Germanium - Impurities - Tin","Charge density difference - Doped - First-principles calculation - Geometrical property - Impurities elements - Impurity formation energy - Mulliken population analysis - Ultra soft pseudo potential technology","541.1 Aluminum - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 51761023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No 51761023 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the temperature for this process is around 1173 K, and consumes a lot of energy. Additionally, during the process, a lot of H2S is yielded, which seriously affects the quality of syngas. Therefore, in order to save energy and improve the quality of syngas, this paper proposes a new oxygen carrier to lower the reaction temperature of the CLG to produce syngas while simultaneously capturing sulfur (S) from the gas product. Meanwhile, thermodynamic calculations and laboratory experiments have been used to investigate the characteristics of proposed Ni/PG material along with the mechanism of the process. The results showed that the Ni element existed in the form of small NiO crystals on the surface of PG while acting as the oxygen carrier, and possessed excellent reactivity and recyclability characteristics. Furthermore, the use of the material can reduce the reaction temperature of the CLG for syngas production and purify syngas through the chemical reaction: 3Ni+2H2S→Ni3S2+2H2. During the reduction process, the main reactions for syngas production consisted of solid-solid and gas-solid reactions, and therefore, the Shrinking Core Model (SCM) was the most probable mode of this process. Furthermore, the main chemical reaction for the regeneration of Ni/PG was a gas-solid reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","61","Temperature","Chemical reactions - Gasification - Gypsum - Lignite - Nickel oxide - Phosphate fertilizers - Synthesis gas - Thermodynamics","Chemical looping - Laboratory experiments - Phosphogypsum - Reaction temperature - S capture - Shrinking core model - Syn-gas - Thermodynamic calculations","482.2 Minerals - 524 Solid Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 21666016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this project was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21666016 ), which is greatly acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By extracting current and voltage impulse differences, we analyzed the principle. The results show that when the amplitude of the impulse wave is constant, the impulse grounding resistance will decrease with the decreasing of the wave front time or the increasing of the half-wave time. The experimental results of impulse grounding resistance under the action of negative polarity impulse are greater than those under positive polarity, and the difference is 10%. The controllability of the impulse wave generator is poor, and the absolute stability of the output waveform cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, the local differences in impulse waveform can change the response impulse waveform amplitude due to the soil spark discharge phenomenon. This can result in the difference resistance between the standard impulse voltage and current waveform control in impulse grounding. That is, when the amplitude is the same, the increase of impulse wave during the peak area can decrease the impulse grounding resistance. These results can provide references for solving the waveform problems in impulse grounding experiment. © 2018, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

By embedding the skeleton information into depth maps, the human body is partitioned to a set of motion parts, which could take account of the geometrical structure of human body and contribute to the recognition task in complex background. A local spatio-temporal scaled pyramid is applied to obtain compact local feature representation. The simplified Fisher vector encoding method is introduced to aggregate local coarse features into a discriminative representation with unified form.

In this paper, the method of obtaining the current fraction is improved, and the cable fault location is calculated by using the voltage and current on both ends of the DC cable to protect the low-voltage DC cable. The protection will not be affected by fault types, fault locations and fault impedance. The protection criterion is simple and reliable to clear faults, and the fault location can be obtained in the process of protection calculation. The action of the proposed protection will still be correct when the data of the different ends is not synchronized. The effectiveness of the protection method is verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulation.

Potato, as the fourth major crop, plays a vital role in alleviating food problem considering its great nutritive value, high yield and adaptability. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides (CFPs) are implicated in ensuring stable and high yields of potato. Therefore, CFPs were intensively used for boosting up the yield; however, the use intensity of CFPs exceeds the international recognized standard, resulting in negative impacts on environment quality, agri-ecosystem, land productivity and tuber production cost. Consequently, those obstacles mentioned above jeopardized the sustainability of potato industry. In order to solve the dilemma, this article focuses on the analysis of the major reasons for abuse of CFPs, and further identified that the excessive consumption could be attributed to high application intensity, low utilization efficiency and lack of scientific application methods. Furthermore, this article introduces the technological advances and future trends in chemical fertilizer and pesticide reductions (CFPR) of developed countries. Based on the successful CFPR experiences abroad, the article also provides some development strategies for Chinese potato CFPR. (1) Promote legislation curbing application rate of potato CFPs. Several research projects were initiated to investigate the scientific standard of application amount for CFPs. Once the scientific standards were set, they could be gradually legislated into agricultural laws to stipulate the use of CFPs nationwide. (2) Promote the innovation on high-efficient application technology and encourage the use of green alternatives to chemical controls. Efforts on scientific research and education should be strengthen to speed up the innovation/ application of advanced CFPR techniques. In addition, recognized reduction techniques abroad could be transferred to improve our application practices in pursuit of chemical contamination decreases. Some chemical fertilizers could be replaced by organic fertilizer, or they could be used in combination with organic fertilizers to enhance use efficiency. Chemical pesticides, to some extent, could be substituted by efficient, low toxicity/residue pesticides, and green prevention techniques could be employed to avoid pesticide abuse. (3) Promote the invention/improvement of intelligent agro-equipment with precision application capabilities. Unlike developed countries, the majority of Chinese potato production entities is still dispersible, small-scale, traditional family farms. Hence, modern fertilizer/pesticide machinery including deep fertilization and accurate spaying should be developed accordingly to meet specific needs of Chinese farmers. However, in the large-scale and intensive potato-growing area of north China, it is reasonable for the large potato enterprise and cooperatives to introduce advanced equipment and management system overseas. (4) Integration of multiple CR technologies to meet diverse regional needs. Combined with traditional reduction techniques such as soil testing, formulated fertilization, drip-fertigation and integrated pest-control, newly developed reduction technology could be integrated into regional 'Potato Chemical Fertilizer and Pesticide Reduction' technique systems according to the diverse ecological, climatic and cultivating factors. Through demonstration zones and potato-grower trainings, popularization of reduction techniques would benefit the potato-growing farmers and cooperatives, which would significantly reduce the use of CFPs in China. © 2018, Science Press.

The content of 15 mineral elements in the caps and stipes was detected, respectively. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was collected using the powder of fruit body. The original spectra were preprocessed by standard normal variable (SNV), second derivative (2D) algorithm et al.

In this research,the deformation properties and the influencing factors of shear band of soil-rock mixture during the shearing process were investigated with the servo motor controlled system of geotechnical experiment developed in-house(RSM-1000). The shear band deformation tests on soil-rock mixture were conducted considering the effects of different rock contents(0,30%,50%,70%),normal pressures(50,200,300,400 kPa) and rock sizes(L1,L2,L3) respectively. The deformation characteristics of shear band were monitored by putting the aluminum wires and dry ash into the hole inside the samples. The results show that when the rock content is less than 30%,rocks have little effect on the deformation of samples,and that the mechanical strengths of samples mainly depend on the sand. When the rock content reaches 50%,samples are transformed into a skeleton structure,rocks have obvious effects on deformations and the mechanical strengths of samples are affected by rocks and sand simultaneously. When the rock content reaches 70%,samples are transformed into the rock structure with empty space. Under the condition of high rock content and rock particles of large diameter,the rocks through the shear surface tend to extrude and roll during the shear process. The rocks around the shear surface are mainly affected by dilation,and present extrusion,particle breakage and redistribution. The shearing deformations of the samples are comprised of three distinct stages and can be depicted as the failure of thrust landslide with the deformation from back to front or compound landslide with the deformation from two slides to the middle. At the first stage,the cracks were generated on the top of the backward slope under the effect of active soil pressure,which leads to the sink,compaction and instability of the top of backward slope. Then,the front edge of the slope begins to deform and move forward. Finally,the shearing dislocation of the soil-rock mass and the progressive expansion failure of the sliding face result in the cut-through of shearing plane and the whole destruction of the slope. © 2018, Science Press.

The potential functions and inheritance patterns of lncRNAs, as well as the epigenetic regulation of lncRNA itself, remain largely uncharacterized in plant seeds, especially in the persistent endosperm of the dicotyledons. In this study, we investigated diverse RNA-seq data and catalogued 5356 lncRNAs in castor bean seeds. A small fraction of lncRNAs were transcribed from the same direction as the promoters of protein-coding genes (PCgenes) and exhibited strongly coordinated expression with the nearby PCgene. Co-expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed these lncRNAs to be involved in differential transcription networks between the embryo and endosperm in the early developing seed. Genomic DNA methylation analyses revealed that the expression level of lncRNAs was tightly linked to DNA methylation and that endosperm hypomethylation could promote the expression of linked lncRNAs. Intriguingly, upon hybridization, most lncRNAs with divergent genome sequences between two parents could be reconciled and were expressed according to their parental genome contribution; however, some deviation in the expression of allelic lncRNAs was observed and found to be partially dependent on parental effects. In triploid endosperm, the expression of most lncRNAs was not dosage sensitive, as only 20 lncRNAs had balanced dosage. Our findings not only demonstrate that lncRNAs play potential roles in regulating the development of castor bean endosperm and embryo, but also provide novel insights into the parental effects, allelic expression and epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs in dicotyledonous seeds. © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","62","Seed","Alkylation - Codes (symbols) - DNA - Methylation - Network coding - Nucleic acids - Transcription","Allelic expression - Castor beans - Co-expression networks - DNA Methylation - Endosperm development - Genomic imprinting - Inheritance pattern - Non-coding RNAs",,"Number: 2015BAD15B02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB060, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31661143002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31701123, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31771839, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank Dr Fei Li for helping with dissecting castor seeds and determining the seed developmental stages.

All hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised/-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. These pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. Factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. Non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. The relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. For the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","156","Aerosols","Health care - Hospitals - Viruses","Aerosol transmission - Biological characteristic - Environmental stress - Medical procedures - Nosocomial infection - Prevention and controls - Temperature and humidities - Vulnerable groups","461.7 Health Care - 461.9 Biology - 462.2 Hospitals, Equipment and Supplies","Number: 2016A050503047, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province; Number: 81490534, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014Y2-00031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project; ","This study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81490534 ), Science research project of the Guangdong Province (Grant no. 2016A050503047 ), Municipal Science and Technology Bureau Foundation of Guangzhou (Grant no. 2014Y2-00031 ).

Many algorithms have been proposed for the estimation of fingerprints' OF but it is hard to solve the dilemma of correcting spurious ridge structure and avoiding singularity location deviation, especially for poor images. So far, the following drawbacks still need to be solved for OF construction methods for practical application: (1) How to adaptively choose block scales to resolve the contradiction between accuracy and anti-noise, since small scale is beneficial to accuracy but is sensitive to noise, while large scale is more resistant to noise, but the accuracy is deteriorated. (2) How to construct the genuine OF in the areas close-by singular points and to evade singularity location deviation? Current block based methods give spurious OF estimates in the area near singular points because these areas have large curvature thus the detected singular points deviate from the genuine localizations. When these singular points are used as the anchor for referencing minutiae, it makes the average error of matching or recognition even larger. Therefore, it is essentials to construct the genuine OF in the areas close-by singular points and to evade singularity deviation. Methods: To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a novel method, combining a weighted multi-scale composite window (WMCM) with a hierarchical smoothing strategy has been proposed for the computation of fingerprint OF. This method mainly contains two procedures: the approximate OF estimation and the hierarchical OF smoothing. In the first procedure, a series of OFs are established under multiple scales of composite windows by using a gradient based method then a coarse OF is estimated using the weight of each scale determined by a squared gradient consistency. In the second procedure, the OF is first quantized into a two-digitized orientation zone and a two-orientation-zone filtering strategy is adapted to the OF blocks based on a filtering mask obtained after eliminating the isolated blocks. In the end a similar three-digitized orientation zone is performed to obtain an accurate and smooth OF. To validate the performance, the proposed method has been applied to OF computation using the FVC2004 databases and three experiments are designed. Experiment 1 aims to validate whether the weighted multi-scale composite window can balance the dilemma of accuracy and robustness more effectively than the previous works do. Experiment 2 is designed to examine whether the hierarchical smoothing method can correct the spurious ridge flow and preserve the genuine localization of singular points. The purpose of experiment 3 is to test the performance of the proposed method on OF reconstruction in low quality fingerprint images. The fingerprint databases FVC 2004 DB1-DB4 are employed in this study. Results: The results of experiment I shows that the proposed method is capable to extract the information of OF reliably and it is more robust against singularity localization deviation in comparison with the other three gradient based methods. The results of experiment II indicates that the proposed smoothing method can balance the contradiction in correcting spurious ridge structures and preserving genuine singularity localization. The results of experiment III illustrates that our approach combing WMCW with the hierarchical smoothing method is capable to extract the information of OF ridge reliably and it is more robust against singularity deviation in comparison with the other three gradient based methods. In a word, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can correct spurious ridge structure and meanwhile avoid singularity deviation compared with the previous works. Conclusions: A novel gradient based algorithm has been proposed which is more reliable for the estimation of the ridge information for fingerprint OF and is more accurate in preserving the singularity localization. Compared with the previously proposed gradient based methods, the advantages of the proposed RBSF lie in three aspects. Firstly a weighted multi-scale composite window is put forward to replace the single window used by conventional gradient based methods and to adaptively choose the scales of the blocks. Secondly, a hierarchical smoothing strategy is proposed to enhance the OF by using the two-orientation-zone filtering and the three-orientation-zone filtering, aiming to correct the spurious ridges and preserving the genuine location of singular points.

Parallel MRI reconstruction accelerates imaging speed with keeping quality of image content. An infinite impulse response (IIR) model has been proposed to improve the finite impulse response (FIR) model, which is applied in generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) image reconstruction method. Recursive terms of IIR GRAPPA are able to improve conventional GRAPPA reconstruction quality. However it has the limitation that outliers and noise lead to poor estimation in the recursive coefficients. On the other hand, auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) is one of the most common models in time series analysis. Time series analysis is using the system time series data obtained by the curve fitting and parameter estimation to establish the mathematical model and theoretical methods. We propose a novel scheme using nonlinear ARMA (NLARMA) model to address the noise and outlier problems in IIR GRAPPA reconstruction. The proposed method extends the linear MA model which has been applied in conventional GRAPPA by incorporating both recursive and nonlinear terms. The results of experimental phantom and in vivo brain datasets illustrate the proposed method can decrease noise and aliasing artifacts comparing with conventional GRAPPA and IIR GRAPPA reconstruction. © 2018 IEEE.","27","Image reconstruction","Communication channels (information theory) - Curve fitting - Estimation - Harmonic analysis - IIR filters - Image enhancement - Impulse response - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical image processing - Medical imaging - Robotics - Statistics - Time series analysis","Autoregressive moving average - Finite impulse responses (FIR) - Generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions - Image reconstruction methods - Infinite impulse response - MRI reconstruction - Reconstruction quality - Theoretical methods","703.2 Electric Filters - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 731.5 Robotics - 746 Imaging Techniques - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: -, Acronym: UH, Sponsor: University of Houston; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 81729003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61563055, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","*Corresponding author ： Haifeng Wang, email: hf.wang1@siat.ac.cn.

One approach to resolve these issues is to draw support from the sedimentary record in the surrounding basins. A volcaniclastic sequence, which divides into Lower and Upper Members, was identified in the southwestern Tarim Basin. The Lower Member was transported by dilute streamflows, which likely flowed during or soon after eruptions, while the Upper Member was formed by a syneruptive volcanic debris flow. Chronological, petrologic, and geochemical data consistently indicate that the sequence was derived from the Central Pamir at ~11 Ma. The ~11 Ma emplacement of the volcaniclastic sequence provides unique constraints for the evolution of the Tashkorgan-Yarkand River and the Pamir salient. Provenance data indicate a multistage evolutionary history of the Tashkorgan-Yarkand River. The paleo-Tashkorgan River was initially formed in the piedmont of the Pamir marginal range before ~15 Ma. This river cut back into the Tashkorgan region at ~15 Ma, after which it has eroded the Central Pamir by ~11 Ma. The N-S trending upper reaches of the Tashkorgan River and the Yarkand River were established after ~11 Ma. The emplacement of the volcanic debris flow, together with regional deformation evidence, indicates limited strike-slip motion between Pamir and the Tarim at least since ~11 Ma, which refutes hundreds of kilometers offset between the Pamir and the Tarim after this time and supports an earlier indention of the Pamir salient. ©2018.

Oxygen is not provided by the usual way but by the cavitation of ultrasound, and the effect of ultrasonic enhanced leaching is more obvious than oxygen enhanced leaching effect. We are more authoritative by combining some valuable literature after conducting systematic experiments. The process mechanism was analyzed by fire assaying, XRD, XRF, SEM and EDS. The optimal conditions were found out through single factor experiments: stirring rate of 300 rpm, thiosulfate concentration of 75 g/L, leaching temperature of 303 K, PH of 5, leaching time of 2 h and the ultrasound power of 100 W.

In this paper, silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and silicon inverted pyramid arrays (SiIPs) were introduced on surface of Gr-Si solar cell through silver and copper-catalyzed chemical etching, respectively. The effects of SiNWs and SiIPs on carrier lifetime, optical properties and efficiency of Gr-SiNWs and Gr-SiIPs solar cells were systematically analyzed. The results show that the inverted pyramid arrays have more excellent ability for balancing antireflectance loss and surface area enlargement.

The research found that the relationship between droplets position and levitation forces was linear. As EML system was a multi-induction, the levitating forces generation was affected by the properties of droplet, quality and size. The electromagnetic properties of the droplets were mainly the reasons for the levitation force to change from heating process before melting.

Previous methods have accomplished the fusion task in spatial or transform domains. However, fusion rules are always a problem in most methods. In this letter, from the aspect of focus region detection, we propose a novel multifocus image fusion method based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) learned from synthesized multifocus images. The primary novelty of this method is that the pixel-wise focus regions are detected through a learning FCN, and the entire image, not just the image patches, are exploited to train the FCN. First, we synthesize 4500 pairs of multifocus images by repeatedly using a gaussian filter for each image from PASCAL VOC 2012, to train the FCN. After that, a pair of source images is fed into the trained FCN, and two score maps indicating the focus property are generated. Next, an inversed score map is averaged with another score map to produce an aggregative score map, which take full advantage of focus probabilities in two score maps. We implement the fully connected conditional random field (CRF) on the aggregative score map to accomplish and refine a binary decision map for the fusion task. Finally, we exploit the weighted strategy based on the refined decision map to produce the fused image. To demonstrate the performance of the proposedmethod, we compare its fused results with several start-of-the-art methods not only on a gray data set but also on a color data set. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior fusion performance in both human visual quality and objective assessment. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","58","Image fusion","Convolution - Image processing - Lenses - Random processes","All-in-focus image - Conditional random field - Convolutional networks - Efficient technology - Fusion performance - Multifocus image fusion - Multifocus images - Objective assessment","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: 171740, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their detailed review, valuable comments, and constructive suggestions.

Failure process of rock specimens was numerically studied by RFPA2D. Formation mechanism of tensile cracks and the effect of different flaw inclinations on the compression strength were explained by constructing an overhanging beam and structural plane mechanical model. Box-counting dimension method was introduced to quantify new cracks geometric distribution of physical and numerical model specimens after failure, and its correlation with fracture characteristics was investigated. Satisfactory agreement between numerical and test results indicate that the failure modes in the specimen can be classified into two modes, namely cutting through the flaw(mode I) and sliding along the flaw(mode II). The rock bridge near the pre-hole is considered as an overhanging beam model, and the generation of tensile cracks around the hole appears to be produced by the maximum bending moment acting at the non-symmetrical part of the overhanging beam. The compression strength of the specimens is weakened by pre-flaws, which can be explained by the structural plane mechanical model. With increasing the flaw inclination, the compression strength of the specimens decreases first and then increases, while the weakening factor shows a crosscurrent. The fractal dimension of new cracks geometric distribution of rock samples after failure is closely related to fracture characteristics. Compared with mode II, the specimen failing in mode I has a greater compression strength, leading to a higher fractal dimension. The results of data fitting show a positive correlation between the compression strength and the fractal dimension. © 2018, Science Press.

Experimental results show that SCW treatment can increase the specific surface area and pore volume of AC. Scanning electron microscopy proves that the AC surface undergoes severe corrosion, resulting in the exposure of highly porous structures. In addition, the point-of-zero charge of AC increases after SCW treatment without the addition of HCl, H2SO4, and H2O2. This result is confirmed by the presence of C≡C and −OH functional moieties, as established through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Temperature programmed desorption profiles suggest that the decomposition of AC in the SCW treatment produces pyrone and anhydride functional groups. According to the above results, SCW treatment increases the adsorption capacities of AC. In SCW catalytic processes, therefore, active components removed from the surface of AC-supported catalysts are directly involved in reactions that enhance the catalytic activity. © 2018 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering","45","Activated carbon treatment","Activated carbon - Catalyst activity - Chemical properties - Chlorine compounds - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Physical properties - Scanning electron microscopy - Temperature programmed desorption","Active components - Adsorption capacities - Catalytic process - Functional moieties - Physicochemical property - Point of zero charge - Porous structures - Supercritical water",,"Number: 210202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Changjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Education; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 21277064, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21277064), the Key Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education (210202), and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The measurements of the color indices, B-V, V-R, and V-I allow the classification of 92 NEAs into seven taxonomic types. Of these samples, 39 of them are new classifications. The fractional abundances of these taxonomic complexes are: A ∼3%, C∼6.5%, D∼8%, Q∼26%, S∼37%, V∼6.5%, and X∼13%. This result is similar to that of Thomas et al. (2011) even though the populations of the D- and X-complex with low albedos are under-represented. The ratio of the C-cluster to the total population of S + C clusters are 0.22 ± 0.06 for H ≤ 17.0 and 0.31 ± 0.06 for H > 17.0, indicating a slightly higher fraction of dark-object population with sizes smaller than 1 km. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","114","C (programming language)","Asteroids - Photometry - Surveys - Taxonomies","Color index - Low albedo - Measurements of - Near-earth asteroids - Object population - Taxonomic identifications - Under-represented","657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 903 Information Science - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: 0426, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Development Fund; Number: MOST 104-2119-M-008-024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Central University; ","This work was mainly supported by the Project 017/2014/A1 of Macau Science and Technology Development Fund: MSAR No. 0426 as well as the Lulin Observatory which is operated by Institute of Astronomy , National Central University, Taiwan , under MOST grant: MOST 104-2119-M-008-024 .
