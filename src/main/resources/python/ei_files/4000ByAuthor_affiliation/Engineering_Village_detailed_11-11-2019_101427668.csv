Firstly, a group-consensus control protocol via pining scheme under fixed topology is proposed. Then the corresponding sufficient conditions to guarantee groupconsensus are deduced by employing graph theory and Lyapunov stability approach. What’s more, based on pinning scheme, the agents in every group can reach their own group’s reference states. Secondly, the group-consensus for heterogeneous multiagent systems with switching topologies is studied, where an equivalent system of the original multiagent system is obtained by model transformation. Then, the corresponding sufficient conditions to guarantee group-consensus are obtained based on the corresponding graph theory and Lyapunov stability approach.

The effects of different NiO content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of AgSnO2NiO composites were studied. The phase structure and surface morphology of the prepared AgSnO2NiO materials were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Metallographic Microscopy (MM). The results showed that the AgSnO2NiO composites with different NiO content can be obtained by the process of preoxidation of AgSn alloy powder and internal oxidation of ingot containing Ni. The agglomeration phenomenon of Ni in the silver matrix was serious, which led to the agglomeration of in-situ generated NiO particles after internal oxidation. After the multi-pass drawing, the SnO2 particles dispersedly distributed in the AgSnO2NiO composites and the NiO particles gradually dispersed from the agglomerated state of the sintered ingot billet. The hardness of the prepared AgSnO2NiO composites increased slightly with the increase of NiO content. The mechanical properties test showed that the introduction of NiO particles signifcantly improved the tensile strength and elongation of AgSnO2 materials to a certain degree. Adding proper amount of NiO is benefcial to improve the overall performance of AgSnO2 materials. © 2019 X.

In general, the enzymatic activity related to the phosphorous, carbon and nitrogen cycles were more developed in litter than in soil surface, while the sulphur enzymatic activity was not significantly different between the two analyzed systems. The higher dehydrogenase content measured in the litter may be an index of a higher extracellular microbial activity, compared to soil. A noticeable effect of forest age and structure on the majority of analyzed elements was detected, with nutrients and metals tending to accumulate in soil rather in the litter. Moreover, the contents of P and some metals and sulphur enzymatic activity in the litter are influenced by forest age and associated forest structure.

We collected 120 professional and amateur transit light curves of the targets of interest, observed with a range of telescopes of 0.3 m-2.2 m, and analyzed them along with the timing information of the planets discovery papers. In the case of WASP-117b, we measured a timing deviation compared to the known ephemeris of about 3.5 h, and for HAT-P-29b and HAT-P-31b the deviation amounted to about 2 h and more. For all targets, the new ephemeris predicts transit timings with uncertainties of less than 6 min in the year 2018 and less than 13 min until 2025.

Two IDT-based HTMs, one with 3,6-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK1) and another with 2,7-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK2), show different performances in PSCs. The PSC device based on YK1 displays a very impressive PCE of 20.13% under AM1.5G solar illumination, which is much higher than those of the devices based on YK2 (17.35%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (19.01%) under the same working conditions. This is mainly because YK1 has more effective intermolecular π-π stacking, a lower-lying HOMO level and higher hole-mobility than YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the YK1-based PSC exhibits excellent long-term stability retaining 94% of the initial PCE value after a 600 h lifetime without encapsulation owing to its better film morphology and hydrophobicity. These findings would shed light on the crucial importance of molecular engineering and allow its extension into general principles for the design of new HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","59","Solar cells","Display devices - Hole mobility - Perovskite - Perovskite solar cells - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Cell performance - Donor groups - Film morphology - Hole transport materials - Long term stability - Molecular engineering - Pi-stacking - Solar illumination","482.2 Minerals - 702.3 Solar Cells - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This contribution presents petrological, geochronological, whole rock geochemical, and Rare Earth Elements (REE) geochemistry of zircons of gabbro and diorite dykes associated with the Yinachang Fe-Cu-Au-U-REE deposit, aiming to constrain the age of the mineralisation and help refine our understanding of the tectonic setting of the region. Zircons from diorite have a Palaeoproterozoic U-Pb age of 2014 ± 30 Ma, and zircons from the gabbro could not be dated because they are metamict, having a high concentration of uranium. The ca. 2014 Ma age of the zircons in the diorite indicates that the southwestern part of the Yangtze Block is partly synchronous with the Columbia Supercontinent. Geochemically, the diorite and gabbro are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs) such as Rb and U, and depleted in high-field-strength elements (HFSEs) such as Nb, P, Ti, Ba, and Sr. The diorite is enriched in light REEs (LREEs) and has a slight to negligible Eu anomaly, which are characteristic of ocean-island basalts containing mantle-derived high potassic calc-alkaline rocks. In contrast, the gabbro is weakly enriched in LREEs and has a slightly negative Eu anomaly similar to those of potassic calc-alkaline enriched mid-ocean-ridge basalt. The average combined REE content of zircons from the gabbro is 19401 ppm and is significantly higher than that of the zircons from the diorite averaging 1020 ppm. This indicates that the gabbro is closely related with the REE mineralisation at the deposit. The geochemistry of the diorite indicates that it formed at the continental margin of a volcanic-arc. It also indicates that the magmatic rocks in the region have a possible mantle plume origin contaminated by crustal material and located at a transitional zone between a rift and an ocean-continent tectonic setting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","94","Gold deposits","Analytical geochemistry - Basalt - Binary alloys - Deposits - Europium - Exploratory geochemistry - Geochronology - Geodynamics - Lead alloys - Mineralogy - Rare earths - Silicate minerals - Tectonics - Trace elements - Zircon","Kangdian region - LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating - Supercontinents - Trace element analysis - Yangtze block","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482 Mineralogy - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2652017266, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: 201706400056, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: B07011, Acronym: SAFEA, Sponsor: State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs; Number: -, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: -, Acronym: UWA, Sponsor: University of Western Australia; ","This research was financially supported by the Major Basic Research Program of People's Republic of China ( 2014CB440903 ), by China Scholarship Council ( 201706400056 ), by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , China University of Geosciences (Beijing) (Grant No. 2652017266 ), by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, China (Grant No. B07011 ), and by the MOST Special Fund from the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences.

Experimental results show that all the samples exhibit n-type conductivity. The order of magnitude for carrier concentration is 1019, which is one order of magnitude higher than that in pure n-type PbTe sample (2.56 × 1018 cm−3). The highest power factor reaches 2.07 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2 at 420 K for the sample with x = 1.5, which is an approximately 30% enhancement compared with the polycrystalline sample (1.59 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2). In a theoretical study on the PbTe system, Te vacancy (VTe) is preferentially formed under the Pb-rich condition. To further understand the effect of VTe on the electrical performance of PbTe thermoelectric material, the electronic structures of PbTe with VTe are determined by first principle calculations. Theoretical calculations reveal that VTe can modify the electronic density of states by introducing resonant level, which can increase the number of carrier pockets. Consequently, carrier concentration has increased remarkably. In this study, a Pb-flux method for synthetizing single crystalline PbTe thermoelectric material is convenient and low cost, and it has potential for mass production in commercial applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","54","Vanadium compounds","Carrier concentration - Costs - Crystalline materials - Electronic density of states - Electronic structure - IV-VI semiconductors - Lead compounds - Modulation - Thermoelectric equipment","Carrier modulation - First principles - Pb flux - PbTe - Thermo-Electric materials","615.4 Thermoelectric Energy - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: -, Acronym: WUT, Sponsor: Wuhan University of Technology; Number: 51262032, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 61864012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61864012 and 51262032 ) and Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Yunnan Province .

First, the incident wave (IW) and reflected wave (RW) at a certain position over a common carotid artery (CCA) are estimated. Then, the propagating pulse waves (PWs) along the CCA are modelled with the synthesizations of the estimated IWs and RWs, whose occurrences are delayed in opposite sequences according to a preset PWV. In ultrasound simulation, a geometric model of a CCA is built, and the dynamic scatterer models are constructed by moving the scatterer positions according to the synthesized PWs. The RF signals are generated using Field II. To characterize the PW propagations of different arterial stiffnesses consistent with clinical ones in the model, 30 healthy subjects from young, middle-aged, and elderly groups are recruited for extractions of IWs and RWs. To quantitatively verify the effectiveness of the simulation model, the normalized root-mean-squared errors (NRMSEs) are used to compare the estimated and preset PWs, time delays (TDs), and PWVs. Results show that for the three age groups, the estimated PWs, TDs, and PWVs conform to the preset ones with the mean NRMSEs of 0.92%, 18.47%, and 8.55%, respectively. Moreover, the model can characterize the effect of the wave reflection on the local PW propagation as its clinical manifestation. Therefore, the proposed model can be effective as a data source for the validation of TT-based local PWV estimation algorithms, particularly the effects of RWs on the estimation performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","44","Verification","Acoustic wave velocity - Crack propagation - Mean square error - Ultrasonics - Wave propagation","Common carotid artery - Pulse wave propagation - Pulse wave velocity - Reflected waves - Ultrasound simulation","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work ‘Ultrasound simulation model incorporating incident and reflected wave propagations along a common carotid artery’ is supported by the Grants ( 81771928 and 61561049 ) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China , and University Key Lab of Electronic Information Processing of High Altitude Medicine, Yunnan Province .

However, p-xylene was oxidized rarely to other oxygen-containing derivatives. On the other hand, current methods for synthesis of 4-hydroxymethylenzoic acid suffer from multistep reactions, long reaction time, high temperature, high pressure, and lower selectivity. In this work, p-xylene was directly oxidized into 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid using Cu-MOF as the catalyst, acetonitrile as the solvent, and 30% H2O2 as the oxidant under mild conditions. Very high selectivity (99.2%) of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and good substrate conversion (85.5%) of p-xylene were achieved at 30 °C for 5 h. Fast hot catalyst filtration experiments proved that Cu-MOF acted as a heterogeneous catalyst. It can be reused three times without losing its activity. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid and the conversion of p-xylene were 97.6% and 84.8% even though the experiment was amplified 15-folds. The efficiency of H2O2 was also up to 92.0%. The reaction mechanism was proposed combined with the analysis of XRD, FT-IR and XPS. All data displayed that Cu-MOF shows great potential as a catalyst for highly selective oxidation of stable C–H to high value-added compounds containing two diverse C–O bands under mild conditions.

The characterization was actualized on the synthesized nanocomposite using XRD, Raman, TG-DSC, UV–vis-DRS, PL, XPS, SEM, TEM and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. An efficient and stable photocatalytic activity was exhibited by the synergistic ZnO/PNAI nanocomposites on the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to benign Cr(III) in comparison with the pristine ZnO and other semiconductor/PANI materials reported. The influence of parameters such as solution pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration and the addition of organic sacrifices on the Cr(VI) removal efficiency was investigated. It was found that the Cr(VI) removal was strongly pH-dependent and the optimum pH range was 4–7 for ZnO/PANI composite catalyst. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic examination showed that the surface photoreaction was the rate-determining step to compare the adsorption equilibrium. The organic additives such as EDTA and citric acid can promote the photocatalytic efficiency and the solution of EDTA/HCl can well restore the photoreduction ability of ZnO/PANI catalyst.

With 740 W microwave power, the mixture can be heated and decomposed to gather and form the large diameter spherical particles of smelting nickel–manganese alloy. The average sizes of the particle were mainly 0.25 mm and 0.32 mm in diameter, accounted for 40.5% or 26.1% (wt%), respectively. The sizes of the particles enlarged with the increase of microwave powers. The reaction mechanisms have been put forward, and the processes can be divided into five steps: the electric spark reaction, the first reaction, the secondary reaction, and granulation. The critical point of the first reaction and the secondary reaction was 560°C and 1870°C, respectively. It was found that the mid-heating rates were higher than the post-heating rates; moreover, the late stage was the cooling process.

A nonperturbative approach is used to describe the electron-photon interaction by including the radiation field in an exact way via a laser-dressed interaction potential. Through a variational approach we evaluate the donor binding energy. We find that the interaction strength of the laser-dressed Coulomb potential in the z direction cannot only be enhanced but also weakened by the radiation field, while that in the x-y plane is only weakened. In this way, the binding energy of the states with odd z parity, like 2pz, can be decreased or increased with respect to its static binding energy by the radiation field, while that of the other states can be only decreased. Furthermore, all binding energies become insensitive to the magnetic field if the radiation field is strong. The magnetopolaron effect on these energies is studied within second-order time-dependent perturbation theory. In the nonresonant region, a laser-modulated magnetopolaron correction, including the effect of single-photon processes, is observed. In the resonant region, a laser-modulated magnetopolaron effect, accompanied by the emission and absorption of a single photon, is found. Moreover, the 1s→2p+ transition, accompanied by the emission of a single photon, is tuned by the radiation field into resonance with the longitudinal-optical phonon branch. This is electrically analogous to the magnetopolaron effect, and therefore we name it the dynamical magnetopolaron effect.

However, the relationship between fine tree roots (including absorptive roots and fine transport roots) and forest biomass or fine understory vegetation roots (understory roots) remains poorly understood, which was the main objective of this study. We selected 20 plots in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation forests of the similar ages (23 years old on average) in different areas with various levels of forest biomass in subtropical China to assess the above-mentioned relationship. Forest biomass was used as a proxy for soil condition. We found that all fine root biomass of trees and understory vegetation were significantly and negatively correlated with forest biomass. To our surprise, both total Chinese fir fine root biomass (absorptive roots and fine transport roots) and fine transport root biomass showed significant and positive correlations with understory root biomass. These results clearly demonstrate that fine tree root biomass is significantly promoted and increased due to competition from understory vegetation where forest biomass is low. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","51","Biomass","Competition - Forestry - Tropics - Vegetation","Absorptive roots - Fine transport roots - Forest biomass - Tree root - Understory vegetation","443 Meteorology - 911.2 Industrial Economics","Number: GJJ14753, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20161BBH80050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology; Number: -, Acronym: IGSNRR, CAS, Sponsor: Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Science; Number: -, Acronym: AAU, Sponsor: Anhui Agricultural University; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CAF, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Forestry; Number: 20162BCB22021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31570444, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank M.

The results showed that the catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF) with 530 g/m3 catalysts loading, name as CDPF1, has little effect on the power and economy performances of the engine under external characteristic conditions. At 3 000 r/min, the volume fraction of NO2 is 81×10-6 at front end of CDPF1, while it is increased by 33×10-6 at rear end of that. This indicates that with the action of Pt and Pd bimetallic catalysts, the binding rate of NO to exhaust O2 is higher than the rate of active oxygen dissociated from NO2 binding to the soot active sites. Adequate NO2 content promotes regeneration efficient of soot in the CDPF, therefore the maximum exhaust pressure difference of CDPF1 was 8.8 kPa which lower than that of DPF. On the basis of external characteristic tests, the active regeneration tests of fuel injection combustion was further carried out. The first part of the regeneration tests were carried on the combustion test bench, the combustion temperatures were controlled by dosing control unit (DCU) to be 550, 600 and 630 , respectively. In order to prevent the peak temperature and thermal stress in the carrier from being too high during regeneration, secondary gas supply was carried out after fuel injection. Based on the principle that the amount of the secondary gas supply matches with displacement of the test engine, 4 different secondary gas supply schemes were adopted. The experimental results showed that when the regeneration temperature was 630 , the regeneration efficiency of CDPF1 reached 96.4% in the absence of secondary gas supply, however, the regeneration efficiency of DPF was only 84.3%. In addition, the maximum temperature of CDPF1 carrier was also lower than that of DPF during regeneration, and the highest temperature of CDPF1 was about 31 which lower than that of DPF at 630 . It can be seen that CDPF1 could not only improve the regeneration efficiency, but also reduce the maximum temperature in the carrier. When regeneration temperature was 600 , the secondary gas supply scheme 4 was adopted, i.e. the secondary gas supply rate was 1.25 L/s for 180 s, then the gas supply rate was 0.625 L/s for 420 s, and the regeneration efficiency of CDPF1 was 83.2%, the maximum temperature was reduced by about 64 compared to the absence of secondary gas supply. The second part of regeneration tests were carried out on engine test bench, and the regeneration temperature was still 600 . The regeneration characteristics of DPF, CDPF1, CDPF2 and the CDPF2 with 636 g/m3 catalysts loading were tested under engine stop and idle speed regeneration conditions. The test results showed that CDPF1 had a good regeneration performance, with regeneration efficiency was 76.4% for engine stop regeneration, the idle regeneration efficiency was increased to 88.5%. This was because that the secondary air into the combustion chamber was cold for engine stop regeneration, and the engine exhaust with higher temperature was introduced into the burner for the idle regeneration, the secondary air was combined to improve the burning rate of the fuel in the burner, at the same time, high temperature gas would burn more soot at a faster rate, and the combustion efficiency of the idle condition regeneration was improved. The pressure difference of DPF, CDPF1 and CDPF2 was tesed under 3 000 r/min speed and 100% load conditions. Since the amount of residual soot in the carrier was less after the idle regeneration, the pressure difference of DPF, CDPF1 and CDPF2 after idle regeneration were lower than that of engine stop regeneration. The pressure difference of CDPF1 was about 27 kPa after engine stop regeneration, and the final pressure difference was reduced to 25 kPa after idle regeneration. This study showed that the combination of active and passive regeneration of catalytic CDPF can integrate the advantages of the both, in future research, the active regeneration strategy based on catalytic conditions can be formed by further optimizing the catalytic load and regeneration timing, combining with exhaust heat management technology, and provide a reference for the upgrading and transformation of exhaust emissions of vehicles in use and the realization of the fourth stage emission standards of non-road mobile machinery. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

As one of the important signs of the development of information warfare, the tactical data chain overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional warfare platforms and wins the opportunity to master the battlefield situation, improve decision-making efficiency, and enhance the cooperative combat capability. The access control protocol determines how the user sites share the channel resources in the tactical data link system, which has an important impact on system performance and has always been a hot issue in tactical data link research. A multi-level priority polling MAC protocol (MPPMP) is proposed for the actual demand of multi-user multi-priority transmission control in tactical data link systems.

In this study, 31P NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy, and UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy were combined to identify the dynamic composition of sediment Po across two sets of lakes in China ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and their possible effects on lake eutrophication were evaluated. The results showed that sediment Po content (accounting for 24–75% of TP) was positively correlated with trophic status in both Eastern Plain and Yun-Gui Plateau lakes of China, and the linear relationship was more stable compared to total P (TP), implying that sediment Po may be a superior indicator of trophic status than TP. The Po component, phosphonate accounted for only 0.4% or less of Po, while the monoester P and diester P, accounted for 2–24% and 0.5–5% of Po, respectively, and were the main factors causing Po to increase with the increasing trophic status. The factors were closely related to the enhanced organic sewage load and intensification of contemporary sedimentation of phytoplankton. As trophic status increased, sediment Po might integrate into larger amounts of aromatic substances and functional groups, which could enhance the stability of Po in sediments. Furthermore, sediments from lakes with higher trophic status exhibited a higher degree of humification and molecular weights, which impart resistance to biodegradation, and therefore, reduced the risk of sediment Po release. However, the massive accumulation of bioavailable Po (monoester and diester P) allows possible degradation, supporting algal growth and maintains eutrophic status because there is abundant alkaline phosphatase in eutrophic lakes. Thus, to control lake eutrophication more effectively, targeted actions are urgently required to reduce the accumulation and degradation of Po in lake sediment. © 2018","58","Sediments","Biodegradation - Ecosystems - Eutrophication - Lakes - Phosphatases - Phosphorus - Sewage","ALkaline phosphatase - Aromatic substances - Compositional characterization - Compositional properties - Lake eutrophications - Linear relationships - Organic phosphorus - Visible absorbance spectroscopy","452.1 Sewage - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.8 Biotechnology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 312232102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 230200069, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The current work is funded by the National High-level Personnel of Special Support Program (People Plan, grant number 312232102 ) and the Open-End fund of the Kunming China International Research Center for Plateau-Lake (grant number 230200069 ).

The objective of this study was to examine the management and landscape effects on soil structure, soil moisture and soil nutrients in the Xishuangbanna region. The treatments were tropical rain forest (TRF), rubber monoculture (Rm), and two rubber-based agroforestry systems: H. brasiliensis–T. cacao (HTAs) and H. brasiliensis–F. macrophylla (HFAs). The results showed that after approximately three decades of the conversion from tropical rain forest to rubber monoculture, soils in the rubber plantations suffered serious degradation (poor soil physical properties, poor soil structure, limited soil moisture, unstable aggregates, depleted nutrients and serious soil erosion). However, the rubber-based agroforestry systems (both HTAs and HFAs) evidently improved the soil physical properties and enriched the soil nutrients in the rubber plantations. Compared to the corresponding values in rubber monoculture, the total soil porosity, initial soil moisture, soil mean weight diameter (MWD) and soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) in rubber-based agroforestry systems increased, on average, by 13.3%, 54.7%, 31.5%, and 246.4%, respectively. In addition, the nutrients of C, N, P, Ca and Mg increased, on average, by 38.8%, 38.5%, 48.2%, 47.9% and 31.4%, respectively, after the transformation from rubber monoculture to agroforestry systems.

One important procedure in the model is to determine the regularization parameter which has an important role in balancing the data-fidelity and the regularity of the denoised image. Discrepancy principle is a classical method for selecting the regularization parameter, which provides an upper bound for the value of the data-fitting term. For the regularization parameter, it is easier to estimate its upper bound as the statistical property of the noise is known. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate an optimal upper bound by applying the consistency between the value of data-fitting term and the upper bound.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results indicated that the AC-P had higher surface areas and micropore volumes than the AC-Mn with the same blending ratio. The relative contents of basic functional groups (i.e., C = O, π-π*) on AC-P were slightly lower than those on AC-Mn, while both contained the same main metal species, namely, MnO. The desulfurization results showed that with 3 wt% of blending ratio, AC-Mn3 and AC-P3 had higher sulfur capacities at 220 and 205 mg/g, respectively, which were much higher than for the blank one (149.6 mg/g). Moreover, the AC-P had relatively higher sulfur capacity than the AC-Mn with the same contents of Mn, which might be attributed to the existence of other metals in pyrolusite. After the desulfurization process, MnO were gradually transferred into MnSO4, and the relative contents of basic functional groups decreased evidently for both AC-Mn3 and AC-P3.

The synthesized absorbent was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Meanwhile, the effects of initial pH, contact time and initial mercury ions concentration on the removal of mercury ions from aqueous solutions were investigated by batch adsorption experiments. The results showed that the removal rate reached 99.11% and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 274.32 mg/g at pH 2 and the equilibrium time of adsorption was about 1 h. The absorbent presented good selectivity for mercury ions among Zn(II), Ni(II), Mn(II) and Ge(IIII). Moreover, the obtained adsorbent has good reusability and the absorbability decreased only from 98.76 to 94.75% after five cycles. Besides, the adsorption isotherms fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm model and adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model. The removal mechanism of mercury via phosphinic acid-functionalized silica nanoparticles was chelation interaction. All the experimental data indicated that the phosphinic acid-functionalized silica nanoparticles are very promising in removal of mercury ions from aqueous solutions.

To date, the relationship between long-term pruning and metabolic flux enhancement in tea trees has not been studied. In this research, 11-year-old pruned tea trees from four different cultivars were randomly selected for transcriptome analysis and characteristic secondary metabolite analysis together with controls. The findings revealed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) accumulation in pruned tea trees was significantly higher than that in unpruned tea trees. SCPL1A expression (encoding a class of serine carboxypeptidase), which has been reported to have a catalytic ability during EGCG biosynthesis, together with LAR, encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase, was upregulated in the pruned tea trees. Moreover, metabolic flux enhancement and transcriptome analysis revealed low EGCG accumulation in the leaves of unpruned tea trees. Because of the bitter and astringent taste of EGCG, these results provide a certain understanding to the lower bitterness and astringency in teas from 'ancient tea trees', growing in the wild with no trimming, than teas produced from pruned plantation trees. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","37","Forestry","Amino acids - Biochemistry - Cultivation - Encoding (symbols) - Metabolism - Metabolites - Plants (botany) - Signal encoding","Camellia sinensis - Carboxypeptidase - Catalytic ability - Epigallocatechin gallate - Metabolic flux - Secondary metabolites - Tea plantations - Transcriptome analysis",,"Number: 16030701097, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: IRT_15R01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Jimei University; ","Zheng-Zhu Zhang: 0000-0003-1564-1428 Author Contributions Mufang Sun, Chengren Zhang, Mengqian Lu, and Zichang Chen prepared the materials for sequencing.

On the other hand, owing to the difficulties to collect and encode micro-expression data, it is small sample size. In this paper, we use only 560 micro-expression video clips to evaluate the proposed network model: Transferring Long-term Convolutional Neural Network (TLCNN). TLCNN uses Deep CNN to extract features from each frame of micro-expression video clips, then feeds them to Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which learn the temporal sequence information of micro-expression. Due to the small sample size of micro-expression data, TLCNN uses two steps of transfer learning: (1) transferring from expression data and (2) transferring from single frame of micro-expression video clips, which can be regarded as “big data”. Evaluation on 560 micro-expression video clips collected from three spontaneous databases is performed. The results show that the proposed TLCNN is better than some state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","53","Long short-term memory","Big data - Convolution - Deep learning - Image retrieval - Video cameras","Convolutional neural network - Micro-expressions - Small Sample Size - Spatial temporals - State-of-the-art algorithms - Temporal sequences - Transfer learning - Transferring learning",,"Number: U1736220, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is supported in part by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61772511 , 61379095 , U1736220 , 61725204 ).

A solar simulator consisting of a halogen lamp light resource array was adopted to provide a light source for heating. Different comparative tests under different input radiation energy conditions were carried out to prove the hypothesis that a lower condensing pressure can be realized by using an enhanced mass transfer method and is good for increasing the amount of desorption. The variations of the adsorbent bed temperature, system pressure and ice production were analysed. The maximum COP and maximum ice-making capacity of the enhanced mass transfer adsorption refrigeration system were 0.142 and 7 kg, respectively.

According to the lab experimental results, users can distinguish the five patterns with the rate of over 75%, which proves that these five vibration patterns can be used to output multi-semantic information.

The Bi2O3/Bi2O4 photocatalysts have wider visible light absorption and lower fluorescence emission intensity than the commercial Bi2O3. So, they displayed superior performance in the degradation of EE2. After the adsorption equilibrium of EE2 was reached, the degradation efficiency of Bi2O3/Bi2O4 for EE2 can reach a maximum value of ~ 100% in 12 min under the visible-light illumination.

The results showed that the proportion of (1) adult bulls, (2) young bulls and adult cows, and (3) calves was 1:10:5. The slopes traversed (0°–28°) within habitats and between two major habitats was higher than those (1°–13°) between habitats and water bodies, and between water bodies and food areas (alpine wet meadow in the north). There were five movement routes from rest habitats to food areas. Moreover, vehicle tracks disrupted yak migration routes from two major habitats to food areas. In conclusion, a UAV is a new multi-purpose monitoring approach for surveying large wildlife and their habitats in remote and very sparsely populated areas, and for identifying human disturbances. Using a UAV can capture detailed data on animal movements for scientific researchers. A UAV can patrol a large area that is hard to reach and provide information quickly; it can also reduce the costs of daily patrolling to determine movements. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","35","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Animals - Antennas - Automobile bodies - Ecosystems - Landforms - Surveys","Animal movement - Effective tool - Human disturbances - Monitoring approach - Multi-purpose - Nature reserves - Qinghai-Tibetan plateau - Sparsely populated areas",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Southwest Forestry University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Normal University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Dundee; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2016YFC0501906, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; ","aState Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China;bState Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; cCollege of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; dSchool of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kindom; eNational Plateau Wetlands Research Center, Wetlands College, Southwest Forestry University, Yunnan Province, China; fInstitute of Plant Nutrition and Resources, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Science, Beijing, ChinaThis work was financially supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016YFC0501906) and State key laboratory of water environment simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University China; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0501906];",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Its negative consequences for both natural ecosystems and the human inhabitants of the karst region have created a need for effective ecosystem restoration strategies, but success in these efforts has been limited. We hypothesized that scarcity of mineral nutrients could be a crucial factor in vegetation recovery, but relatively little information is available about the limiting roles of various mineral elements. We investigated responses of aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations of a degraded karst grassland to nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) additions over a period of three years. Nutrient additions significantly increased aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations for both the plant community and individual plant functional groups. Total aboveground biomass was significantly increased by N (by 35.6%), P (by 35.3%) and K (by 11.7%) fertilization over three years of nutrient additions. The interaction effects of year × N and year × P on total biomass were significant. Additions of N and P increased the biomass of grasses by 39.2% and 15.0%, respectively, and additions of P increased the biomass of forbs by 69.3%. The biomass of shrubs was significantly increased by P (by 111.3%), K (by 45.3%) and N (by 38.5%), and there were strong interaction effects of N, P and K on shrub biomass. P and K additions significantly increased the relative biomass of shrubs but decreased that of grasses, especially under the NPK treatment. Our results suggest that the productivity of degraded grassland in the karst region of China is co-limited by N, P and K, with N and P being the primary limiting factors. Among functional groups, grasses are mainly limited by N and P, forbs by P, and shrubs by all 3 elements, with P being the most limiting factor overall. Mineral fertilization stimulates plant growth and may be a useful tool in efforts to restore woody vegetation in degraded grasslands, thus counteracting the process of rock desertification in the karst region of southwestern China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","52","Nutrients","Biomass - Climatology - Ecosystems - Landforms - Minerals - Nitrogen - Phosphorus - Potassium - Productivity - Restoration - Vegetation","Ecosystem restoration - Environmental problems - Fertilization - Karst grassland - Mineral fertilization - Nutrient concentrations - Nutrient limitations - Plant functional groups","443 Meteorology - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 2016YFC0502602, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: CAFYBB2016QB020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: XDA05070400, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2013CB956701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41373081, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502602 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41373081 , 31500583 ), the National Key Basic Research Program of China ( 2013CB956701 ), the ‘Strategic Priority Research Program’ of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( XDA05070400 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of CAF (CAFYBB2014ZD006, CAFYBB2016QB020).

In the recent years there has been a trend to measure dialect differences with computational models. From the perspective of phonology, a syllables of a Chinese character can be divided into three parts: The Initials, the Finals and the Tone. The Initials are usually composed of consonants, and the Finals are composed of vowels or vowels and consonants. Therefore, as long as the quantitative characteristic of vowels and consonants are described, and the Five-Degree markings method of tones are used, the differences between Chinese syllables can be calculated.

However, one bottleneck of the anode materials for LIBs is the poor cycling performance caused by the fact that the anodes cannot maintain their integrity over several charge-discharge cycles. In this article, a zinc-based two-dimensional coordination polymer [Zn(bcbpy)0.5(PTA)(H2O)] (Zn-BCP) has been synthesized (H2bcbpy·2Cl = 1,1′-bis(3-carboxylatobenzyl)-(4,4′-bipyridinium) dichloride, PTA = terephthalic acid), which was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Because of the presence of electron-deficient bipyridinium moieties, Zn-BCP can easily undergo photoinduced electron transfer and eye-detectable photochromic behavior. Moreover, its luminescence can be switched by UV-Vis light irradiation. When Zn-BCP acts as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, it can deliver a high reversible capacity of 386.2 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles and a high capacity retention of 93.1% after 1000 cycles at a high rate of 200 mA g-1, which is supposed to be due to the flexible structure characteristic of the proposed anode. The high capacity may be mainly ascribed to rich insertion sites arising from the aromatic ligands and all of the aromatic ligands are taking part in lithium storage. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","55","Lithium-ion batteries","Anodes - Aromatic compounds - Flexible structures - Infrared spectroscopy - Ions - Ligands - Photochromism - Single crystals - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray diffraction - Zinc compounds","Anode material for lithium ion batteries - High reversible capacities - Photo-induced electron transfer - Portable electronic devices - Powder X ray diffraction - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Stationary energy storages - Structure characteristic","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 51474191, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51703118, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51764048, 51703118 and 51474191) and the Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (2017FD144) for providing the financial support.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A novel NMR strategy for discriminative quantification of the endogenous and exogenous glucose in plasma has been developed using an adapted isotope dilution 1H–13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (ID-HSQC) with uniformly 13C-labeled glucose as a tracer of exogenous glucose. This method takes advantage of the distinct 1H–13C chemical shifts of the hemiacetal group of the α-D-glucopyranose and makes use of the 13C–13C one-bond J-coupling (1JCC) in uniformly 13C-labeled glucose to differentiate the 1H–13C HSQC signal of labeled glucose from that of its natural counterpart when data are acquired in high-resolution mode. The molar ratio between the endogenous and exogenous plasma glucose can then be calculated from the peak intensities of the natural and labeled glucose. The accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated using a series of standard mixtures of natural and uniformly 13C-labeled glucose with varied but known concentrations. Application of this method is demonstrated for the quantification of endogenous and exogenous glucose in plasma derived from healthy and diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. The results nicely agree with our previous LC-MS/MS results. Considering the natural abundance of 13C isotope at the level of 1.1% in endogenous glucose, comparable peak intensities of quantitatively measurable signals derived from natural and labeled glucose imply that the ID-HSQC can tolerate a significantly high ratio of isotope dilution, with labeled/natural glucose at ~ 1%. We expect that the ID-HSQC method can serve as an alternative approach to the biomedical or clinical studies of glucose metabolism. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","34","Glucose","Dilution - Isotopes","Accuracy and precision - Accurate quantifications - Carbon-13 - Concentration determination - Heteronuclear single quantum correlations - HSQC - Isotope dilutions - Quantification",,"Number: 2012HA015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2017YFC0906900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21505142, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2012HA015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2017YFC0906900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21505142, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments The authors are grateful for financial supports from the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0906900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21505142), and Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (2012HA015).Funding information This study received financial supports from the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0906900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21505142), and Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (2012HA015).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Such a hydropower system faces many new operation problems that have not occurred in other countries. These problems have posed a great challenge to the safety, efficiency, and economy of hydropower system and the entire power grid. This paper analyzed the operation characteristics of extra large-scale hydropower systems, which were different from that of previous small and medium-sized hydropower systems. A series of key operation problems facing large-scale hydropower systems were summarized, including curse of dimensionality, safety control of huge units with multiple forbidden zones, large-scale hydropower absorption, peak operation for multiple power grids, etc. Moreover, some feasible technological approaches were proposed to address these issues. Taking the China Southern Grid, Yunnan Power Grid, Lancang River, Hongshui River, and Wu River as the background, we had applied some research results to the real-world hydropower systems and presented typical applications.

The results of simulations on the test functions show that the dynamic grouping process is stable, feasible and effective, and has fast convergence and high accuracy compared with several other PSO-based algorithms in terms of global searching ability and convergent speed. © 2018 IEEE.","11","Clustering algorithms","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Clustering grouping - Convergent speed - Dynamic adjustment - Global searching ability - Grouping strategies - Location information - Multi-swarm particle swarm optimizations - Particle swarm optimization algorithm","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Number: 2015SE204, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018229, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is funded by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2015SE204 and Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2012SE306.Co-supported by Yunnan University's Research Innovation Fund for Graduate Students No.2018229.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This study proposes a reflected wave identification method based on speeded-up robust features, which can gradually approximate from the possibly largest fault distance to the near-end fault distance so as to exclude the reflected wave from time window containing initial wave. In particular, the time window segmentation divides initial wave and reflected wave into two inconsistent time windows, hence the reflected wave from the superimposed oscillation that usually follows the travelling wave can be effectively separated, such that the identification of reflected wave can be significantly simplified. Lastly, the superimposed oscillation is thoroughly analysed while both the field data with and without obvious superimposed oscillation are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Analysis shows that the annual radiation loss due to leakage is sensitive to the geometry of DCPCs and tilt-angle adjustment strategy, and the optimal qe,opt for minimizing annual leakage is the one that makes the incidence angle of solar rays on the plane wall equal to the critical incidence angle for total internal reflection at solar-noon in solstices and days when tilt-angle adjustment from site latitude is made for DCPV with the aperture's tilt-angle being yearly fixed, and adjusted two and four times, respectively. It is found that annual radiation leakage is considerable small, for DCPVs with qe eθopt, almost all leaked radiation comes from sky diffuse radiation, whereas for θe = 90°, most of leakage is attributed to direct sunlight. As compared to similar non-concentrating solar cells, more radiation arrives annually on solar cells of DCPV-θa/θe at small angles thanks to refraction of radiation on the aperture, hence, under same operation conditions, the annual average photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells for concentrated radiation is even higher. Analysis also shows that the power increase of DCPVs, being much less than the geometric concentration of DCPCs (Ct), is mainly attributable to optical loss due to absorption of solar rays on the way to the solar cells, and the power loss due to leakage of radiation is not significant. From the point of annual electricity generation, for full DCPVs with a given qa, DCPV-qa/90 are favorable, and for truncated DCPVs with given qa and Ct, DCPVs with θe © 2018 MDPI AG.

The risk is fed back to the trust center, which calculates the value of user trust according to the principle that the value of user trust is negatively correlated with the risk. If the user trust value does not meet the requirements of the assigned role, the role will not be assigned. At the same time, if the risk quota is exhausted, the access will be blocked.

We have investigated the thermal decomposition behavior and kinetics, as well as the product distribution, of the co-pyrolysis of biomass (cellulose and pine sawdust) and plastic (LDPE) both with and without a catalyst (HZSM-5) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Our results, based on the weight loss difference (W), show that there is a positive and synergistic interaction between the biomass and LDPE. After the addition of LDPE, the synergistic reactions inhibited catalyst coking effectively and decreased the formation of solid residues. In addition, the ZSM-5 catalyst improved the reaction activity and reduced the activation energy, although the reaction mechanism is not changed. At the same time, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method was used to fit the kinetic data for both non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE, and the activation energies (Ea) of the cellulose + LDPE + catalyst and pine + LDPE + catalyst systems were found to be 168.81 and 185.87 kJ/mol, respectively. The co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE effectively improved the yield and selectivity of aromatics and increased the selectivity for benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene (BTXE).

Biomimetic scaffolds emerge as ideal cell delivery vehicles for regulating cell fate via mimicking the components of stem cell niche. Herein, we prepared a bioactive hydrogel by mixing chitosan and hyaluronic acid that is immobilized with C domain peptide of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1C) and examined whether this hydrogel could augment stem cell survival and therapeutic potential. Our results showed that IGF-1C-modified hydrogel increased in vitro viability and proangiogenic activity of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs). Moreover, cotransplantation of hydrogel and ADSCs into ischemic hind limbs of mice effectively ameliorated blood perfusion and muscle regeneration, leading to superior limb salvage. These therapeutic effects can be ascribed to improved ADSC retention, angiopoientin-1 secretion, and neovascularization, as well as reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Additionally, hydrogel enhanced antifibrotic activity of ADSCs, as evidenced by decreased collagen accumulation at late stage. Together, our findings indicate that composite hydrogel modified by IGF-1C could promote survival and proangiogenic capacity of ADSCs and thereby represents a feasible option for cell-based treatment for critical limb ischemia. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","57","Scaffolds (biology)","Biomimetics - Cytology - Hyaluronic acid - Hydrogels - Insulin - Stem cells","Adipose-derived stromal cells - Cell delivery vehicles - Collagen accumulation - critical limb ischemia (CLI) - Insulin-like growth factor 1 - Neo-vascularization - Proangiogenic activities - Therapeutic potentials","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 81701840, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81220108015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51622305, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31771066, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81760327, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects (81701840, 81760327, 51622305, 31771066, and 81220108015).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the cost of solar power has become an economic constraint to the large-scale production of solar power equipment. In order to meet the demand of solar power generation, metallurgical grade silicon may be used to replace solar grade silicon to generate electricity. The challenge is that metallurgical grade silicon contains phosphorus impurities. In this paper, electromagnetic levitation is recommended to remove the phosphorus in metallurgical grade silicon. The results show that when the mass of levitated droplets is 0.59-0.64g, the input current is 300-400A, the frequency is 280kHz, and the input power range is 3000-4500W, the removal rate of phosphorus in the ferrosilicon sample is as high as 41%. Therefore, it is feasible to use metallurgical grade silicon to replace solar grade silicon. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Numerical results show that the fixed parts made of traditional epoxy (λ=0.2 W·m-1·K-1) between batteries more significantly increase the maximum temperature inside the battery pack compared with the case without fixed parts, and the temperature difference between these two cases is about 12 K. Moreover, the difference of pressure drop between these two cases gradually increases with Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that the numerical model of the stagger-arranged battery pack without fixed parts distinctly underestimates the maximum temperature and pressure drop. As air coolant is of laminar flow inside the stagger-arranged battery pack, the optimal thermal conductivity of fixed parts is 2 W·m-1·K-1.

Mushroom harvesters have developed sophisticated understandings of matsutake ecology and production, and are applying this knowledge in various innovative management strategies. At the same time, Chinese government agencies and scientists are promoting matsutake-based livelihoods to support development and conservation goals. We collaborated with matsutake harvesters in one Yunnan community to carry out a systematic experiment on a popular shiro-level management technique: covering matsutake shiros with either plastic or leaf litter. Our experimental results suggest that although leaf litter coverings are superior to plastic coverings, shiros that are left uncovered may produce the highest yields. Complementing our experimental work is a multi-sited household survey of existing matsutake management practices across Yunnan, which shows that a high proportion of harvesters are already engaged in a broad range of potentially beneficial management strategies. Though both findings highlight limitations of previous initiatives led by government and research actors in China, this existing body of work is an important foundation and opportunity for developing applied mycology in the region. In and beyond China, working with communities to develop site-specific management strategies through rigorous and participatory scientific inquiry can provide salient benefits for both scientists and resource users. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","35","Fungi","Ecosystems - Harvesters - Microbiology - Surveys","China - Edible fungus - NTFPs - Participatory research - Tricholoma matsutake","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.9.2 Microbiology - 821.1 Agricultural Machinery and Equipment","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Center for East Asian Studies, Stanford University; Number: 179122, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: David R.

Virtual basic surgical training framework integrated with multi-sensations rendering has been recognized as one of the most immersive implementations in medical education. Yet, compared with the original intraoperative data, there has always been an argument on the lower fidelity these data are represented in virtual surgical training. In this paper, a solution is proposed to achieve better training immersion by incorporating multiple higher-fidelity factors toward a trainee's sensations (vision, touch, and hearing) during virtual training sessions. This was based on the proposal of a three-tier model to classify reasons leading to fidelity issues. This include: haptic factors, such as high-quality fitting of force models based on surgical data acquisition, the use of actual surgical instrument linked to desktop haptic devices; visual factors, such as patient-specific CT images segmentation and reconstruction from the original medical data; and hearing factors, such as variations of the sound of monitoring systems in the theatre under different surgical conditions. Twenty seven urologists comprising 18 novices and 9 professors were invited to test a virtual training system based on the proposed solution. Post-test values from both professors' and novices' groups demonstrated obvious improvements in comparison with pre-test values under both the subjective and objective criteria, the fitting rate of the whole puncture processing is 99.93%. Both the subjective and objective results demonstrated a higher performance than the existing benchmark training platform. Combining these in a systematic approach, tuned with specific fidelity requirements, haptically enabled training simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment. © 2013 IEEE.","43","E-learning","Audition - Benchmarking - Biological systems - Computerized tomography - Data acquisition - Haptic interfaces - Image segmentation - Medical education - Medical imaging - Personnel training - Rendering (computer graphics) - Surgery - Surgical equipment - Transplantation (surgical)","Biological system modeling - Clinical trial - Force - haptic - Intra-operative - percutaneous - Solid model - Surgical training",,"","This work was supported by the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation at Deakin University.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

On the basis of particle swarm optimization algorithm, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm based on adaptive adjustment inertia weight is proposed. Using the correlation coefficient matrix as the evaluation criterion of separation performance, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, the basic particle swarm optimization and the fast fixed point algorithm(FastICA) are compared under the noisy condition. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective to improve separation performance and has resistance to noise to some extent. © 2018 IEEE.","7","Blind source separation","Information management - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Reactive power","Correlation coefficient - Fixed-point algorithms - Improved particle swarm optimization algorithms - Inertia weight - Noisy conditions - Particle swarm optimization algorithm - Separation performance - Source seperation","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The material and structure of an insulator affect its flashover performance but the research on the differences in the flashover performance of different insulators and the analysis of the reason for these differences have not been clear. In this paper, lightning impulse flashover tests of two types of insulators (composite and glass insulators) were carried out in the National Engineering Laboratory (Kunming) for Ultrahigh-voltage Engineering Technology. In these tests, the insulators were hung in a 110 kV double-circuit transmission tower and a standard lightning impulse (1.2/50 _s) was applied to the insulators. The discharge path and the 50% impulse flashover voltage of the insulators were recorded. At the same time, the electric fields in the vicinity of different insulators were calculated using the finite element method with COMSOL Multiphysics. The electric field distribution and the uneven coefficient were analyzed. Combined with the flashover test data and the electric field simulation, the relationship between the flashover performance (discharge path and 50% impulse flashover voltage) and the electric field (electric field distribution and uneven coefficient) is found. The simulation results are in accordance with the test data and the conclusions can provide useful references for the external insulation design of transmission lines and the optimization of insulators. © 2018 by the authors.
