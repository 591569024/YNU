Compound 1 is a one-dimensional coordination polymer with strong lone pair-π interactions between the coordinated NO3-anions and the imide ring of DPNDI; while 2 is a two-dimensional network with a (4, 4) net topology. In the case of 3, due to the presence of uncoordinated perchlorate counter ions, it exhibits a non-interpenetrated square-grid coordination polymer containing one-dimensional rhomboid channels. The structural diversity in these compounds is attributed to different coordination abilities and geometries of counter anions. Due to the presence of electron-deficient NDI moiety, the photochromic behavior of these compounds was studied. Interestingly, only compounds 1 and 3 exhibit color changes under light irradiation. The influence of the anions on the photochromism process of the NDI-based materials has been discussed. © 2018 by the authors.","46","Polymers","Cadmium compounds - Dimethylformamide - Inorganic compounds - Naphthalene - Negative ions - Organic solvents - Photochromism","Controlled architecture - Coordination Polymers - Electron transfer - N ,N-Dimethylformamide - Naphthalene diimide - One-dimensional coordination polymer - Photochromic behavior - Two-dimensional networks","741.1 Light/Optics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials","Number: 2017FD144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: This work has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (award No. 51764048) and Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to solve this problem, an urban traffic planning model based on impedance matching of complex road networks is constructed. Firstly, the impedance matching technology of a complex road network was studied; the weight coefficient of impedance feature information detection was calculated by sampling impedance feature information of the complex road network and considering the vehicle density in road segments in the complex road network, and the impedance feature information was detected according to the weight coefficient, so as to complete impedance matching of the complex road network. The total error rate during impedance matching of the complex road network was predicated, and optimal optimization was performed to the impedance matching results of the complex road network according to the detection results of impedance feature information to track the impedance matching results of the complex road network and ensure the matching accuracy, so as to construct a high-precision urban traffic planning model. The designed urban traffic planning model was applied to a main road section of a city for experiment. The experimental results showed that the model can provide a success rate close to 100% in urban traffic congestion detection and it only resulted in 41ms in time overhead when the number of urban traffic monitoring nodes was 100. It proves that the proposed model can effectively alleviate traffic congestion, improve the traffic capacity of road sections and effectively guide traffic planning and design. © 2018, Gioacchino Onorati Editore.

Herein, we demonstrate that a nickel supported Pt-decorated electrode with an ultralow mass loading (1.50 μg cm−2) featuring Ni-Pt hybrid nanoparticles growing on self-reconstructed porous nickel frameworks (Pt/p-Ni) is synthesized via a facile electrochemical activation process. The self-supported Pt/p-Ni exhibits 3.65-fold higher activity for catalyzing the methanol electrooxidation reaction than that of commercial Pt/C with the same Pt loading under alkaline media. The activation approach results in surface rearrangement of Ni substrate to form nanoporous skeletons and highly dispersed Ni-Pt hybrid nanoparticles with a mean size of 4.34 nm grown on the nano-ligaments of the Ni porous skeletons. The porous skeletons decorated with nano-dispersion of Pt significantly increase the surface active sites and, therefore, yield a superior catalytic activity. Experiments coupled with density-functional theory calculations suggest the existence of a strong electronic interaction at the superface of the Pt/p-Ni, which leads to efficiently weaken the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface and alleviate the COadspoisoning of the active sites, resulting in remarkably enhanced methanol electrooxidation activity and durability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","54","Platinum alloys","Binary alloys - Catalyst activity - Catalyst poisoning - Chemical activation - Density functional theory - Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) - Electrocatalysts - Electrooxidation - Fuel storage - Methanol - Methanol fuels - Musculoskeletal system - Nanoparticles - Nickel - Platinum - Synthesis (chemical)","Electrochemical activation - Electrochemical fabrication - Electronic interactions - Enhanced methanol electro oxidations - Hybrid nanoparticle - Methanol electrooxidation - Porous nickel - Surface rearrangement","461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 523 Liquid Fuels - 547.1 Precious Metals - 548.1 Nickel - 694.4 Storage - 702.2 Fuel Cells - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 2017PY269SQ, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: CNMRCUTS1601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FB125, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51464028, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51204080, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51464028 and 51204080 ), Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province ( 2017PY269SQ ), the Application Foundation Research of Yunnan Province ( 2014FB125 ), and the Independent Research Funds for the State Key Laboratory ( CNMRCUTS1601 ).

Analysis of all-sky Planck submillimetre observations and the IRAS 100 μm data has led to the detection of a population of Galactic cold clumps. The clumps can be used to study star formation and dust properties in a wide range of Galactic environments. Aims. Our aim is to measure dust spectral energy distribution (SED) variations as a function of the spatial scale and the wavelength. Methods. We examined the SEDs at large scales using IRAS, Planck, and Herschel data. At smaller scales, we compared JCMT/SCUBA-2 850 μm maps with Herschel data that were filtered using the SCUBA-2 pipeline. Clumps were extracted using the Fellwalker method, and their spectra were modelled as modified blackbody functions. Results. According to IRAS and Planck data, most fields have dust colour temperatures TC∼ 14-18 K and opacity spectral index values of β = 1.5-1.9. The clumps and cores identified in SCUBA-2 maps have T ∼ 13 K and similar β values. There are some indications of the dust emission spectrum becoming flatter at wavelengths longer than 500 μm. In fits involving Planck data, the significance is limited by the uncertainty of the corrections for CO line contamination. The fits to the SPIRE data give a median β value that is slightly above 1.8. In the joint SPIRE and SCUBA-2 850 μm fits, the value decreases to β ∼ 1.6. Most of the observed T-β anticorrelation can be explained by noise. Conclusions. The typical submillimetre opacity spectral index β of cold clumps is found to be ∼1.7. This is above the values of diffuse clouds, but lower than in some previous studies of dense clumps. There is only tentative evidence of a T-β anticorrelation and β decreasing at millimetre wavelengths. © ESO 2018.","95","Dust","Emission spectroscopy - Millimeter waves - Opacity - Population statistics - Stars","Dust , extinction - Infrared: ISM - ISM : clouds - Stars: formation - Stars: protostars - Submillimetre: isms","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics","Number: -, Acronym: NASA, Sponsor: National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Number: -, Acronym: ESA, Sponsor: Ecological Society of Australia; Number: -, Acronym: KASI, Sponsor: Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute; Number: -, Acronym: NAOJ, Sponsor: National Astronomical Observatory of Japan; Number: 679852, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NCC5-626, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 285769, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Academy of Finland; Number: -, Acronym: Caltech, Sponsor: California Institute of Technology; Number: 320773, Acronym: ERC, Sponsor: European Research Council; Number: -, Acronym: KASI, Sponsor: Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute; Number: -, Acronym: CFI, Sponsor: Canada Foundation for Innovation; Number: 196.C-0999, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: XDB09000000, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","★Planck (http://www.esa.int/Planck) is a project of the European Space Agency – ESA – with instruments provided by two scientific consortia funded by ESA member states (in particular the lead countries: France and Italy) with contributions from NASA (USA), and telescope reflectors provided in a collaboration between ESA and a scientific consortium led and funded by Denmark.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, the original acoustic impulse response signals are analysed by statistical analysis and local mean decomposition (LMD), in order to construct the mixed domain features, which are made up of time, frequency and time-frequency domain features. Then the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is adopted to reduce the high-dimensional features of mixed domain and extract the main features which reflect the operation state of main components. Finally, the main features are input to extreme learning machine (ELM) for state recognition. After the feature extraction by KPCA, the redundancy of input features is eliminated. The simulation results show that KPCA is more sensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the pipeline blockage signal when compared with PCA. Meanwhile, ELM is superior to BP in terms of classification accuracy and time consuming.

The issue of China's increasing timber imports is now receiving extensive attention from the international community. Existing studies that analyze China's global timber sourcing focus on international trade data or rules at a predominantly macro-level, while few empirical studies exist. This paper takes a grounded approach to empirically study the timber trade from Myanmar to China via Yunnan Province. Using a global value chain analysis, the research identifies the flow of timber along the value chain, the different actors involved in the trade, and the institutions that shape the actor's access to the value chain, before calculating the profits among the different actors. The results show the Sino-Burmese border timber trade originated from traditional border trade and was recently booming along with the economic development of China. Along the timber value chain, however, a few privileged actors parasitize the timber value by exploiting real market participants with the power entitled to them by both governments. The research argues the challenges to improve sustainable timber trade lie not only in national law enforcement, but also improving the governance structure of the value chain by improving the transparency and accountability of timber harvesting concessions and trade permits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","37","Timber","Chains - International trade - Logging (forestry)","Governance - Market access - Middlemen - One Belt and One Road - Southeast Asia - Value chains","602.1 Mechanical Drives","Number: QN2013016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 16JJD850015, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","The fieldwork for this research was financed by the Yunnan Provincial Foundation of Social Sciences (Project no.

Results indicated that CeO2 could remove oxygen from acids, aldehydes and methoxy phenols, producing a maximum yield of hydrocarbons of 85% and highest selectivity of monocyclic aromatics of 73% in the TCB. The addition of LDPE exhibited a near-complete elimination of oxygenates, leaving hydrocarbons as the overwhelming products. With increasing LDPE proportion, the yield of aliphatics and the selectivity of BTX kept increasing. An optimum H/Ceff of 0.7 was superior to that reported in literature.

In neopentyl glycol, La2O3nanoparticles are coated on the surface of spinel LiMn2O4ultimately obtaining La2O3coating contents of 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 wt%. XRD characterization reveals that the nano La2O3exhibits a favorable crystalline intensity, without impurities and the crystalline peak of La2O3can be observed when the coating content is of up to 6 wt%. Successful deposition of a thin layer of La2O3on the LiMn2O4surface is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray spectrum elemental plane scanning, and line scanning. Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma emission spectrography and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses show that the nano-La2O3coating significantly relieves the dissolution of Mn in LiMn2O4materials, and also improves the electro-conductivity. The electrochemical performances of the coated LiMn2O4samples are also investigated in this work.

In order to fight register pressure and therefore improve the effectiveness of compiler, this research takes the register pressure into account to improve loop unrolling optimization during the transformation process. In addition, a register pressure aware transformation is able to reduce the performance overhead of some fine-grained randomization transformations which can be used to defend against ROP attacks.

The analysis shows that, the projected incident and refractive angles of solar rays on the cross-section of DCPC are not subjected to the correlation as Snell law except for incident rays on the cross-section, hence, the acceptance half-angle (θa) of DCPC should be determined based on time variations of projected refractive angle and minimum time (2tc) required to concentrate direct sunlight in all days of a year. It is also found that, to make all refractive radiation within θa are totally internally reflected onto the absorber, DCPC with a restricted exit angle (DCPC-θa/θe should be employed, and solar leakage from walls of DCPC-θa/90 can be avoided or reduced by increasing θa and number of periodical tilt-angle adjustment in a year. Calculations show that, the minimum θa of DCPC depends on tc and strategy of tilt-angle adjustment; and for a given tc, the ratio (Rc) of maximum geometric concentration of DCPC to that of reflective CPC (n = 1) is dependent on number of periodical tilt-angle adjustment in a year, but always larger than refractive index (n) of dielectric. Calculations also indicate that, for DCPCs with n > 1.4, when solar rays incident towards onto right/left wall, the radiation incident on its opposite wall (left/right) will be totally internally reflected, and multiple reflections of solar rays on way to the absorber will also be total internal reflection for radiation within its acceptance angle. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","31","Incident solar radiation","Refractive index","Acceptance angle - Acceptance half angle - Linear dielectric - Multiple reflections - Three dimensional radiation - Time variations - Total internal reflections - Vector algebra","657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics","Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of funded research program 51466016, financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.

The difference in the freshness of strawberries was evaluated by determining the following parameter changes: weight loss, hardness, soluble solids, titratable acid, color, vitamin C, total phenol, free radical scavenging activity, peroxidase activity, and sensory evaluation. The results revealed that the active nanocomposite packaging film has better preservation effect when compared with pure PLA film. Its preservation effect is mainly reflected in the more effective reduction of vitamin C loss, delaying the decline of total phenols and 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in strawberries.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that oxygen defects are almost inevitable in such thin films deposited by RF sputtering. At a moderate (120 W) sputtering power the Mn2+ content increases 10–20% and the Mn4+ content is accordingly reduced. The detailed cationic configuration is proposed, where Zn2+ ions occupy both the tetrahedral site and the octahedral site. Raman and spectroscopic results allows asserting the relation between Mn valence states and the sputtering power. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","39","Thin films","Film growth - Light absorption - Manganese compounds - Microstructure - Nickel compounds - Optical properties - Scanning electron microscopy - Sputtering - Surface defects - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy - Zinc compounds","Cationic distribution - Crystalline structure - Fast growth rate - Film crystallinity - Radio-frequency sputtering - Rf-sputtering - Tetrahedral sites - Valance state","741.1 Light/Optics - 951 Materials Science","","This work was supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0406405).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures in the ratio of 3:7 was tested based on a lightning impulse experimental platform. The 50% impulse breakdown voltage of CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures was determined under various pressures (0.1~0.3MPa) and gaps (5~30mm) and compared to pure SF6 gas. The results indicate that CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures has good insulation properties, reaching 0.84 times that of SF6 gas under slightly non-uniform electric field and 0.65 times that of SF6 gas in extremely inhomogeneous electric field. The polar effect of CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures was also analyzed and the coefficient K is proposed to describe and compare the differences of 50% breakdown voltages under different electric field. The results show that the polar effect of CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures under extremely inhomogeneous electric field is more obvious than that under slightly non-uniform electric field, and the polar reversal phenomenon occurs only under extremely inhomogeneous electric field.

The significant strategy is based on three favorable properties: the dazzling polymeric ability of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT); the strong adsorption interaction between TdT-yielded T-rich DNA with Adenine/Au complex; the unique electro-catalytic property of Adenine/Au complex. Here, the change in electrochemical response depends on the concentration of TdT or alkaline phosphatase (ALP), so the same novel electrochemical sensor for detecting TdT or ALP can be established with a lower detection limit.

Emission of toxic formaldehyde is still one of the biggest problems for these formaldehyde-based adhesives in recent years for the development of wood adhesives. Lately, there has been a considerable industrial interest in the development of natural or green wood adhesives, such as lignin, tannin, protein, starch, and polysaccharides, to substitute synthetic thermosetting resins as adhesives for wood panels because of the mounting environmental pressure worldwide. As one kind of bio-based adhesives, soy protein-based adhesive has been always a hot topic since 1990s. As it is well-known that the soy-based adhesive with no modification cannot be used directly for wood panels for its poor bonding strength and water resistance especially, and the latter one is so bad. Cross-linking modification has been proved to be an effective modification method to improve the water resistance of soy-based adhesive. Some cross-linkers have to be used for this modification, such as formaldehyde-based resins, polyacrylic ester, epoxy. As a biomass material, furfuryl alcohol is more friendly than formaldehyde-based crosslinkers for protein-based adhesive. To guide the preparation of protein-based adhesive, especially the soy-based adhesive, the reaction between a simple dipeptide N-(2)-L-alanyl-L-glutamine (AG), used as a model compound of protein, and its cross-linker furfuryl alcohol was studied in this paper. The products prepared with furfuryl alcohol and AG under different pHs were analyzed by ESI-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometer),13C-NMR (carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) and FT-IR. It was found that the medium environment had great effects on the competition of the co-condensation reaction between furfuryl alcohol and AG and self-condensation reaction of furfuryl alcohol molecules in the mixing system with furfuryl alcohol and AG. Under alkaline conditions, both co-condensation and self-condensation were not obviously detected. Only when the value of pH was higher than 11, a few co-condensation reaction products were gotten. The reaction occurred mainly between furfuryl alcohol and the primary amido groups of AG. Under acid conditions, both co-condensation and self-condensation were observed. The more acid the preparation conditions, the easier to be observed the self-condensation of furfuryl alcohol molecules than the co-condensation between furfuryl alcohol and AG. And when the value of pH was higher than 5, both co-condensation and self-condensation were not outstanding. In this study, under pH value 3, the co-condensation and self-condensation found equilibrium. There was a great possibility for the primary amido and aliphatic amino groups of AG molecules to react with furfuryl alcohol molecules. No reaction was detected between the secondary amido groups of AG and furfuryl alcohol. Besides, the reaction mechanism between furfuryl alcohol and model compounds of soy protein had correspondence with the performance of plywood with soy protein-based adhesive, namely, soy protein-based adhesive crosslinked by furfuryl alcohol showed better bonding performance and water resistance under the pH value of 3 than that of others. In conclusion, the research has great significance to realize the scientific use and improve the market competitiveness of soy protein-based adhesives. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Design/methodology/approach: Evaluation was carried out by weight loss and electrochemical techniques. The surface morphology and the composition of the elements of adsorption layer are studied by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer. Findings: The experimental results reveal that the maximum value of inhibition efficiency appear at an extreme point of concentration with the increase of concentration of the inhibitors. Ornidazole has better corrosion inhibition than metronidazole but not as tinidazole. The inhibitors all act as cathodic type corrosion inhibitor. The adsorption of ornidazole, metronidazole and tinidazole on mild steel obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm and belongs to chemisorption of electron donating. Combined with the molecular structure of the corrosion inhibitor and the experimental structure, the authors propose a detailed mechanism analysis. Originality/value: The expired nitroimidazole antibiotics as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in hydrochloric acid solution is first studied.

Compared to tobacco monoculture and current fertilizer management, rotation and manure amendment increased macroaggregate (>250 μm) proportion and geometric mean diameter and decreased the proportion of microaggregates and silt-clay sized fractions ( © 2018 The Authors","62","Tobacco","Aggregates - Curing - Flues - Manures - Nitrogen fertilizers - Organic carbon - Rotation - Silt - Soil conservation - Stabilization","Aggregate-associated soil organic carbons - Carbon and nitrogen - Fertilizer management - Flue-cured tobacco - Geometric mean diameters - Management systems - Water stable aggregates - Yunnan","406 Highway Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes - 931.1 Mechanics","Number: 2017FB074, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 2017YN09, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YN28, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41601330, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are thankful to Dr. Junying Li and Dr. Bingwu Wang for their valuable assistance and advice in the preparation of this paper.

This deposit structurally occurs in the Mile-Shizong-Shuicheng regional fault and is an important part of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou (SYG) Pb-Zn metallogenic province. Ore body is buried and occurs along the interlayer tectonic belt as stratiform shape. Sulfide ore is hosted by the middle Permian Yangxin Formation dolostone. Ore minerals are mainly sphalerite, minor galena and pyrite, with rare chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite, and gangue minerals are dominantly calcite and dolomite. Sulfide ore has massive, veined or disseminated structures with granular (euhedral, subhedral and anhedral) and metasomatic relict textures. There are more than 5 million tones (Mt) of sulfide ore, grading >10% Zn + Pb, and can up to 60% Zn + Pb. This paper presents the detailed ore deposit geology, and C-O, S and Pb isotopic data, aiming to reveal the sources of mineralizing elements and ore genesis. Calcite has δ13 C values ranging from 1.25‰ to 2.01‰, mean 1.64‰, which are similar to those of marine carbonate rocks, but are higher than those of mantle and sedimentary organic matters. However, δ18 O values of calcite range from 17.21‰ to 17.74‰ (mean 17.49‰), which are lower than those of carbonate rocks and organic matters, but are higher than those of mantle. Such C-O isotopic data suggests that the source of C is carbonate wall rocks, and O isotope signatures are generated by water/rock interaction between fluids and carbonate rocks. δ34 S values of sulfide minerals range from 10.04‰ to 16.43‰ (av. 14.12‰), indicating a feature of heavy S isotopes-enriched and the sources of reduced S in the hydrothermal fluids are originated mainly from evaporites within sedimentary strata by thermal-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR). Single-grain galena has206Pb/204Pb,207Pb/204Pb and208Pb/204Pb ratios ranging from 18.530 to 18.610 (av. 18.564), 15.694 to 15.702 (av. 15.697) and 38.569 to 38.657 (av. 38.601), respectively. These Pb isotopic data overlap with those of ore-formation age-corrected country sedimentary rocks and basement metaphoric rocks. Such Pb isotopic signatures demonstrate that the main sources of metal Pb are sediments and basements. This study proposes that the Fule is a carbonate-hosted, anticline and interlayer structure-controlled, stratiform, epigenetic, dispersed elements-enriched and high grade Pb-Zn deposit that formed under the background of tectonic regime shifted from extension to compression and then to extension. All those metallogenic features are probable to be related to both the Emeishan mafic magmatism and Indosinian Orogeny. © 2018 Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

For the design and performance optimization of MCAO technology, it is necessary to measure the atmospheric turbulence profiles of the site. The inversion linear equations of the methods based on differential image motion variance or covariance of extended object are obtained through discretization. The discretization error causes the effective field of view (FOV) not to be very wide. A small FOV limits the number of equations, resulting in turbulence profile inversion results being affected by motion variance or covariance measurement errors. In this paper, taking the PML method as an example, we propose a layer integral coefficient matrix method. This method obviously reduces the discretization error, greatly improves the range of observation FOV, reduces the influence of the covariance error on the measurement results, and improves the accuracy of the turbulence profile inversion. The simulation results show that the FOV of the PML method using layer integral coefficient matrix can reach 400', and the measurement error is also greatly reduced. © 2018, Chinese Lasers Press.

It is found that the deep trap density increases remarkably at the beginning of thermal aging (before 1600 h), but it decreases obviously as the aging degree increases. At elevated aging temperature and, in particular considering the presence of air gap between two-layer insulation, the peak densities of deep traps decrease more significant in the late period of aging. It can be concluded that it is the released energy from de-trapping process leads to the fast degradation of insulation. Moreover, after thermal aging, the microstructure changes of crystallinity and molecular structures are analyzed via the x-ray diffraction experiment and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results indicate that the variation of the deep trap density is closely linked with the changes of microstructure, a larger interface of crystalline/amorphous phase, more defects and broken chains caused by thermal aging form higher deep trap density stored in the samples. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","23","Polyester resins","Crystalline materials - Defects - Epoxy resins - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Isotherms - Microstructure - Plastic films - Polyesters - Polymer films - Thermal aging - X ray diffraction","Aging temperatures - Air-gaps - Charge de-trapping - Degradation of insulations - Fourier transform infrared spectrometer - Isothermal relaxation currents - Microstructure changes - Released energy","801 Chemistry - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 817.1 Polymer Products - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2015CB251003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFB0902702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This paper is supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2015CB251003) and the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2017YFB0902702).

These modifiers play an important role in recognizing the sentiment intensity of multi-word phrases because they may lead to an intensity shift and polarity reversal for the words they modify. Appropriately modeling the effect of such modifiers on intensity shift can greatly improve the performance of phrase-level sentiment intensity prediction. To this end, this paper proposes two neural network (NN) models organized in a pipelined fashion to determine 1) the intensity of individual words and 2) shift weights of modifiers representing the degrees of intensity change for the words they modify. The phrase intensity can then be determined by combining the word intensity and modifier weight. When measuring word intensity, the first NN model introduces a hidden layer as a filter to select appropriate similar seed words in the prediction process. In learning modifier weights, the second NN model considers both the weights of individual and group of modifiers to capture various intensity shift effects caused by the modifiers. Experiments on a SemEval-2016 dataset showed that the proposed method yielded better prediction performance for both single words and multi-word phrases.

Sulfidization flotation is an extensively used method to recover copper/lead/zinc oxide minerals, and sulfidization is a key part of this methodology. In this review, five oxidized minerals bearing copper, lead or zinc were introduced. Roles on oxidized minerals flotation of sulfidation were dissected. The surface sulfidization mechanism of oxide minerals and its influenced factors were presented. Two stages are involved in the sulphidizing process: chemical adsorption and chemical reaction. After adsorption on the particle surface, the sulfide ions might react with oxide minerals to form a metal sulfide coating, which activate minerals flotation. The sulphidizing reactions are affected by pH and slurry temperature, sulphidizing reactions time, sulphidizing agent dosage and its addition form, metal ions and minerals characteristic, etc. There may be interaction among the factors. Surface sulfidization can be enhanced with some reagents which can improve the rate and limit of sulphidizing reactions, or mechanical strength of reaction products. The results suggested that some influence factors and mechanism of enhanced sulfidization are unclear. In order to guide practice better, further studies on them are needed based on multidiscipline approaches, in-situ measuring technique and computer simulation which are also the research directions and inevitable requirement for flotation. © 2018, Chemical Industry Press.

The connection between the notion of local probabilistic epistemic truth degree and belief function is also established. Based upon the fundamental notion of the global epistemic truth degree, the notion of epistemic similarity degree is also proposed and a kind of pseudo-metric used for approximate reasoning in MEL is thus derived. The obtained results provide a useful supplement to the existing study in the sense that it offers a quantitative approach instead of the qualitative manner in the literature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","26","Probability distributions","Computer circuits - Uncertainty analysis","Approximate reasoning - Incomplete information - Incomplete knowledge - Quantitative approach - Quantitative logic - Similarity degree - Truth degree - Uncertainty theory","721.3 Computer Circuits - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The scavenging capacity against hydroxyl, superoxide anion and 2, 2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate free radicals (ABTS+•), and reducing power were investigated by comparing with walnut oil and rutin as controls. The results indicated the quality of the oil obtained by hydraulic pressing was improved compared with those obtained by other pressing methods; color parameters L, a and b values of the oil were 99.78, -1. 44 and 2.99, respectively, acid value was 0.648 6 mg/g, and peroxide value was 0.466 8 mmol/kg. The oil obtained by hydraulic pressing contained five unsaturated fatty acids, together accounting for 83. 89% of the total fatty acids, including linoleic acid (62.66%), palmitoleic acid(16.75%) and octadecenoic acid (1.47%), as well as 679.11 μg/mL of total phenolics. All of the oils showed concentration dependent antioxidant activity, which could strongly scavenge hydroxyl and superoxide anion free radicals and also exhibited scavenging activity against ABTS+• as well as reducing power. The hydroxyl free radical (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)=1.31 mg/mL) scavenging activity and reducing power (IC50=14.78 mg/mL) of the oil obtained by hydraulic pressing were stronger than those of other oils but weaker than rutin. In addition, the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity (IC50=0.029 mg/mL) was higher than that of cold-pressed oil and rutin but lower than that of hotpressed oil and walnut oil at the same concentration, whereas the opposite was observed for ABTS+• scavenging activity(IC50=12.88 mg/mL). Correlation analysis showed that total phenolic contents in macadamia oils obtained by different pressing methods and walnut oil had good correlations with their hydroxyl and ABTS+• scavenging capacity and reducing power with R values of 0.951 9, 0.910 7 and 0.939 4 (P © 2018, China Food Publishing Company.

Although the understanding of the sediment transport rates in the Mekong is gradually growing, the sediment dynamics in the lower Mekong floodplains (downstream from Kratie) are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to conduct an analysis to increase the understanding of the sediment dynamics at the Chaktomuk confluence of the Mekong River, and the Tonle Sap River in the Lower Mekong River in Cambodia. This study is based on the data from a detailed field survey over the three hydrological years (May 2008-April 2011) at the two sites (the Mekong mainstream and the Tonle Sap River) at the Chaktomuk confluence. We further compared the sediment fluxes at Chaktomuk to an upstream station (i.e. Mukdahan) with longer time series. Inflow sediment load towards the lake was lower than that of the outflow, with a ratio on average of 84%. Although annually only a small amount of sediment load from the Tonle Sap contributes to the delta (less than 15%), its share is substantial during the February-April period. The annual sediment load transport from the confluence to the delta in 2009 and 2010 accounted for 54 and 50 Mt, respectively. This was on average only 55% of the sediment fluxes measured at Mukdahan, a more upstream station. Furthermore when compared to sediment loads further downstream at the Cambodia-Vietnam border, we found that the suspended sediment flux continued to decline towards the South China Sea. Our findings thus indicate that the sediment load to the South China Sea is much lower than the previous estimate 150-160 Mt/yr. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","44","Rivers","Sediment transport - Suspended sediments","Cambodia - Hydrological years - Mekong River - Sediment dynamic - Sediment transport rate - Suspended sediment flux - Tonle saps - Upstream stations","483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to automatically guide and drive micro/nano robots to target in vascular network, a navigation strategy is desired. In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm based on A∗ search is proposed. The MRA image is preliminarily processed to extract major vessels. Then, pixel-based A∗ search algorithm identifies the shortest path between start point and target without human supervision.

The starting materials for the syngas are low quality lignite, which cannot be used for other applications, and phosphogypsum (PG), the byproduct of wet phosphoric acid. The results show that the CO production is mainly due to the following reaction: (CaSO4 + 4C → CaS + 4CO) and (C + CO2 → 2CO), while the main reactions of H2 generation are (CO2 + H2O(g) + 2CH4 → 3CO + 5H2) and (C + H2O(g) → CO + H2). The analysis results indicate that high temperature and water vapor content are detrimental for phosphogypsum recycling. Furthermore, after three times recycling of phosphogypsum, some sintering is observed. The composition of syngas is very important for the corresponding applications. Therefore, the relationships between reaction factors and products are also investigated. The results of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) show that H2 and CH4 generation are strongly dependent on water vapor content. The influence of the different factors on CO yield is in the following order: PG/lignite's molar ratio > temperature > water vapor. Among the three factors, reaction temperature effect on CO2 generation is less than that of the other factors. Moreover, the reaction temperature and the PG/lignite's molar ratio have a great influence on lignite decomposition. The results of this work can provide some guidance for preparing syngas with the desired composition by the CLG process. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","60","Analysis of variance (ANOVA)","Gas generators - Gasification - Gypsum - Lignite - Oxygen - Sintering - Synthesis gas - Water recycling - Water vapor","Chemical looping - High temperature - Oxygen Carrier - Phosphogypsum - Reaction mechanism - Reaction temperature - Water vapor contents - Wet phosphoric acids",,"Number: 21666016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this project was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21666016), which is greatly acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To enhance the performance of structure-texture decomposition, a new method based on region covariance of simple image features and total variation optimization is proposed in this paper. We first identify texture from structure by patch-based covariance, which shows highly discriminative power for textures. Then, a total variation model built on the joint covariance and gradient is used for structure-preserving smoothing. To overcome the inherent limitation of covariance descriptor in locating main structures, patch shifting based on the variation of the region covariance is introduced. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art structure-preserving decomposition methods and the results show that our approach outperforms them in removing unimportant texture details while preserving main structures. Even for images containing the mixture of high-contrast textures with obscure boarders between them, our approach still can improve the decomposition at few extra cost of computation. Besides better decomposition results and robustness for various types of images, the simplicity of our approach make it easy to implement and adaptable to other applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","53","Structural optimization","Image enhancement - Image texture","Conventional structures - Covariance descriptor - Decomposition methods - Discriminative power - Inherent limitations - Patch shift - Region covariance - Total variation",,"Number: 2015Y018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 61540062, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61540062) and the Science Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (Grant No. 2015Y018).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In general, the parameters of S-PCNN are set manually, which is complex and time-consuming and usually causes inconsistence. In this paper, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to overcome these shortcomings and improve fusion performance. Firstly, source images are divided into several equidimension sub-blocks, and then, spatial frequency is calculated as the characteristic factor of the sub-block to get the whole source image’s characterization factor matrix (CFM), and by this way the operand can be effectively reduced. Secondly, S-PCNN is used for the analysis of the CFM to get its oscillation frequency graph (OFG). Thirdly, the fused CFM will be got according to the OFG. Finally, the fused image will be reconstructed according to the fused CFM and block rule. In this process, the parameters of S-PCNN are set by PSO algorithm to get the best fusion effect. By CFM and block method, the operand of the proposed method will be effectively reduced. The experiments indicate that the multi-focus image fusion algorithm is more efficient than other traditional image fusion algorithms, and it proves that the automatically parameters setting method is effective as well. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","46","Image fusion","Feature extraction - Image processing - Neural networks - Object recognition - Parameter estimation - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Processing","Characteristic factors - Characterization factors - Image fusion algorithms - Image fusion methods - Image processing - methods - Multifocus image fusion - Oscillation frequency - Pulse coupled neural network",,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: 61640306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

The influences of F/M molar ratio and pH on the polymer structures were investigated based on the quantitative 13C-NMR analysis. The results show that both F/M molar ratio and pH influence the competitive formation of ether and methylene bridges. For the cases of F/M = 2.0, and 3.0, methylene bridge formation is minor in contrast to ether bridges either at pH = 9.3-9.8 or at 7.3-7.8. When the molar ratio was lowered to 1.0, methylene bridges became competitive with ether bridges at pH = 9.3-9.8, but the latter is still more favorable. When the lower molar ratio overlaps with the lower pH, significant changes were found. The content of methlylene bridges was over three times that of ether bridges with M/F = 1.0 and at pH = 7.3-7.8.

A sustainable reduction of CaTiO3 commenced with greater calcium metal participation, and the calcium metal content was determined using the CaO concentration in the molten salt. The effect of CaO concentration on the direct electrochemical reduction of a bulk ilmenite pellet was studied. The results proved that the dissolved CaO had an appreciable effect on the phase transformation. Upon the addition of 1 mol% CaO into equimolar CaCl2-NaCl molten salt, the deoxidization rate of ilmenite was promoted, leading to the complete production of an FeTi alloy in fine and homogeneous microstructures with a particle size of 2–8 μm.

While loading precious metals like platinum nanoclusters on mullite SMO is an effective approach to enhance its catalytic performance, the high cost of noble metals has limited its large scale application. In this work, we systematically study an alternative approach to composite catalyst formation by loading non-precious metal oxides MOx (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) onto SMO mullite for CO oxidation. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses show that composite catalysts are successfully formed by loading MOx nanoparticles at a content of ∼0.75 wt% through the deposition precipitation (DP) method. Except for FeOx, MOx loaded samples in general exhibit much higher reaction rates of CO oxidation than bare SMO especially at the temperature range below 100 °C. The promoted activity for MOx/SMO composites can be attributed to the improved reducibility of adsorbed oxygen (Oads) and the increased oxidation state of Mn cations at the interface. Such behavior accelerates the decomposition of carbonates, as indicated by the H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy results. We demonstrate that the best catalytic performance of the CuOx/SMO composite also stems from the additional CO adsorption on the CuOx sites.

The findings show that this approach is effective in reducing feature dimensions and improves prediction accuracy.

Previous reports indicated that the double impulses consist of two parts, the step response and the impulse response, which can be observed in the vibration generated by a spalled ball bearing. A step and an impulse responses will occur when a rolling element is entering and exiting the spall zone, respectively. Precise measurement of the space between the two parts can be employed to estimate the length of the spall zone along the rotating direction, and provide a possibility to evaluate the remaining useful life (RUL) of faulty bearings under running conditions. However, all the previous works are only concerned with the metal ball bearings. The double-impulse phenomenon generated by faulty hybrid ceramic ball bearings is rarely reported. To address this issue, the double-impulse phenomenon of hybrid ceramic ball bearings with different spall lengths on their outer races will be investigated in this paper. The pre-whitening, kurtogram and squared envelop are employed to extract the two events (the entry and the exit) from the picked vibration. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid ceramic ball bearing with an outer race spall can generate shaper double-impulse phenomenon than that from the faulty metal bearings with almost the same outer race spall length. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","13","Roller bearings","Ball bearings - Ceramic materials - Impulse response - Spalling","Double impulse - Experimental investigations - Hybrid ceramics - Precise measurements - Remaining useful lives - Rolling Element Bearing - Rotating direction - Running conditions",,"Number: 51365023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The project sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51365023).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, a combined ultrasonic-microwave method was developed to remove oil and recover molybdenum (Mo) from the spent HDS catalyst. Firstly, ethanol was used to extract the surface oil of the spent MoNiCo/Al2O3 catalyst with ultrasonic assistance. Effects of temperature, ultrasonic time, liquid-solid ratio and ultrasonic power on the oil removal rate were investigated systematically and the process conditions were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that the oil removal rate was over 99% under the optimum conditions of temperature 55 °C, ultrasonic time 2 h, liquid to solid ratio 5:1, and ultrasonic power 600 W. After oil removal, the sample was roasted in microwave field at 500 °C for 15 min. The generation of toxic gas could be effectively avoided and no hardest-to-recycle impurity CoMoO4 was found. At last, the roasted sample was subjected to ultrasonic leaching with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution for recovering Mo. Extraction of Mo of the deoiled sample after microwave roasting reached 94.3%, which is about 7% higher than that of oily sample. Moreover, microwave roasting method resulted in a much higher Mo extraction than traditional method for both the oily and deoiled spent catalyst. It was concluded that the ultrasonic-microwave assisted method could remarkably improve the recovery of Mo and greatly shorten the processing time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","42","Metal recovery","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Calcination - Catalysts - Cobalt compounds - Extraction - Hydrodesulfurization - Impurities - Leaching - Microwaves - Molybdenum - Nickel compounds - Sodium Carbonate - Sodium compounds - Temperature - Ultrasonics","Effects of temperature - Hydrodesulfurization catalysts - Liquid to solid ratio - Microwave-assisted methods - Oil removal - Optimum conditions - Response surface methodology - Ultrasonic assistance",,"Number: 2016FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: U1402274, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 51464024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China – Yunnan Joint Foundation of China (No. U1402274 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51562018 , 51564033 , and 51464024 ), and Yunnan Applied Basic Research Project (No. 2016FA023 ).

In this research, carbon dots (CDs) and quantum dots (QDs) were doped inside and electrostatically assembled on electrospun nanofibers (ENFs), affording ratiometrically dual-emitting fluoresecent films. Because of the FRET process between CDs and QDs on NFs and the strong quenching response of QDs to Cu2+, the as-prepared NFs can visually detect Cu2+ with high sensitivity and selectivity based on ratiometric fluorescent signals. By exploiting the release of numerous Cu2+ from CuO nanoparticles (NPs) under acidic conditions, a sandwich-type immunoassay with CuO NPs-labeled antibody was developed for the detection of biomarker proteins via the response of dual-emitting and FRET-based NFs to different Cu2+ concentrations. Taking advantage of the ratiometrically fluorescent property of these ENFFs as well as the Cu2+-mediated signal amplification strategy, alpha fetoprotein can be detected with high sensitivity (detection limit of 8.3 pg/mL) and selectivity. This strategy demonstrates a promising candidate with a point-of-care assay for clinical diagnostics and biomedical research.

The use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, aka drones) equipped with various types of cameras is considered to be a flexible and low-cost platform for monitoring cultivated land changes. However, image pairs of the same scene taken from different viewpoints often contain discontinuous rotated images with illuminated variations. To address these problems, a novel small UAV based multi-viewpoint image registration method for monitoring cultivated land changes in mountainous terrain is proposed. First, a mixed feature descriptor (MFD) is defined for measuring global and local discrepancies between two datapoint sets, and a deterministic annealing scheme is employed to control the balance of the MFD. Second, the mixed feature finite mixture model (MFMM) is formulated to be the estimation of mixture densities. Finally, the double geometric constraints for L2 -minimizing estimate L2E based energy optimization is formulated in order to calculate a reasonable position in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Extensive experiments on UAV images with different viewpoints are conducted.

Finally, the simulation process was carried out with ANSOFT HFSS 15.0 by changing the flare angle of the biconical antenna. As a result, an asymmetric biconical antenna with the impedance bandwidth of 3.1GHz-10.6GHz was designed. Within this operating frequency, the antenna has an omnidirectional radiation pattern, the voltage standing wave ratio (VWRS) is less than 1.8, the return loss (S11) is less than 10.5dB, and the average gain can reach more than 5dBi, the comprehensive performance is relatively better than classic biconical antenna, it can effectively satisfies the basic requirements of antenna communication system. © 2018 IEEE.","19","Directional patterns (antenna)","Bandwidth - Electric impedance - Microwave antennas - Omnidirectional antennas","Asymmetric - Asymmetric biconical antenna - Asymmetric configurations - Biconical antenna - Omnidirectional radiation pattern - Performance - Simulation - Voltage standing-wave ratio","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

High-thermostability phytases are particularly desirable due to their ability to withstand transient high temperatures during feed pelleting procedures. A comparison of crystal structures of the widely used industrial Aspergillus niger PhyA phytase (AnP) with its close homolog, the thermostable Aspergillus fumigatus phytase (AfP), suggests 18 residues in three segments associated with thermostability. In this work, we aim to improve the thermostability of AnP through site-directed mutagenesis. We identified favorable mutations based on structural comparison of homologous phytases and molecular dynamics simulations. Results: A recombinant phytase (AnP-M1) was created by substituting 18 residues in AnP with their AfP analogs. AnP-M1 exhibited greater thermostability than AnP at 70 °C. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested newly formed hydrogen bonding interactions with nine substituted residues give rise to the improved themostability. Thus, another recombinant phytase (AnP-M2) with just these nine point substitutions was created. AnP-M2 demonstrated superior thermostability among all AnPs at ≥70 °C: AnP-M2 maintained 56% of the maximal activity after incubation at 80 °C for 1 h; AnP-M2 retained 30-percentage points greater residual activity than that of AnP and AnP-M1 after 1 h incubation at 90 °C. Conclusions: The resulting AnP-M2 is an attractive candidate in industrial applications, and the nine substitutions in AnP-M2 are advantageous for phytase thermostability. This work demonstrates that a strategy combining structural comparison of homologous enzymes and computational simulation to focus on important interactions is an effective method for obtaining a thermostable enzyme. © 2018 The Author(s).","31","Enzymes","Aspergillus - Hydrogen bonds - Molecular dynamics - Mutagenesis - Nutrients - Stability","Molecular dynamics simulations - Phytases - Site directed mutagenesis - Structural comparison - Thermostability","461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry","Number: 31660240, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31660304, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31660240 and No. 31660304), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFB0308401), Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2016FD018).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Chronic injection of d-galactose (d-gal) can accelerate the aging process similar to natural aging and is commonly used to build an aging model to investigate aging. In the present study, the effects of piceatannol on d-gal-induced aging in mice were evaluated. Piceatannol treatment showed an observable anti-aging effect. Results obtained in vivo showed that piceatannol retained spontaneous motor activity and enhanced spatial learning and memory abilities in mice in which aging was induced by d-gal. Morphometric analysis displayed that piceatannol prevented d-gal-induced neuronal loss, increased the number of Nissl bodies, and promoted cell proliferation in the hippocampus and cortex. Piceatannol also significantly decreased the level of MDA and elevated SOD and CAT activity in the hippocampal and cortical tissues. Furthermore, western blotting results revealed that piceatannol treatment noticeably reversed the suppression of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased the expressions of HO-1 and NOQ1 in mice with aging induced by d-gal. Furthermore, piceatannol activated the Nrf2 pathway in natural aging mice, whereas treatment with the Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol reversed the increased expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NOQ1. In conclusion, treatment with piceatannol ameliorates behavioral disorder and brain injury in an aging mouse model; this suggests that piceatannol is a promising pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of age-associated diseases. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","41","Mammals","Brain - Cell proliferation - Neurology - Neurons","Chronic injection - Complex Processes - Cortical tissues - Morphometric analysis - Neurological deficit - Nuclear translocations - Spatial learning - Western blotting","461 Bioengineering and Biology","Number: 201736, Acronym: HLJUCM, Sponsor: Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine; Number: 2013HB099, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016-I2M-3-015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81673667, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81673667), the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Science (CIFMS) (no. 2016-I2M-3-015), the Middle-aged Academic Leaders and Reserved Talent Foundation of Yunnan (no. 2013HB099), and the Science Research Fund Project of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine (no. 201736).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

If improper linear control, the compression performance of the material cannot be fully played after the arch rib is formed, which has a great influence on the state of the bridge. In order to make the arch axis of the bridge more reasonable, this paper takes a concrete-filled steel tube arch bridge with a span 60m as an example.

Total conversion of ethanol is obtained in SRE and OSRE with high stability. A higher production of H2 (60 L h−1 gcat−1) can be achieved at a reaction temperature of 300 °C in OSRE conditions compared to SRE (10 L h−1 gcat−1) mainly because of a beneficial use of a high concentration of ethanol (14 mol%) in presence of O2. Moreover, carbon formation is decreased and a much lower input of energy of 50 °C is used to get a temperature of 300 °C when O2 is added.

In this study, eight near-isogenic Wx wheat lines were bred and used as test materials for analysis of the content and biosynthesis dynamics of starch, and the changes in flour and dry noodle qualities were evaluated. The results showed that the contents and accumulation rates of amylose, amylopectin, and total starch initially increased and then decreased at 20 d after anthesis. Additionally, the three Wx genes examined in this study had varying effects on the amylose content and accumulation rate, in the order of Wx-B1 > Wx-A1 > Wx-D1. Wx genes had only minor effects on amylopectin biosynthesis. Lack of Wx gene expression was expected to affect the physiochemical properties of wheat flour, with the Wx-B1 gene exhibiting the most dramatic effects. Almost all properties except taste, stickiness, and total score of dry noodles decreased following silencing of the Wx-B1 and Wx-D1 genes. Dry noodle qualities deteriorated to different degrees after silencing of one, two, or three Wx genes, and almost no amylose biosynthesis and very poor dry noodle quality were observed in wheat lacking all three Wx genes.
