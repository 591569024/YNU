Herein, performance and microbial community dynamics of the AGS were assessed with stepwise increasing influent loads. RESULTS: AGS exhibited good structure stability and effective removal efficiency; when the influent load increased from 6.5 kg COD m-3d-1(0.255 NH4+-N m-3d-1) to 10.1 kg COD m-3d-1(0.455 kg NH4+-N m-3d-1). COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies reached 97.1–97.9% and 84.5–98%, respectively. As indicated from the PCR-DGGE results, the microbial community and dominant species in the AGS also gradually evolved along with the increase of influent loads. A coincidence was observed, namely, three main distinct clusters of the phylogenetic tree appeared respectively in the three stages of influent loads. The microbial diversity attained a maximum in the medium loads stage. The identified bacteria mainly belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The dominant species were responsible for the AGS stability and pollutant removal. CONCLUSION: Variation in the influent load strongly affected the microbial community dynamics, and hence the AGS performance. These results and understanding could lead to potential improvements in guiding AGS wastewater treatment. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry","42","Lead removal (water treatment)","Dynamics - Efficiency - Granular materials - Microorganisms - Polymerase chain reaction - Wastewater treatment","Aerobic granular sludges - Influent loads - Microbial communities - PCR-DGGE - Piggery wastewater","445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 913.1 Production Engineering - 951 Materials Science","Number: KLCAS-2012-04, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: KLCAS-2016-01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: KLCAS-2013-01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","This study was funded by the Open Fund from Key Laboratory of Environmental and Applied Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Nos.

This property along with the high water absorption under wide range of pH values qualified the material for application as adsorbent/ligand to metal ions from aqueous solutions. This was additionally signified using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra collected for the graft before and after chelation to metal ions that cause water hardness, which confirmed that the oxygenated and nitrogenated groups are the main sites for binding metal ions in high capacity with removal efficiency above 90% in most cases. Application of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models for the metal ions on the graft copolymer indicated that the adsorption data are better fitted by Freundlich model for all metal ions while a chemisorption nature of adsorption was deduced by a kinetic modeling study. Further, the adsorption was highly favoured in case of Ca(II) and Mg(II) while to a much lesser extent in case of Na(I). The polymeric ligand showed also outstanding performance during competitive removal of a mixture of metal ions from aqueous solution with a selectivity order Ca(II)>Mg(II)>>Na(I), such selective removal activity of the ligand was almost not influenced after induced desorption and reuse for additional four succeeding cycles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite having high amino acid identity, KRAS and HRAS have very different codon usage biases: the HRAS gene contains many common codons, and KRAS is enriched for rare codons. Rare codons in KRAS suppress its protein expression, which has been shown to affect both normal and cancer biology in mammals. Here, using HRAS or KRAS expression in different human cell lines and in vitro transcription and translation assays, we show that KRAS rare codons inhibit both translation efficiency and transcription and that the contribution of these two processes varies among different cell lines. We observed that codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency such that WT KRAS mRNA is poorly translated. On the other hand, common codons increased transcriptional rates by promoting activating histone modifications and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Finally, we found that codon usage also influences KRAS protein conformation, likely because of its effect on co-translational protein folding. Together, our results reveal that codon usage has multidimensional effects on protein expression, ranging from effects on transcription to protein folding in human cells. © 2018 Fu et al.","65","Transcription","Cell culture - Diseases - Efficiency - Mammals - Protein folding - Proteins","Cancer biology - Codon usage bias - Histone modification - Human cell lines - Multidimensional effects - Protein conformation - Protein expressions - Transcriptional co-activators","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: R01CA94184, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Welch Foundation; Number: P01CA203657, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Welch Foundation; Number: I-1560, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Welch Foundation; Number: 1R35GM118118, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Number: RP160268, Acronym: CPRIT, Sponsor: Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; ","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant 1R35GM118118, Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Grant RP160268, Welch Foundation Grant I-1560 (to Y.

The main purpose of this work is to obtain better mechanical properties when the metal binder of the diamond tools was prepared by the MPS method. The orthogonal experimental method is adopted to design the sintering process parameters. The optimized experimental conditions are suggested as 880 °C of sintering temperature, 375 MPa of cold pressure, and 35 min of withholding time. The contrastive investigation of the MPS and conventional pressureless sintering (CPS) are performed under optimized conditions. The microstructures information are obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and the necessary mechanical properties, such as relative density, hardness, and flexural strength are tested. Experimental results show that the MPS method, compared with CPS, can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the metallic matrix. The factors of relative density, hardness, and flexural strength increase 1.25%, 3.86%, and 6.28%, respectively. The possible sintering mechanism of the MPS method is also discussed.

(Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-HA composites possessed matrix of β-Ti phase, residual of α-Ti phase and ceramic phases (TCP, CaZrO3, CaO and Ti5P3). With the increase of HA concentration, the increase of ceramic phases and the hindering effect of α to β phase were observed. Results of electrochemical tests revealed that composites containing 0–10 wt.% HA exhibited higher corrosion resistance.

The optimal ratio of added elemental Ag was 15%, which degraded 89% of MO within 20 min. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BiOBr0.3I0.7/Ag/AgI can be ascribed to the efficient separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs through a Z-scheme charge-carrier migration pathway, in which Ag nanoparticles act as electron mediators.

The results indicate that the experimental data of HS(z) are consistent with the theoretical calculations, both location and extent of the steel bars corrosion can be qualitatively determined by using HS(z). The gradient K of HS(z) is approximately linearly related to the loss rate, S, of the bending strength, which can be used to evaluate the residual bending strength of the corroded reinforced concrete beam.

It is revealed that BFO nanoplates grew via an oriented attachment of layer by layer, giving rise to the formation of the inner interface within the nanoplates. In particular, antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase-transition temperature (Néel temperature, TN) of the BFO nanoplates is significantly enhanced from typical 370 to ∼512 °C, whereas the Curie temperature (TC) of the BFO nanoplates is determined to be ∼830 °C, in good agreement with a bulk value. The combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and the first-principle calculations reveals that the interfacial tensile strain remarkably improves the stability of AFM ordering, accounting for the significant enhancement in TNof BFO plates. Correspondingly, the tensile strain induced the polarization and oxygen octahedral tilting has been observed near the interface. The findings presented here suggest that single-crystal BFO nanoplate is an ideal system for exploring an intrinsic magnetoelectric property, where a tensile strain can be a very promising approach to tailor AFM ordering and polarization rotation for an enhanced coupling effect. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","47","Tensile strain","Antiferromagnetism - Bismuth compounds - Chromium compounds - Electron energy levels - Electron energy loss spectroscopy - Electron scattering - Energy dissipation - Fluorine compounds - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Ions - Iron compounds - Nanostructures - Polarization - Scanning electron microscopy - Single crystals - Transmission electron microscopy","Antiferromagnetics - First principle calculations - Hydrothermal methods - Magnetoelectric properties - Nanoplates - Oriented attachment - Polarization rotation - Scanning transmission electron microscopy","525.4 Energy Losses (industrial and residential) - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 931.1 Mechanics - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 2015M571866, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 51472282, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51602282, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51232006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51602282, 51232006, and 51472282) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M571866).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the unified standard for land cover classification system has not been formed; the production always needs converting to meet the actual needs. Therefore, it proposed a refined classification method based on multi source of remote sensing information fusion. It takes the third-level classes of forest land and grassland for example, and has collected the thematic data of Vegetation Map of China (1:1,000,000), attempts to develop refined classification utilizing raster spatial analysis model. Study area is selected, and refined classification is achieved by using the proposed method. The results show that land cover within study area is divided principally among 20 classes, from subtropical broad-leaved forest (31131) to grass-forb community type of low coverage grassland (41192); what's more, after 30 years in the study area, climatic factors, developmental rhythm characteristics and vegetation ecological geographical characteristics have not changed fundamentally, only part of the original vegetation types have changed in spatial distribution range or land cover types. Research shows that refined classification for the third-level classes of forest land and grassland could make the results take on both the natural attributes of the original and plant community ecology characteristics, which could meet the needs of some industry application, and has certain practical significance for promoting the product of The First National Geographic Conditions Census. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The results show that, with tf increases, U50 of insulator with metallic conducting particle attached to its surface and rod- plate gap presents a 'U' sharped curve. However, U50 of coaxial bus with a needle attached to it increases approximately linearly with tf increases, and gradually approaches to a stable value. The U-t characteristic is studied and results show that the form of U-t characteristic curve of the rod- plate electrode changes with tf, and when gas gap distance (d) increases, the minimum breakdown voltage increases, the inflection point of v-t characteristic curve moves right too. When choosing coaxial bus with protrusion attached to it as the insulation defect, with tf increasing, the breakdown voltages become more decentralized, the U-t characteristic curve becomes flat. Moreover, when the protrusion is a needle, with the length (l) of needle increasing, the breakdown voltages become lower and less decentralized, and the probability of breakdown occurance after the inflection point of v-t characteristic curve rises.

These RPMs’ application in high altitude mountainous areas networks (HAMANETs) environment requires further validation and studies. Through using the measured path loss in the HAMANETs at 2.6 GHz to calculate the predicted value of the five RPMs and the measured value’s mean error (ME), root mean square error, and error standard deviation (ESTD), we verified the predicted value of the SPM model that is closer to the actual measurement. On this basis, the empirical propagation model in HAMANETs environment is corrected. When correcting, a method to calculate base station’s effective antenna height and propagation distance is provided by using the altitude above sea level data. This method can reduce the error that the mountainous areas are simplified to the flat-terrain in the existed propagation models. A linear least square method is used to calculate the optimal propagation model. Finally, the ME is the smallest, and the ESTD is less than 8 dB, which indicate that the corrected propagation model is more suitable for the actual environmental path loss’s prediction. The results show that the path loss factor of the test area is about 65 dB, including the influence of the high altitude, mountains, vegetation, and air humidity in HAMANETs environment. The study results can provide useful advice to the evaluation and verification of personal wireless communications in the HAMANETs. Furthermore, using the correction method proposed in this paper can correct propagation models suitable for the different propagation environments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of wireless network optimization. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","27","Wireless telecommunication systems","Antennas - Cellular radio systems - Errors - Least squares approximations - Mean square error - Mobile telecommunication systems - Personal communication systems - Radio communication - Radio waves - Sea level - Wave propagation","Empirical propagation models - Linear least square methods - Path loss - Personal wireless communications - Propagation modeling - Wireless communication system - Wireless network optimizations - Wireless personal communications","471.1 Oceanography, General - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The CD and WD can be alternatives and superior to other 2-D approaches because they both exhibits some advantages such as permutation invariance, rotation invariance (reflection invariance) and the ability to measure projection uniformity. The feasibility of those developed techniques was verified by simulation and gas-liquid-particle mixture flowing in a gas-stirred liquid reactor with top-air injection.

Overall, LULC Classification and extraction based on RS images include 3 tasks: data source selection, sampling design, classification method selection and classifier performance evaluation. These tasks are all important, that is, interdependence and mutual influence. The OBIC method has become a popular method of L ULC classification because it makes full use of geographic information system (GIS) technology to process spatial, spectral and textural features in RS images. There are many OBIC algorithms, especially the Machine learning (ML) algorithms offers the potential for effectiveness and efficiency, such as Random forest (RF), Support vector machine (SVM) and so on. The Object-based image classification (OBIC) method involves three stages: segmentation, feature-selection and classification. A large number of studies have proved that there are many problems in each task of the LCLU classification extraction method based on RS images. These problems include design of sample sampling strategy, determination of optimal image segmentation parameters and optimization of parameter of classification algorithm and so on. At present, solving these problems requires frequent human-computer interaction also has a great negative influence on the automatic extraction process of remote sensing classification.

Aiming at the order and bandwidth of the FBE-based band-pass filter which need to be determined by experience, a novel method of parameters optimization based on the principle of information entropy minimum is proposed. Firstly, the Hankel matrix is reconstructed from the original vibration signal in the phase space and the SVD method is used to reduce the noise. The singular value relative change rate is used to determine the order of the model.Then, FBE-based band-pass filtering is performed on the noise-reduced signal, and an optimization method based on the principle of information entropy minimum is used to determine the order and bandwidth of band-pass filter.Finally, the filtered signal is subjected to envelope analysis to extract the characteristic frequency of the bearing fault, and the effectiveness of the band-pass filter is proved by the kurtosis index. Through the numerical simulation and the analysis of the actual bearing fault data, the effectiveness of the method to extract the characteristic frequency of the bearing fault is validated. © 2018, Nanjing Univ. of Aeronautics an Astronautics.

Caves and subterranean habitats are frequently overlooked habitats with diverse communities, which are frequently endemic to a region, karst outcrop or even a single cave. These cave species include a wide range of taxa adapted to cave environments. Within cave systems, bats are key providers of energy for other cave-dependent species. However, identifying caves for conservation prioritisation requires an understanding of cave-dwelling species diversity, patterns of endemism, and conservation status, in addition to a standard mechanism to evaluate risk. In this paper, we present the ‘Bat Cave Vulnerability Index’ (BCVI) as a standard index for evaluating bat caves for conservation prioritisation by determining Biotic Potential (BP) and Biotic Vulnerability (BV) of caves. The Biotic Potential is represented by various species diversity and rarity measurements. The Biotic Vulnerability is represented by the cave geophysical characteristics and human-induced disturbance present. Pilot testing in the southern Philippines has demonstrated that the index is an effective and practicable method to identify bat caves for conservation prioritisation. The biotic potential variables assess the presence of endemic, rare, and threatened bat species and assays the priority level based on an equation. Relative risk and vulnerability were assayed using landscape vulnerability variables, which showed anthropogenic activities were important factors in conservation prioritisation. The application and mechanism of the index potentially provides a valuable, rapid and simple assessment tool in cave conservation with special relevance to bat diversity and vulnerability. Furthermore, the multiple and holistic criteria of the BCVI, and the accessible information for both biotic and landscape features can be adapted to prioritise caves in a wider scale in the tropics, and in other regions with diverse cave ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","76","Conservation","Biodiversity - Caves - Decision making - Ecosystems - Tropics","Anthropogenic threats - Biotic vulnerability - Ecological indicators - Tropical landscape - Umbrella Species","443 Meteorology - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 912.2 Management","Number: Y7GJ021B01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: Y4ZK111B01, Acronym: RCEES, CAS, Sponsor: Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: Y5ZK121B01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We would like to thank our peers and colleagues for the insightful comments and suggestions in the earlier version of the paper.

The obtained dextran-gold nanoparticles (Dex-AuNPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The TEM examinations showed the resultant particles were 4–50 nm in size, monodispersity and uniform particle size distribution. Moreover, the size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the concentration of the reactants. UV–Vis spectra showed that the characteristic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of AuNPs was at about 525 nm. NMR spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopic analysis suggested the detailed structural information of dextran before and after synthesis of AuNPs. XRD and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern analysis demonstrated that the colloidal nanoparticles had a well crystallized structure. The experimental analyses revealed that NaOH played an important role in the synthesis of Dex-AuNPs. And the possible formation mechanism of the fabrication of these Dex-AuNPs was also proposed. MTT assay was utilized to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the synthesized Dex-AuNPs on HeLa cells and SiHa cells. These results suggested that the prepared Dex-AuNPs complexes had excellent biocompatibility and acted as a candidate for further biomedical application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","41","Synthesis (chemical)","Biocompatibility - Dextran - Electron diffraction - Fiber optic sensors - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gold compounds - Gold nanoparticles - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Lanthanum compounds - Medical applications - Metal nanoparticles - Nanomagnetics - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Silicon compounds - Sodium hydroxide - Spectroscopic analysis - Spectrum analysis - Surface plasmon resonance - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction analysis","Biocompatible gold nanoparticles - Biomedical applications - Colloidal nanoparticles - Hydroxide assisted method - Localized surface plasmon resonance - MTT assays - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) - Selected area electron diffraction","461.9.1 Immunology - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2014FB140, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61665014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by NSFC (No. 61665014 and No. 21361028 ), Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (No. 2014FB140 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Because of the complexity of the grounding fault tests, the measured data from tests are rare and valuable, and the detailed distribution of short circuit current in converter station has not been investigated currently. Based on the AC artificial grounding fault test at Funing 500 kV converter station, we experimentally investigated the short circuit current distribution of 500 kV converter station for the first time. After analyzing and simulating the flow direction and value of short circuit current, we proposed a measurement scheme. Measured currents of the grounding device, ground wires of the transmission lines and transformer's neutral-point are provided and compared with PSCAD simulation results together with proper analyzation. Results show that about 40% of the short circuit current is discharged from the earth of the fault tower, about 60% discharged from the ground wires of the fault line, among which about 20% of the short current is discharged from the ground wires close to the opposite converter station, about 30% of the short current is discharged from the grounding grid of the converter station. Meanwhile, currents which flow through the ground wires of the non-fault lines and transformer's neutral-point are both less than 7%, which means that when the fault takes place at AC part, it is not necessary to measure the shunt current from the DC ground wires and the transformers neutral-point. © 2018, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

This paper mines symbiotic relationships implied in prevalent co-location patterns from dynamic spatial databases. Firstly, after analyzing the existed definition of symbiotic patterns, a criterion of judging strong symbiotic patterns is proposed. Secondly, a novel algorithm to mine strong symbiotic patterns from prevalent co-location patterns is presented, named basic algorithm. Third, for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm, an improved algorithm which integrates two expensive operations of the basic algorithm into together, and a pruning strategy with two pruning lemmas are presented.

The differences of flow and heat transfer between the circumferentially non-uniform heated rifled tube (NRT) and uniform heated rifled tube (URT) were investigated. The distributions of temperature field, thermophysical properties, axial velocity and turbulent kinetic energy were analyzed. The mechanism of heat transfer improvement of NRT was comprehensively revealed. Results showed that the maximum inner wall temperature in NRT (Tiw,N,max) was 10 K lower than that in URT for the simulation conditions. Both radial and circumferential heat transfers were improved in NRT due to the swirling flow. Under high q/G (ratio of heat flux to mass flux) conditions, the buoyancy effect was weakened in NRT comparing to that in URT. Flow turbulence in boundary layer of y+ > 30 was intensified in NRT, which was crucial for supercritical fluid heat transfer.

Finally reconstruct the image based on the color combination equation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme performs well and has superiorities over other existing typical and state of art ones in both subjective visual performance and objective criteria to a certain extent. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","16","Image fusion","Color - Image processing - Mathematical morphology - Morphology - Nearest neighbor search","Color distortions - Color image fusions - K nearest neighbor (KNN) - KNN matting - Objective criteria - Shearlet transforms - Structural similarity - Visual performance","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 951 Materials Science","Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors’ work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 61463052 and no. 61365001).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, previous studies have typically equated virtual resources with ordinary items and designs corresponding to specific auction mechanisms, which cannot truly reflect the characteristics of the virtual resource. This inability to reflect the virtual resource characteristics arises because the users have only the right to use resources without ownership, the use of virtual resources has significant impacts on the social welfare and revenue of the resource provider, and the virtual resource usage will generate operating costs. Considering the above issues, this work proposes a truthful online auction mechanism based on user evaluation and cost and applies it to the allocation and pricing of cloud computing virtual resources. Based on a pay-as-you-go model, users can submit multiple requirements at any time, but only one requirement can be satisfied, which is known as a multi-requirement, single-minded scenario. We prove that the resource providers can obtain increased social welfare and guarantee that the mechanism is truthful. For the resource allocation problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain the allocation result quickly and to maximize the social welfare of the cloud resource provider. The payment algorithm accounts for the interests of both the users and resource provider based on the dichotomy. We experimentally analyze the solution in terms of social welfare, execution time, resource utilization and users served. © 2018","25","Costs","Cloud computing - Electronic commerce - Heuristic algorithms - Operating costs - Resource allocation","Auction mechanisms - Dynamic pricing - Multi-requirements - Online auctions - Resource allocation problem - Resource providers - Resource utilizations - User evaluations","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.1 Computer Programming - 723.5 Computer Applications - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 912.2 Management","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions of Anhui Province; Number: 2014FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: IBM, Sponsor: International Business Machines Corporation; Number: 2017ZZX228, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61402398, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61662088, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank IBM for providing the full version of CPLEX12, which sets no limitations for solving the optimal solution.

Flow-oriented BPMN 2.0 choreographies can exhibit a range of semantic errors in the control flow. The ability to check the semantic correctness of choreographies is thus a desirable feature for modelling tools based on BPMN 2.0 choreographies. However, the semantic analysis of BPMN 2.0 choreographies is hindered by the lack of formal semantic definition of its constructs and the corresponding analysis techniques in the BPMN 2.0 standard specification. This paper defines a formal semantics of BPMN 2.0 choreographies in terms of a mapping to WF-nets. This defined semantics can be used to analyze the structural errors and the control flow errors of BPMN 2.0 choreographies with analysis techniques of Petri nets. The proposed mapping and the semantic analysis have been implemented as a tool. The experimental results show this formalization can identify the semantic errors of choreographies from the BPM AI process model library. © Copyright 2018, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

To address this issue, this paper proposes the hesitant fuzzy envelopment analysis (HFEA) model based on the defined score per unit. Furthermore, we develop the deviation-oriented hesitant fuzzy envelopment analysis (DHFEA) model and the score-oriented hesitant fuzzy envelopment analysis (SHFEA) model in terms of score and deviation values. Then, their dual forms are derived so that the DHFEA and SHFEA models can be transformed into the linear programming. Based on the calculated results, the non-optimal alternatives can be improved accordingly. Moreover, with respect to the attributes’ differences, this paper constructs the hesitant fuzzy preference envelopment analysis (HFPEA) model by integrating the attributes’ preferences. Similarly, its dual form, linear transformation, and alternative improvement method are investigated respectively. Thus, based on the HFEA and HFPEA models, we can rank all the alternatives and improve the non-optimal ones according to the envelopment values and the obtained parameters. Meanwhile, the decision maker's subjective preferences for the attributes can be considered in the decision-making process.

Extracting mentions of ADRs from the health-related text has important applications in biomedical research. Existing work mainly utilizes feature-based pipeline methods or neural network models that use only word embeddings as input features. These methods either require many efforts to design task-specific features or suffer misclassification on those words, which have not been seen before. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end neural sequence labeling model that labels words in an input sequence with ADRs membership tags. In addition to word-level embeddings, we also adopt character-level embeddings and combine them via an embedding-level attention mechanism. Through such an attention mechanism, our model can dynamically determine how much information to utilize from a word- or character-level component. In addition, we use the intermediate output of the model as an auxiliary classifier and combine it with the final output of the model to improve the overall performance. We evaluate different architectures on two ADRs labeling datasets. One is an ADRs-related Twitter corpus that includes many informal vocabularies and irregular grammar, and the other is a biomedical text extracted from PubMed abstracts with many professional terms and technical descriptions. Our model achieves approximate match F1 scores of 0.844 and 0.906 for ADRs identification on the Twitter and PubMed datasets, respectively. It presents the state-of-the-art performance on both the datasets. Our system is completely end-to-end, requires no task-specific feature engineering or hand-crafted features, and thus can be generalized to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. © 2013 IEEE.","47","Biological systems","Deep learning - Extraction - Feature extraction - Job analysis - Labeling - Neural networks - Pharmacodynamics - Social networking (online)","Adverse drug reactions - Biological system modeling - Biomedical text - Drugs - Sequence Labeling - Social media - Task analysis - Twitter",,"Number: 2018HC019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2015FB113, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017ZZX030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61762091, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61702443, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61463050, Grant 61702443, and Grant 61762091, in part by the NSF of Yunnan Province under Grant 2015FB113, in part by the Educational Commission of Yunnan Province of China under Grant 2017ZZX030, and in part by the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province under Grant 2018HC019.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Finally, the appropriate training samples and test samples are selected, online-random forests algorithm is used to train and test them. When it iterates ten times, the recognition rate reaches 87.86%.

In real life, individual inertia is hard to change due to the inherent characteristics of players. Only when he meets lazy and rich people, he will try to change his inertia. Inspired by this, the evolution of inertia is constructed as follows: initially each individual sets a different inertia value due to the heterogeneities among them. Considering loner is a risk averse player, we assume that he has the largest inertia during the simulation. Subsequently, as long as an individual encounters a loner and decides to change his strategy, he will learn his neighbor's inertia simultaneously. Otherwise, his inertia will remain unchanged. Through a large number of simulations we find that, counterintuitively, individual inertia will impede cooperation. Especially, the larger value of inertia, the less likely the individual to change his strategy, and it severely weakened the effect of rock-scissor-paper cyclic dominance in promoting cooperation by making it happen less and less frequently, further leading to a full loner phase. For a comprehensive understanding, we give an explanation from macroscopic and microscopic aspects. Besides, we use a small-world network to verify the robustness of this mechanism. The results also suggest that individuals can maintain the diversity of the population only if they maintain appropriate enthusiasm to participate in social activities. Our work may provide further insight in understanding the role of inertia on the evolution of cooperation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","59","Statistical mechanics","Game theory - Risk perception - Small-world networks","Cooperation - Evolution of cooperation - Evolutionary games - Inertia - Inherent characteristics - Macroscopic and microscopic - Prisoner's dilemma - Prisoner's dilemma game","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 11161053, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11671348, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1302267, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate the support from (i) National Natural Science Foundation of China (Yunnan United Fund (Key Project) grants no.

However, the role of each component in heterogeneous catalyst as well as the essential relationship between interfacial structure and surface reactivity is still ambiguous. To deeply understand these details, we investigated the structure, stability, electronic property, and surface reactivity of α-MoO3/γ-Al2O3composites by density functional theory DFT and DFT + U. The models of α-MoO3/γ-Al2O3composites were constructed by combining the α-MoO3(0 1 0) surface with non-spinel and spinel γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) and (1 1 0) facets. We found that both the nature of γ-Al2O3support and the surface coverage of α-MoO3significantly influenced the interfacial stability and surface catalytic activity. For all composites, the interfaces were stabilized via the formation of different Al–O–Mo bonds between the γ-Al2O3slab and the α-MoO3slab. The interaction energy and adhesion work of interface indicated that the spinel γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) surface is most favorable for the stabilization of α-MoO3surface. Fermi softness (SF), a readily obtainable electronic property was used to evaluate the surface reactivity of the composites. The results indicated that the surface reactivity of all composites is clearly higher than pure α-MoO3, and the monolayer coverage composites with exposed (1 1 0) surface of γ-Al2O3exhibited the highest surface reactivity. By analysis of the charge density difference and density of states, we found that the electrons on the interface are largely redistributed and charges transfer from γ-Al2O3to α-MoO3, which promoted the delocalization of both interfacial and surface electronic states near the Fermi level, resulting in strengthened the interfacial interaction and surface reactivity. In addition, the adsorption and dissociation of H2S on the surfaces of all ML composites was investigated. The reaction pathway and kinetic barrier were determined. The results shown that ML- Mo/nspAl(1 1 0) with the highest Femi softness (1.39) showed the lowest energy barrier (0.35 eV), which further confirmed the effectiveness of the Femi softness. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","91","Molybdenum oxide","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Catalyst activity - Density functional theory - Design for testability - Electronic properties - Interface states - Petroleum refining - Stability","Charge density difference - Fermi softness - Heterogeneous catalyst - Interfacial interaction - Interfacial stabilities - Surface catalytic activity - Surface electronic state - Surface reactivity","513.1 Petroleum Refining, General - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932 High Energy Physics; Nuclear Physics; Plasma Physics","Number: U1402274, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 51464024, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51562018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51564033, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2016FA023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China – Yunnan Joint Foundation of China (No. U1402274 , S.

As confirmed by observing of transmission electron microscopy images and analysis of plasmon resonance spectrum transformations, we found that silver triangular nanoplates (TNPs) without further modification could be face-to-face assembled by citrate. The face-to-face assembly of silver TNPs could be disassembled quickly by heating at a wide temperature range from 30 to 80 °C. In this process, an obvious localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak shift and a color change of solution from pink to purple could be observed. Moreover, the disassembled silver TNPs suspension is very stable that no significant peak shift of silver TNPs spectrum was observed in 8 h after removing of silver TNPs from a hearing area.

The maximum adsorption capacity and adsorption mechanism of the cadmium ions in the solution were analyzed by comparing the modified silicon materials of organic materials, inorganic materials and polymers. The adsorption process and capacity of various adsorbents was compared by adsorption isotherm and dynamical model. The analysis shows that the increase of hydrophilicity and functional groups on the surface of the material is capable of removing cadmium ions from water. It is pointed out that the preparation of high selectivity, high adsorption capacity and improving recyclability will be the research focus of silicon-based material modification.

Firstly, the vibration signals of each state of the check valve are decomposed by CEEMD, and the useful intrinsic mode functions (IMF) are obtained by using the compound screening method, which effectively removes the background noises. Then the BSE features of the useful IMF are extracted, and the test samples are identified by hamming approach degrees between the test samples and the cluster center. Finally, the performance of fault diagnosis is evaluated by the classification coefficient and average fuzzy entropy. Compared with the IMF's experience screening method, sample entropy (SE) and permutation entropy (PE) feature extraction method, the fault diagnosis accuracy of this method is as high as 95.83%.

However, different users inherently have different preferences, and so it is impossible that all users rate services with the same criteria. Thus, aggregating cardinal ratings into reputation will potentially lead to unreliable and misleading result, which makes the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons should be considered in reputation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation measurement mechanism that aggregates ordinal user preferences rather than cardinal ratings into reputation. By extending the majority rule naturally, dominance relationship between services is defined based on ordinal preferences. Then, reputation measurement is modelled as a problem to find a ranking that indicates the dominance relationships among services. A directed acyclic graph is constructed based on the dominance relationships of services pairs and then the ranking of services is found from the graph. We prove our method satisfies some basic criteria that a reasonable reputation measurement method should satisfy in the context of the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons.

However, various raw materials play important roles in the electricity consumption and exergy efficiency of a submerged arc furnace during silicon production. An artificial neural network (ANN) method was used to model the final strain of the electricity consumption and exergy efficiency with varying silica, coke, coal and electrode. The measured strain versus predicted strain by the model was compared using the R2coefficient. The results showed that the exergy efficiency and the electricity consumption values of the testing data are R2= 0.9918 and R2= 0.9896, respectively, in a very short time with low error levels. They clearly indicate the adequacy of the model proposed for prediction of the exergy efficiency and the electricity consumption with different raw materials in the mixture of carbonaceous raw materials in the furnace. Additionally, there is good agreement between the actual and predicted values. Therefore, this developed ANN model is useful to guide the decision about the use of raw materials in silicon production under the condition of lower electricity consumption and higher exergy efficiency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","20","Electric power utilization","Chemical industry - Efficiency - Exergy - Furnaces - Neural networks - Silica","ANN modeling - Electricity-consumption - Exergetic efficiency - Exergy efficiencies - Low errors - Silicon industry - Submerged arc furnace - Testing data","641.1 Thermodynamics - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 805 Chemical Engineering, General - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Each feature has a different damage sensibility to different fatigue evolution stages. Fatigue evolution information is dispersed in different features, which increases the difficulty to recognize the fatigue stages. This paper presents a new feature extraction method for acoustic emission (AE) signal of rolling bearing to solve the problem, and a specially designed test rig is used for the experimental verification. The new method combines wavelet packet de-noising (WPD) with an improved kernel entropy component analysis (KECA). First, de-noising original signal by WPD method. Second, applying KECA method with Gaussian kernel function on the feature matrix extracted from the de-noised signal. A new particle swarm optimization method based on the best kernel entropy component number theory with inertia weight and dynamic accelerating constant (BWCPSO) is proposed to optimize the kernel parameter. BWCPSO method puts the minimized kernel entropy components number with the maximum stage information of rolling bearing as its objective. The optimal kernel parameter can make KECA method extract and converge the original signal information greatly. Finally, each fatigue evolution stage can be identified adaptively by the main kernel entropy score (KES) graphs. The experiment results show that the proposed method extracts the fatigue evolution stages information of rolling bearing effectively and much easier and more accuracy than the traditional feature trend analysis and other two traditional feature extraction methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","26","Acoustic emission testing","Acoustic emissions - Entropy - Extraction - Fatigue damage - Feature extraction - Number theory - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Roller bearings - Signal denoising - Telecommunication industry - Wavelet analysis","Component analysis - Experimental verification - Feature extraction algorithms - Feature extraction methods - Gaussian kernel functions - New particle swarm optimization - Rolling bearings - Wavelet packet de-noising",,"Number: 51265018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51465022 & 51265018 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The cutting-ring method was applied, and field plot experiments were conducted to determine soil physical properties and monitor runoff and sediment yield in response to land-use change by comparing tropical rainforest (TR), rubber monoculture (Rm), and four rubber-based agroforestry systems. Results showed that conversion of tropical forest to rubber resulted in lower leaf area index (LAI), canopy cover, less litter, and an unfavorable soil environment (i.e., high bulk density [BD], low porosity, etc.). The runoff from the Rm was 33.2- and 2.6- times higher than the TR and the rubber-based agroforestry systems, respectively. In general, sediment yield from the TR, Rm, and agroforestry systems was 0.041, 11.54, and 2.73 t ha−1, respectively. These trends suggested that the forest conversion caused negative hydrological consequences (i.e., excessive runoff and sediment yield). Compared with the Rm, rubber-based agroforestry systems could more effectively reduce runoff volume and sediment yield. Overall, the sediment yield were significantly negatively correlated with LAI, canopy cover, stand litter, and saturated water capacity, while positively correlated with BD and runoff. The effects of precipitation on the sediment yield of agroforestry systems in this region became less important due to their partly improved soil conditions and vegetation traits.

In this study, aqueous biphasic systems (ABSs) consisting of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ionic liquids (ILs) (alkyl = butyl, hexyl, and octyl) and phosphate-based salts were studied for extraction of gold(I) from alkaline aurocyanide solutions for the first time. The results indicated that gold(I) preferentially migrated into the IL-rich phase, achieving remarkable extraction efficiency up to 99.9%. The extraction mechanism of gold(I) was evaluated based on characterization by FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results revealed the electrostatic interaction between gold(I) cyanide complex and IL was the main driving force for gold(I) partition. The migration of gold(I) into IL-rich phase was associated with an extraction mechanism by ion pair formation of [Cnmim+]•[Au(CN)2−]. Furthermore, the microscopic structure of the IL-rich solution was also determined by transmission electron microscopy.

The reducing capacity (RC) of sample was quantified by I2 titration to explore how these modification methods affected the redox properties of hydrochar. The results indicated HNO3 and thermal oxidization increased the RC of hydrochar by 2–5 folds while NaOH washing had the negative effect on samples’ RC. By analyzing the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence of alkaline extraction solution of sample, humic acid like substances generated from various methods were identified as one of the major sources for electron donating. HNO3 oxidization could significantly increase the RC in hydrochar, which was likely resulting from the generation of alkali-soluble small molecule organic compounds. However, excessive oxidation by nitric acid with prolonged duration led to the gradual decrease in hydrochar's RC. Heating treatment caused a significant increase in the content of redox-active oxygen-containing functional groups and persistent free radicals (PFRs) in hydrochar. Even though both could donate electrons in the redox reaction with I2, the former was considered a greater contributor for the RC of hydrochar. From this study, the origin of RC of hydrochar can be identified as: oxygen-containing functionality, humic-like matter and PFRs. By employing different modification methods, the RC of hydrochar could be tuned by regulating the above sources. This study provided fundamental knowledges and simple routes to manipulate the redox properties of hydrochar for different environmental applications. © 2018","54","Chlorine compounds","Biological materials - Carbonization - Free radicals - Ionization of gases - Organic acids - Oxygen - Redox reactions - Sodium hydroxide - Temperature - Washing","Environmental applications - Excitation-emission matrix fluorescences - Humic acid - Humic acid-like substances - Hydrochar - Hydrothermal carbonization - PFRs - Reducing capacity","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 15230500300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; Number: 415272349, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 415272349 ) and Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 15230500300 ).

Here, we consider a stone forest as a small-scale field model of urban climate. The study was conducted in the scenic area of stone forest (24.81°N, 103.32°E), located in Yunnan Province in southwest China. The stone forest is a set of limestone formations with heights ranging from 10 to 30 m. These stones are thought to be similar to buildings in cities because the thermal properties of the stones are similar to those of the concrete of human-made structures in cities. The thermal environment of the stone forest can thus be considered to simulate that of cities. Our field measurements were conducted over 2 years in four different areas to simulate typical urban morphology and environment scenarios, that is, high-rise compact, low-rise sparse, garden, and isolated single-stone areas. The field measurements in the stone forest demonstrated several phenomena common to cities—higher mean temperature, smaller amplitude, and delayed phase lag—as opposed to rural areas. Unlike cities, air pollution and anthropogenic heat are limited in the stone forest; hence, we attribute the differences between the four areas to the effects of stone forest morphology. With increasing compactness, the daily amplitude is reduced and the daily phase delayed. Rather than the mean temperature alone, the daily amplitude and phase may be better indicators of the effects of urban morphology on the daily temperature cycle. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","29","Climate models","Atmospheric temperature - Forestry - Lime - Morphology - Structure (composition)","Anthropogenic heat - Daily temperatures - Field measurement - Limestone formation - Scale modeling - Stone forest - Thermal environment - Urban climates",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University Grants Committee; Number: -, Acronym: RGC, UGC, Sponsor: Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee; Number: 41371514, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013U-5, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Tsinghua University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: School for Advanced Research; Number: HKU9/CRF/12G, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41371514, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Tsinghua University; Number: 2013U-5, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education - Singapore; ","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Grant/Award Number: HKU9/ CRF/12G; Tsinghua University, Grant/Award Number: 2013U-5; National Natural Scientific Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41371514We thank the Stone Forest Scenic Area Management Bureau, Yunnan, China, for supporting this field study for more than 2 years, and Mr. Wing Kam Leung, Dr. Xiaoxue Wang, Mr. Meng Yuan, and Mr. Zhiqiang Ding for their technical support with the measurements.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to utilize porous organic molecular cages as stationary phases in capillary electrochromatography (CEC). We report herein the use of a homochiral porous organic cage (POC) (CC3-R) as a stationary phase in open tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) for the separation of chiral compounds and positional isomers. The column was fabricated using CC3-R as the stationary phase by a static coating method. Separation of furoin, benzoin, and alprenlol were achieved on the CC3-R coated column, with the highest resolution value (Rs = 3.35) for the separation of benzoin. The influences of pH and buffer concentration on separation have been investigated. Besides, the CC3-R column also exhibited good selectivity for the separation of positional isomers, including those of nitrophenols, phenylenediamines, aminophenols, and ionones. The run-to-run (n = 5), day-to-day (n = 5), column-to-column (n = 3), and batch-to-batch (n = 3) relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the analyte migration time were in the range of 0.5–1.5%, 0.2–1.8%, 1.2–2.1% and 1.5–2.8%, respectively. The RSDs for the migration time and enantioselectivity of the analyte were less than 5.9% and 2.2% (inter-day, n = 5) after a week of continuous use.

However, molecular evidence of cell expansion, acquisition of tumor cytotoxicity, and safety of CIK cells is required before putting them to clinical use. Here, we performed dynamic transcriptomic analyses of CIKs generated from primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to interferon-γ, OKT3, and interleukin- 2. CIK mRNAs were extracted and sequenced at days 0, 1, 7, and 14 and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), we identified two major gene modules that mediate immune cell activation and mitosis. We found that activation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells likely rely on cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and its protein partner LCK proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (LCK). A time-course series analysis revealed that CIK cells have relatively low immunogenicity because of decreased expression of some self-antigens. Importantly, we identified several crucial activating receptors and auxiliary adhesion receptors expressed on CIK cells that may function as tumor sensors. Interestingly, cytotoxicity-associated genes, including those encoding PRF1, GZMB, FASL, and several cytokines, were up-regulated in mature CIK cells. Most immunecheckpoint molecules and inflammatory tumor-promoting factors were down-regulated in the CIK cells, suggesting efficacy and safety in future clinical trials. Notably, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was highly expressed in CIK cells and may promote cytotoxicity, although it also could facilitate tumorigenesis. The transcriptomic atlas of CIK cells presented here may inform efforts to improve CIK-associated tumor cytotoxicity and safety in clinical trials. © 2018 Meng et al.","50","Cytology","Activation analysis - Amino acids - Chemical activation - Cytotoxicity - Genes - Time series analysis - Tumors","Adhesion receptors - Bioinformatics analysis - Cytokine-induced killer cells - Insulin-like growth factor 1 - Interferon-gamma - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells - Promoting factors - Weighted correlation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2015FA008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014NS212, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province; Number: 81360245, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 81360245, 81660477, and 81460436 and "Special and Joint Pro-gram" of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department and Kun-ming Medical University Grant 2015FA008.

Herein, we have successfully designed and synthesized various cobalt nitrides (Co4N) by using different weak bases (i.e. hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), urea, and ammonium hydroxide (AH)) through nitridation treatment in ammonia (NH3) atmosphere. Physical characterization results demonstrate that Co4N-NSs (nanosheets) with vast meso/macropores and large BET surface are successfully constructed once adding carbon paper and HMT into precursors. As the synergistic effect of metallic character of Co4N phase, excellent electroconductibility of pyrolytic carbon, and large surface area, Co4N-NSs surfaces can form more Co4+ active sites in electrochemical reaction processes. Meanwhile, the abundant meso/macroporous structures constructed in Co4N-NSs further promoted its mass transfer ability. Benefitting from the above mentioned advantages, Co4N-NSs therefore exhibit more excellent glucose oxidation ability than another three control samples (i.e. Co4N-HMT, Co4N-Urea and Co4N-AH). When used for glucose detection, the optimal Co4N-NSs display excellent detection parameters as well, such as: a wide linear range of 0.6–10.0 mM, a large sensitivity of 1137.2 uA cm−2 mM−1 glucose, a low detection limit of 0.1 µM, a small response time of 1.7 s, good reproducibility and stability, and the excellent anti-interference to other electroactive molecules and Cl−. Upon utilized for measuring glucose concentrations in human blood serum samples, the detection results on Co4N-NSs are accurate and satisfying as well. This work opens a new possibility for boosting electrochemical catalysis abilities of Co4N samples by the structure design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","41","Cobalt compounds","Aluminum nitride - Ammonium hydroxide - Carbon - Electrocatalysts - Glucose - Glucose sensors - Mass transfer - Metabolism - Nanocatalysts - Nanosheets - Nitrides - Urea","Electrocatalytic activity - Electrochemical catalysis - Electrochemical reactions - Glucose detection - Metallic character - Nitridation treatments - Non-enzymatic glucose sensors - Physical characterization","462.1 Biomedical Equipment, General - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 761 Nanotechnology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 1411909417, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21575021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21575021 ) and the scientific research start-up fund from Kunming University of Science and Technology of introducing talents ( 1411909417 ).
