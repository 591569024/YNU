Firstly, in this paper, an active-clamp full-bridge boost converter is taken as the basic unit. Then a multi-modular converter centralized DC boosting system is proposed, which is suitable for 30kV/1.5MW PV grid-connected system. In this system, inputs and outputs of two active-clamp full-bridge boost converters are connected in parallel and series to form a sub-module. With input-parallel output-parallel (IPOP) scheme of multi-modules, the system can meet the demand of DC boost design with large capacity and high conversion ratio, and achieve the goal of power superposition at constant voltage. Subsequently, in order to solve the problem of input current sharing (ICS) and output voltage sharing (OVS) among sub-modules, a DC voltage sharing and current sharing control strategy is proposed. Finally, a real-time simulation model of ±30kV/1.5MW PV modular DC boost system is built in the RT-LAB environment. Effectiveness of the structure and control strategy is validated by the simulation results. © 2018 IEEE.","15","Intelligent control","DC-DC converters - Modular construction - Photovoltaic cells","Current sharing control - Current-sharing - DC boost - Full-bridge boost converter - Modularizations - PV grid-connected systems - Real-time simulation models - Voltage sharing","405.2 Construction Methods - 704.1 Electric Components - 723.4.1 Expert Systems","Number: 2016YFB0900200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 51707026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received July 29, 2018.

The proposed method is suitable for analysis of signal with non-linear characteristics. It is more sensitive on the damage identification than the existing methods based on statistical pattern recognition. The proposed method collects structural dynamic response signals under different conditions and uses the ESN network for system identification. The output weights are served as the damage feature values of the bridge structure. A number of experiments are performed by using the non-linear vibration finite element model and a real bridge scale model under environmental motivation. The experimental results show that the proposed non-linear feature extraction method based on ESN is more sensitive than the traditional auto-regressive model. There are obvious differences in the damage sensitivity index value between the healthy case and the damage case. The damage sensitivity index increases linearly with the structural degradation. Moreover, this paper constructs the damage sensitive index by using the Euclidean distance which is consistent with the evolution trend of the structural state. The proposed method offers a more appropriate theoretical and technical support for the existing bridge monitoring data processing and the structural damage evolution trend assessment. © 2018 Acta Press.

The experimental results show that the studied alloy experiences the MT from the ferromagnetic L21-type cubic structure to the paramagnetic-like three-layered (3M) modulated monoclinic structure, resulting in a value of ∼1.1% for the relative volume change Ε between two phases. Due to appearance of an enhanced Ε the migration rate of martensitic transformation with respect to the hydrostatic pressure reaches ∼4.7 K/kbar, while a high transition entropy change (∼28 J/kg K) is still maintained. Based on an indirectly estimated method, the calculated maximum value for isothermal entropy change ΔSTachieves ∼ -23 J/kg K with the pressure change of 6.2 kbar, which yields the values of ∼10 K for adiabatic temperature change ΔTadand ∼786 J/kg for relative cooling power (RCP), performing a large BCE. According to the change of phase fraction at selected hydrostatic pressures, a detailed schematic diagram has been established to evaluate the reversibility of this effect. With applying an external cyclic pressure of 6.2 kbar, the maximum repeatable values calculated for both ΔSTand ΔTadare decreased to ∼ -15 J/kg K and ∼5 K, respectively. This is attributed to an insufficient driving force, which can only partially transform this material, leading to a reversible MT appeared in the mixed state. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","31","Martensitic transformations","Cobalt alloys - Entropy - Hydraulics - Hydrostatic pressure - Manganese alloys - Schematic diagrams - Tin alloys","Adiabatic temperature change - Barocaloric effects - Heusler alloys - Isothermal entropy change - Monoclinic structures - Quaternary Heusler alloys - Relative cooling power - Transition entropies","531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 632.1 Hydraulics - 641.1 Thermodynamics","Number: TD201301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Jimei University; Number: 2016FB013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016ZZX205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11404186, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51371111, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51661029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51661029 , 11404186 and 51371111 ), Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2016FB013 ), Innovative Research Team of Qujing Normal University (No. TD201301 ), Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Educational Committee (No. 2016ZZX205 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The simulation results are presented for an oblique cone-shaped mountain with different inclining angles, and for different relative positions of the distribution line placed over nonflat lossy terrain. It is found that, when lightning strikes the top of an oblique cone-shaped mountain, the lightning-induced voltages are closely related with the mountain inclining angles where the distribution line is located above as well as the other mountain inclining angles; in general, the peak values of induced voltages increase with increasing inclining angles. For example, for the constant angle β = 45° (the inclining angle where the line is located above), the induced voltages at the close end of line for α = 26.6°, 45°, and 63.4° (the inclining angle opposite to angle β) is increased by 24%, 60%, and 106% as compared with that for flat ground, respectively. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","39","Time domain analysis","Couplings - Electric conductivity - Electromagnetic fields - Finite difference method - Finite difference time domain method - Grounding electrodes - Landforms - Lightning","Coupling modeling - Lightning induced voltage - mountain inclining angle - Solid model - Three dimensional finite difference time domains","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 481.1 Geology - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2017YFC1501505, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41775006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received July 7, 2018; revised August 16, 2018; accepted September 4, 2018.

Thus, the final solution containing NO3-and PO43-can be potentially used as raw material for the production of nitrogen phosphorus compound fertilizer. Moreover, effects of various parameters on NOxremoval efficiency were optimized, and single-factor experiments together with response surface optimization were applied for optimizing these parameters. It was indicated that the removal efficiency of NOxcan obtain 99.2% under optimal conditions. Subsequently, the corresponding reaction mechanisms were discussed. Therefore, using the mixtures of yellow phosphorus and phosphate slurry as absorbent not only obtains high NOxremoval efficiency, but can avoid the need to dispose of spent liquid wastes, which provides an attractive approach for controlling NOx.

A numerical model was established by setting the bond block model method in the discrete element software named 3DEC. The settlement and the range of failure joints in surrounding rocks were simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that the model can reasonably characterize the abnormal deformation and structural failure of the Caiguanying Tunnel when the longitudinal spacing is too large or too small. In the process of excavation, the settlement value and the number of tensile and shear failure joints in the surrounding rocks of the adjacent tunnel increase when the advance or the back tunnel is being excavated. The failure joints are mainly caused by shear sliding. Furthermore, based on a number of factors, the influence of different longitudinal spacing between the left and right working face of the tunnel on the stability of the surrounding rocks and supporting structure of the tunnel is studied to determine the suitable longitudinal spacing. The results show that this spacing should be greater than or equal to 30 m according to the variation of the settlement value of the vault near the working face of the advance tunnel. In terms of the number of tensile failure joints, the suitable spacing is 20-40 m. In terms of the sliding state, the suitable spacing is 30-40 m. In terms of the total number of slide failure joints, the suitable spacing is 20-40 m. A spacing less than or equal to 40 m is suitable in terms of the bending moment of lining. On the basis of all these judgments, it is concluded that the vertical spacing between two sides tunnel should be between 30-40 m, which is 2 to 2.5 times the tunnel clearance. In the subsequent construction process, the longitudinal spacing of the left and right working faces is strictly controlled within this range, and the tunnel is smoothly penetrated finally. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Traditional differential calculation pretreatment only considers the integer-order differential, such as the 1st order and 2nd order, and overlooks important spectrum information located at fractional order. Since fractional differential (FD) has rarely been applied to spectrum field measurement, there are few reports on the spectrum features of saline soils under different degrees of human interference. We used FD to analyze field spectrum data of saline soil collected from Xinjiang’s Fukang City. Order interval of 0.2 was adopted to divide 0–2 orders into 11-order differentials. MATLAB programming was used to convert the raw spectral reflectance and its four common types of mathematics and to conduct FD calculation. Spectrum data for area A (no human interference area) and area B (human interference area) was separately processed. From the statistical analysis of soil salinization characteristics, the salinization degree and type for area B were more diverse and complicated than area A. MATLAB simulation results showed that FD calculation could depict the minute differences between different FD order spectra under different human interference areas. The overall differential value trend appeared to move towards 0 reflectance value. After differential processing, the trend of bands that passed the 0.05 significance test of correlation coefficient (CC) showed an increase first then decrease later. The maximum CC absolute value for five spectrum transformations all appeared in the fractional order. FD calculation could significantly increase the correlation between spectral reflectance and soil salt content both for full-band and single-band spectra. Results of this study can serve as a reference for the application of FD in field hyperspectral monitoring of soil salinization for different human interference areas. © 2018 Anhong Tian et al.","30","Soil surveys","Finite difference method - MATLAB - Reflection - Soils - Spectrum analysis","Correlation coefficient - Differential calculation - Fractional differential - Hyperspectral models - Hyperspectral reflectance - Spectral reflectances - Spectrum information - Spectrum transformation","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2017FH001-067, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 41761081, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41761081, 41671198, and 41861054) and Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department and Education Department Project of China (2017FH001-067, 2017FH001-117, and 2016ZDX127).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, little is known about their mechanical behavior under stress, as the response of the prepared tooth that supports it. The aim of this article is to use for the first time 3D color holography to evaluate the behavior of a molar occlusal veneer under stress and the response of the prepared tooth. The occlusal surface of a lower molar is prepared to receive a specific monolithic ceramic reconstruction manufactured with a chairside CAD/CAM system. Longitudinally cut samples are used to get a planar object observation and to 'look inside' the tooth. A digital holographic set-up permits to obtain the contact-less and one-shot measurement of the three-dimensional displacement field at the surface of the tooth sample; stain fields are evaluated with low noise-sensitive computation. The results show an excellent behavior of the restored tooth without areas of excessive stress concentrations, but also a significant involvement of the dentin enamel junction. So, we demonstrate that the ceramic occlusal veneer seems to behave in accordance with the biomechanical concepts ensuring the longevity of the reconstituted tooth. It follows that we demonstrate that 3D holography is a highly recommended method for studying dental biomechanics. © 2018 SPIE.","17","Computer aided design","Biomechanics - Ceramic materials - Holography - Speckle - Tooth enamel - Veneers","3-D displacement - Color holography - Digital holography - Mechanical behavior - Strain fields","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741.1 Light/Optics - 743 Holography - 746 Imaging Techniques - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 812.1 Ceramics","Number: 11462009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11362007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Haiting XIA thanks the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for funding this work under Grant agreement 11362007 and 11462009.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, DSWT is employed to decompose the important features of the source image into a series of sub-images with different levels and spatial frequencies. Secondly, DCT is used to separate the significant details of the sub-images according to the energy of different frequencies. Thirdly, LSF is applied to enhance the regional features of DCT coefficients, and it can be helpful and useful for image feature extraction. Some frequently-used image fusion methods and evaluation metrics are employed to evaluate the validity of the proposed method.

Conventional icing alert methods either cannot predict future icing accretion or these methods suffer from inadequate predictive accuracy. To resolve these issues, historical and online micrometeorological data from local observations are used to build a multivariate prediction model. Moreover, data preprocessing based on wavelets is used to prefilter spiking noise within the obtained field signals. In addition, the phase-space reconstruction theory is applied to find the minimal embedding dimensions of the contributing factors by which the computational complexity of the multivariate model is reduced. Finally, an online adaptive predictive model based on support vector regression is proposed and implemented to further improve the predictive accuracy and predictive length of the icing process of overhead power lines. Experimental results indicate that this method can predict the real-time icing value on overhead power lines 5 hours in advance, with an acceptable error term.

The film was formed by the in situ polymerization of colchicine-imprinted membranes on the G@AuNPs-modified GCE using methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. The specific surface area, catalytic performance, and electrical conductivity of the electrode increased on account of the formation of G@AuNPs compound materials, thereby improving the sensitivity of the sensor. The MIM as a preconcentrator exhibited chemical selectivity. Under optimal conditions, the MIM/G@AuNPs/GCE sensor exhibited high selectivity and high anti-interference ability.

We updated the albedo in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model lower boundary condition using the Global LAnd Surface Satellite Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer albedo products and demonstrated evident improvement for cold temperature biases in the TP. It is the large overestimation of albedo in winter and spring in the WRF model that resulted in the large cold temperature biases. The overestimated albedo was caused by the simulated precipitation biases and over-parameterization of snow albedo. Furthermore, light-absorbing aerosols can result in a large reduction of albedo in snow and ice cover. The results suggest the necessity of developing snow albedo parameterization using observations in the TP, where snow cover and melting are very different from other low-elevation regions, and the influence of aerosols should be considered as well. In addition to defining snow albedo, our results show an urgent call for improving precipitation simulation in the TP. © 2018 The Author(s).

The model predicts the pressure drop variation for water flowing upward inside a uniformly heated tube at supercritical/subcritical pressures for various heat fluxes, tube lengths and tube inner diameters. The results show that G0 increases with decreasing heat flux and tube length and decreases with increasing inner diameter. © 2018, Tsinghua University Press.

CS-SAS-AAGC showed an inhibition efficiency as high as 95% at low inhibitor concentration of 100 mg/L. The inhibitive performance is much higher than that of CS, SAS, AA, CS/AA, CS/SAS or CS/AA/SAS mixture. The adsorption of CS-SAS-AAGC on aluminum surface was found to obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm. CS-SAS-AAGC behaves as a mixing-type inhibitor, while mainly inhibiting the cathodic reaction.

In the context of the increasing human activities, sediments of alpine lakes could record the processes of human-nature interaction. Here we present multi-proxy records, including total organic carbon, total nitrogen and n-alkanes along with elementals, inferred from a 37-cm-long sediment core collected from a small alpine lake (Lake Cuoqia) in northwestern Yunnan Province, China. Together with instrumental data and other published regional records, we divide environmental changes into four stages over the past 200 years: ca. 1807-1900: increased lake level and expanded surface area, declined organic matter abundance, and exogenous mainly contributions of organic matter with growing endogenous contributions; ca. 1900-1950: slightly declined lake level and decreased surface area, decreased abundance of organic matter, and slightly increased exogenous organic matter; ca. 1950-1982: further dropped lake level and shrank lake surface, declined abundance of organic matter, and increased exogenous organic matter; ca. 1982-2007: further decreased lake level and surface area, increased organic matter content which was dominated by terrestrial inputs with the addition of endogenous contributions. We also divide the industrial pollutions into three stages based on the heavy metal results: before ca. 1950: very low heavy metal concentration indicating natural background without anthropogenic influences; ca. 1950-1982: beginning of industrial pollutions; after ca. 1982: abruptly increased heavy metal pollutions due to the development of ore industry. As Lake Cuoqia has a very small catchment without any human activity and industry, the heavy mental pollutions are likely transported through atmospheric circulation. Our records indicate the considerable environmental fluctuations over the last 200 years, and suggest that industry pollutants could be transported and influence the remote high-altitude areas. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","51","Lake pollution","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Catchments - Heavy metals - Lakes - Organic carbon - Paraffins","Abundance of organic matters - Alpine lakes - Atmospheric circulation - Environmental fluctuations - Heavy metal concentration - Lake levels - n-Alkanes - Organic matter abundances","453 Water Pollution - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on a study of the saturated vapor pressure in the metal and vapor–liquid equilibrium diagram of a binary system, we carried out a large-scale recovery experiment for bismuth and lead with the enrichment of silver and copper. The experimental results show that the copper and silver contents in the residue are higher than 80%. Secondary continuous vacuum distillation resulted in a residue with a Ag content of less than 20 g/t.

We experimentally imposed a 1.8 °C increase of air temperature to the cuttings of two common poplar species Populus yunnanensis and Populus szechuanica naturally growing in southwest China using open-top chambers. Populus yunnanensis is distributed along a narrower elevation range compared with P. szechuanica. We determined some key physiological parameters and plant growth regulator activities during the growing season without soil water limitation. Our results showed that a 1.8 °C increase in air temperature increased shoot growth of P. szechuanica through an extension of its growth period but did not affect the growth of P. yunnanensis. Malondialdehyde content, guaiacol peroxidase activities and abscisic acid content increased while indoleacetic acid content decreased in P. yunnanensis. Our results suggest that the two common poplar species in southwest China should be able to adapt to the moderate increase in temperature projected for future climate. The growth of P. szechuanica may benefit through phenological adjustment but a further increase in temperature may inhibit the growth of P. yunnanensis.

Fast-ICA tries to find the demixing matrix by optimizing the nonlinear objective (cost or contrast) functions. For Fast-ICA, there are three built-in contrast functions to separate non-Gaussian sources, and their derivatives are similar to nonlinearities used in neural networks. However, the contrast functions and their nonlinearities for separating super-Gaussian sources are not optimal owing to their high computational cost, which greatly affect the convergence rate of Fast-ICA. To address this issue, this paper proposes two rational nonlinearities to replace the built-in (original) nonlinearities. The rational nonlinearities are derived by the Chebyshev–Pade approximant from Chebyshev polynomials (series) of the original nonlinearities. To speed up the convergence of Fast-ICA, the degrees in both numerator and denominator of rational functions are designed to be relatively low, and thus the rational polynomials can be quickly evaluated. Simulation results of audio BSS show that the proposed rational nonlinearities can not only improve the convergence rate of Fast-ICA, but also improve the separation performance index; Experiment results of real electrocardiogram data also verify the validity of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","58","Independent component analysis","Approximation theory - Blind source separation - Gaussian distribution - Polynomials - Rational functions","Chebyshev polynomials - Computational costs - Independent component analyses (ICA) - Non-Gaussian sources - Pade approximants - Rational nonlinearity - Separation performance - Super-Gaussian sources","921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: 14K022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 60572183, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements Funding for this work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 60572183] and the Research Projects of the Open Fund Project of Key Laboratory in Hunan Universities [No. 14K022].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Two kinds of liquid crystal compounds, which have the structures of biphenyl with C≡≡C or CF2O moiety as a linkage group, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer(GC-MS). The results show that the spectra of the compounds are obtained by remarkable odd electron radical ion peaks and doubly charged fragment ion peaks, so the cleavage pathways were similar for the two kinds of compounds. We noted a sequential loss of alkyl, alkyl, or phenoxyl radicals under electron impact, which seems to be frequent in the case of liquid crystal compounds. The achievement of a higher degree of aromaticity may be the driving force for these processes. For the alkyl biphenyl compounds with C≡≡C central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the alkyl carbon-carbon bond is initiated by the loss of alkyl radical via the α-cleavage, followed by the the losing of the other alkyl radical by σ bond cleavage, i. e., α-σ cleavage. For the alkyl biphenyl compounds with CF2O central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond is initiated by the loss of phenoxyl radical via the i-cleavage, followed by the losing of the other alkyl radical by σ bond cleavage, i. e., i-σ cleavage. For the biphenyl compounds with double CF2O central-bridge-bond, the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond is initiated by the loss of phenoxyl radical via the i-cleavage, followed by the losing of the other phenoxyl radical by σ-bond cleavage, i. e., i-σ cleavage. The obtained results suggest the reason of σ-bond breakage, which should be caused by an internal conversion(IC). Generally, doubly charged ions are found in the electron ionization(EI) mass spectra of hydrocarbons, but the intensities of them are weak and cannot be used in chemical analyses. In contrast, in this paper we showed two kinds of liquid crystal compounds, as interesting examples, which can eliminate two internal alkyl or phenoxyl groups as radicals and yield the most abundant doubly charged ions in their EI mass spectrum by αα/iα or ii cleavage reactions. As an example, the DFT method is adopted to simulating the cleavage pathway of compound 2d. A conclusion can be draw that the proposed fragmentation mechanism is agreed by both experimental data and theoretical research. © 2018, Higher Education Press.

Existing submodular algorithms are sequential and not easy to take full advantage of the power of distributed cluster computing platform, such as Spark, to significantly improve the efficiency of algorithm. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a distance metric, which is defined by a sum function of personalized PageRank scores over the symmetry difference of neighbors of a pair of nodes, is first introduced to capture the pairwise dis-similarity over pairs of nodes. Then, the problem of diversified ranking on graphs is formulated as a max-sum k-dispersion problem with metrical edge weight. A polynomial time 2-approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Considering the computational independence of different pairs of nodes, a MapReduce algorithm is further developed to boost the efficiency of the process.

The typical precipitates at Si grain boundaries before and after leaching were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The leaching results show that the impurities removal efficiency is 2-MACL > 1-MACL > HF acid leaching. After 2-MACL, the impurities (Fe, Al, Ca, Ti, Mn, Ni, Cu, V, Cr, Ag, B and P) concentration can be reduced from 4550.40 ppmw to 106.09 ppmw and the purity of MG-Si increased from 99.55 to 99.99%. It is notable that the introduction of micro-scale “channels” can facilitate the impurities removal when compared to solely HF leaching, especially for some non-dissolving metallic impurities like copper, calcium and aluminum.

We investigated variation in species richness of Ericaceae along an elevational gradient in Yunnan, China, and used a variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis ordination to examine how those changes might be influenced by the mid-domain effect, the species-area relationship, and climatic variables. Species richness varied significantly with elevation, peaking in the upper third of the elevational gradient. Of the factors examined, climate explained a larger proportion of the variance in species richness along the elevational gradient than either land area or geometric constraints. Species richness showed a unimodal relationship with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. The elevational pattern of species richness for Ericaceae was shaped by the combined effects of climate and competition.

Besides, the approach of how to select the ideal solution is redefined, especially for the case that the content of criterion according to all alternatives is not a totally ordered set anymore.

In order to study its molecular content and dynamical state, we mapped this filament in seven species: C18O, HCO+, HNC, HCN, N2H+, CS, and CH3OH. Among them, HCO+, HNC, HCN, and CS show self-absorption, while C18O is most sensitive to the filamentary structure. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that this filament forms a velocity-coherent (trans)sonic structure, a large part of which is one of the most quiescent regions in the Serpens cloud. Widespread C18O depletion is found throughout the Serpens filament. Based on the Herschel dust-derived H2 column density map, the line mass of the filament is 36-41 Mpc-1, and its full width at half maximum is 0.17 ± 0.01 pc, while its length is 1.6 pc. The inner radial column density profile of this filament can be well fitted with a Plummer profile with an exponent of 2.2 ± 0.1, a scale radius of 0.018 ± 0.003 pc, and a central density of (4.0 ± 0.8) × 104 cm-3. The Serpens filament appears to be slightly supercritical. The widespread blue-skewed HNC and CS line profiles and HCN hyperfine line anomalies across this filament indicate radial infall in parts of the Serpens filament. C18O velocity gradients also indicate accretion flows along the filament. The velocity and density structures suggest that such accretion flows are likely due to a longitudinal collapse parallel to the filament's long axis. Both the radial infall rate (72 MMyr-1, inferred from HNC and CS blue-skewed profiles) and the longitudinal accretion rate (10 M3 Myr-1, inferred from C18O velocity gradients) along the Serpens filament are lower than all previously reported values in other filaments. This indicates that the Serpens filament lies at an early evolutionary stage when collapse has just begun, or that thermal and nonthermal support are effective in providing support against gravity. © ESO 2018.","95","Velocity","Kinematics","Density structures - Evolutionary stage - Filamentary structures - ISM-molecules - Kinematic Analysis - Kinematics and dynamics - Line profiles - Velocity gradients","931.1 Mechanics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Number: 2017YFA0402702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: QYZDJ-SSW-SLH047, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of California, Los Angeles; Number: 11127903, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements.

The overall accuracies of land use/land cover classification reached 90.13–97.90%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84–0.96. Massive but decelerating conversion from forests to artificial plantations has occurred in recent decades. From 1994 to 2014, the area of plantations increased by 1833.85 km2, whereas that of forests decreased by 1942.67 km2. The expanded areas of artificial plantations decreased from 158.41 km2 per year in 1994–1999 to 59.70 km2 per year in 2009–2014. More considerable transformation from forests to artificial plantations occurred in lowland areas with elevations below 1000 m and at the edges of National Nature Reserves, which observed a forest loss rate of greater than 40% between 1994 and 2014.

The years have witnessed the development of several types of solar air heating systems (SAHS). This chapter aims to present a review of the literature involving improvement methods, design configurations, test methods of thermal performance, and applications of SAHS. Firstly, this chapter makes an introduction to five new SAHS, namely, fin type flat-plate solar air collector (FTSAC), baffle-type vacuum tube solar air collector (VTSAC), novel straight through VTSAC, inserted VTSAC, and traditional straight through VTSAC. Meanwhile, the chapter states the advantages of these five types of SAHS and describes its working principles. The similarities and differences between the designed air collector and other air collectors are presented. In terms of structure and cost, the advantages of the new SAHS designed in this chapter are pointed out, which will provide the direction for the optimization and improvement in the future. Secondly, design and test methods of thermal performance of SAHS system are introduced in this chapter. The design parameters cover the determination of heat load and collector area of SAHS, air flow rate of SAHS, the resistance of SAHS, and the power of the fan. Besides, a test method of thermal performance for SAHS is also presented, which mainly includes its testing procedures, test conditions, test period (steady-state), as well as computation of collector efficiency. Finally, SAHS are widely used for many applications such as drying applications and space heating and cooling of buildings. This chapter reviews selected studies concerning these applications and presents a solar dryer and solar assisted heat pump dryer system (SAHPDS). According to the work conducted to date on solar drying and SAHPDS of fruits and vegetables, it can be concluded that the solar dryers can be adopted to a great extent. The solar drying of agricultural products serves as one of the most important potential applications of solar energy. It has been established that solar drying and SAHPDS of fruits and vegetables is technically feasible and economically viable. Heating and cooling of agricultural greenhouses are the paramount activities to extend its application throughout the year for crop production. In the meantime, SAHS are very popular for space heating applications relying on their simple design and cost. Major disadvantages of SAHS are relatively low thermal efficiency as well as little thermal storage capacity of the system itself. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","59","Thermal processing (foods)","Applications - Climate change - Collector efficiency - Cultivation - Drying - Electron tubes - Fruits - Heat pump systems - Heat resistance - Heat storage - Heating - Heating equipment - Solar dryers - Solar energy - Space heating - Vegetables","Agricultural greenhouse - Design configurations - Economically viable - Fruits and vegetables - Heating and cooling of buildings - Heating applications - Solar air heating system - Solar assisted heat pump","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 643.1 Space Heating - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 822.2 Food Processing Operations",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The XRD patterns reveal that the MWH method effectively promotes the reactions between NaOH with Al-bearing minerals to form NaAlO2, and inhibits the dehydration of AlOOH. Compared to CH, MWH greatly decreases the roasting temperature nearly 400 °C and shortens the reaction time by 3 times to completely transform Al-bearing minerals from raw bauxite into NaAlO2. The model fitting results show that the kinetics of the reactions between NaOH and the Al-bearing minerals for both heating methods can be described by the Jander's model. The value of apparent activation energy for the reactions between NaOH and Al-bearing minerals by MWH is 31.31 kJ/mol, which is 23% less than that of the reactions in CH. In addition, the SEM-EDS analysis results show that the reacted layer gradually expands outward when the microwave roasting time prolonged.

Numerical simulations and earth observations have provided the capability to capture and study the complex evolvement of natural phenomena in a discrete fashion. It is demanding but challenging to extract events from these datasets automatically. Based on the previous research on feature identification, this research presents a movement tracking framework to analyze evolvements and dynamic movements of detected events. The framework consists of three components: feature identification, movement tracking, and track simplification. Based on the proposed framework, dust storm events are systematically detected and analyzed concerning their dynamic movements from a 4D (x, y, z, and t) simulation dataset over North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East from December 2013 to November 2014. The systematic research includes single event, multi-event, and seasonal analyses. Evaluation of the detected dust events shows that the tracked dust events align well with observations, with ∼80% identification accuracy and consistency in the movement pattern.

Because three strategic types of players lead to a rock–scissor–paper dynamic with cyclic dominance. There is no doubt that loner has played a very important role. Thus we introduce a parameter p represents loners’ participation willingness in order to explore the impact of its on cooperation in voluntary prisoner's dilemma. Large quantities of simulations demonstrate that for traditional case (p=1), three strategies will coexist. However, with p decreases, loners will greatly increase, and cooperation level declines, because defectors can be suppressed very fast. More interesting, when defectors completely vanish, cooperation becomes the best strategy, and holds the whole system.

Through the definition of the coupling of highway traffic risks under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions and combined with the role of highway traffic risk indexes, the coupling model of highway traffic risks under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions was constructed by dint of N-K model and the improved coupling degree model. The coupling degrees of various elements of the coupling model with single risk factor and double risk factors were calculated. The risk levels of various kinds of couplings were quantified. Finally, the correlation mechanism of highway traffic risk values and risk components under the geological and meteorological environment of plateau regions was analyzed. The results show that strong couplings will aggravate the consequences of risks, ultimately causing a sharp increase in risk volume or a new form of risks to conduct and spread in the system after the coupling mutation. “Sharp turns”, one of the geological environment elements in Yunnan plateau areas, and the couplings of other elements usually present strong couplings. The coupling degrees of “rain” and “fog”, meteorological environment essential elements, with other elements are high. The local codes and standards for the minimum turning radius, the speed limit, the load and the distance between the trucks during rainy and foggy days in the plateau areas should be strengthened. As time goes by, the number of strong couplings declines from 10 to 7 and the coupling degrees show a significant downward trend, which indicates that the degree of accident risks resulting from the coupling of geological and meteorological elements in 2015 is declining compared with the previous three years. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

However, our understanding of N2O emissions under limiting precipitation conditions is lacking. This study evaluates the effects of precipitation reduction on soil N2O fluxes from a woody savanna ecosystem in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Precipitation exclusion shelters were installed above the tree canopy, and four total treatments were established as follows: a control (CK) and precipitation exclusions of 30% (PE3), 50% (PE5), and 70% (PE7). Two years (2015–2016) of N2O fluxes, soil temperature and soil water content data were collected. The N2O fluxes were generally low, ranging from 0.039 to 0.245 mg N m−2day−1, and they were strongly linked to precipitation events. Additionally, the N2O fluxes during the rainy season were significantly greater than those during the dry season. The maximum N2O flux was observed in August, and the minimum flux occurred in December. Precipitation exclusion had a significant negative influence on the N2O fluxes. The N2O emissions of CK, PE3, PE5, and PE7 were 0.20, 0.17, 0.13, and 0.12 kg N ha−1yr−1, respectively. With the exacerbation of precipitation exclusion, the decrease rate of precipitation exclusion on the N2O emissions increased over the entire year (eventually reaching 41.8% in PE7), but the decrease rate of precipitation exclusion on the soil N2O emission during the dry season was stronger than that during the rainy season. Additionally, the proportion of dry season N2O emissions to total annual emissions decreased (from 45% to 41%), and that of rainy season N2O emissions to total annual emissions increased (from 55% to 59%) over the year, whereas they exhibited a stable trend from PE5. The data show that the Yuanjiang savanna is a net source of N2O; precipitation reduction decreases the N2O emissions in the savanna regions, indicating that precipitation reduction can only slow the increase in the N2O concentration in the atmosphere and can therefore slow global warming. In addition, the N2O emissions during the dry season may play a significant role in total N2O emissions and be more sensitive to precipitation reduction than those during rainy season. These possibilities should be considered in future studies, especially in those ecosystems that experience substantial inter-annual climatic fluctuations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","60","Ecosystems","Drought - Global warming - Soil moisture - Stream flow","Climatic fluctuations - Dry valley - N2O source - Precipitation events - Savanna - Savanna ecosystems - Soil temperature - Soil water content","407.2 Waterways - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics","Number: U1602234, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1202234, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41405143, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: CMA, Sponsor: China Meteorological Administration; Number: 2017XTBG-F01, Acronym: CAS Key Project, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Project; Number: 2017XTBG-T01, Acronym: CAS Key Project, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Project; Number: 135, Acronym: CAS Key Project, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Project; Number: 2017VCA0036, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: 2015FB186, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017FB077, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China ( U1602234 , 41405143 , and U1202234 ); the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province, China ( 2015FB186 , 2017FB077 ); the Chinese Academy of Sciences 135 project ( 2017XTBG-T01 ; 2017XTBG-F01 ) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative ( 2017VCA0036 ).

With the increasing exhaustion of oil resources in the world and the challenge of increasingly stringent emission regulations, the advantages of biodiesel, such as low emission, renewable and biodegradable property, have aroused widespread concern, and meanwhile, engine manufacturers around the world have adopted a wide array of VNT (variable nozzle turbocharger) and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) technologies in order to maintain performance when downsizing their engines. The focus of diesel engine emission control is NOx (nitric oxide) and PM (particulate matter) emissions. The terrain changes in China are complex; when the diesel engine runs in the plateau areas, due to that the air pressure is reduced, the air is thin and the oxygen content of the intake charge is reduced, the combustion of the engine is deteriorated, the engine power and economy are reduced, the NOx emission is reduced, and the PM emission is increased. EGR and VNT combined with the technology of mixing fuel containing oxygen can broaden the applicable conditions of EGR, and improve the air-fuel ratio, which could resolve the conflicts between NOx and PM emissions, but also reduce the degree of deterioration of diesel engine caused by rising altitude. A high pressure common rail diesel engine coupled with EGR and VNT is selected as the research type, and biodiesel and bio-ethanol are mixed into diesel fuel to form multi-component oxygenated fuel (biodiesel-ethanol-diesel, BED) at a certain proportion. Under the atmospheric pressure environment of 100 and 80 kPa (VNT opening and EGR valve opening (control EGR rate) are adjusted by ECU(electronic control unit), ES590 and INCA calibration software), the influence of VNT and EGR on the power, economy and emission characteristics of oxygenated fuel diesel is studied by atmospheric simulation system. The results show that the power and economy of the oxygenated fuel diesel engine become worse with the increase of the VNT opening and the EGR rate and the decrease of the atmospheric pressure. Under the condition of the atmospheric pressure of 80 kPa and the speed of 2 200 r/min, the opening of VNT increases from 22% to 28%, the torque is reduced by 3.8 N•m, and the average increase of oil consumption is 4.2 g/(kW•h). When the EGR rate increases by 5%, the torque is reduced by 0.8 N•m, and the average increase of oil consumption is 1.5 g/(kW•h). When the atmospheric pressure is reduced from 100 to 80 kPa, the torque is reduced by an average of 3.4 N•m, and the average increase of oil consumption is 4.9 g/(kW•h). When the VNT opening increases from 22% to 28%, the average NOx decreases by 15%. When the EGR rate increases by 5%, the average NOx emission decreases by 12%. When the atmospheric pressure increases from 80 to 100 kPa, the average increase of NOx emissions is 11%. When the VNT opening increases from 22% to 28%, the average increase of smoke is 477%. When the EGR rate increases by 5%, the average increase of smoke is 331.9%.

The mutual effect of HF and H2O2solution's concentration on the etching direction of silicon nanowires was investigated, and isotropic etching and anisotropic etching were intensified through respectively adjusting and controlling the concentration of HF and H2O2solution, making it possible that the etching direction can make rapid response to the solution concentration during the alternate etching process. Zigzag silicon nanowires with highly adjustable etching direction were fabricated when conducting alternate etching experiments in solution I([HF]=2.3 mol/L, [H2O2]=0.4 mol/L) and solution II([HF]=9.2 mol/L, [H2O2]=0.04 mol/L).

In this paper, copper and iron-based [CuCl2, FeCl3, Cu(NO3)2] modified activated carbon were prepared by over-volume impregnation method. The effects of modified activated carbon prepared at different concentrations and calcination temperature on the removal of divalent mercury(HgCl2)in simulated flue gas were investigated. Through the comparative experiments, both copper-based and iron-based activated carbon have a good adsorption effect on mercury-containing flue gas. The 0.01mol/L of copper chloride modified activated carbon calcined at 300 is the best removal of mercury chloride flue gas modified activated carbon, the adsorption capacity reached 4.55mg/g. On this basis, the physical and chemical characteristics were studied by using XRD, BET, SEM/EDS and XPS. It was proved that the adsorption of copper chloride and iron-based activated carbon is the result of the interaction between physical adsorption and chemical adsorption, and the corresponding explanation was given to provide some ideas for the follow-up scientific research. © 2018, Chemical Industry Press.

ISA has become the main urban landscape. Although ISA rate just occupy no-iced surface about 0.2%-2.7%, the impacts on human and nature are extremely significant. Intensive research demonstrated that the relationship between urbanization and water quality was nonlinear. The foreigner researchers revealed that the deterioration of water environment could not be reversed when the ISA rate exceeded 25%. But the threshold influenced by natural and human conditions of research area, different areas have different threshold. To date analyzing the changing characteristic and correlation between water quality parameters and ISA are lees carried out. In this paper, the Dianchi lake watershed of Kunming, Yunnan province was studied, and improved normalized difference build-up index (INDBI) and linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) algorithm were used to analyze the characteristics of Dianchi Lake watershed impervious surface expansion in the context of rapid urbanization in the past 30 years. Secondly, the distance decay function and gravity model was used to quantitatively analyze the impervious surface area impact on water quality. Thirdly, Morlet wavelet analysis method was used to reveal water parameters periodicity. Results showed that the impervious surface area of Dianchi Lake Watershed expanded fast around Dianchi Lake (α = 0.001), nearly half of the land use/land cover has been changed. The natural surface area in 2017 was approximately 59%, the percent of high-intensity urban area was increased from 0.06% to 12.05%. Under the national strategy background of 'One Road, One Belt', 'One lake, four core urban area' and 'Build the Urban Area on the hill', the number of main district (high-intensity urban areas) changes from 1 in 2001 to 4 in 2017 (Kunming main district, Airport main district, Chenggong main district and Jinning main district), cities are surrounding the Dianchi Lake. 35% of natural surface area was transferred into impervious surface. In the last 30 years, the growth rate of impervious surface area in the Dianchi watershed has been exceeded 21 km2per year, and the growth rate reached 38 km2per year from 2004 to 2017. There is a significant correlation between the spatial influence of impervious surfaces and water quality of lakes. The correlation coefficients between water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chla), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (PI), potential of hydrogen (pH) and transparency (Trans)) and the spatial influence of impervious surfaces were all passed the significance test, which shows that the high speed urbanization is the main cause of frequent eutrophication and blue-green algae bloom in Dianchi Lake Watershed. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

To this end, an A-site doubling tailoring strategy is explored in high-Tc superconducting perovskite to endow enhanced structural bidimensionality in terms of decoupling between 2D superconducting planes. High-quality (La1.6–xNd0.4)BaxCuO4 (LNBCO; x = 0.125–0.20) epitaxial films with A-site Ba/Nd doping are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition method. The LNBCO films exhibit ultrahigh laser-induced voltages (LIVs), especially the superior LIVs of higher than 50 V for x = 0.15 and 0.175 and show fast rising time (100 ns). Such a high LIV is several orders/folds larger than that of the existing high-Tc superconductors and other materials reported to date. Systematic influences are investigated in terms of laser irradiation conditions, tilting angle, Seebeck coefficient, etc., suggesting the high LIVs are correlated to charge transport. Simultaneous tailoring over A-site Ba and Nd in LNBCO causes weaken coupling between the CuO2 planes because the La/Ba/Nd-O bonds are elongated and charges are localized within Cu or CuO2 plane. This enables accelerating the charge transport anisotropically, a consequence of enhanced bidimensionality. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Tomicus beetles are secondary pests in temperate regions and the aggressiveness of the beetles in SW China is considered to be due to the warm subtropical climates as well as the beetles’ virulent fungal associates. Here, we assessed the virulence of three blue-stain fungi (Leptographium wushanense, L. sinense and Ophiostoma canum) associated with pine shoot beetles to Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis) in SW China. Following fungal inoculation, we measured necrotic lesion lengths, antioxidant enzyme activities and monoterpene concentrations in the stem phloem of Yunnan pine. Leptographium wushanense induced twice as long lesions as L. sinense and O. canum, and all three fungi induced significantly longer lesions than sterile agar control inoculations. The activity of three tested antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and superoxide dismutase) increased after both fungal inoculation and control inoculation. However, L. wushanense and L. sinense generally caused a greater increase in enzyme activities than O. canum and the control treatment. Fungal inoculation induced stronger increases in six major monoterpenes than the control treatment, but the difference was significant only for some fungus-monoterpene combinations. Overall, our results show that L. wushanense and L. sinense elicit stronger defense responses and thus are more virulent to Yunnan pine than O. canum. The two Leptographium species may thus contribute to the aggressiveness of their beetle vectors and could damage Yunnan pine across SW China if they spread from the restricted geographical area they have been found in so far. © 2018 Pan, Zhao, Krokene, Yu, Qiao, Lu, Chen and Ye.","63","Monoterpenes","Antioxidants - Enzymes - Fungi - Network security","Defense response - L. sinense - Leptographium wushanense - Ophiostoma canum - Reaction zones","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2013-1477, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; Number: 229-2011-890, Acronym: VR, Sponsor: Vetenskapsr&aring;det; ","We thank Yong-liang Wang and Dong-mei Wu (Yunnan University) for assistance in field and laboratory work, and the Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory Resources of the Ministry of Education for providing experimental facilities.

It can qualitatively describe oil reservoirs. The AVO conventional classification depends mainly on human discrimination so that the discrimination result is often inaccurate and the workload is heavy. In this paper, we extract feature parameters from four types of AVO curves as a training set, and introduce the proximal support vector machine method to AVO types discrimination. Based on the shape of four types of gas AVO curves, taking the morphological features of pre-stack seismic data as input parameters, AVO types of the reservoir in a survey area are obtained. This method is applied to the automatic identification of AVO types in a clastic-rock gas field in the South China Sea, and more accurate results are obtained. The proposed method provides a reliable and convenient tool for AVO types discrimination in reservoirs. © 2018, Editorial Department OIL GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING.
