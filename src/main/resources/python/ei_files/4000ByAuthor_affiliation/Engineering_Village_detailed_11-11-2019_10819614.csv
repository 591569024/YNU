This paper focuses on peak phosphorus in China, which serves as an 'early warning indicator' for phosphorus security. The results indicate that China's production of PR is likely to peak sometime between 2035 and 2045. This result was derived using Chinese data, which differs from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data, upon which estimates are more commonly based. Drivers of Chinese phosphorus consumption were also identified, and trends in phosphate use from six developed countries were analysed to form an overall assessment of the current demand for phosphorus in China. This analysis indicates that the demand for Chinese PR has reached a plateau. Combining the forecasts of both extraction and demand, the study explores potential challenges for sustainable phosphorus management. The study concludes with a range of policies that may help ensure a sustainable supply of Chinese PR. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","109","Phosphorus","Extraction - Food supply - Sustainable development","Demand - Developed countries - Early warning indicators - Phosphate rocks - Phosphorus management - Resources - Sustainable management - U.s. geological surveys","802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 822.3 Food Products","Number: 2016ZR01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Many thanks to three anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions.

However, few studies on the microscopic mechanism of smithsonite sulfidization have been performed. In this work, density functional theory calculations are conducted to investigate the electronic properties and adsorption mechanism of sulfide ion species on smithsonite (1 0 1) surface. Results indicate that the Zn[sbnd]O bond breaks when smithsonite crystal is crushed and ground, and that zinc atoms are the dominant reactive sites for the subsequent adsorption of flotation reagents onto smithsonite surface. HS− ions can spontaneously react with Zn atoms at the top, bottom, and bridge sites of the mineral-surface layer, thereby forming a newly stable structure of Zn[sbnd]S on smithsonite (1 0 1) surface. The adsorption of HS− ion on this smithsonite surface greatly influences the structural and electronic properties of smithsonite (1 0 1) surface, changing the structure of Zn[sbnd]O and C[sbnd]O at the surface layer of smithsonite. We observe an obvious electron transfer between Zn and S atoms after HS− ion adsorption, as well as a significant difference in charge transfer when HS− ion adsorbs at different Zn sites on mineral surface. Besides, it proves that a slight oxidation occurs in the sulfidization process of smithsonite at the atomic level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","45","Electronic properties","Adsorption - Atoms - Charge transfer - Chemical reactions - Crystal atomic structure - Density functional theory - Flotation - Hydraulic structures - II-VI semiconductors - Ions - Ore treatment - Ores - Oxide minerals - Rare earths - Sulfur compounds - Zinc oxide","Adsorption mechanism - Electron transfer - Flotation reagents - Microscopic mechanisms - Smithsonite - Stable structures - Structural and electronic properties - Surface adsorption","482.2 Minerals - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 2018T111000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2018FD035, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51804144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge the Projects funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51804144 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018T111000 ), and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2018FD035 and 2016FD121 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

First, the geometrical relationship and infinite homography of vanishing points at various camera positions are used to derive the method. To improve the accuracy and robustness performance of this approach, an optimization method is then proposed to nonlinearly optimize the camera focal length.

Herein, an electron-donating group, namely p-phenylene, is incorporated into PCN by a polycondensation reaction between carbon nitride and p-phenylenediamine (or p-benzoquinone) to repair the structural defects. The p-phenylene-modified PCN exhibits an almost fivefold increase in H2 evolution, a threefold increase in photocurrent density, and higher nonradiative rate (0.285 ns−1). Spectroscopic studies confirm that p-phenylene tends to bridge the heptazine-based oligomers through a polycondensation reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that anchoring of the heptazine units by p-phenylene induces localization of h+ and e− on the phenylene and melem moieties, respectively, which effectively separates the charge carriers.

To approach the maximum solar absorption of a blackbody, efficient nanomaterials were developed with enhanced absorption in ultraviolet (UV)-visible to near infrared (NIR). Nanomaterials with broadband absorption, efficient heat transfer, minimum surface energy loss, and energy storage have recently emerged exhibiting accelerated the evaporation rate.

On the other hand, due to the potential risk during pursuing high payoff in human society, selecting the most common strategy for a player inside the interaction range is relatively safer, at least its payoff is not much lower than average, which is known as conformity. Motivated by these facts, we here propose a mechanism of conformity with memory whose core lies in two facts: (i) Each player first applies a memory rule to compare its own historical payoffs with a limited memory length and to take the strategy corresponding to the maximal payoff as historical optimal strategy; (ii) Each player can get the virtual optimal strategy by selecting the most common strategy from its neighbors’ historical optimal strategies according to the conformity rule. The asynchronous updating algorithm, together with the virtual strategy, is used to study the evolution of cooperation with different memory lengths on a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism remarkably promotes cooperation in three classical evolutionary social dilemmas. More specifically, it is revealed that the cooperation level decreases gradually as the memory length increases in the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game, and that the cooperation level increases as so does the memory length in the stag-hunt game. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","61","Behavioral research","Optimal systems - Virtual reality","Conformity - Cooperation - Evolutionary games - Memory effects - Social dilemmas","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 961 Systems Science - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2015FB113, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017TD0028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team; Number: 61703353, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61673016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61463050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018XWD-S0805, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 15TD0050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Sichuan Province; ","This work was partially supported by National Nature Science Foundation (61673016, 61703353, 61463050), SWUN Construction Projects for Graduate Degree Programs (2018XWD-S0805), Innovative Research Team of the Education Department of Sichuan Province (15TD0050), Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Innovation Research Team (2017TD0028), and Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2015FB113).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Controlling runoff water quantity and its water quality are the two main objectives of low impact development measures. This paper discusses the results of water quality testing, comparing content changes of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) measured from water samples collected from the same LID facilities established by LCTIP three times a month during 2018 the local rainy season. The values changes of various pollutants from sampling points to the outlet show that the water quality of after LID facilities is close to the state of natural rain before development. The water purification effect of the LID facility was verified. At the same time, it is necessary to understand that more factors will have an impact on water quality.

This paper focused on the effect of Crystallizer's 3D dimension of the large-scale Ti64 (Ti-6Al-4V) slab ingot on the solid-liquid interface morphology. The results show that when the cross-section length of Ti64 slab ingot exceeds 450 mm, the cooling capacity of the crystallizer does not increase. When the inner length exceeds the effective distance, the depth of molten pool and the width of mushy zone will not change with the increase of the inner length in the crystallizer. Moreover, increasing the ratio of the crystallizer's inner length to inner width is helpful to improve the production quality. The simulation results show that it is better to choose between 4:1 and 6:1. When the height of the crystallizer is higher than 300 mm, the depth of the molten pool and the width of mushy zone will not change.

To narrow the gap between solutions contributed by previous heuristic schemes and the optimal solution, and to ease the unacceptable computational burden of optimization approaches to VNE for large-scale networks, we propose the use of graph eigenspace notions for node mapping, that is, for associating virtual nodes to substrate nodes (SNs). We also contribute an inexact algorithm which projects all SNs to a 2-D eigenspace for generating a more efficient node mapping. There are some similarities between our method and numerous graph-matching strategies emerging in machine learning fields, but there are also some differences between the two, because the VNE problem is not strictly mathematical with respect to the mapping it seeks. Thus, we provide the relevant theoretical evidence to guarantee the solution quality of our scheme compared with a couple of previous VNE proposals. Simulation results demonstrate that our schemes can reach a better tradeoff point regarding runtime (that approaches the overhead of implementing eigendecomposition of a general matrix) and embedding quality metrics. Besides, our inexact algorithm using 2-D projection exhibits an improvement in quality over previous node-rank-based methods. © 2019 IEEE.","23","Embeddings","Mapping - Optimization - Pattern matching","Computational burden - Distance matrices - Eigen decomposition - Eigenspaces - Heuristic schemes - Large-scale network - Optimization approach - Virtual network embedding","405.3 Surveying - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effect of substitution of Sb for Ga on the crystalline structure, martensitic transformation (MT), magnetocaloric effect and shape memory effect of Co50V33Ga17 alloy has been investigated. The experimental results combined with theoretical calculation results indicate that Co50V33Ga17−xSbx (x = 0, 1, 2) series alloys are stabilized in a highly ordered Cu2MnAl (L21)-type structure with a space group F m3 ¯ m (no. 225) and Pearson’s symbol cF16 at 300 K. The temperature dependence of magnetization indicates that both Co50V33Ga16Sb1 and Co50V33Ga15Sb2 alloys experience the MT process; however, only Co50V33Ga16Sb1 possesses metamagnetic MT, which is relatively sensitive to the applied magnetic field. Associated with such a prominent behavior, the isothermal entropy change was obtained, which is about 4.53 J K−1 kg−1, 7.51 J K−1 kg−1 and 10.67 J K−1 kg−1 at about 164 K under the applied field of 1 T, 2 T and 3 T, respectively. Furthermore, a large strain value of 0.33% in Co50V33Ga16Sb1 alloy was obtained under an external magnetic field of 3 T during the MT, which is larger than that of 0.28% induced by temperature.

Allocating computing and storage resources through resource sharing has emerged as an effective way to improve the resources utilization. While in reality users' resource requirements may change at any time, previous work has studied mostly based on the premise that the number of tasks required by users is unlimited and the demand does not change. In order to solve the resource allocation problem that users have limited time-varying resource requirements, we propose a multi-resource fair distribution mechanism based on the concept of resource sharing fairness. Firstly, on the conceptual level, we develop a linear programming model according to users' dynamic limited tasks resource requirements and the amount of resources shared by users. This mechanism is further proved which satisfies four significant fairness properties: Sharing incentive, Pareto efficiency, Envy fairness, Truthfulness. Secondly, on the specific allocation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is designed by the concept of user sharing coefficient, which can ensure the fairness of distribution and the user does not share loss. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed resource allocation mechanism achieves good results in ensuring the fairness of user resource allocation and ensuring high resource utilization when users propose multiple sets of time-varying resource requirements. © 2019, Science Press.

Herein, a series of aromatic-substituted TPE derivatives were synthesized and used to separate mixtures of E/Z isomers by common column chromatography with high yields, as confirmed by single crystal analysis, mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The structure-property relationships of these molecules were systematically investigated by a combination of spectroscopic methods, theoretical calculations and single crystal data analysis. E/Z isomers exhibit many different fluorescent properties, such as AIE and mechanochromic behavior. Moreover, the position of N on the substituted pyridine ring also has an effect on the molecule stack pattern and the fluorescent properties.

Dermal application of maltol to DNCB-sensitized AD mice reduced erythema, pruritus, and lichenification scores. Histopathological examinations revealed significant decline in mast cell infiltration in maltol-treated AD mice. In addition, maltol accelerated skin barrier recovery by reducing TEWL and skin pH and increasing skin hydration. Maltol was also found to suppress atopy-induced IL-4 and IgE elevations in serum, which are known to be essential for the development of atopy.

Therefore, it is of great significance to identify plant disease quickly and adopt appropriate control measures to improve the quality of crops. In this paper, the healthy leaves, rust spot and green area near the spot of rust diseased leaves of broad bean, corn, allium fistulosum and garlic were studied by a tri-step IR spectroscopy method, including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, second derivatives infrared (SD-IR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy. The results showed that tiny differences were observed in the intensities and shape of several peaks in the original spectra of each crop leaves. And several peak intensity ratios in the original spectra were different. The peak intensity ratio A1 410/A1 646 of the healthy leaves, green area near spot and rust spot of rust diseased leaves of broad bean were 0.698, 0.624 and 0.616 respectively, and the corresponding ratio A2 926/A1 646 were 0.665, 0.638 and 0.552 respectively. The corresponding ratio A1 649/A1 055 of corn were 0.813, 0.696 and 0.691 respectively, and the corresponding ratio A1 382/A1 055 were 0.552, 0.478 and 0.465 respectively; the corresponding ratio of A2 926/A1 055 were 0.574, 0.467 and 0.469 respectively. The corresponding ratio A1 382/A1 061 of allium fistulosum were 0.843, 0.821 and 0.704 respectively; the corresponding ratio of A2 923/A1 061 were 0.707, 0.680 and 0.489 respectively. It can be seen that the intensity ratios of the rust spot and the green area near the spot of rust leaves were lower than that of the healthy leaves. More significant differences were exhibited in their SD-IR spectra in the range of 1 800~800 cm-1, and clearer differences in the position and intensity of auto and cross peaks were observed in the range of 860~1 690 cm-1 in 2D synchronous correlation spectra. The healthy leaves of broad beans showed 4 strong auto-peaks and 2 strong positive cross peaks, and 5 strong auto-peaks and 4 strong positive cross peaks were revealed in the green area near the spot of rust diseased leaves, and 2 strongest auto-peaks, 5 medium strong auto peaks and 5 strong positive cross peaks were appeared in the rust spot of rust diseased leaves. The intensity of auto-peaks of the rust spot of broad bean rust leaves were the strongest while the intensity of auto-peaks of the healthy leaves were the weakest. There were 9 strong auto-peaks and 12 strong positive cross peaks in the healthy leaves of corn, and 11 strong auto-peaks, 3 strongest positive cross peaks and 11 medium strong positive cross peaks in the green area near the rust spot on the diseased leaves, and 6 strong auto-peaks and 3 strong positive cross peaks in the rust spot of rust diseased leaves. There were 9 strong auto-peaks and 8 strong positive cross peaks in the healthy leaves of garlic, and 2 strongest auto-peaks, 9 medium strong auto-peak and 10 strong positive cross peaks appeared in the green area near spot of rust diseased leaves, and 6 strong auto-peaks and 1 strong positive cross peaks in the rust spot of rust diseased leaves. The intensity of auto-peaks of the green area near the spot of rust diseased leaves of corn and garlic were the strongest while the intensity of auto-peaks of the rust spot of rust diseased leaves were the weakest. There were 9 strong auto-peaks and 5 strong positive cross peaks in the healthy leaves of allium fistulosum, and 8 strongest auto-peaks and 3 strong positive cross peaks in the green area near the spot of rust diseased leaves, and 3 strong auto-peaks in the rust spot of rust diseased leaves. The auto-peaks of the healthy leaves of allium fistulosum were the strongest, while the auto-peaks of the rust spot of the rust leaves were the weakest. It is demonstrated that FT-IR combined with SD-IR and 2D-IR spectroscopy could be used to discriminate the crops rust leaves rapidly and effectively.

To achieve the goal of sustainable recycling of biological resources and mitigation of greenhouse gases, a novel metal-free cellulose-based Schiff-base heterogeneous catalyst (Cell-2L) is reported in the ring-opening addition reaction of CO2 with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates for the first time. The as-prepared samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller/Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, solid-state NMR, and thermogravimetric analysis analyses. The successful anchoring of nonmetal Schiff-base complex on chlorinated cellulose is evident from the structural composition studies. The catalytic activity results showed that the samples exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the solvent-free condition. The yield of resultant propylene carbonate was measured to be 98.7% with ∼100% selectivity. The enhanced role of the present catalyst for the ring-opening addition could be attributed to the synergy of its structural hydroxyl, phenolic -OH, and Lewis basic (imine) groups in the catalyst, which are capable of activating the epoxide and CO2, which efficiently participate in the reaction together with the substantial role of nucleophilic ionic (Br-) group from the co-catalyst. The catalyst was effectively reused for five consequent runs without a significant loss in the catalytic activity and showed high effectiveness for a series of other epoxides. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","83","Catalyst activity","Addition reactions - Carbon dioxide - Cellulose - Greenhouse gases - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Scanning electron microscopy - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Brunauer emmett tellers - Catalytic performance - Environmental catalysis - Fourier transform infra reds - Heterogeneous catalyst - Ring-opening addition reactions - Solvent free conditions - Structural composition","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives","Number: 2019M653845XB, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 10988880, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 21766016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 21566014 and 21766016).

Lake Dianchi, one of the most eutrophicated lakes in China, has epitomized this issue. Clear understandings of phosphorus (P) mitigation efforts, the evolution of P budgets, and possible risks in the Dianchi system will benefit future eutrophication control, providing valuable lessons for other plateau freshwater lakes. In this study, we applied systematic review methodology to investigate the above questions, and then compared the results with other lakes worldwide. Generally, meta-analytical approaches have indicated P levels remain a key factor in causing algal blooms. Post-2015, the P budget of the Dianchi system, especially in Caohai section, was modified. However, it's still experiencing high pressures from P enrichment (Caohai: 0.4 mg·l−1; Waihai: 0.2 mg·l−1). The flux of P in Dianchi remains high, both through the external P load (556 ton·a−1), and an internal cycle (304 ton·a−1 associated with the absorption, deposition and removal of algae biomass; and 380 ton·a−1 associated with sediment exchange). Meanwhile, significant P retention has been observed in the lake, in particular within the Waihai section (211 ton·a−1). Currently, water diversion (from external watersheds), sewage diversion, and sediment-dredging projects have benefited Dianchi. However, continuous urbanization and GPMn ecological degradation could introduce hundreds of tons of additional P, leading to subsequent algal blooms. Furthermore, beyond Lake Dianchi, other lakes and reservoirs in southwest China are facing similar issues regarding P mitigation, especially in GPMn regions, though corresponding knowledge is still limited. Therefore, effective and flexible sub-regional protection strategies and research related to external and internal P mitigations have become key requirements for Lake Dianchi management. Meanwhile, ecologically sensitive approaches to GPMn regions, as well as city development within basin and market driven treatments, should be incorporated into regional water source protection for southwest China. © 2019","77","Reservoirs (water)","Budget control - Dredging - Eutrophication - Flood control - Geology - Hierarchical systems - Intelligent systems - Lakes - Markov processes - Monte Carlo methods - Phosphorus - Sewage - Soil conservation - Urban growth - Water conservation - Water management","Analytical approach - Bayesian hierarchical model - Ecological degradations - Eutrophication control - Geological phosphorus-rich mountains - Lake sand reservoirs - Markov chain monte carlo simulation - Watershed management","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 441.2 Reservoirs - 442.1 Flood Control - 444 Water Resources - 452.1 Sewage - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","Number: QYZDY-SSW-SMC014, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2017HC015, Acronym: YNAU, Sponsor: Yunnan Agricultural University; Number: 41807524, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation ( 41807524 ), Response of Asian Mountain Ecosystems to Global Change, CAS , Grant No: QYZDY-SSW-SMC014 , and Provincial Innovation Group for Farmland Non-pollution Production, Yunnan Agricultural University ( 2017HC015 ).

In this paper, the aluminum was removed from the diamond wire saw powder via a direct HCl leaching method. In order to analyze the removal efficiency of various experimental conditions, certain parameters such as HCl concentration, leaching temperature, reaction time and liquid-solid ratio were also investigated. Particularly, the removal efficiency of Al reached 95.6% under the optimal leaching condition, such as the HCl concentration of 4 mol·L−1, the leaching temperature of 60 °C, the reaction time of 3 h, and the liquid-solid ratio of 10. The shrinking core model and homogeneous model were then respectively utilized to describe the leaching kinetics of the Al removal leaching process. The results indicated that the homogeneous model was more suitable than the shrinking core model. Moreover, the kinetics parameters regarding the reaction orders m=3, n=2.81, the activation energy Ea=97.30kJ mol−1, the frequency factor A=1.11×1014 min−1. Furthermore, the leaching mechanism of Al removal was revealed based on kinetic analysis and materials characterization.

The characterization results reveal that the sepiolite support could anchor Fe3O4 nanoparticles with good dispersion. The composite was used as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for atrazine (ATZ) degradation. 71.6% of ATZ and 20.9% of solution TOC could be removed after 60 min with 92 mmol/L of PS ([ATZ]0 = 10 mmol/L). Due to the good adsorption capacity of Fe3O4-sepiolite composite toward ATZ, the degradation was considered to be facilitated by an adsorption process, since the adsorbed ATZ can be more easily transported to the active sites and be degraded in situ. Operation factors, including PS dose and solution pH, were investigated and found to be influential for the ATZ removal. The Fe3O4-sepiolite composite maintained its catalytic activity and structural stability with negligible Fe leaching during the recycling batch experiments. The intermediate products were further identified and the possible transformation pathway was then proposed based on the results. The findings of this research promote the application of Fe3O4-sepiolite composite as efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for organic degradation, and provide insights into the development of alternative catalysts with good adsorptive properties. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","45","Iron oxides","Catalyst activity - Herbicides - Magnetite - Stability","Advanced oxidation - Coprecipitation method - Degradation pathways - Fe3O4-sepiolite - Heterogeneous catalyst - Persulfate - Structural stabilities - Transformation pathways","803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan University; ","The authors are grateful to the support and help from the college of chemistry and material science in Sichuan normal university .

The NN-SnO2 displays three particular particle morphologies: roundness, oval and polygon, with an average particle size of ~ 9 nm. When evaluated as a sensing material for methane, the NN-SnO2 sensor exhibits ultra-high response (Ra/Rg = 9.80), fast response/recovery times (τres/τrecov= 1 s/3 s) toward 3000 ppm methane at a operating temperature of 420 °C, which are far superior to the vast majority methane semiconducting sensors, and more importantly, it has barely been reported that the sensor based on NN-SnO2 presented such excellent gas-sensing performances for methane.

In this paper, we propose an efficient mobile energy replenishment scheme based on hybrid mode, namely MERSH, which merges the advantages of the existing online and offline modes to improve the energy supplement efficiency and meanwhile to adapt well to the energy consumption dynamicity of sensors to achieve sustainable operation of wireless sensor networks. In MERSH, nodes are allowed to proactively send charging requests to the mobile charger, called MC, when the residual energy goes down a lower level. With a special-designed low-cost method, MERSH can plan an optimized path for MC every time when it charges the sensors that have sent charging requests. Moreover, to ensure energy supplement and avoid node failure due to the high dynamic energy consumption, MERSH dynamically adjusts the charging duration of each node along the calculated charging path according to its maximum tolerate charging latency and minimum charging wait time. The theoretic analysis shows that MERSH guarantees MC to move along the optimized charging path, which reduces the whole charging cost. Through extensive simulation results, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed MERSH. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","32","Sensor nodes","Cost benefit analysis - Energy utilization","Energy limitations - Extensive simulations - Hybrid mode - Low cost methods - Rechargeable sensor networks - Sustainable operations - Theoretic analysis - Wireless charging","525.3 Energy Utilization - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics","Number: 2014FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 61462056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received April 11, 2019; accepted July 8, 2019.

However, there is a challenge in that shallow traps can result in interference with the real-time reading of optical information, and the anti-counterfeiting level also needs to be further enhanced. Here, a novel quasi-layer-structured Ca3Ga4O9:Bi3+ phosphor is introduced to address this challenge, based on the targeted recombination phenomenon. This material shows turning electron-trapping ability and obvious differences in photoluminescence, long persistent luminescence, and photo-stimulated luminescence processes, which are beneficial in achieving information reading without interference and provide multiple anti-counterfeiting. As a proof of concept, information reading without interference is experimentally achieved by choosing an appropriate filter and excitation wavelength, and multiple anti-counterfeiting applications are demonstrated using a simple seal-photocopy method.

In these contexts, commodification takes different forms, including sales of certified timbers and sales of carbon credits. In addition to the general aim to enhance income, these market-based forestry interventions typically aim to align with sustainable development agendas, including (a) safeguarding ecological integrity and (b) promoting poverty alleviation. Our concern here is that the process of forest commodification might lead to a shift in local norms of benefit-sharing, in ways that can hinder these key components of sustainable development goals. We report the results of a survey (N = 519) conducted across sites in Bolivia, China and Tanzania that shows that switching from non-monetary to monetary benefits is associated with changes in preferences for distributional fairness in ways that may be detrimental to the poor. In particular, we show that forest commodification is associated with a lower likelihood of selecting pro-poor or egalitarian approaches to benefit sharing and higher likelihood of selecting to distribute benefits in a way that rewards individual contributions or compensates losses. © 2019 The Author(s).

A novel methodology is proposed to evaluate the stability of slopes based on an uncertain set. The soil properties involved in the deterministic methods, i.e., shear strength parameters and unit weight, are expressed as uncertain sets, and their membership functions can be assumed to be triangular or trapezoidal for a homogeneous or two-layered slope, respectively. The parameter values of membership functions are designed according to the means and variations of the soil properties, and then the expected safety factor can be calculated through the operational laws. Two numerical examples including a homogeneous slope and a two-layered slope illustrate the suitability of the proposed methodology.

ZrO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 40 nm were synthesized by a sol-gel process with zirconium oxychloride as the precursor. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were synthesized via a facile method by calcining a solution of ammonium citrate. Synthesized CQDs suspended in absolute ethanol emitted a green glow under UV irradiation. A convenient one-step process involving mixing in absolute ethanol under sonication was adopted for the formation of CQD-decorated ZrO2 nanoparticles (CQDZ). The dried final composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of CQDZ was evaluated by quantifying the removal efficiency of methylene blue dye. CQDZ managed to remove methylene blue by 66.5%, 76.5%, 84.3% and 95.0% under UV-irradiation of 10, 20, 40 and 60 min respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, pure ZrO2 nanoparticles managed to remove only 34% of the dye under 60 min of UV irradiation. The produced composite showed promise as a formidable contender to be used in industrial dye removal from waste water. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","71","Semiconductor quantum dots","Aromatic compounds - Carbon - Ethanol - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Irradiation - Nanocrystals - Nanoparticles - Photocatalysis - Scanning electron microscopy - Sol-gel process - Synthesis (chemical) - Transmission electron microscopy - Zirconia","Carbon quantum dots - Experimental conditions - Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy - Methylene blue dye - Photocatalytic performance - Removal efficiencies - Zirconia nanoparticles - Zirconium oxychloride","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.3 Glass - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Increasing Nd values from 17 to 9.5 Ma imply relatively more erosion from the Karakoram and Kohistan, likely linked to slip on the Karakoram Fault and compression in the southern and eastern Karakoram. After a period of relative stability from 9.5 to 5.7 Ma, there is a long-term decrease in Nd values that corresponds with increasing relative abundance of > 300 Ma zircon grains that are most common in Himalayan bedrocks. The continuous presence of abundant Himalayan zircons precludes large-scale drainage capture as the cause of decreasing Nd values in the submarine fan. Although the initial increase in Lesser Himalaya-derived 1500-2300Ma zircons after 8.3Ma is consistent with earlier records from the foreland basin, the much greater rise after 1.9Ma has not previously been recognized and suggests that widespread unroofing of the Crystalline Lesser Himalaya and to a lesser extent Nanga Parbat did not occur until after 1.9 Ma. Because regional erosion increased in the Pleistocene compared to the Pliocene, the relative increase in erosion from the Lesser Himalaya does not reflect slowing erosion in the Karakoram and Greater Himalaya. No simple links can be made between erosion and the development of the South Asian Monsoon, implying a largely tectonic control on Lesser Himalayan unroofing. © Author(s) 2019.","94","Erosion","Binary alloys - Catchments - Geochronology - Lead alloys - Metamorphic rocks - Silicate minerals - Uranium alloys - Zircon","Detrital zircon grains - Karakoram fault - Lesser Himalaya - Relative abundance - Relative stabilities - Sr and Nd isotopes - Submarine fans - Tectonic control","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys","","This research has been supported by the USSSP (grant no. 355-001).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this article, we propose a new scheme based on dynamic pseudonym swap zone, to protect location privacy of vehicles. For each vehicle, dynamic pseudonym swap zone allows it dynamically to establish a temporary pseudonym swap zone on demand to exchange the pseudonym with another random vehicle in the just formed zone. This randomness of choosing the pseudonym exchanging vehicles prevents dynamic pseudonym swap zone from the secure risk that the information of exchanging participants exposes to their group manager in some existing works in which each pair of pseudonym exchanging participants is assigned by the manager. To avoid the high communication and computation overhead of frequently swapping pseudonyms, dynamic pseudonym swap zone adopts a combination of swap and update to achieve the unlinkability between new and previous pseudonyms. Moreover, dynamic pseudonym swap zone can self-adapt to the varying surroundings to reduce the communication cost of forming pseudonym swap zones in high vehicle density areas. The analysis and simulation results show that our proposed dynamic pseudonym swap zone is a high location privacy preserving, secure, auditable scheme. © The Author(s) 2019.","38","Vehicle to vehicle communications","Data privacy - Location - Managers - Vehicles","Analysis and simulation - Communication cost - Computation overheads - Group managers - Location privacy - Location privacy protection - pseudonym swap - Vehicle density","716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 912.4 Personnel","Number: 61262081, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61462056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61662042, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants nos 61662042, 61262081, and 61462056; the Yunnan Provincial Key Project of Applied Basic Research Plan under grants no. 2014FA028.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, the square direction gradient method was applied to extract the rough direction of the fingerprint field, and then the quality of the fingerprint was evaluated by using the gradient consistency based on the weights. The quality block was divided into four levels. Subsequently the neighborhood discrimination method was performed to correct the misjudged fingerprint block. After correcting the misjudged quality block, the number of the evaluated blocks in the neighboring block was counted. Thereafter, the blocks with the same quality score were divided into three priority levels. Finally, the fingerprint orientation field was iteratively calculated according to the quality and priority. During the iteration process, different weight values were assigned according to the square gradient of the neighborhoods of the block to be evaluated. After the iteration of the evaluation block was completed, the final orientation field was obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the reliability of the low-quality region through quality diffusion, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the regions with poor reliability. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

In the present, most solar physicists manually adjust parameters by trial and error to complete this step, because the mapping information may not be included in the flexible image transport system (FITS) header of a raw image. The manual approach cannot guarantee the accuracy. It is inefficient and has plagued many solar physicists. In this paper, we propose an automatic mapping approach by registering a high-resolution image to a standard calibrated solar full disk using image preprocessing and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technology. Following steps are included. (1) Downsampling and blurring a high-resolution image to roughly fit the scale and the resolution of its corresponding full disk image; (2) scaling the gray level to 256 by local minimum and maximum to meet the requirements of applying the standard OpenCV SIFT processing package; (3) removing the limb-darkening of the reference full disk image with Cartesian to polar coordinate transform method; (4) detecting the feature points by SIFT on both high-resolution and full disk images; (5) matching corresponding point pairs by fast library for approximate nearest neighbors (FLANN); (6) calculating translation, rotation and scale parameters by random sample consensus (RANSAC); (7) recording the registration results in FITS header with standard keywords of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) image. These keywords can be automatically retrieved by the Solar SoftWare (SSW) system. With this approach, we have successfully registered both active region and quiet sun images observed by the titanium dioxide (TiO) band of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to the continuum of the helioseismic and magnetic imager (HMI) instrument on the SDO, and Hα active region images of NVST to the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) with high accuracy (0.25 arcsec for photosphere and 1 arcsec for chromosphere). If a high-resolution image shows bright structures, such as flares, the Hα image of NVST could be registered to 304 Å image of the atmospheric imaging assembly (AIA) on SDO with the accuracy of 1 arcsec as well. In addition, the images observed by Hα blue/red wings (±0.7 Å) of NVST, TiO of the Goode solar telescope (GST), Hα of the Optical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer (ONSET) are also successfully registered to SDO/HMI continuum or SDO/AIA 304 Å full disk image. Iterative processing is applied to improve accuracy. An automatic SDO or GONG image downloading procedure and an extra interactive user interface are also integrated. This approach has met the requirement of mapping a highresolution image to the Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinates of full disk. Its weakness is that if a high-resolution image does not show high contrast, such as limb observation of photosphere or quiet sun of chromosphere, it is difficult to get a mapping result, because the whole strategy is based on image feature detection. The procedure will be merged into the observation system of NVST in the future, and will provide great convenience for the solar physicists to use the highresolution observation data. © 2019, Science Press.

However, limited studies have been conducted on the depression mechanism of Ca(ClO)2 for pyrite. This study investigates the effect of Ca(ClO)2 on pyrite flotation with butyl xanthate (KBX) in a low-alkaline medium. The addition of Ca(ClO)2 at pH 8.7 enhances pyrite hydrophilicity and decreases flotation recovery by ∼60%. Solubility tests and Visual MINTEQ model analysis indicate that Ca(ClO)2 promotes the dissolution of pyrite and produces more hydrophilic species on the pyrite surface. Contact angle measurement results confirm that adding Ca(ClO)2 increases the number of hydrophilic species. XPS study indicates that the depressing effect of Ca(ClO)2 on pyrite is due to the formation of CaSO4 and Fe(OH)3 and the adsorption of Ca(OH)+ on the surface. ToF–SIMS results provide strong evidence that adding Ca(ClO)2 increases the amount of hydrophilic species and decreases dixanthogen adsorption onto the pyrite surface. The thickness of the whole formed hydrophilic species is approximately 41.7 nm, and the thickness of the formed dixanthogen is few nanometers. Based on semiquantitative determination, the number of hydrophilic species follows the order of hydroxy calcium > iron carbonyl > hematite > calcium sulfate > calcium carbonate.

The perovskite microstructure, electrical transport properties, low-field magnetoresistance (MR) and peak temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) behaviors of the as-obtained materials were all studied and the results were discussed. Grain size of LCSMO ceramics expanded as more Sr was added but grain boundaries (GBs) decreased. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) analyses suggested that addition of Sr greatly enhanced the electrical/magnetic properties of the prepared specimens. The metal-insulator transition temperature rose as doping concentration x enhanced, and increased Ca2+ substitution led to reduced peaks of MR and TCR. For single-phase LCSMO, large room-temperature TCR and low-field MR effects (0.8 T magnetic field) were obtained by controlling the level of Sr2+ substituted Ca2+. For x = 0.095, the optimized room-temperature TCR and MR reached 13.78% K−1 (299.2 K) and 26.41% (302.6 K), respectively.

Lead oxide was manufactured via thermal decomposition in a vacuum from recycled lead carbonate that was extracted from lead acid battery waste. The decomposed products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and decomposition rate. The impact of the decomposition conditions, including temperature, preservation time, particle size and system pressure, on the lead carbonate decomposition rate were evaluated. The results show that the newly developed lead carbonate vacuum decomposition technique does a good job, and that the decomposition conditions strongly affect the lead carbonate decomposition rate and phase compositions. For instance, at a temperature range of 310–580 °C, a pressure ranging from 10 to 60 Pa, and a preservation time of 30 min, decomposition rates reached as high as 95.77%. At the temperature of 310 °C, when the preservation time increased from 30 min to 180 min, the decomposition rate increased from 29.62% to 78.40%. In terms of the effect of particle size, the mixed particles (≤20 mesh and ≤400mesh) worked best.

Stove-heating and -reheating generated significant EPR signals, and quickly dissipated during cooling. When the stove-heated samples were reheated by microwave, the EPR signals were further enhanced and lasted for over 2 h. FTIR characterization showed the breaking of C[dbnd]C and C[dbnd]O bonds and LF-NMR confirmed the increased polarity after stove heating. Microwave reheating following the stove heating generated much more small molecular chemicals according to GC–MS analysis, including some ring structures, which were not detected in stove heating or microwave heating alone. We thus proposed that these ring structures, such as benzene, were involved in the formation and stabilization of free radicals.

Two classes of event-triggered communication and control strategies with fixed sampling period are considered. By designing different event conditions, the communications amongst neighbouring vehicles are allowed at each sampling time instant in the first strategy, whereas the control input of each vehicle is updated only when its own or neighbours’ event conditions are violated. Furthermore, both communication and control update are allowed only when the events of itself or neighbours are triggered in another strategy. To this end, an unified event-triggered and distributed observer-based controller with globally asymptotic convergence rate is proposed. And corresponding sufficient conditions are derived regarding to two types of event conditions, based on Lyapunov technique, matrix analysis and algebraic graph theory. It is worth noting that the Zeno-behaviour of systems with the presented controllers and event conditions is naturally avoided for all the vehicles due to the advantageous property of sampled-data control.

The aim of this study was to examine the miRNA profile of ASD patients, and to identify the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of ASD. We performed a miRNA comparison between the atrial septa of three normal fetuses and three ASD patients by microarray, followed by chromosome clustering and bioinformatic analysis to identify the dysregulated miRNA clusters between these two groups. Furthermore, qRT-PCR in the mouse developing heart was used to exclude differences resulting from the use of unpaired stage patient samples. After normalization, 70 dysregulated miRNAs were detected between the two groups. Advanced chromosome clustering and bioinformatic analysis showed that two upregulated miRNA clusters (miR-29 and miR-143/145) and three downregulated miRNA clusters (miR-17-92, miR-106b-25 and miR-503/424) were associated with ASD. Further qRT-PCR in the mouse developing heart found that the dysregulated expression levels of all the clusters, except the miR-143/145 cluster, were associated with the occurrence of ASD.

The result showed that the solo application of chemical fertilizers (NPK treatment) or combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers (N1P1K1Z1-total nitrogen in biogas slurry replaced 25% of the total application amount of chemical fertilizer, N2P2K2Z2-total nitrogen in biogas slurry replaced50% of the total application amount of chemical fertilizer, N3P3K3Z3-total nitrogen in biogas slurry replaced 75% of the total application amount of chemical fertilizer) had no obvious effects on the soil pH values and the contents of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium (P>0.05), while the combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers (especially N3P3K3Z3 treatment -high dosage biogas slurry) significantly increased the contents of soil alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium (P0.05), while the combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers significantly decreased the proportion of actinomycetes (P0.05). Solo application of chemical fertilizers had no significant effects on the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen of bamboo forest (P>0.05), but the combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers significantly increased the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen by 19.3%-62.0% and 52.7%-147.3%, respectively (P0.05), but the combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers significantly increased the invertase activity by 46.2%-138.5% (P1P1K1Z1 treatments compared to the CK, respectively (P2P2K2Z2 and N3P3K3Z3 treatments. There were no significant (P>0.05) difference among the CK, NPK, N1P1K1Z1 and N2P2K2Z2 treatments of catalase activity. In summary, the combined application of biogas slurry and chemical fertilizers could significantly increase soil available nutrient contents, the proportions of bacterial and fungi, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and the activity of invertase, urease and catalase. In all fertilization treatments, the increase of above indicators under N3P3K3Z3 treatment was the most obvious. In addition, all fertilization treatments significantly increased the mean diameter at breast height of one-year bamboo, two-year bamboo and bamboo stand by 38.9%-61.7%, 11.8%-18.8%, and 13.1%-24.4%, respectively (P3P3K3Z3 treatment was the most obvious.

To improve the objectivity of online services reputation measurement under the circumstance referred above, this paper presents a method of online service reputation measurement based on Kendall tau distance. Firstly, a distance metric is defined to measure the consistency between the two rating vectors. Secondly, the measurement of online service reputation is modeled as an optimization problem to find a reputation vector that minimizes the Kendall tau distance between the reputation vector and the user-service rating matrix. Finally, simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem and the reputation vector is served as a service reputation. The rationality and effectiveness of the method have been verified by experimental study. The experiments show that the method can meet the preferences of most users, so that users can make right services choice decision, and ensure the efficiency while improving the manipulation resistance ability of the reputation measurement method. © 2019, Science Press.

Herein, a nickel (Ni) and magnesium (Mg) co-doping strategy was employed to synthesize LiNi0.03Mg0.05Mn1.92O4 cathode material via a facile solid-state combustion approach. The effects of the Ni-Mg co-doping on crystalline structure, micromorphology and electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared LiNi0.03Mg0.05Mn1.92O4 are investigated by a series of physico-chemical characterizations and performance tests at high-rate and elevated-temperature. The resultant LiNi0.03Mg0.05Mn1.92O4 has the intrinsic spinel structure with no any impurities, and exhibits an elevated average valence of manganese in comparison to the pristine LiMn2O4. Owing to the Ni and Mg dual-doped merits, the LiNi0.03Mg0.05Mn1.92O4 sample demonstrates a robust spinel structure and high first discharge specific capacity of 112.3 mAh g−1, whilst undergoing a long cycling of 1000 cycles at 1 C. At a high current rate of 20 C, the capacity of 91.2 mAh g−1 with an excellent retention of 77% is obtained after 1000 cycles. Even at 10 C under 55 °C, an excellent capacity of 97.6 mAh g−1 is also delivered.

The results show that the curves of the in-cylinder pressure of n-octanol/diesel blends nearly overlap those of pure diesel fuel under the test conditions. At a low EGR ratio, the brake thermal efficiency of n-octanol/diesel blends is higher than that of diesel fuel. With an increase in the EGR ratio, the results show that nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions decrease, whereas carbon monoxide (CO) and soot emissions significantly increase. However, the use of n-octanol/diesel blends can inhibit the increase in CO and soot emissions appreciably. In addition, with an increase in n-octanol content in the blends, the number concentration of particles on the particle size distribution decreases gradually. To summarize, a simultaneous reduction in NOX and PM emissions under a combined operation of small EGR ratios and n-octanol blends can be realized, thereby improving the brake thermal efficiency. © 2019","47","Exhaust gas recirculation","Alcohol fuels - Brakes - Carbon monoxide - Diesel engines - Diesel fuels - Direct injection - Gas emissions - Nitrogen oxides - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Particulate emissions - Soot","Brake thermal efficiency - Combustion characteristics - Direct injection diesel engines - Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) - In-cylinder pressures - N-octanol - Particle numbers - Simultaneous reduction","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 521 Fuel Combustion and Flame Research - 523 Liquid Fuels - 602 Mechanical Drives and Transmissions - 612.1.1 Internal Combustion Engine Components - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science","Number: 51666007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51865002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51865002, 51666007).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that there is no carbide precipitated from the martensitic matrix when the sample was tempered at 480 °C. However, when the sample was tempered at 540 °C, a large number of stable spherical M6C carbides precipitated in the test steel. Nevertheless, there are three types of carbides precipitated from the matrix including M6C, M2C and M23C6 carbides when the tempering temperature reached 600 °C. The mechanical properties also present a correlation with the evolution of carbides during tempering at different temperatures. This indicates that the strengthening mechanism of the steel is mainly attributed to the precipitation of carbides and their evolution, including the morphologies and types of carbides at different temperatures. In addition, the austenitic layers with a thickness of about 30 nm have been obtained between the martensite laths after tempering at 600 °C.

In this paper, the 14-3-3 encoding gene was cloned, the recombinant 14-3-3 protein was expressed and purified, and rabbit antibody against 14-3-3 protein was obtained. The expression level of 14-3-3 protein in Cryptococcus humicola increased with increasing aluminum (Al) concentrations and reached the highest level under 20 mM Al. Co-immunoprecipitation between 14-3-3 protein and the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase showed similar trend, as the expression of PM H+-ATPase interacted with 14-3-3 protein. These results suggested that 14-3-3 protein interacted with PM H+-ATPase under Al stress. To verify the role of the 14-3-3 protein in Al-tolerant mechanisms, transgenic yeast overexpressing the 14-3-3 gene were generated. The transgenic yeast could grow well in culture medium containing 2 mM Al, while the yeast with pYES3/CT and wild-type yeast (negative control) could not grow or grew poorly when inoculated at a dilution of 10-4 of the original concentration. Therefore, these data showed that over-expression of 14-3-3 protein enhanced the Al tolerance of the yeast. The content of residual active Al in medium cultured by 14-3-3 transgenic yeast is much lower than that of medium cultured by the yeast containing empty vector. These data suggested that over-expression of 14-3-3 protein enhances Al tolerance of yeast, and that Al tolerance may be due to the adsorption of active Al. © 2019 Journal of Biotech Research.","19","Recombinant proteins","Aluminum - Cell membranes - Cloning - Encoding (symbols) - Gene encoding - Signal encoding - Yeast","14-3-3 - Abiotic stress tolerances - Aluminum resistance - Aluminum tolerance - Co-immunoprecipitations - Cryptococcus humicola - Expression levels - Whole genome sequencing","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 541.1 Aluminum - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products","Number: 31160020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31560246, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Dr. Papadopoulos Vassilios (The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Canada) for providing the yeast expression vector pYES3/CT and the S. cerevisiae INVSC1 (MATa his3D1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52) strain.

Comparative transcriptome analysis and carbohydrate dynamics indicated that leaf herbivory activated systemic carbon reallocation to enhance resource investment for local secondary metabolism. The crucial role of jasmonic acid and the involvement of other potential hormone signals for local and systemic signaling networks were supported by phytohormone quantification and dynamic expression analysis of phytohormone-related genes.

The effect of a ZnO intermediate layer between CZTS and Mo on the microstructure, morphology and photovoltaic properties was investigated. Three samples with different ZnO thickness, named as S1 (10 nm), S2 (50 nm) and S3 (211 nm), had the identical composition ratio of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.67 and Zn/Sn = 1.05 for kesterite structure. No obvious secondary phase such as SnS, SnS2 and ZnS was found. XRD showed no ZnO peak which indicated that the ZnO layer was completely sulfurized and converted to ZnS and CZTS. The ZnO intermediate layer significantly inhibited the formation of MoS2 and the decomposition of CZTS. A porous interlayer with many voids appeared at CZTS/Mo in S1 and S2 which originated from two different formations of CZTS and resulted in the inferior properties. The efficiency of CZTS solar cells without ZnO was only 2.7%, obviously below that of the three samples with ZnO. The Voc and Jsc of S3 was 625 mV and 12.6 mA cm−2 respectively, which resulted in the highest efficiency of 4.16% in three samples.

This study develops a framework for seeking the required minimum number of travel time observations generated from FCD for urban link TTD estimation. The basic idea is to test how, with a decreasing the number of observations, the similarities between the distribution of estimated travel time from observations and those from the ground-truth vary. These are measured by employing the Hellinger Distance (HD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. Finally, the minimum sample size is determined by the HD value, ensuring that corresponding distribution passes the KS test. The proposed method is validated with the sources of FCD and Radio Frequency Identification Data (RFID) collected from an urban arterial in Nanjing, China. The results indicate that: (1) the average travel times derived from FCD give good estimation accuracy for real-time application; (2) the minimum required sample size range changes with the extent of time-varying fluctuations in traffic flows; (3) the minimum sample size determination is sensitive to whether observations are aggregated near each peak in the multistate distribution; (4) sparse and incomplete observations from FCD in most time periods cannot be used to achieve the minimum sample size. Moreover, this would produce a significant deviation from the ground-truth distributions. Finally, FCD is strongly recommended for better TTD estimation incorporating both historical trends and real-time observations. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.","36","Travel time","Advanced traffic management systems - Computational complexity - Radio frequency identification (RFID) - Sampling - Traffic control","Floating car data - Hellinger distance - Incomplete observation - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test - Real time observation - Real-time application - Sample size determination - Travel time distributions","406.1 Highway Systems - 431 Air Transportation - 432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 434 Waterway Transportation - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although soil microbes play a key role in ecosystem functioning, their response to grassland degradation has not been fully investigated. In particular, degraded patch formation is the main feature of alpine meadow degradation, but little is known about its effect on soil microbes. In this study, soils were collected from three patch-degraded Tibetan alpine meadows to examine the effects of degraded patch formation on soil microbial communities. The alpine meadows at the three sites were in the third to fifth stages of degradation, respectively. Soil microbial abundance and community structure were determined through real-time PCR and MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the degraded patch formation significantly decreased microbial respiration rates, changed the interaction patterns among microbial taxa, and increased fungal diversity, but did not significantly affect microbial abundance. Additionally, both prokaryotic and fungal community composition was significantly altered by the degraded patch formation. The functional predictions based on FAPROTAX and FUNGuild suggested that degraded patch formation significantly increased the proportion of nitrifiers, plant pathogenic fungi, and saprotrophic fungi, especially when mattic epipedons were eroded. The increased relative abundance of nitrifiers and pathogenic fungi can aggravate the risk of nitrogen leaching and plant diseases, respectively. Therefore, degraded patch formation can impede the recovery of degraded alpine meadows by changing soil microbial community composition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","62","Soils","Bacteria - Biodegradation - Fungi - Nitrification - Polymerase chain reaction","Alpine grasslands - Fungal community compositions - Land degradation - Microbial community composition - Qinghai Tibet plateau - Soil micro-organisms - Soil microbial community - Soil microbial community compositions","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions","Number: 2016YFC0501800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 31570518, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31971530, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0501800), the Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20050103), the start-up funding from Yunnan University (C176220100024), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570518 and 31971530).

Upon screening in the presence of Pb, PbRB3 strain exhibited significant plant growth promoting potential. A 3 weeks long pot experiment was established to examine the capability of PbRB3 strain for physiological and biochemical traits, and Pb accumulation tendency of mung bean at 250 and 500 mg kg−1 of Pb toxicity, respectively. With respect to control treatments, photosynthetic pigments, protein synthesis, net assimilation rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were significantly constrained by Pb toxicity levels. Intrinsic and instantaneous water use efficiencies were considerably improved in inoculated plants under Pb toxicity. Compared to inoculated control, significantly higher superoxide dismutase activity in both Pb toxicity treatments, while higher malondialdehyde contents only at Pb500 treatment was recorded with PbRB3 inoculation. Catalase activity between Pb250 and Pb500 treatments was comparable at both inoculation level. Moreover, PbRB3 inoculation led to significantly higher peroxidase activity under Pb toxicity treatments compared to inoculated control. The PbRB3 inoculation led to comparable differences in root Pb content between Pb250 and Pb500 treatments.

To elucidate this, we cloned HisK2301 from Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae strain YM25235, characterized HisK2301 as a novel HHK, and further investigated the role of HisK2301 by overexpressing it in YM25235. Our results revealed that HisK2301 can promote adaptation of YM25235 to cold, osmotic, and salt stresses. During cold stress, HisK2301 significantly enhanced the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and intracellular glycerol. HisK2301 also augmented the expression levels of Δ12/Δ15 fatty acid desaturase (RKD12) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase1 (GPD1), which are responsible for PUFA and glycerol biosynthesis, respectively. To conclude, our findings give the first insight into the defense and mechanisms of HisK2301 in fungi against cold stress and suggest the potential use of the novel cold-adapted HHK HisK2301 in industrial processes, such as large-scale production of PUFA. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","54","Polyunsaturated fatty acids","Amino acids - Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Cloning - Environmental regulations - Enzymes - Fungi - Glycerol","cold adaptation - Environmental stress - Glycerol biosynthesis - Histidine kinase - Industrial processs - Intracellular glycerol - Large scale productions - Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae",,"Number: D-201643, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31160016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","*Phone: 86-871-65920751.

The effects of Ethaline concentration, temperature, ZTA concentration and deposition times on the morphology of ZTAp@Ni have been investigated. Experimental results show that the thickness of Ni coating is about 7–10 μm, and there is no casting crack or shrink on the composite, so compact bonding between ceramic and matrix is obtained. In addition, the impact abrasive wear resistance testing demonstrates that the performance of ZTAp@Ni reinforced HMS composite is superior to that of matrix. On the basis of experimental analysis, a schematic illustration of the cast-infiltration process is put forward. It implies that Ni-encapsulated ZTA can be wetted with molten HMS matrix to form a ZTA/Al2NiO4-Al2MnO4/Fe interface layer through Ni diffusion and reactive wetting.

A service composition is usually implemented in either a centralized or decentralized manner. Compared with the centralized service composition, the decentralized composition has no central control component, and components interact with each other directly, thereby achieving better performance. Process partitioning is a technique to divide a process into multiple parts and has been shown that it can be successfully applied to decentralizing process-driven service compositions. This paper proposes a new process partitioning technique for constructing decentralized service compositions. The proposed technique, which is based on typed digraphs and a graph transformation technique, is used for exploring available process partitioning solutions. For applications, this paper discusses the topology and interaction features about the partitioning solutions and summarizes a ranking method for them. Three experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods in this paper.

However, the comprehensive chemical analysis of the formulated ARIF I has yet to be clarified. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-orbitrap HRMS) method executed in full scan/data-dependent MS2 (full MS/dd-MS2) mode has been established in negative ion mode to analyze the major chemical constituents in ARIF I as well as in its three constituent herbs. To rapidly and efficient identify these compounds, we employed a combination of statistical analysis of the MS2 data and fragmentation pathway method to screen for elementary characteristic ions and sub-characteristic ions. Then, we applied multifold characteristic ion filtering to comprehensively profile ARIF I extract chemical constituents with diverse structures. A total of 360 compounds, including anthraquinones, sennosides, galloyl glucoside derivatives, catechin and its derivatives, flavonoids, iridoids, phenylpropanoids, lignan, organic acid, and other compounds were rapidly identified or tentatively characterized by multifold characteristic ion filtering based on their accurate mass spectra (within 5 ppm error) and structure types or by comparison with reference standards. All the ARIF I compounds were also detected in the individual constituent herbs. This study provides a basis for further pharmacokinetic studies of ARIF I and may help in the discovery of new chemical drugs to treat chronic kidney disease.

Because of the recalcitrance, they could enter swine wastewater and become a serious obstruction factor for the anaerobic digestion process. In this work, three dietary fibres abundant in pig feedstocks: Wheat Bran Fibre (WBF), Alfalfa Fibre (AF) and Rice Chaff Fibre (RCF) were chosen and their anaerobic degradability was determined. The results showed that the biochemical methane potential in 10 days (BMP10) of WBF, AF and RCF was 258, 176 and 86 mL/g-VS, respectively. The size, purity, crystallinity, and lignin coating in particular, were found having influences on the anaerobic biodegradability of dietary fibres. To surprise, a negative rather than positive effect was observed for the direct addition of extraneous cellulase into the anaerobic digestion systems, leading to a longer lag time and a smaller BMP10. The enhancement was achieved for the addition of extraneous bacteria in the form of anaerobic granular sludge (AnGS), shortening the lag time of WBF and AF by 36% and 13%, respectively. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, abundant protein and amino acids degraders found in anaerobic activated sludge (AnAS) could degrade the exogenous enzymes.

This paper proposes a novel optimal operation strategy for an active distribution network to enhance system resilience.. The objectives in the proposed optimal strategy include, the resilience, operation cost, and its pollutant emissions. According to the existence of uncontrollable distributed energy resources in the active distribution network, the problem which takes the uncertainty most into account, is this multi-objective optimization problem. Thus, it can be treated as a min-max dual robust optimization problem. Benders decomposition is employed to decouple the problem, then non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is applied to search the multi-objective optimal solution which has an extremely low CPU time. The modified standard IEEE 34-node system, with different distributed energy resources types, is employed, as a studied case, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal operation strategy.

Firstly, a global oil momentum model was established based on the fluid resistance. Then, according to the coupled heat transfer between the winding, the oil flow, and the radiator, a control equation describing the oil temperature distribution was established by using energy conservation. Simultaneously, a three-dimensional numerical model of transformer and the heat run test platform were established to verify the proposed model. Finally, the double logarithmic linear regression model was used to correct the nonlinear thermal parameter oil index. The research results show that, according to the design parameters, the upper limit of transformer top oil temperature rise under overload operation condition can be obtained using the calculation method presented in this paper; the calculation results of temperature rise are basically consistent with the CFD simulation results. The average relative errors of top oil temperature rise and bottom oil temperature rise are 3.61% and 3.28%, respectively, and the average relative error is 3.43% compared with the actual test results, which verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. The oil index under overload is corrected and its accuracy is improved by 2.627% compared with the reference value of the IEEE.

In this paper, with 150 flue-cured tobaccos as test samples, with two Bruker MPA near infrared spectrometer and one Thermo Antaris near infrared spectrometer as the research object. We obtained spectral data by integrating sphere diffuse reflectance. Processed and analyzed the spectral data by using the first derivative and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation, and calculated the value of residual error between different instruments, first moment, signal probability density and maximum signal to noise ratio(SNR) and so on. Also, we established mathematical model of total sugar content by partial least squares (PLS) to test the effect of model transfer. The results showed that first derivative could reduce the first moment and transfer the deviation between different instruments into the standard Gaussian distribution, but at the same time, it could also put SNR down. SNV could also reduce the first moment and even could do better than first derivative, and it could increase SNR significantly, but SNR could not transfer the deviation into standard Gaussian distribution, which would need other ways to make up for it. The combination method of the first derivative and SNV can retain the advantages of both, and make up for the disadvantages of individual treatment, and it can settle the model transfer problem caused by different instrument types and different using time between different instruments that work in the principle of Fourier, which is based on the integrating sphere diffuse reflectance.

Air-dried remolded loam was mixed with octadecylamine to obtain water repellent loam. A total 5 kinds of loam with octadecylamine content of 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0% were prepared. For each loam with a certain octadecylamine content, 16 samples with different initial moisture content were then prepared. The water repelling of water repellent loam was determined by water drop penetration time (WDPT), and the critical moisture content of water repellent loam was proposed. Then the permeability tests of water repellent loam under different water head differences were carried out by using a triaxial permeameter. The relationship between octadecylamine content, seepage discharge and water head differences was analyzed, and the permeability coefficient of water repellent loam was obtained. The octadecylamine and soil moisture content were important factors affecting soil water repellency and the higher octadecylamine mass fractions had the stronger water repellency of loam, the lower moisture content of upper limit, and the higher moisture content of lower limit. When the moisture content was less than 12%, the drop penetration time of loam with octadecylamine content of 0.2% and 0.4% was less than 5 s, which showed hydrophilicity. When the moisture content of loam increased to 21%, the drop penetration time of loam increased rapidly to 3 611 and 4 012 s, respectively. That means the corresponding water repelling of loam changed from hydrophilicity to extreme level. The drop penetration time of loam soil with moisture content between 21% and 25% was more than 3 600s, which showed extreme level. When the moisture content increased from 25% to 32% (saturation), the water repellency of loam decreased rapidly from extreme to hydrophilicity. In loam with natural air-dried moisture content, the drop penetration time of loam with octadecylamine content of 0.6% and 0.8% were 731 s and 2 584 s, which showed severe level. With the increasing of moisture content, the drop penetration time increased rapidly to 9 345 s (moisture content of 23.1%) and 12 364 s (moisture content of 21.6%), which showed extreme levels. Then the drop penetration time decreased rapidly and the water repellency disappeared completely at saturation. The drop penetration time of natural air-dried loam was 4 886 s with octadecylamine content of 1.0%, which showed extreme level. With the increasing of moisture content, the drop penetration time also increased rapidly. The maximums of drop penetration time were more than 18 000s (moisture content of 19.3%, 20.0% and 23.7%) which showed extreme levels. When the moisture content increased to 26.8%, the drop penetration time decreased rapidly to 9 346 s, and the water repellency disappeared completely at saturation. For loam with octadecylamine content of 0.2% and 0.4%, the upper limits of moisture content were 11.1% and 10.8%, and the lower limits of moisture content were 23.9% and 24.1%, respectively. For loam with octadecylamine contents of 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0%, the upper limits of moisture content were 3.5%, 2.8% and 2.0%, and the lower limits of moisture content were 26.3%, 27.1% and 27.3%, respectively. When the octadecylamine content were the same, the initial infiltration rates was less affected by water head differences. After a period of time, the infiltration rates were decreased suddenly and kept stable. The larger water head differences had the higher stable infiltration rates. When the water repellency of soils changed from wettable to extreme level, the stable infiltration rate gradually decreased. The mutation time of infiltration was shortened with the increasing of water head differences. When the octadecylamine content were low (0%, 0.2% and 0.4%), the permeability coefficients were greatly affected by the water head differences: the greater the water head differences had the smaller permeability coefficients. When the octadecylamine content were high (0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0%), the permeability coefficients were basically not affected by the water head differences. When the octadecylamine content was 0.8% and the water head difference was 20 kPa, the water hardly infiltrated into loam which showed complete impermeability. The results can provide theoretical support to analysis on hydrophobized soil and its application in civil and hydraulic engineering. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Several critical genes involved in the isoflavone biosynthesis (i.e., PAL, CHS, CHI, IFS) of soybeans treated with and without chitohexaose were analyzed, and results suggested that chitohexaose application could dramatically stimulate the transcription of these genes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","45","Seed","Amino acids - Antioxidants - Bioactivity - Biosynthesis - Cultivation - Flavonoids - Gene expression - Metabolites - Nitrogen fixation - Polymerization - Transcription","Degree of polymerization - germination - Isoflavones - Oligochitosan - Soybean seeds","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 Biology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.2 Polymerization - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 31660461, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The present work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31660461) and the key lab of marine bioactive substance and modern analytical technique, SOA (Grant No. MBSMAT-2016-06).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Meanwhile, the adsorption mechanism of TBT+ (organic part of TBTB) was theoretically investigated by quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that TBTB acts as a good inhibitor, and inhibition efficiency in three chlorinated acetic acids follows the order: ClCH2COOH 2CHCOOH 3CCOOH. The maximum inhibition efficiency of 1.0 mM TBTB from weight loss method is 85.8% in ClCH2COOH; 91.7% in Cl2CHCOOH; and 95.5% in Cl3CCOOH. The adsorption of TBTB on CRS surface obeys Langmuir isotherm, and the adsorption free energy (ΔG0) is about −34 kJ mol−1. In each chlorinated acetic acid solution, TBTB behaves as a mixed inhibitor, and the presence of TBTB shifts the both anodic and cathodic curves to lower current densities. With the addition of TBTB, the corrosion potential almost does not alter in ClCH2COOH, while becomes more positive in Cl2CHCOOH, and moves negative position in Cl3CCOOH. EIS exhibits one large depressed capacitive loop at high frequencies followed by a small inductive section at low frequencies. In the presence of TBTB, the charge transfer resistance increases, while both constant phase element and double layer capacitance decreases. SEM micrographs reveal that the corrosion of CRS can be efficiently retarded by TBTB. TBT+ can be further protonated by H+ in acid solution to form TBTH2+. Both TBTH2+ and TBT+ could easily physical adsorb on steel surface owing to high dipole moment values, and TBTH2+ exhibits stronger physisorption than TBT+. The electron densities of both HOMO and LUMO are localized principally on tetrazole and thiazole rings, which are chemical adsorption sites. TBTH2+ strengthens accepting electrons while weakens donating electrons as compared with TBT+. Both TBT+ and TBTH2+ adsorb onto Fe (001) surface with nearly flat orientation mode, and the adsorption energy of TBT+ is a little higher than that of TBTH2+. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","64","Steel corrosion","Acetic acid - Adsorption - Charge transfer - Chlorine compounds - Cold rolling - Corrosion inhibitors - Dichloroacetic acid - Electrochemical corrosion - Electrochemical electrodes - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Electrons - Free energy - Isotherms - Metal cladding - Molecular dynamics - pH - Quantum chemistry - Scanning electron microscopy - Steel - Steel sheet - Trichloroacetic acid","Adsorption free energy - Charge transfer resistance - Constant phase element - Double-layer capacitance - Molecular dynamics simulations - Potentiodynamic polarization curves - Quantum chemical calculations - Triazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide","535.1.2 Rolling Mill Practice - 545.3 Steel - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2015HB049, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51361027, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was carried out in the frame of research projects funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51361027 ) and Training Program of Young and Middle Aged Academic and Technological Leaders in Yunnan Province ( 2015HB049 ).
