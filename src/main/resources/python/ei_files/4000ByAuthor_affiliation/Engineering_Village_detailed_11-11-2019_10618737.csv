In this paper, a new, clean and efficient vulcanization-vacuum distillation process is used to separate the rare metal Te from cadmium telluride. Taking CdTe (99.99%) and S (99.99%) as examples, the feasibility of this process was verified on a laboratory scale. Recovery of cadmium telluride waste was simplified to two-step vulcanization and vacuum distillation process. The effects of temperature and time on vulcanization-vacuum distillation were investigated. The experimental results show that the purity of Te obtained by vacuum distillation was 99.92%, and the purity of cadmium sulfide was up to 99.5%. This method provides theoretical guidance for the recycling of cadmium telluride photovoltaic modules. Compared with the traditional methods, this process has a short refining process, does no generate waste water or waste gas, and is environmentally friendly.

On the other hand, most of the existing literature for them can only deal with time-independent covariates. Sometimes one may face time dependent covariates and furthermore the covariates could also suffer measurement errors. For the situation, one approach is to conduct a joint analysis for which many methods have been developed in the literature under various framework. One drawback of these methods is that they usually assume that there are no more measurements on the covariates after the failure time and it is apparent that this may not be true. In this paper, a new joint analysis approach is proposed that can take into account the extra observations. In particular, for estimation, a MCEM algorithm is developed that is much more stable and converges much faster than the existing algorithms. To assess the finite sample performance of the proposed method, an extensive simulation study is conducted and suggests that it works well for practical situations. Also the method is applied to an AIDS study that motivated this investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","33","Failure (mechanical)","Regression analysis - Sampling","Covariates - Extensive simulations - Finite sample performance - Interval censoring - Joint analysis - MCEM algorithm - Time independents - Time-dependent covariates","922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 11671349, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors wish to thank Professor Ana Colubi, Co-Editor-in-Chief, the Associate Editor and two reviewers for their many helpful and insightful comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Metric learning is one of the most commonly used methods in PRID. However, most of them do not explore the label information carried by the labeled training samples, which limits the improvement of recognition performance. To this end, we propose a joint learning method by integrating the discriminative metric learning, the support vector machine (SVM) and the identity discriminator into one model, so as to realize joint construction of metric learning and identity discriminator. In this process, the label information carried by the training samples is fully exploited and the latent identify space of pedestrians is constructed by predicting the person's identity. To mitigate the appearance ambiguity caused by the variations in camera views, body poses, illumination and occlusion, we develop an extreme distance regularization term and introduce it into the joint learning framework to refine the solution spaces of the metric learning and discriminator. Finally, we present a similarity measure method by combining the advantages of the metric learning and the identity discriminator.

Additionally, these nanoparticles, in response to the tumor microenvironment, showed rapid drug release and generated the hydroxyl radicals (HO[rad]) by the Fenton reaction between Mn2+ and endogenous H2O2 for use in MRI-guided anti-tumor activity. Firstly, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were used to reduce KMnO4 to HMnO2 nanoparticles followed by acetone etching. After bufalin loading, these NPs were biomimetically cloaked with PLTM to form PLTM-HMnO2@Bu NPs. In vitro release profiles showed that the NPs responded to acid pH and glutathione (GSH) to induce decomposition of MnO2, resulting in rapid release of bufalin and yielding the MRI contrast agent Mn2+. In vivo MRI studies revealed an obvious T1 contrast enhancement at the tumor site because of a combination of the EPR and active targeting effects. The PLTM-HMnO2 NPs led to effective inhibition of tumor growth, attributing to Fenton-like Mn2+ conversion of endogenous H2O2 in the tumor to highly toxic HO[rad] and this anti-tumor efficacy was enhanced when combined with chemotherapy.

In the presented study, a phosphorus-grafted hexadecanol was blended with pentaerythritol phosphate (PEPA) to prepare flame-retardant phase change material (FRPCM). The thermal properties of FRPCM were evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry. The flame-retardant mechanism was examined by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests. The FRPCM maintains a promising heat storage capacity (186.9 J/g) and thermal stability after grafting and blending. The flame retardance analysis reveals that the grafted phosphorus group helps to promote char formation. PEPA extends the time before exposed combustible material ignites. The cone calorimeter test demonstrated that the peak heat release rate and total heat release are further decreased by more than 50%, owing to the synergistic effect between the phosphorus group and PEPA. The SEM results showed that a porous structure is formed during combustion.

A challenge is how to update the BCI to meet changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, since the resource are so limited that retraining of traditional well-performed models, such as a support vector machine, is nearly impossible. To cope with this challenge, less-demanding adaptive online learning can be considered. We investigated an adaptive projected sub-gradient method (APSM) that is originated from the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory. APSM provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Coefficients of APSM are adjusted online as data arrive sequentially, with a regularization constraint made by projections onto a fixed closed ball. We extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form, where shrinkage closed balls were used instead of the original fixed one, expecting a more controllable fading effect and better adaptability. The convergence of shrinkage APSM was proved. It was also demonstrated that as shrinkage factor approached to 1, the limit point of shrinkage APSM would approach to the optimal solution with the least norm, which could be especially beneficial for generalization of the classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine, and the passive aggressive algorithm, through an event-related potential-based BCI experiment. Results showed the advantage of the proposed method over the others on both the online classification performance and the easiness of tuning. Our study revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method for adaptive EEG classification, making it a promising tool for on-device training and updating of wearable/portable BCIs, as well as for application in other related fields, such as EEG-based biometrics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","48","Brain computer interface","Biometrics - E-learning - Electroencephalography - Electrophysiology - Gradient methods - Set theory - Shrinkage - Support vector machines - Wearable technology","Adaptive online learning - Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) - Event related potentials - Incremental support vector machine - Online learning - Passive aggressive algorithms - Projections - Projections onto convex sets","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 951 Materials Science","Number: 61772508, U1713213, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61906183, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: JCYJ20170413152535587, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shenzhen Technical Project; Number: JCYJ20180507182610734, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shenzhen Technical Project; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61772508, U1713213, 61906183), Shenzhen Technology Project (JCYJ20170413152535587, JCYJ20180507182610734), Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2019B090915001), CAS Key Technology Talent Program.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Various theories and models have been developed to explain the origins, maintenance, and continuation of cooperation within a generic population. Among these theories is the prisoner's dilemma (PD), which is a well-known framework for investigations on agents’ behavior and strategies [2]. In a traditional PD game, pairwise players are assigned the same initial endowment, and they have no access to (nor knowledge of) the opponents’ wealth throughout the course of the game. In real life, however, circumstances operate which (in most of the cases) unequally, asymmetrically or hierarchically distribute the income and resources, and the group members may be aware (completely or partially) of their opponents’ power and capacity before making their own decision to cooperate or defect. We experimentally reveal the impact of inequality and visibility by means of comparing the results of four sessions where players (1) may have equal or unequal initial endowments and (2) may be visible or invisible to opponents as far as their wealth information is concerned. Our observations disclose that wealth information makes no significant difference to the promotion of cooperation when the initial wealth distribution is fair.

However, understanding the intra-annual water isotope cycle is difficult for a region lack of winter precipitation. Here, we reported water vapor δ18O and δ2H time series over two and half years at Lhasa on the southern Tibetan Plateau. We compare our values with concurrent daily precipitation isotopes to assess the seasonal controls of vapor isotopes and possible correlation to precipitation isotopes. Results show an intra-seasonal dependence of water vapor δ18O on large scale meteorological regime. During the winter months, vapor water δ18O shows positive dependence on regional-scale temperature, confirming a Rayleigh-distillation controlling moisture transport. During the summer months, lower vapor δ18O is weekly in association with the heavy precipitation over tropical Indian Ocean and on the Tibetan Plateau, and this relation is further enhanced by the evaporation of precipitation at the sampling site. We also found a weak seasonal variation of vapor d-excess, likely resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region. Moreover, the isotope dataset contains a high-frequency of fluctuations for both δ18O and d-excess lasting several days during the summer monsoon season. These high frequency fluctuations are in phase with precipitation events, confirming significant local evaporation effects on the short-term water cycle, which further complicated the control of near surface water vapor isotopes. These findings improve our regional scale understanding of hydrological cycle on the southern Tibetan Plateau, and will potentially improve our understanding of isotope variations in proxy archives in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","51","Isotopes","Concurrency control - Distillation - Evaporation - Moisture control - Precipitation (chemical) - Surface waters - Water vapor","Daily precipitations - High frequency fluctuations - Precipitation events - Rayleigh distillation - Seasonality - Tibetan Plateau - Tropical Indian ocean - Winter precipitation","444.1 Surface Water - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: 41771043, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Reaction order, frequency factor, activation energy, and reaction kinetic model were determined. Compared to methyl palmitate, the kinematic viscosity of the branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid was slightly higher; however, the solidifying point (SP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) decreased with increasing degree of branched-chain.

However, previous studies generally found that biochar was only effective in a narrow low pH range for Cr(VI) removal, and less attention was paid to biochar which can be effectively operated in a wider range of pH. This study showed that the jute fiber-based biochar pretreated H3PO4 can availably remove and reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in wastewater over a broadened operating pH range of 1–6, in which the intrinsic pH of Cr(VI) solution was included. For this, XRD, Raman, SEM, elemental analysis and N2 adsorption- desorption techniques were utilized to characterize the structure and compositions of the biochars. FTIR, XPS, Boehm titration and zeta potential measurements were performed to determine the surface group and charge distributions. It was revealed that in comparison with the biochar activated by KOH, H3PO4-treated biochar offered sufficient acidic groups such as phosphonic acid and carboxyl on the surface, from which the supplied protons could maintain the pH within a stable range of 1.9–3.4. XPS analysis exhibited that the electron-rich C–O, P–O and C–P bonds acted electron donating moieties to reduce high potential Cr(VI). Cr(VI) uptake experiments showed that Freundlich multilayer chemisorption occurred on the heterogeneous surface. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model suggested the surface reaction was the rate-controlling step.

In order to make the Bayesian algorithm applicable with limited computational resources, we dedicated our efforts to the analytic marginalization of irrelevant parameters. We found that the widely used parameter for pulsar timing systematics, the 'Efac' parameter, can be analytically marginalized. This reduces the Gaussian likelihood to a function very similar to the Student’s t-distribution. Our iterative method to solve the maximum likelihood estimator is also explained in the paper. Using pulsar timing data from the Yunnan Kunming 40-m radio telescope, we demonstrate the application of the method, where 80-ns level precision for the clock jump can be achieved.

Fe-C microelectrolysis intensified the anaerobic fermentation of DM, the highest CH4 content was 87%, the cellulose degradation rate was 36%, increased by 125%, and the lignin degradation rate was 23%, increased by 203%, under loading 0.5 V voltage and weak magnetic field. Metagenome sequence results showed that EMF and Fe-C microelectrolysis can not only promote the microbial diversity, but also increase the abundance of functional microorganisms at various stages. This finding provides theoretical support and foundation for the extraordinary efficiency degradation of lignocellulose and the electric and magnetic regulation of anaerobic fermentation microorganism system. © 2019","60","Biodegradation","Cellulose - Cost engineering - Degradation - Fermentation - Fertilizers - Iron compounds - Lignin - Magnetic fields - Manures - Methane - Microorganisms","Anaerobic fermentation - Effective microorganisms - Electric and magnetic fields - Lignocellulose degradation - Methane content","461.8 Biotechnology - 461.9 Biology - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics","Number: 2014ZX07105-001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Critical Project for Science and Technology on Water Pollution Prevention and Control; Number: 21467011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors greatly acknowledge the funding support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21467011 ) and the National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project (No. 2014ZX07105-001 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Moreover, this study also revealed the oil-soluble properties of conventional antioxidants in biodiesel at different temperatures and investigated the change rule of their oil-soluble properties. The results indicated that 10 common antioxidants could improve the antioxidative performance of rubber seed oil biodiesel to a certain extent; however, their effects were quite different. At room temperature (20 °C), conventional antioxidants exhibited relatively poor oil-soluble properties, with great discrepancy. The decreasing order of oil-soluble properties of 10 conventional antioxidants in rubber seed oil biodiesel is as follows: BHA > TBHQ > D-TBHQ > PA > PG > OG > VC > MT > AP > GA. With increasing temperature, the oil-soluble properties of 10 antioxidants somewhat improved; however, their soluble interval changed only slightly. A weak relationship was observed between the antioxidative performance and oil-soluble properties of 10 conventional antioxidants.

A theoretical model of the periodic price drawdown time series is proposed to describe the energy price drawdown time series with the periodic Heston model. Then the signal power amplification (SPA) is employed to measure the stochastic resonance phenomenon in the internal and external periodic information environment of complex energy dynamics system. Combined with the real data of WTI spot price of NYMEX, the least square method of drawdown time series distribution is used to estimate the parameters of the model. The probability density functions of drawdown between the theoretical model and the real data are compared, and a good agreement can be found between both the simulated data from the proposed model and the real data. After the stochastic simulation of signal power amplification under internal and external periodic information respectively, the results show that: (i) In the functions of SPA versus price volatility parameters (noise correlation strength or periodic information strength), inverse resonance phenomenon can be observed, that is to say, there is the best system price volatility parameter, noise correlation strength and information strength corresponding to the least risk of the price drawdown; (ii) In the SPA versus amplitude of volatility fluctuations, the correlation induce multiple inverse stochastic resonance phenomenon can be observed; (iii) The increase of growth rate strengthens SPA and weakens drawdown risk of energy market prices. © 2019","74","Stochastic models","Amplification - Circuit resonance - Commerce - Costs - Density functional theory - Financial markets - Least squares approximations - Magnetic resonance - Power markets - Probability density function - Stochastic systems - Time series","Econophysicss - Information environment - Least square methods - Maximum drawdown - Signal power amplification - Stochastic resonances - Stochastic simulations - Theoretical modeling","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1 Electric Networks - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","Number: 19YJAZH045, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; ","This work was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No.: 19YJAZH045).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that with the number of the layer increased, the band-gap shows a decreasing trend, whereas the absorption edge shows a trend of red-shift. When we put different in-layer biaxial strain from −10% compressive strain (a/a0 = 90%) to 10% tensile strain (a/a0 = 110%) on all few-layer BP layers, the electronic, optical and structural properties change. In terms of electronic property, few-layer BP shows an increasing trend of the band-gap, and at the same time, a distinct change of chemical bond has been observed. As for the optical property, an anisotropic variation of the absorption and reflectivity occurs. And for the structural property, there is a noticeable regular anisotropic change of the stacking order. In our opinion, the increasing number of layers affects band splitting around the Γ point and entire BZ, which leads to the decrease of the gap. The changing of the layer from 5 L to 1L and the strain from −10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain affect the stacking order and the change of near-band-states of few-layer BP, which further impacts the band-gap, chemical bond and its transition from metal to semiconductor of BP. Besides, the strain effect leads to the anisotropic change of the structure, which further results in the anisotropic change in the optical properties of the few-layer BP.

To test this hypothesis, we generated multiple paleoproductivity (OCAR and PAR), paleoredox (Corg/P ratios), upwelling/restriction (CoEF × MnEF, Co (ppm) × Mn (%), Mo/TOC, and Cd/Mo ratios), and terrigenous flux proxies (Al and unreactive Fe (FeU)) for the lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation in the outer-shelf Jinsha section, which records a typical transition from the organic-rich black shales to overlying organic-lean mudstones or siltstones. These new data were integrated with published paleoredox proxies (iron speciation and redox-sensitive trace metals) for the same section. Our results suggest that the organic-rich (TOC = 4.6 ± 1.8%) lower member (LM; 0–37 m) of the Niutitang Formation records ferruginous conditions, high productivity levels, and low siliciclastic fluxes, and that the organic-poor (TOC = 0.1 ± 0.1%) upper member (UM; 37–329 m) was characterized by dominantly oxic conditions, declining productivity levels, and high siliciclastic fluxes. Our results suggest a redox shift from ferruginous to oxic conditions and enhanced terrigenous fluxes in response to falling sea level from the LM to the UM. Secular variations in primary productivity and redox conditions are strongly correlated, which is consistent with a positive feedback: high primary productivity led to increasing water-column anoxia, which enhanced organic P recycling, stimulating further productivity. Variations in primary productivity may reflect variable upwelling intensity in a semi-restricted shelf setting linked to sea-level changes. Taken together, these findings suggest that a combination of primary productivity, redox conditions, and terrigenous fluxes driven by sea-level changes played a key role in organic matter accumulation on the early-Cambrian western Yangtze Platform. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","115","Sea level","Biogeochemistry - Feedback - Organic compounds - Phosphorus - Photosynthesis - Phytoplankton - Productivity - Trace elements - Water recycling","Anoxia - Nanhua basin - Niutitang formation - Organic-rich shales - Paleoproductivity - Primary productivity - Upwelling - Upwelling intensity","471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 481.2 Geochemistry - 731.1 Control Systems - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2016YFA0601100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: Wuhan, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: 41661134048, Acronym: NERC, Sponsor: Natural Environment Research Council; Number: XDB26000000, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University; Number: 41821001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Yuanlong Zhao, Xinlian Yang, Jing Peng and their groups at Guizhou University for sampling and/or helpful discussions.

The recovering and recycling of the adsorbents became a bottleneck in heavy metal removal through adsorption. A hybrid adsorbent MnFe2O4@CAC showed great application potential because of its easy regeneration. However, as for other commonly used adsorbents, the removal performance of different types of heavy metals are distinctively different, but the mechanism is still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the electron-scale behavior and adsorption mechanism of six divalent cations (Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Hg(II)) on MnFe2O4@CAC were investigated in-depth combining experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The experimental results showed the order of adsorption: Ni(II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Hg(II). The reaction from transition state to the final product was the rate-determining step for the Cu(II), Pb(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) adsorption, while the reaction from reactant to intermediate controlled the adsorption rate of Cd(II) and Hg(II). The main adsorption mechanisms were surface complexation and ionic exchange, which were further confirmed by the spectroscopic (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) characterizations and DFT calculations. In addition, the electron density of state (DOS) results indicated the 4s orbit of the cations most easily to be occupied by the d electrons of MnFe2O4. The order of adsorption affinity agreed well with the apparent adsorption, and was decided by the electronic empty orbit and ionic electron cloud size of the cations. The results of the current study provide an in-depth understanding on the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals and offer a theoretical guidance for improving their removal efficiency. © 2019","50","Cadmium compounds","Adsorption - Biochemistry - Cobalt compounds - Copper compounds - Density functional theory - Electron affinity - Electrons - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Heavy metals - Ion exchange - Lead compounds - Mercury compounds - Nickel compounds - Positive ions - Reaction intermediates - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Adsorption affinity - DFT calculation - Electronic transfers - Heavy metal cations - Spectroscopic evidence","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: 2017YFD0801000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2018HC065, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0801000), National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (U1602231, 41725016 and 41663013), and Yunnan Provincial Scientific Innovation Team of Soil Environment and Ecological Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology (2018HC065).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To address this issue, a fused screening procedure is proposed for dimension reduction with large-scale high dimensional imbalanced data under repeated case-control samplings. There are several advantages of the proposed method: it is model-free without any model specification for the underlying distribution; it is relatively inexpensive in computational cost by using the subsampling technique; it is robust to outliers in the predictors.

Therefore, it improves the operational efficiency of enterprises. It is of great significance for innovation policy-making. This paper presents a theoretical framework for evaluating innovation performance in which the contribution of new product development funds is divided into several elements, including invention, utility model, and appearance design patents. Based on this framework, the elasticity of invention patents to new product sales revenue is divided by the elasticity of new product development funds to new product sales revenue, and the result is used as an indicator to evaluate the innovation performance of new products. Taking the interprovincial panel data of China's high-technology industry as an example, the relationships between the variables, including number of invention patents, new product development funds, R&D funds, and new product sales revenue, were studied comprehensively by using a panel data simultaneous equation model, Granger causality tests, a panel threshold regression (PTR) model, and a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model. The results showed that the overall innovation performance of new products in China's high-technology industry, which reached only 42.9%, was unsatisfactory. Despite the poor performance of invention patents, the high-technology industry in China showed strong developmental potential and is entering a transformation period for innovation quality improvement. The overall performance of investments in developing new products was satisfactory. The contribution of new product development funds increased as the enterprise scale increased and as new product sales revenue increased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","38","Patents and inventions","Economics - Elasticity - Product design - Product development - Sales - Statistical tests","Developmental potential - Granger causality test - High technology industries - Innovation performance - New product development - Operational efficiencies - Product sales - Simultaneous equation modeling","913.1 Production Engineering - 913.6 Product Development; Concurrent Engineering - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences","","We would like to thank the anonymous referee and the editor for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments, which have significantly improved the content and presentation of the paper.

However, existing PM strategies result in errors and extra costs because of ignoring the time-varying operational conditions (e.g. wind speed, air temperature and power current alternating) and constant redundant sub-modules (SM). To reduce PM-related costs with an acceptable level of reliability considering different operational conditions, a dynamical PM strategy is proposed. Compared with the traditional PM strategy, adjustable redundant SMs in every operational stage and PM interval are added to dynamically coordinate reliability and PM-related costs of MMC. The reliability model of MMC proposed in this paper considers the impact of different operational conditions based on multi-term thermal cycles of components and operating characteristics of MMC. Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the reliability of MMC, and the genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the PM interval and the number of redundant SM in every operational stage. Case studies show that the PM results vary with different operational conditions. Besides, compared with existing strategies, the proposed dynamic PM strategy could reduce the PM-related costs with an acceptable level of reliability by dynamically adjusting the PM interval and redundancy on every stage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","39","Preventive maintenance","Cost reduction - Electric power transmission - Genetic algorithms - Monte Carlo methods - Redundancy - Reliability - Thermal cycling - Wind","Critical technique - Dynamic preventive maintenances - Long distance transmission - Modular multi-level converters - Multi terms - Operating characteristics - Operational conditions - Preventive maintenance (pm)","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 913.5 Maintenance - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: cstc2017jcyj-yszxX0011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFB0902200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 5228001700CW, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Foundation of State Grid Corporation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the Project Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2017YFB0902200 , the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China under grant 5228001700CW , the academician-mentoring Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Chongqing under grant cstc2017jcyj-yszxX0011 .

At first, the compensation circuit parameters are obtained in the modal system that separates the coupling multiconductor system into isolated circuits to avoid the complexity of the three-phase system. Then, the compensation circuit parameters can be transformed into multiconductor system by modal-phase transformation, which accomplishes the compensation circuit parameter design in three-phase system.

The adsorption performances of UiO-66-TA for Au(III) were studied. The results showed that UiO-66-TA had a strong adsorption capacity under acidic conditions and the optimal pH was 2.0.

The regeneration and thermodynamic experiments indicated that UiO-66-TA can be reused and were a spontaneous endothermic process.

A heat transfer model for a novel parabolic trough solar collecting system with V-shaped cavity absorber is established based on the thermal resistance network method. Experimental validation was performed in different weather conditions to investigate the calculation accuracy of the proposed model. The analysis results demonstrate that the model calculation error mainly lies in the influence of wind speed deviation and the difference between the theoretical and actual temperature rise rate with the sudden changes of solar direct normal irradiation (DNI). By carrying out bias correction, the model calculated results were perfectly consistent with the experimental results. Based on the proposed model, the effects of different environmental factors on the outlet temperature and collecting efficiency were compared, and the comparison results can be used to correct the proposed model in different weather and environmental conditions, which make the proposed heat transfer model more reliable to the practical operation situation. As a result, the proposed model may provide a theoretical basis for the operation optimization of the solar collecting system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","24","Heat transfer","Collector efficiency - Heat resistance - Historic preservation - Wind","Environmental conditions - Environmental factors - Experimental validations - Heat transfer characteristics - Heat transfer model - Parabolic trough solar collectors - Solar heat utilization - Thermal resistance networks","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 702.3 Solar Cells","Number: 2017FB092, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Number: 51979261, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: DE190100931, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: tsqn201812025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Taishan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 2015DFA60120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the Collaborative Innovation Center of Research and Development of Renewable Energy in the southwest area in China (No.: 05300205020516009 ), NSFC China (No.: 51979261 ), Taishan Scholar in China ( tsqn201812025 ), the Project on Co-establishing China-Laos Joint Lab for Renewable Energy (No.: 2015DFA60120 ), the Science and Technology Planning Project in Yunnan Province, China (Grant No.: 2017FB092 ) and Australia ARC DECRA (No.: DE190100931 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, their ecological consequences on shallow lakes are not well studied. Here we compare the succession of diatom assemblages of two medium-sized shallow lakes in southwest China during the past ~70 years, comprising an extreme drought event between ~2009 and ~2013. The diatom community of Lake Chahei showed a clear response to eutrophication from ~1980. The pioneer species Achnanthes minutissima increased strongly with elevated sedimentary total nitrogen content and at the expense of Epithemia sorex. In contrast, the diatom community of Lake Yuxian was stable and constantly dominated by the Fragilaria construens/pinnata complex. For both lakes, the most striking change occurred with the extreme drought event when environmental conditions and diatom compositions were homogenised. With strongly shrinking lake areas, peaks in the proportion of silt were observed in the sediments, suggesting increased particle burial rates and decreased light availability. These conditions selected for motile and presumably heterotrophic species mainly of the genera Navicula and Nitzschia which exhibited abrupt increases in their relative abundances at both lakes. Meanwhile, the degree of community homogeneity (inferred by Jaccard's similarity index) of the formerly distinct diatom assemblages increased strongly between both lakes. Hence, the extreme drought event has overridden and homogenised previous abiotic conditions and led to a decrease in beta diversity between the two study sites. Navicula and Nitzschia species may be reliable (paleo)indicators for extreme drought events in comparable shallow lake systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","92","Lakes","Drought - Eutrophication - Global warming - Homogenization method - Paleolimnology","Beta diversities - Diatoms - Ecological consequences - Environmental conditions - Extreme drought event - Light availability - Siltation - Total nitrogen content","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 921 Mathematics","Number: 2017YFA0605202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 41771239, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to the comments of two reviewers that helped to improve a previous version of this manuscript.

Traditional methods for PARM relies on designing and utilising Data fusion or machine learning techniques in processing ambient and wearable sensing data for classifying types of physical activity and removing their uncertainties. Yet they mostly focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing types of identifiable activity subjects, improved recognition accuracy and measure robustness. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to an open and dynamic uncontrolled ecosystem by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps and various groups of users [35]. Little is currently known about whether traditional Data fusion techniques can tackle new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand potential use and opportunities of Data fusion techniques in IoT enabled PARM applications, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a perspective of a novel 3D dynamic IoT based physical activity collection and validation model. It summarized traditional state-of-the-art data fusion techniques from three plane domains in the 3D dynamic IoT model: devices, persons and timeline. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of data fusion techniques in the IoT enabled PARM studies, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them. © 2019","97","Internet of things","Application programs - Cost effectiveness - Data fusion - Dynamics - Health - Information fusion - Learning systems - Pattern recognition - Reviews - Three dimensional computer graphics - Wearable technology","Activity monitoring - Activity recognition - Health care application - Internet of thing (IOT) - Lifelogging - Machine learning techniques - Physical activity - Rehabilitation programs","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 903.2 Information Dissemination - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that acute MC-LR exposure at concentrations ranging from 50 μg/L to 400 μg/L led to significant reductions in thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels in juvenile zebrafish. The transcription levels of genes involved in TH synthesis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and transthyretin (ttr), were significantly decreased followed by an increase after MC-LR exposure. Transcription of the TH nuclear receptors (tr-α and tr-β) was significantly reduced during the exposure period. Moreover, the activities of iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID1) and iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID2) showed initially decreased and then increased trend, while the activity of iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID3) significantly decreased during MC-LR exposure. In addition, the effect of MC-LR on deiodinase activities and T4 contents were important causes of the decreased T3 at the early exposure stage. These results indicated that acute MC-LR exposure significantly interfered with the transcription of genes related to TH synthesis, transport and metabolism, and affected normal function of the thyroid which leads to decrease of T4 and T3 in juvenile zebrafish. Therefore, the thyroid function is susceptible to interference by MC-LR, and it may cause adverse effects on the growth and development of juvenile zebrafish. © 2019","43","Transcription","Hormones - Metabolism","Corticotropin-releasing hormone - Gene transcriptions - Growth and development - Iodothyronine - Thyroid hormones - Thyroid stimulating hormones - Waterborne exposure - Zebrafish","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology","Number: CARS-45, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; Number: 31670521, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31602141, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","This work was supported by the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System ( CARS-45 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 31670521 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2662015PY119 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 31602141 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results indicated that N2 selectivity over RuOx/TiO2 was significantly enhanced after the introduction of SO42−. The introduction of SO42− into RuOx/TiO2 observably increased the amount and strength of acid species on the surface of catalyst. Specifically, the RuOx/TiO2-SO42− sulfated treatment at 2 h possessed the optimal surface acidic property obtaining more than 85% N2 selectivity at 300 °C, which was apparently higher than that of RuOx/TiO2 with 66% N2 selectivity. The strong interaction between sulfated support and RuOx resulted in excellent redox property at high temperature, abundant surface oxygen and more Ru4+ species. Particularly, DRIFTS and NH3-TPD illustrated that the increased N2-selectivity was put down to Brönsted and Lewis acid sites augmented via sulfating treatment of TiO2, promoting the dehydrogenation of adsorbed ammonia species on the catalyst surface, then the formation of more [sbnd]NH2 species could facilitate the reduction of NO to harmless N2, meanwhile, the generation of HNO species also were reduced to N2 by NH. Therefore, the excellent acid properties of RuOx/TiO2-SO42− gave rise to the formation of few nitrate species with an iSCR mechanism, which ensured to the high N2 selectivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","65","Catalyst selectivity","Ammonia - Catalytic oxidation - Ruthenium compounds - Titanium dioxide","Acidic properties - Catalyst surfaces - DRIFTS - Mechanism studies - NH3-SCO - Selective catalytic oxidation - Strong interaction - Surface acidity","803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 21307047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21567030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21307047 and No. 21567030).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In monsoon regions, strong inverse impacts of convection on precipitation isotope ratios, have created a debate regarding the interpretation of isotope records as local climate proxies. The proportions of stratiform to convective precipitation on water isotopes, together with the influence mechanisms on seasonal and interannual scales remain highly uncertain. To further address the influence of precipitation patterns on water isotopes, we used 10 yrs of precipitation isotope data from the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to explore the effects of large-scale cloud cover and local climate on precipitation isotopes. Correlation analysis performed between local precipitation δ18O values and different level cloud data, indicated significant negative correlations between precipitation isotopes and high level cloud cover on both seasonal and interannual time scales. This result suggests that high-level convection in the upper moisture transport stream is a main control on precipitation isotopes in the southern TP. The clear and coherent variations of precipitation isotopes with the Southern Oscillation Index and outgoing longwave radiation confirmed that strong convection activity in the moisture source region and during transport significantly depleted heavy isotopes in vapor, producing substantially decreased precipitation δ18O in the study region. These results agree with earlier findings of tree ring cellulose isotope records that correlate with cloud cover, but we emphasized the important role of larger-scale regional cloud cover. We also delineated different maximum correlation zones for seasonal and interannual time scales, likely due to different mechanisms. These findings further improve the interpretation of paleoisotope records from the Indian summer monsoon region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","50","Precipitation (meteorology)","Atmospheric pressure - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Isotopes - Moisture","Cloud cover - Convective activity - Convective precipitation - Outgoing longwave radiation - Paleoclimate reconstruction - Regional scale - Southern oscillation index - Tibetan Plateau","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation","Number: 41530748, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41661144044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41771043, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) for provision of the OLR and SOI data.

In order to explore the source of such photosensitive substances, extracellular and intracellular polymeric substances from aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were tested for their ability to photodegrade EE2 under anaerobic conditions. Degradation was promoted at higher concentrations of the extracts, except for the extracellular polymers from anaerobic cultivation. The contribution of triplet state substances was more important than that of singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radical. The contributions of various triplet state substances were strongly correlated with their quantum yield coefficients. The fluorescence intensity values of the proteins and amino acids were in line with the observed photodegradation rates mediated by the four cellular polymers.

Therefore, commercial rice samples from the Sri Lankan market (n = 163) were measured to reveal the total mercury (THg) and MeHg levels.

The crime rate of drugs was the highest, reaching 46.86%, farmers are the majority, accounting for 97.07%, people under the age of 35 are the subject of crime.

By comparison, the classification effect of Random Trees is better than that of Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks. Through the data collection of the three algorithms, the validity and accuracy of the random tree algorithm in predicting crime data are observed.

However, the active phases for this reaction were unexplored widely. In the present study, we tackle this issue through investigating the effect of potassium (K) and supports on the nature of MoS2 catalysts via the characterizations of XRD, UV–vis, TPS, XPS, HR-TEM, as well as HAADF-STEM combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) etc. The results suggested that K species can not only lead to formation of different oxidized precursors but also affect the microstructure, surface morphology and electronic properties of active MoS2 phases. Three sulfided species, i.e., pure MoS2, K-decorated MoS2 and K-intercalated MoS2 nanoslabs, were simultaneously detected, and were demonstrated to be derived from the reduction and sulfidation of oxidized precursors via O[sbnd]S exchange mechanism. Furthermore, the activity results showed that pure MoS2 species worked only for the reaction of CO with H2S to COS, while K-decorated MoS2 and K-intercalated MoS2 nanoslabs exhibited unique ability for the hydrogenation of COS to produce CH3SH.

Furthermore, based on macromolecular models, comprehensive analyses on macromolecular and conformational characterizations of PFPP fractions were conducted quantitatively through, e.g., shape factor (1.42–1.79), Mark-Houwink-Sakurada exponent (0.55–0.74), conformational power-law exponent (0.52–0.58), fractal dimension (1.72–1.94) and persistence length (6.73–13.47 nm).

TCS treatment increased the expression of inflammatory markers and ROS in cultured HUVECs. Moreover, TCS treatment inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR expression.

The concentration spatial and temporal profiles (Ce(z, t)s) are obtained from a single experiment using an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens. The concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is assumed to be a polynomial D(C) = D0 × (1 + α1C + α2C2 + α3C3 + …), where D0 is diffusion coefficient in infinite dilute solution, α1, α2 and α3 are under-determined parameters. The finite difference method (FDM) is applied to solve numerically Fick diffusion equation, the calculated concentration profiles (Cn(z, t)s) by varying the under-determined parameters are compared with the profile Ce(z, t), the parameters(α1, α2, α3, …) corresponding the minimum concentration standard deviation are selected to determine D(C). To verify the proposed method, we have carried out the diffusion experiment of ethylene glycol aqueous solution, the obtained concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with literature values. On the other hand, the obtained polynomial D(C) has been used to calculate refractive index profiles (nn(z, t)s). Based on the nn(z, t)s, ray tracing method has been applied to simulate the diffusion images, which fit the experimental images very well over a wider range of diffusion time, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable in rapidly measuring concentration-dependent liquid diffusion coefficients with high accuracy and stability. © 2019","31","Diffusion","Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Finite difference method - Lenses - Liquids - Optical data processing - Polynomials - Ray tracing - Refractive index - Solution mining","Concentration dependent diffusion coefficients - Concentration-dependent - Cylindrical lens - Finitedifference methods (FDM) - Infinite dilute solutions - Liquid diffusion coefficient - Ray-tracing method - Refractive index profiles","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.1 Algebra - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 11804296, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant no. 11804296), Joint Key Project of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2018FY001-020) and Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Fund (Grant no. 2016CYH05).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In P-D methods, depth is expressed as a function of the unwrapped phase, and parameters of the function are different from pixel to pixel. In P-I calibration methods, depth is expressed as a function of both phase and pixel coordinate, and there is only one set of parameters which applies to all pixels. P-D method is resistant to distortion of the projector or the camera but is time-consuming because a number of phase maps need to be recorded; P-I method requires only two or three phase maps but is sensitive to distortion. To address this problem, we further propose a blockwise calibration method. It requires the same number of phase maps as the P-I method and meanwhile can be as resistant to distortion as the P-D method. Simulation results show that when phase maps are contaminated by random additive noise, error produced by the proposed blockwise method is even less than that of the P-D method which uses 18 phase maps. In the experiment the proposed method and the P-D method were utilized to calibrate a fiber-optic fringe projection profilometer and then heights of a 4 mm and a 7 mm gauge block were measured.

To help lake management units to prevent and control the outbreak of cyanobacteria, this paper designed and developed a comprehensive management system for the prevention and control of cyanobacteria blooms and salvage treatment. The system consists of four subsystems: the operational reporting subsystem, the monitoring data management system, the algae environmental protection disposal process management system, and the real-time cyanobacteria monitoring system. The three-dimensional interaction between the WEB end and the mobile patrol handheld terminal makes the system more efficient and convenient. The neighborhood image is denoised by the neighborhood averaging method, and the K-means algorithm is used for clustering training, which makes the classification of the algae pictures taken. The realization of the system effectively prevented the large-scale outbreak of cyanobacteria, providing a new idea for monitoring and processing cyanobacteria blooms. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.","6","Information management","Algae - Fish - K-means clustering - Lakes - Monitoring","Comprehensive managements - Cyanobacteria blooms - Data management system - Hand-held terminals - Integrated management systems - Prevention and controls - Salvage treatment - Three-dimensional interaction",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the dynamic processes involved in the evolution and deformation of the region remain poorly understood due to a lack of reliable geophysical observations. We collected abundant seismic data recorded by 108 permanent broadband stations deployed in the SE margin of Tibet since 2000, and obtained 4536 pairs of P-wave receiver functions (PRFs) with high signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we have implemented a novel two-step data inversion procedure that can reduce the dependence of the inversion results on the initial model. We first use low-frequency PRFs obtained by iterative deconvolution in the time domain, and then an initial model consisting of a series of 2-km-thick isotropic layers to fit velocity models, and thus determine an overall statistical solution by means of the bootstrap resampling technique. This statistical solution is then regarded as a new initial model to adjust high-frequency PRFs. Hence, the same resampling process is executed again to estimate the optimal S-wave velocity structure below each station. The results provide an accurate 3D image of the crust and uppermost mantle in the SE margin of Tibet. We infer a wide intra-crustal low-velocity zone that varies laterally and in depth, which is thinner or even absent in the most southern part of Yunnan. Our hypothesis is that this low-velocity zone is the result of the accumulation of lower crustal flow coming from central Tibet. Furthermore, we show that this lower crustal flow extends largely through the Sichuan–Yunnan diamond-shaped block, and that there are significant variations in both crustal velocity structure and deformation mechanism across the great strike-slip faults of the Jinshajiang–Red River and Xiaojiang fault systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","66","Time domain analysis","Acoustic wave velocity - Deformation - Iterative methods - Sampling - Seismic waves - Seismology - Shear waves - Signal receivers - Signal to noise ratio - Strike-slip faults - Wave propagation","Bootstrap technique - Low velocity zones - Lower crustal flows - Receiver functions - southeast margin of Tibet - two-step inversion","484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics","Number: 41464003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are very grateful to the editor Dr. Arthur Snoke and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions that made possible a better presentation of this paper.

It generates an all-in-focus image through multiple partly focused source images. There are common schemes that are based on focused region detection and activity-level measurement, and fusion rule. We found that it is difficult to directly map between source images and focus maps. In this paper, we investigate the use of U-shape networks for the end-to-end modeling of MFIF. The novelty of our framework is two-fold. First, it uses a U-shaped network as a feature extractor that captures low-frequency information through feature extraction and high-frequency texture information through high-frequency texture extraction. Compared with the common convolutional neural network, the proposed network has better representation ability so that the most visually distinctive features can be extracted, fused, and enhanced. Second, the hybrid objective with 1 and perceptual losses enables the framework to yield fused results that are consistent with human beings' perception. In addition, we employ a weighted strategy to merge the chrominance components in the YCbCr color space so that color distortion is almost eliminated in the color fused result. We investigate the performance through extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Even though some issues are able to be addressed by quantitative data, researchers may face the difficulty of obtaining accurate and sufficient numbers. Some qualitative evaluations given by experts or decision makers are usually linguistic expressions. Therefore, fuzzy linguistic research has been broadly studied to address the above issues. This research has also been attracting increasing attention from researchers and decision makers in the world. It is believed that analyzing the status quo and emerging trends in this research area is of great necessity, especially for the beginners who are interested in fuzzy linguistic research. To do so, this paper provides the mapping knowledge domain of fuzzy linguistic research based on 648 papers on Web of Science from 1975 to 2018 by using CiteSpace which is an effective tool for scientometric studies. The visualization analyses of cited reference clusters, collaborations networks, author co-citation networks, burst detection and time zone view are presented in this study to show the research streams and the papers that made significant theoretical contributions. Also, the active counties, institutions, journals and authors in this research area are analyzed in detail. Besides, the specific hot spots and emerging trends can be known. There are two contributions in this study. Firstly, we give a comprehensive investigation about the status quo and emerging trends of fuzzy linguistic research in the recent 43 years.

The gas and solid motion are solved by treating the gas as the continuum medium in the Eulerian framework and numerical parcel in the Lagrangian framework, respectively. After validating the numerical results with experimental data, the radial and axial segregation induced by the wide PSD and chemical reactions, combined with the particle-scale information of both particle type (e.g., temperature, heat transfer coefficient, constituent mass fraction, and solid residence time) are discussed. The results demonstrate that obvious radial and axial segregation impact the spatial distribution of temperature and heat transfer of both particle types. The skewed distribution of the residence time of biomass particles is obtained. Biomass particles exiting the bed behave with large carbon content. PSD width exerts an evident influence on the spatial distribution of heat transfer coefficient, mass, and constituent content of biomass particles. Enlarging the PSD width enhances the gasification performance of biomass particles with the reduced mass and increased residence time for biomass particles in the bed, and the reduced char residual in the biomass particles lost. The results obtained in this work provide new insights regarding the presence of the radial and axial segregation induced by the wide size distribution and chemical reactions, which can be beneficial for the scale-up and the in-depth understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for the gasification process in this kind of reactor. © 2019","54","Residence time distribution","Biomass - Bubble formation - Chemical reactions - Computer simulation - Fluidization - Fluidized beds - Gasification - Heat transfer coefficients - Light transmission - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Segregation (metallography) - Size distribution - Spatial distribution","Biomass Gasification - Bubbling fluidized bed - Fundamental mechanisms - Gasifiers - In-depth understanding - Particle in cell - Spatial distribution of temperature - Wide size distribution","531.2 Metallography - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; ","The authors thank the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China -Yunnan joint fund (Grant No. U1602272 ).

Firstly, based on the grey theory, an improved GM(1,1) prediction model is put forward. Then, according to the theory knowledge of Markov chains, an MIGM(1, 1) model is built to correct the relative residuals of IGM(1, 1) model, which can reflect the volatility characteristics of the data.

High junction temperature of light-emitting-diodes (LED) chips inevitably causes serious degradation of luminous efficiency and deteriorates WLEDs output properties. Here, the silicate glass embedded with Ba2LaF7: 35Eu3+/Eu2+, 20Tb3+ (BLF: Eu3+/Eu2+, Tb3+) nano-particles by the self-crystallized growth process achieves a low scattering loss, high luminous efficiency, good thermal stability, and the spectral chromaticity coordinate of which locates in white region even at 573 K.

Here we provide sensitive but noninvasive methods that can not only directly correlate luminescence with the underlying structure, but also distinguish point defects from embedded nanostructures. We first use correlated Raman-PL as a passive structure-property method to identify the difference between emissive and nonemissive Cs4PbBr6 crystals and reveal the existence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in emissive Cs4PbBr6. We then employ a diamond anvil cell to probe the response of luminescence centers to hydrostatic pressure. The observations of fast red-shifting, diminishing, and eventual disappearance of both green emission and Raman exclude Br vacancies as possible luminescent centers. The resolution of this long-lasting controversy paves the way for further device applications of low dimensional perovskites, and our techniques are applied to other emerging materials. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","60","Cesium compounds","Bromine - Crystal structure - Hydrostatic pressure - Lead compounds - Luminescence - Nanocrystals - Noninvasive medical procedures - Perovskite - Point defects - Red Shift","Device application - Diamond-anvil cell - Emerging materials - Green photoluminescence - Luminescence centers - Luminescent centers - Noninvasive methods - Passive structures","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 482.2 Minerals - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The structures, surface morphologies and electrical transport properties of obtained composites were analyzed by various analytical methods. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of LCSMO:Agx exhibited single perovskite structure with pure orthorhombic crystal structure (Pnma space group) and without presence of traces secondary phases. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), XRD and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) depicted good grain surface connectivity of the specimens. In addition, grain size increased with Ag doping. The influences of Ag2O doping on materials electrical properties were also explored. The results indicated the presence of silver as Ag+ ions substituting A-site ions. Furthermore, small amounts of metallic silver gathered at the grain boundaries (GBs) were detected. This increased both the Mn–O bond length and Mn–O–Mn bond angle, and slightly expanded both cell volume (V) and lattice constant (a, b, c). The maximum value of temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) reached 11.2% K−1 with peak TCR temperature (Tk) of 281.5 K. The improved electrical transport performances of LCSMO:Agx materials were attributed to Ag doping, which enhanced Mn4+ ion amounts and GBs connectivity in each specimen. In addition, excess replacement of A-site ions by Ag+ expanded the metal-insulator transition characteristics and reduced the temperature coefficient of resistivity. Finally, a double exchange based mechanism was proposed to explain the above results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","37","Structural properties","Bond length - Crystal structure - Deionized water - Field emission microscopes - Grain boundaries - Ions - Lanthanum compounds - Manganese oxide - Manganites - Metal insulator boundaries - Metal insulator transition - Perovskite - Photoelectron spectroscopy - Scanning electron microscopy - Semiconductor insulator boundaries - Silver - Silver oxides - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Strontium compounds - Temperature - Transport properties - X ray diffraction","Electrical transport properties - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Orthorhombic crystal structures - Perovskite manganites - Perovskite structures - Structural and electrical properties - Temperature coefficient of resistivity - X ray photoemission spectroscopy","408 Structural Design - 445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 482.2 Minerals - 547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.3 Glass - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11674135, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11674135 ) and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology .",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Thus, it has been widely used for surface water extraction. Traditional FCM clustering algorithm considers the uncertainty of ground objects without neighborhood spatial information, which is sensitive to background heterogeneity. On the basis of the shortcomings of traditional FCM clustering algorithms, this study proposed a regional FCM clustering algorithm and applied it to extract city surface water in complex environment regions using GF-2 remote sensing imagery. The main steps of the method include (1)Calculating the normalized difference water index after the removal of shadows; (2) Presenting a regional FCM clustering algorithm;(3)Proposing the urban surface water automatic extraction algorithm by combining the water body index and the regional FCM clustering algorithm. Finally, the proposed method was carried out on two GF-2 high-resolution remote sensing image data located in Guangzhou and Wuhan. The experimental results showed that the proposed method has better accuracy and water boundary than state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method also retains regional integrity and local details of surface water objects while effectively inhibiting noise from urban surface water in the complex background, thereby reducing the ' salt and pepper' phenomenon found in traditional FCM clustering algorithm. © 2019, Science Press.

Furthermore, comparative tests of the control system with and without a controller were conducted to evaluate the performance of the solar cooling system. The results of the experiment under the impedance matching control strategy reveal that the average photoelectric conversion efficiency reached approximately 0.129 and improved by 83.7% relative to the control system without a controller. The coefficient of performance (COPsolar) reached 0.263 using an ice thermal storage model, which was an improvement of 60.4%.

The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, HRTEM, FT-IR, Raman and XPS techniques. The optical property of Cu, N-CDs/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was examined with UV–vis DRS (Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy). And the excellent photocatalytic performance of this Cu, N-CDs system was ascribed to the increased conversion of ·O2− under visible light irradiations and effective separation of electron-hole pairs, results in inhibited photocorrosion of the system. Also, this nanocomposite could successfully degrade the neutral red dye (mention the concentration) about 95.5% under LED irradiations within 60 min. © 2019","45","Photocatalytic activity","Carbon - Copper compounds - Degradation - Irradiation - Light - Light emitting diodes - Nanocomposites - Optical properties - Precipitation (chemical) - Silver compounds","Ag3PO4 - Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy - Environmental pollutants - Neutral Red - Photo-catalytic - Photocatalytic performance - Visible light photocatalytic activity - Visible-light irradiation","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 2018M20172118065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This study was supported by the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (2018M20172118065), Yunnan Province, China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
