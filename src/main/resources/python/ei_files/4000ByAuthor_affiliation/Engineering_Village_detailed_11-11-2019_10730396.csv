Current approaches on this topic adopt a prevalence threshold (a measure of a user's interest in a pattern) to generate prevalent co-location patterns. However, in practice, it is not easy to specify a suitable prevalence threshold. Thus, users have to repeatedly execute the program to find a suitable prevalence threshold. Besides, the efficiency of these approaches is limited because of the expensive cost of identifying row-instances of co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel clique-based approach for discovering complete and correct prevalent co-location patterns. The proposed approach avoids identifying row-instances of co-location patterns thus making it much easier to find a proper prevalence threshold. First, two efficient schemas are designed to generate complete and correct cliques. Next, these cliques are transformed into a hash structure which is independent of the prevalence threshold. Finally, the prevalence of each co-location pattern is efficiently calculated using the hash structure. The experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","32","Location","Data mining - Efficiency","Clique-based approach - Co-location patterns - Row-instance - Spatial data mining - Spatial neighbor relationship","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61662086, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by grants (No. 61472346, No. 61662086) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, by grants (No. 2016FA026, No. 2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province and by the Project of Innovation Research Team of Yunnan Province (No. 2018HC019).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper presented a similarity measure method SSLLE based on the spectra subspace and locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm. Firstly, we divided the high dimensional spectra data into several subspaces according to the absorption band of the major chemical compositions, which effectively avoids the influence of irrelevant features and noise and reduces the dimension and computation complexity of the LLE. Then, we modified the LLE algorithm by introducing the geodesic distance instead of Euclidean distance, which solves the measure problem of the Euclidean distance in high dimensional space. In order to make the sample more evenly distributed, the method of distance calculation in LLE was also modified. For each spectra subspace, the distance matrix was calculated according to the embedding that was mapped from the high dimensional space by using the modified LLE. Subsequently, the spectral similarity matrix of the sample set was integrated by adding all of the individual distance matrices of each subspace so that the sample with the highest similarity can be found. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm, the spectral projection of the samples was analyzed first, the results showed that the SSLLE distinguished the tobacco samples from different areas significantly better than the methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and LLE. Secondly, we compared the results of searching the most spectrally similar sample with the target tobacco, it showed that the SSLLE had the minimum differences in the chemical composition, and the highest consistency with the recommendation of the experts than that of PCA and LLE algorithm.

Moreover, the maximum equivalent stress occurs at edges of the flat ends in both two models. Three dimensional discrete element model is also constructed to study the initiation and propagation of cracks in the flattened Brazilian test.

Firstly, based on the principle of spring operating mechanism, the corresponding vibration caused by components impact in the closing process is analyzed. Then, in order to eliminate the noise in the vibration signal, the variation mode decomposition is adopted to decompose the vibration signal, and the signal is reconstructed by selecting the components whose waveform change is consistent with the original signal. Finally, the double threshold method based on the short-time energy entropy ratio is used to detect the timing parameters of the critical moment in the time domain of the vibration signal, completing the extraction of timing parameters in the circuit breaker closing process. Through the comparison of the timing parameters extracted from the theoretical vibration signal and the experimental travel curve, the correctness of the proposed method is verified.

Further experiments demonstrated that mixed phospholipids of EPS were largely responsible for the solubilization of EPS on PAHs. In the presence of EPS, DPPC or BSA, adsorption of PAHs by silica was notably inhibited, indicating competitive adsorption between PAHs and PS components on silica.

We show that there is an optimistic amplitude of node weights that guarantees the survival of cooperation even when temptation to antisocial behavior is relatively large. An explanation is provided from a microscopic point of view by dividing nodes into four different types.

Here, through manipulating magnetostructural transition, we achieved large reversible magnetoresponsive effects under a relatively low magnetic field of 3 T in a Ni-Co-Mn-In alloy. By systematically tuning the Mn/In ratio and Co substitution, an optimum composition Ni49Co3Mn34In14 with a low thermal hysteresis (8 K), a narrow transformation interval (7 K) and a high sensitivity of transformation temperature to field change (6KT-1), was obtained. Good geometric compatibility between austenite and martensite was revealed by in situ synchrotron high-energy x-ray diffraction experiment, which accounts for the low hysteresis and narrow transformation interval. A reversible transformation between pure austenite and pure martensite is induced by a relatively low field of 3 T, which was directly evidenced by in situ neutron diffraction experiments. As a result, a large reversible magnetocaloric effect with entropy change of 16.5Jkg-1K-1, a large reversible magnetostrain of 0.26%, and a large reversible magnetoresistance of 60%, under a relatively low field of 3 T, were simultaneously achieved. These reversible magnetoresponsive effects are comparable to the maximum reversible values obtained under high fields in other Ni-Mn-based alloys, but the magnetic field we applied is much lower. This study may guide the design of metamagnetic shape memory alloys with low-field-induced magnetoresponsive properties for magnetic refrigeration, magnetic sensing, and magnetic recording applications. © 2019 American Physical Society.","75","Manganese alloys","Austenite - Cobalt alloys - Hysteresis - Indium alloys - Magnetocaloric effects - Magnetoresistance - Martensite - Mathematical transformations - Neutron diffraction - Nickel alloys - Shape-memory alloy","High energy x-ray diffraction - High magnetic fields - In-situ neutron diffraction - In-situ synchrotrons - Magnetostructural transitions - Metamagnetic shape memory alloys - Reversible transformation - Transformation temperatures","531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 548.2 Nickel Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The serious inhomogeneity in the thermal field remains as one of the major concerns need to be addressed in horizontal supercritical flow. This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of internal helical-rib roughness in improving heat transfer of horizontal supercritical flow. A well-validated, three-dimensional numerical model was employed to solve the turbulent mixed convection. Results show that helical ribs easily inhibited buoyancy effect in horizontal flow. Under condition of weak buoyancy influence, helical ribs hardly improved local or integral heat transfer as a result of barely modified flow field. In heavily buoyancy-affecting mixed convection, strong interaction between natural convection and rib-induced swirl flow was observed. The flow field continued evolving along the flow direction, which resulted in a more uniform thermal field and significant improvement in heat transfer. Variation trend of the location where heat transfer was the worst was identified. Finally, it was concluded that though internal helical-rib roughness is less effective in horizontal flow than in upward flow, it can still significantly relieve the serious thermal inhomogeneity and heat transfer deterioration in horizontal smooth pipes at Grq/Grth > 200. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","51","Mixed convection","Buoyancy - Deterioration - Effluent treatment - Flow fields - Supercritical fluids - Thermoelectricity","Horizontal flows - Rib roughness - Smooth pipes - Supercritical water - Thermal field","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2016YFB0600201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FB087, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51806091, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to appreciate the financial support from the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB0600201 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51806091) and Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2017FB087 ).

This leads to the researches of semi-supervised learning that can incorporate a small number of labeled and a large number of unlabeled data by exploiting the local structure of data distribution. Manifold regularization and pairwise constraints are representative semi-supervised learning methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel local structure preserving approach by considering both manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. Specifically, we construct a new graph Laplacian that takes advantage of pairwise constraints compared with the traditional Laplacian. The proposed graph Laplacian can better preserve the local geometry of data distribution and achieve the effective recognition. Upon this, we build the graph regularized classifiers including support vector machines and kernel least squares as special cases for action recognition.

However, the role of each intermolecular force in constraining peptide conformation remains poorly understood. In this work, we show that aromatic–aromatic interactions drive peptides into β-sheets, and the hydrophobic effect determines the assembly speed of peptides. By using intermolecular forces to artificially control the assembly of β-sheets, a multi-modal analytical system was developed that allows five readouts and dual qualitative–quantitative analysis, and satisfies both point-of-care testing (POCT) and laboratory-based testing.

In order to explore the development and research frontiers of lake science in China, this paper analyzes the interannual variation trend of the annual output and impact factors through the statistics of 2555 papers of the Journal of Lake Sciences published in the past 30 years (1989-2018) and the visual knowledge map by CiteSpace V. The results show that the annual volume, citation frequency and impact factors of the Journal of Lake Science display a steady increase trend, and indicate the stable and extensive academic influence of the journal. The relevant research scope mainly involves global climate change, lake ecosystems and community structure, lake eutrophication and other aspects. Meanwhile, the research focuses on the areas of lakes widely distributed and fragile ecosystems. According to the keywords, the research hotspots and trends can be divided into three stages. Analysis of the author's structure shows that universities have overtaken research institutes to become the main parts of journal authors in the past 10 years. The analysis of the key words frequency demonstrates that 'Taihu Lake', 'sediment' and 'eutrophication' have been hot topics in the publication. In the past 10 years, phytoplankton and its community structure, the Three Gorges Reservoir have gradually become hotspots. With the further intersection of lake research and remote sensing technology, statistics and simulation, environmental chemistry and so on, lake research field will become more in-depth and refined. At present, lake research has formed relatively stable research teams in lake hydrology and ecosystem, lake ecological restoration and environmental assessment, sedimentary environment and global change. Universities and research institutes have become the main body of lake research with obvious regional and agglomeration effects. Statistical analysis of the download volume of the journal shows that the journal website has become the main channel for readers to study and download papers. The statistical analysis of CNKI database suggests that the published papers have been cited by different numbers of readers in the past 30 years, with the highest citation frequency of 636 times and 24 citations per article. Analysis of high-cited papers indicate that, as an important carrier of ecological environment protection, strengthening the prevention of lake pollution, prediction of lake eutrophication and ecological restoration technology have become hotspots and trends in related research. At the same time, the research on material exchange, quantitative assessment of human impact, health and management, and protection of lake wetland ecosystem will be further accelerated with the construction of the national lake basin data platform and the integration of big data. The application of lake research results in the region will provide strong support for improving the quality of the water environment, ensuring the safety of regional ecological environment, and improving lake ecological protection and environment. © 2019 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","65","Lake pollution","Climate change - Ecosystems - Environmental technology - Eutrophication - Information management - Lakes - Publishing - Remote sensing - Reservoirs (water) - Restoration - Statistical methods","Bibliometric analysis - Citespace - Co-occurrence relationships - Highly-cited papers - Journal of Lake Sciences","441.2 Reservoirs - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 453 Water Pollution - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 903.2 Information Dissemination - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, these generative models without prior knowledge of spatial distributions has limited performance to deal with various complex scenes. In this paper, we proposed a image deblurring network based on CGANs to generate ideal images without any blurring assumption. To overcome adversarial insufficiency, an extended classifier with different attribute domains is formulated to replace the original discriminator of CGANs. Inspired by residual learning, a set of skip-connections are cohered to transfer multi-scaled spatial features to the following high-level operations. Furthermore, this adversary architecture is driven by a composite loss that integrates histogram of gradients (HoG) and geodesic distance. In experiments, an uniformed adversarial iteration is circularly applied to improve image degenerations. Extensive results show that the proposed deblurring approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","55","Image enhancement","Graphic methods - Iterative methods","Adversarial networks - Histogram of gradients - Image deblurring - Prior distribution - Residual learning","921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 61562053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61563025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61563025, 61562053, 61762056), Yunnan Science and Technology Department of Science and Technology Project (2016FB109, 2017FB094).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The proposed model has been analyzed theoretically using the qualitative analysis techniques related to Filippov non-smooth systems in the first place. In particular, the existence and stability of equilibria are discussed for the sliding mode dynamics, through which it can be shown that the real equilibrium and pseudo-equilibrium can coexist. After that, some relevant topics such as sliding mode bifurcation, boundary-focus bifurcation, grazing bifurcation, crossing bifurcation and buckling bifurcation are investigated using numerical analysis. These complex sliding bifurcations reveal that the proposed Filippov system admits the coexistence of multi-attractors including equilibrium and crossing cycles, thus indicating that there exists a close relationship between the intermittent control strategy and the initial densities of both populations. Similarly, the global stability properties of real equilibrium and pseudo-equilibrium of subsystems show that the intermittent control strategy can effectively control the pests under the prescribed threshold which is the aim of the IPM strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","40","Bifurcation (mathematics)","Ecosystems - Network security - Pest control - Stability","Filippov systems - Group defense - Integrated Pest Management - Sliding bifurcation - Threshold control","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications","Number: 11601268, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 201808420192, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no.: 11601268, W.J.

However, the spatial correlation across distinct sites and the temporal correlation within each site pose challenges to accurate forecasting. In this paper, a geosensor data forecasting tensor framework for significant societal events is proposed. Specifically, a tensor pattern is used to model the geosensor data, based on which a tensor decomposition algorithm is then developed to estimate future values of geosensor data. The proposed approach not only combines and utilizes the multi-mode correlations, but also well extracts the underlying factors in each mode of tensor and mines the multi-dimensional structures of geosensor data. In addition, a rank increasing strategy is used to determine tensor rank automatically, and a sliding window strategy is used to improve the prediction accuracy.

How to deal with the integrated management and efficient application of the electric power big data is one of major technology challenges facing power grid operation in this country. Focusing on the complex hydro-thermal-wind-solar power generation scheduling system, this paper analyzed the scheduling big data characteristics and the mutual relations of the ultra-large-scale power station groups. Based on the data analysis, the scheduling management functional system and a power generation scheduling big data platform architecture were constructed. Multi-source data check techniques and multi-platform cooperative storage technology were developed to meet the common needs for different operation scenarios. Meanwhile, big data fusion processing technology and analysis decision technology were proposed to serve for analyzing operation plans and making generation schedule, respectively. These techniques can help to realize the integrated function of electric power big data collection, storage, analysis and knowledge extraction. Taking more than 400 large and medium-sized power stations in Yunnan power grid as the background, an ultra-large-scale multi-source power generation scheduling software system was constructed based on the big data platform architecture and related key technologies. Typical applications in practical engineering such as tracking monthly generation schedule, determining new energy power forecast error, and scheduling cascaded hydropower plants were presented. The results show that electric power big data technology can indeed provide new solutions for the efficient and practical operation of complex power generation scheduling system. © 2019 Chin.

The deposit contains over 4.2 million tonnes (Mt) of contained Zn + Pb metal reserves at 5.09% Zn and 2.40% Pb, and 301 Mt of Fe ore resources at 30.02% TFe. The stratiform or vein-type orebodies are hosted in the Upper Cambrian Shahechang Formation. Similar to many major Zn skarn deposits worldwide, the Luziyuan deposit shows a distinct metal zonation pattern with depth, which correlates with the different calc-silicate mineral assemblages: From Zn-Pb (sphalerite + galena) ores in marble, through Zn-Pb-Fe-Cu (sphalerite + galena + magnetite ± pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in pyroxenoid (± clinopyroxene)-bearing skarn, to Fe-Cu (magnetite ± pyrite + chalcopyrite) ores in garnet (± clinopyroxene ± pyroxenoid)-bearing skarn. The syn-ore calcite has δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values of −1.0 to +0.9‰ and +10.3 to +12.7‰ respectively, suggestive of isotopic affinities to both granite and marble. δDH2O values of the fluid inclusions in the pre-ore rhodonite and the syn-ore quartz range from −81.7 to −68.8‰ and −76.6 to −56.3‰ respectively; whilst the calculated δ18OH2O values of the rhodonite, syn-ore calcite, and quartz are of +5.4 to +6.1‰ +1.4 to +3.8‰ and −5.3 to −2.0‰ respectively. This indicates that the ore-forming fluids were sourced from both magmatic and meteoric waters. δ34S values of the syn-ore sulfides (+8.9 to +12.0‰) are slightly higher than those of typical crustal-derived granites (δ34S = −4.0 to +9.0‰), but are significantly lower than those of Cambrian seawater sulfates. This indicates that the source of S is correlated with both granite and seawater sulfates. We propose that the Luziyuan Zn-Pb-Fe(-Cu) polymetallic mineralization occurred in a distal skarn system, and was genetically linked to concealed Early Cretaceous granite intrusions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","154","Ores","Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper compounds - Deposits - Granite - Iron alloys - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Magnetite - Marble - Mineralogy - Ore deposit geology - Ore deposits - Quartz - Seawater - Silicate minerals - Sulfur compounds - Uranium alloys - Zinc - Zinc alloys - Zinc sulfide","Baoshan Block (SW China) - Distal skarn - Fluid sources - Luziyuan - Polymetallic - S isotopes","471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 41363001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013HA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Leading Talents Program of Guangdong Province; Number: 2015CB452605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China ( 41363001 and 41762009 ), the State Key Fundamental Research Development Program ( 2015CB452605 and 2014CB440905 ), and the Science and Technology leading talent training program of Yunnan Province ( 2013HA001 ).

The source and mechanism of the regional Zn–Pb mineralization remain controversial despite many investigations that have been conducted. The Wusihe Zn–Pb deposit is a representative large-scale Zn–Pb deposit in the northern SYG, which mainly occurs in the Dengying Formation and yields Zn–Pb resources of ~ 3.7 Mt. In this paper, Zn and S isotopes, and Fe and Cd contents of sphalerite from the Wusihe deposit were investigated in an attempt to constrain the controls on Zn and S isotopic variations, the potential sources of ore-forming components, and the possible mineralization mechanisms. Both the δ66Zn and δ34S values in sphalerite from the Wusihe deposit increase systematically from the bottom to the top of the strata-bound orebodies. Such spatial evolution in δ66Zn and δ34S values of sphalerite can be attributed to isotopic Rayleigh fractionation during sphalerite precipitation with temperature variations. The strong correlations between the Zn–S isotopic compositions and Fe–Cd concentrations in sphalerite suggest that their variations were dominated by a similar mechanism. However, the Rayleigh fractionation mechanism cannot explain the spatial variations of Fe and Cd concentrations of sphalerite in this deposit. It is noted that the bottom and top sphalerites from the strata-bound orebodies document contrasting Zn and S isotopic compositions which correspond to the Zn and S isotopic characteristics of basement rocks and host rocks, respectively. Therefore, the mixing of two-source fluids with distinct Zn–S isotopic signatures was responsible for the spatial variations of Zn–S isotopic compositions of sphalerite from the Wusihe deposit. The fluids from basement rocks are characterized by relatively lighter Zn (~ 0.2 ‰) and S (~ 5 ‰) isotopic compositions while the fluids from host rocks are marked by relatively heavier Zn (~ 0.6 ‰) and S (~ 15 ‰) isotopic compositions. © 2019, Science Press and Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","55","Zinc deposits","Deposits - Isotopes - Lead deposits - Mineralogy - Mixing - Ores - Rocks - Zinc sulfide","Guizhou - Isotopic characteristics - Isotopic composition - Isotopic signatures - Rayleigh fractionation - S isotopes - Temperature variation - Two sources","482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2017YFC0602503, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: XDB18030302, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41573011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This project was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB18030302), the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0602503), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1812402, 41430315, 41573011, 41625006).

Based on comprehensive researches and prospecting practices in the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Triangle (SYGT) area in the last 20 years, particularly those of the depth and periphery exploration of known deposits, we proposed a 'Four Steps Type' ore-prospecting method for concealed hydrothermal ore deposits. First, in order to successfully apply this integrated technology system, 'four main factors' including metallogenic time, space, materials and evolution processes, and 'five links' including mineral origin, transportation, storage, change, and preserving, should be well documented. After that, it is important to determine the metallogenic geologic body of deposits, to set metallogenic structural planes, to reveal fluid characteristic symbols, to gradually establish ore-finding prediction model based on the ore-forming geological processes, metallogenic tectonic system and fluid metallogenic processes. The prospecting directions can be chosen at this stage. Secondly, it is essential to delineate the structural controls on the distribution of the deposits and ore-bodies, to define the metallotectonic system by using fine structural resolution and large-scale alteration lithofacies mapping, to delineate the natural boundaries of mineralization and screening favorable ore-prospecting zones. Thirdly, by applying fine tectono-geochemical exploration method, the mineralization center and key prospecting targets have to be delineated. Fourthly, to explore concealed or deeply buried ore-bodies in selected locations, comprehensive application of large-scale geophysical exploration techniques including high-precision tunnel gravity exploration method (TGEM), AMT, TEM and IP will be carried out to determine the occurrences and buried depth of concealed ore-bodies. A successful implication of the 'Four Steps Type' method consists of choosing a potential ore-prospecting direction by applying ore-finding prediction model, selecting favorable zones by structural resolution and alteration lithofacies mapping, sorting out the most promising prospecting targets by using fine tectono-geochemical exploration method, and locating the deeply concealed ore bodies by applying geophysical exploration techniques. Based on establishing the integrated ore-prospecting exploration model, deep deposits or orebodies are discovered finally through exploration engineering. The method is further exemplified by prospecting and exploration engineering in the Maoping Zn-Pb-(Ge-Ag) deposit. Important ore-prospecting breakthroughs have been made by using the 'Four Steps Type' ore-finding exploration model in the Maoping deposit, moreover, the results showed that it could shed lights on prospecting of the HZT-type deposits in the SYGT area, and it is likely that this method may be useful for ore prediction and evaluation of the overall hydrothermal-type ore deposits in sedimentary basins. © 2019, Science Press.

In this work, the microwave sodium roasting (MWSR) strategy was used for the heat treatment of the spent catalyst, with the aim of achieving effective separation of Mo and Al while achieving in-situ sulfur fixation. Specifically, the de-oiled, spent HDS catalyst was roasted with Na2CO3 by microwave heating in air, followed by hot water leaching. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, the effects of microwave heating temperature, holding time and Na2CO3 addition on the recovery of molybdenum have been thoroughly investigated. Owing to the special heating method of microwave, the spent catalyst after roasting has a microstructure suitable for leaching, and S is more in situ converted to Na2CO3. After following the strategy, the leaching degree of Mo can reach 99%, while the leaching degree of Al is less than 8%, which indicates that Mo and Al are effectively separated. More importantly, a sulfur fixation degree of 79.1% was obtained. This strategy provides a novel reference for the harmless treatment of spent HDS catalysts. © 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","39","Sodium compounds","Aluminum - Calcination - Catalysts - Hydrodesulfurization - Leaching - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Molybdenum - Sodium - Sodium Carbonate - Sulfur - Thermoanalysis","Harmless treatments - Heat pretreatment - Heating method - Holding time - MWSR - Sodium roasting - Spent catalyst - Thermo dynamic analysis",,"Number: U1402274, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 51664035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China −Yunnan Joint Foundation (No. U1402274 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51562018 , 51564033 , 51664035 and 51464924 ).

In this study, corn core powder was modified (MCCP) using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) to break the structure of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and cell membrane for enhancing the dewaterability of sewage sludge. The dewatering performance, the properties of the treated sludge, the composition and distribution of EPS were investigated to discuss the dewatering mechanism of sludge. Adding 20% DS (mass of dry solids in sludge) of MCCP reduced the moisture content (MC) and the specific resistance of filtration (SRF) of the sludge by 40% and 55%, respectively. Then, correlation analyses were performed between dewatering indices of sludge and sludge properties. A multiple linear regression model was established which indicated the relationship between MC and the key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability, demonstrating that larger particle size of sludge flocs and more total dissolved solids in filtrate may be propitious to reduce content of bound water in sludge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","59","Filtration","Cationic surfactants - Cytology - Dehydration - Dewatering - Dyes - Linear regression - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Polymers - Sewage sludge - Sodium hydroxide","Cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromides - Dehydrating agents - Dewatering performance - Extra-cellular polymeric substances - Multiple linear regression models - Sludge dewaterability - Specific resistance of filtration - Total dissolved solids","452.2 Sewage Treatment - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 21666016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 21666016); the key Laboratory and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is interesting how invasive plants interact with the local soil microbial community and establish the soil bacterial community in the endosphere of these plants in the short term. In this study, we compared the bacterial community in the rhizosphere with that in the root endosphere of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the roots of A. adenophora selectively accumulated the genera Clostridium and Enterobacter, which are rarely distributed in the rhizosphere. This selective accumulation caused a switch in the bacterial composition at the phylum level from Bacteroidetes predominant in the rhizosphere to Proteobacteria dominant in the root endosphere of A. adenophora. Our data indicated the potential existence of a highly conserved signal recognition in which hosts, either invasive or native, enrich the endosphere bacteria, such as Clostridium, Enterobacter, etc., from the rhizosphere. Moreover, the accumulated bacteria were physiologically and genetically different at the strain level and displayed distinct roles in growth between invasive and native plants.

Our results showed that Shenzhen experienced two expansion phases, which is in accordance with the diffusion-coalescence hypothesis. In addition, we found that the greenspace patterns in edge expansion and outlying patches were similar, but were different from those of infilling. In the infilling patches, the greenspace percentage, edge density (ED) and largest patch index (LPI) were significantly larger than those in the patches of the other two expansion types.

Four cases with different velocity difference ΔU of 1.5ms-1 and 3.0ms-1 and different potential temperature gradient Γθ of 0.006Km-1 and 0.015Km-1 were conducted in the horizontal homogeneous atmospheric convective boundary layer of 6000m × 6000m × 2000m. The results show that the formation of the entrainment layer is affected integratedly by the horizontal shear effect and the vertical buoyancy effect, in which turbulence shows strong anisotropy and intermittent characteristics, wherein the mixed layer is dominated by stable small eddies, and the entrainment layer by strip-shaped large eddies. Compared with the pure buoyancy boundary layer, the entrainment flux ratio A f is 0.176∼0.385, and the height of the entrainment layer z i is shifted to the side with bigger velocity (U 2). ΔU promotes entrainment and Γθ inhibits, especially for the upper limit of the entrainment layer h 2.

Multi-core processors enable intra-task parallelism, and there has been much progress on exploiting that, while there has been only a little progress on energy-efficient multi-core real-time scheduling as yet. In this work, we study energy-efficient real-time scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider a clustered multi-core platform where processors within the same cluster run at the same speed at any given time. A new concept named speed-profile is proposed to model per-task and per-cluster energy-consumption variations during run-time to minimize the expected long-term energy consumption. To our knowledge, no existing work considers energy-aware real-time scheduling of DAG tasks with constrained deadlines, nor on a clustered multi-core platform. The proposed energy-aware realtime scheduler is implemented upon an ODROID XU-3 board to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. To complement our system experiments in large-scale, we have also conducted simulations that demonstrate a CPU energy saving of up to 57% through our proposed approach compared to existing methods. © 2019 IEEE.","50","Energy efficiency","Directed graphs - Embedded systems - Energy utilization - Parallel processing systems - Power management - Real time systems - Scheduling","Cluster-based - Computation intensives - Directed acyclic graph (DAG) - Energy minimization - Multi-core embedded systems - Parallel task - Real - time scheduling - Real-time application","525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The program is based on its research on four representative processes in metallurgical route, namely slag refining, wet purification, directional solidification and electron beam melting. Key factors determining environmental load are sought out through contribution analysis and improvement evaluation. Measures and suggestions on how to improve are proposed. For the first time, the LCA model of comparison of metallurgical route and modified Siemens process to SoG-Si environmental impact is constructed. The environmental impacts of SoG-Si production via metallurgical route is compared with purification via modified Siemens process. Results show that the comprehensive environmental impact of metallurgical route SoG-Si is only 49.57% of modified Siemens process SoG-Si. The metallurgical route enjoys obvious environmental advantage.

Although numerous algorithms have been proposed, it is still challenging due to the limited labeled data. One representative work is the Laplacian-regularized multitask dictionary learning (LR-MTDL) that employs graph Laplacian regularization terms to fully utilize both the labeled and unlabeled information. However, it probably conduces to poor extrapolating power because Laplacian regularization biases the solution toward a constant function. In this letter, we propose a Hessian-regularized multitask dictionary learning to learn a source-data set-shared but target-data set-biased representation for RS image recognition. Particularly, Hessian can properly exploit the intrinsic local geometry of the data manifold and finally leverage the performance. Extensive experiments on four RS image data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with baseline algorithms including single-task dictionary learning and LR-MTDL. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","24","Remote sensing","Image recognition - Laplace transforms","Constant functions - Dictionary learning - Graph Laplacian - Hessian regularization - Image representations - Laplacian regularizations - Remote sensing images - Target data set",,"Number: FDCT/189/2017/A3, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Development Fund; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: ZR2018MF017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Doctoral Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 2016FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1713213, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Number: MYRG2016-00123-FST, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University Research Committee, Emory University; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61671480, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received August 11, 2018; revised November 5, 2018; accepted November 14, 2018.

In the second stage of OEEDA, a four-dimensional matrix based on ordered relationship (OFDM) is proposed to effectively learn and accumulate the excellent solutions'information of ordered relationship, i.e., the information of job blocks and their corresponding positions. Then, a sampling scheme that fixes some blocks in the solution is designed to guide the global search direction more clearly.

However, several problems still exists towards this goal, such as the generally low concentration of the target molecules disturbed in the complex samples that undergo analysis during criminal investigations. In this work, the sensitive and selective detection of ketamine was accomplished by molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor. The molecularly imprinted membrane as a biomimetic recognition element was fabricated by the UV-induced polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) on a metal-organic framework/graphene nanocomposite (MOFs@G) modified screen-printed electrode. The screen printed electrode (SPE) provided good adhesion for the formation of the imprinted membranes and increased the stability of the sensor. The morphology and performance of the imprinted films were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The experimental results demonstrated that the imprinted sensor had excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and long-term stability. It offered a low detection limit (4.0 × 10−11 mol L−1) and had a dynamic range from 1.0 × 10−10 mol L−1 to 4.0 × 10−5 mol L−1. Furthermore, the established method was successfully applied for the determination of ketamine in urine and saliva samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","32","Electrochemical sensors","Amines - Biomimetics - Crystalline materials - Cyclic voltammetry - Electrochemical electrodes - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Functional polymers - Health risks - Molecules - Nanocomposites - Organometallics - Scanning electron microscopy","Differential pulse voltammetry - Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate - Ketamine - Molecularly imprinted - Molecularly imprinted membranes - Screen printed electrodes - UV induced - UV-induced polymerization","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 2017FB012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018FB014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Fund of Yunnan (2017FB012 and 2018FB014).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The basic idea is from the invariant energy quadratization approach to construct energy stable schemes for gradient systems, which are energy dispassion. We here take the sine-Gordon equation as an example to show that the invariant energy quadratization approach is also an efficient way to construct linearly implicit and local energy-conserving schemes for energy-conserving systems. Utilizing the invariant energy quadratization approach, the sine-Gordon equation is first reformulated into an equivalent system, which inherits a modified local energy conservation law. The new system are then discretized by the conventional finite difference method and a semi-discretized system is obtained, which can conserve the semi-discretized local energy conservation law. Subsequently, the linearly implicit structure-preserving method is applied for the resulting semi-discrete system to arrive at a fully discretized scheme. We prove that the resulting scheme can exactly preserve the discrete local energy conservation law. Moveover, with the aid of the classical energy method, an unconditional and optimal error estimate for the scheme is established in discrete Hh1-norm. Finally, various numerical examples are addressed to confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantage of the new scheme over some existing local structure-preserving schemes. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","43","sine-Gordon equation","Energy conservation - Finite difference method - Numerical methods - Physical properties","Discretized systems - Energy-conserving - Energy-preserving - Equivalent system - Invariant energy quadratization - Linearly implicit - Optimal error estimate - Structure-preserving","525.2 Energy Conservation - 921.2 Calculus - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 2016YFC0600310, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 2019J0956, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 201905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 15KJA110002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: BK20171480, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 11771213, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to express sincere gratitude to the referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.

Hypertension is a complex multifactorial disease involving multiple biological pathways and interactions between genetic and environmental factors. By combining network approach with biological knowledge, this study constructs a pathway-based weighted network model of hypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationships between genes; in this network model a weight is assigned to each edge in terms of the number of the same pathways in which the two nodes (genes) connected to the edge are involved. Analysis of statistical and topological characteristics shows that the edge weights are correlated to the network topology, and the edge weight distribution decays as a power-law. The disparity of the weights indicates that the edge weight distribution for the nodes with the same degree is of approximately equal weights; and the edges with the larger weights tend to connect with the higher degree nodes. By introducing an integrated ranking index that comprehensively reflect the contribution of the three indices of nodes (strength, degree, and number of pathways), eight key hub genes are identified by the threshold of integrated ranking index larger than 0.60: Jun, Cdk4, RT1-Da, Pdgfra, Fn1, Actg1, Cycs, and Creb3l2. These genes can be regarded as candidate genes or drug targets for further biological and medical research on their functions.

In this study, electromagnetic wave power transmission coefficients (PTCs) of alumina refractory ceramics are calculated within the temperature range of 22–1379 °C and the thickness range of 0–0.1 m at 2.45 GHz, and the influences of the complex dielectric constant of the material, the thickness of the medium, the polarisation mode of the electromagnetic waves, and the incident angle of the electromagnetic waves on PTC are analysed. It was found that the transmission performance of alumina ceramics fluctuates with increasing thickness at different temperatures and that there are several transmission peaks. The transmission performance in a transverse electric (TE) field decreases monotonically with increasing incident angle, and the PTC is equal to zero when the incident angle is 90°. The transmission performance in a transverse magnetic (TM) field increases first and then decreases with increasing incident angle, and there is a transmission peak. Transmission peaks at different thicknesses form a ‘ridge’ at the Brewster's angle, at which the fluctuation amplitude of PTC becomes very small. As the temperature increases, the ‘ridge’ becomes steeper. Finally, the incident angle range with good transmission performance of alumina ceramics in the temperature range of 22–1379 °C is obtained, and the optimal thickness interval at the optimum incident angle (73.8°) is calculated for reference.

A heterogeneously catalyzed H2O2/peroxydisulfate system coupled with magnetite supported on coal fly ash was investigated for the degradation of bisphenol A. The activity tests results showed that the bisphenol A (50 mg/L) degradation efficiency of 60 min in the binary oxidants system can be significantly enhanced from 16.7% to 100% after the addition of catalyst ([oxidants]0 = 20 mM, [H2O2]0/[PDS]0 = 4, [Catalyst] = 2 g/L, pH = 5, T = 25 °C), while the oxidation process can be affected by solution pH, catalyst surface properties and oxidant ratios. Based on the results of quenching experiments, it was proposed that in a binary system, there were 3 radicals including hydroxyl radical, sulfate radical and superoxide radical possibly responsible for the bisphenol A degradation, and either radical may predominate over the other two depending on the adsorption behaviors on the catalyst surface as well as the radicals’ inter-conversions. The stability and reusability analysis of catalyst were carried out in 7 sequential batch studies. The negligible concentration of dissolved Fe ion in first 4 runs illustrated the dominant role of heterogeneous process, while the gradually leached Fe ion in following runs demonstrated the involvement of homogeneous process. The findings of this study strongly suggest that the heterogeneous binary oxidant system is a promising treatment technology for the abatement of bisphenol A, while the suitable oxidant ratio and solution pH are essential for making the most of the radicals. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","32","Oxidants","Catalysis - Catalysts - Coal ash - Degradation - Fly ash - Hydrogen peroxide - Iron - Magnetite - Phenols - Reusability - Sulfur compounds","Binary oxidants system - Bisphenol a degradations - Degradation efficiency - Peroxydisulfate - Point of zero charge - Radical inter-conversions - Reusability analysis - Treatment technologies",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan University; Number: 41602241, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41602241 ).

In addition, unit cell volume and grain size increased with sintering temperature. Besides, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) fitting results of Mn2p core level peaks confirmed the increase in Mn3+ ion concentration with sintering temperature, mainly attributed to formation of more oxygen vacancies. Raman microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) jointly depicted the existence of Mn–O bond, indicating that sintering temperature definitely impacted vibration mode of Mn–O and affected both crystal structure and performance. UV–vis optical band gap width of LCSMO nanoparticles sintered at 700 °C, 1000 °C, and 1500 °C decreased from 1.2 to 0.75 eV as sintering temperature increased, suggesting the semiconducting properties of nanoscale LCSMO particles.

The ozone effective absorption coefficients of the Dobson and Brewer instruments at Kunming in the low-latitude stations and Hohenpeissenberg in the middle-latitude stations were calculated. The test of the total ozone column (TOC) from different ozone absorption cross-section data sets shows that in the Dobson and Brewer retrieval algorithms, the effect of temperature on the Brewer instrument is smaller than that for the Dobson instrument. The temperature sensitivity of the two instruments to the SAC is −0.005%°C−1 and 0.102%°C−1, respectively, indicating that the differences in the temperature sensitivity result in differences in the TOC measurements between the two instruments, as well as in systematic seasonal differences. Using BPQ, DBM and SER to retrieve TOC will increase the overall deviation of the two instruments by 2.5%, −2.77% and −1.89%, respectively. The consistency of the TOC retrieval in the two instruments is the best when using the SAC, which shows a deviation of only 0.03%. The systematic seasonal deviation can also be effectively improved. In addition, this work makes up for the lack of relevant research in low-latitude areas. The rangeability of the monthly mean value of the instrument system deviation at a low-latitude station is about one-half of that at the mid-latitude station (Kunming: 0.2%–1.1%, Hohenpeissenberg: 0.2%–2.0%).

The test results show that when the partial arc appears on the surface of the sample, the calculated equivalent values of the surface conductivity of different types of insulators are different, and there is a great deviation from the actual value of the surface conductivity. The calculated equivalent value of surface conductivity of the triangular glass plate is almost the same as the actual value. The test results show that the appearance of partial arc changes the development path of current on the pollution layer, and then causes the change of shape coefficient, so that the calculated equivalent value of the surface conductivity of insulator is smaller than the actual value.

This system is capable of cooling PV panels by ventilation/exhaust air in winter/summer and generating electricity. A performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is defined in this study to examine the overall performance of the considered BIPVT system. Then, the mentioned methods are used to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the system. The parameter PEC is considered as the essential output of the system, while the input parameters are the length, width, and depth of the duct underneath the PV panels and air mass flow rate. To evaluate the accuracy of produced outputs, two statistical indices of R2 and RMSE are used. As a result, all models presented excellent performance where the ANN model could slightly perform better performance compared to GP and ANFIS. Finally, the equations belonging to ANN and GP models are derived, and the GP presents a more suitable formula, due to its simplicity of use, simplicity of concept, and robustness. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society","41","Fuzzy inference","Fuzzy neural networks - Fuzzy systems - Genetic algorithms - Genetic programming - Photovoltaic cells","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system - ANFIS - Building integrated photovoltaic - Building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) systems - Energetic performance - Optimization algorithms - Performance evaluation criteria - Statistical indices","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper proposes a binocular clear image hazing algorithm based on depth map, which combines atmospheric attenuation models with the characteristics of hazing image depth, and derives a model of the hazy image and then simulates the effect of the hazy image on this basis. In practical applications, simply take a clear image and you can get the desired stereo hazy image with this hazing model.

XRD, Raman SEM, TEM, XPS and physical adsorption of nitrogen were used to characterize the products. Dark adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was run to evaluate their activities for removal of organic pollutants. It was demonstrated that the composition and structure of ZnO/JFC composites depended on the ratios of jute fibers to zinc salt. Through adjusting the mass ratio between raw materials, a fine composite of ZnO monocrystalline nanorods embedded on the porous carbon walls was obtained, which exhibited a much better efficiency for MB decolorization. The removal of MB was found to be pH dependent, and the optimized removal efficiency reached to 99% and the mineralization level was over 93% at pH 7.0 following 30 min under UV illumination. The kinetic studies showed the decolorization of MB followed pseudo first-order kinetics, and the rate constants were determined using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, indicating KLH = 0.024 Lmg−1and kc = 4.01 mgL−1 min−1. Moreover, the ZnO nanorods/JFC composite was stable and showed a high efficiency of over 80% during seven cycles of utilization and regeneration. Examination for the real sample contaminated by MB proved that the presence of metal ions and other organic pollutants hardly affected its photocatalytic ability. It was demonstrated that ZnO/JFC composites could be fabricated through simultaneous pyrolysis of jute fibers and zinc acetate. These composites were provided with the advantages of high photocatalytic efficiency, convenient recycling and long-term stability, and were expected to be applied in environmental engineering and manufacturing for organic dyes removal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","78","Jute fibers","Aromatic compounds - Carbon - Costs - Dyes - Efficiency - Fabrication - Gas adsorption - II-VI semiconductors - Metal ions - Metals - Nanorods - Organic pollutants - Photocatalysis - Photocatalytic activity - Porous materials - Pyrolysis - Rate constants - Reusability - Stripping (dyes) - Zinc oxide","Bichar - Dye degradation - Engineering and manufacturing - Photo catalytic degradation - Photocatalytic efficiency - Photodegradation of methylene blue - Pseudo first-order kinetics - ZnO nanorod",,"Number: 51364040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51364040 ) Appendix A",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

An economy sensitive equalization method is employed at the secondary level to equalize the curtailed active power of each RSP. A comprehensive reactive power regulation method is utilized at the tertiary level to minimize the curtailed active power of each photovoltaic (PV) inverter.

A Markov chain Monte Carlo calculation provides a best-fit single power-law function to the first ten epochs of photometry described by an exponent of 2.16+0.06-0.06 and a time of first light of MJD 56629.4+0.1-0.1, which is 1.93+0.12-0.13 days (i.e., +0.12-0.13 days before the time of B-band maximum (MJD 56648.5 ± 0.1). The estimate of the time of first light is consistent with the explosion time inferred from the evolution of the Si II λ6355 Doppler velocity. Furthermore, discovery photometry and previous nondetection limits enable us to constrain the companion radius down to Rc ≤ 4 Ro. In addition to our early-time constraints, we used a deep +235 day nebular-phase spectrum from Magellan/IMACS to place a stripped H-mass limit of o. Combined, these limits effectively rule out H-rich nondegenerate companions. © 2019 ESO.","78","Supernovae","Atmospheric optics - Markov processes - Photometry - Silicon compounds","Doppler velocity - Markov Chain Monte-Carlo - Photometric systems - Power-law functions - Supernovae: general - Supernovae: individual - Time constraints - Visual wavelength","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 922.1 Probability Theory - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Adolph C. and Mary Sprague Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California Berkeley; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Google; Number: 11325313, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11403096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11633002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11773067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: AST-1211916, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; ","A special thanks to the referee for detailed comments to the submitted manuscript.

Given the complexity of the studied problem, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is proposed to address this problem. To construct initial solution, vehicle routing is determined with nearest insertion first, whereby the order batch production sequence is determined based on three propositions. Moreover, ten neighborhood structures are designed and a local search algorithm based on tabu search algorithm is proposed for intensification. The effectiveness of the proposed VNS algorithm is validated by comparing it with CPLEX and two heuristic algorithms in the existing literature.

The characteristic correlation time (CCT) and normalized fluctuations of pulse durations Rp are employed to further explore the coherent resonance behavior of stock market price returns and volatility. Based on the stochastic simulation of the estimated parameters, we can observe the phenomena of coherent resonance-like and anti-coherent resonance in CCT and Rp as a function of long-run variance and amplitude of volatility. We can also observe the critical phenomenon, there is a critical mean reversion of volatility. On both sides of the critical value, the opposite characteristics of coherent and anti-coherent resonance can be observed. The enhanced long-run variance of volatility and weakened amplitude of volatility both cause coherent-like resonance in CCT and Rp vs. the mean reversion of volatility. In addition, it can be seen that the market efficiency is lower when coherent resonance occurs, and higher when anti-coherence resonance occurs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","54","Resonance","Bayesian networks - Commerce - Efficiency - Financial markets - Parameter estimation - Statistical Physics - Stochastic models - Stochastic systems","Bayesian estimations - Coherence resonance - Correlation time - Econophysicss - Stochastic simulations","913.1 Production Engineering - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931.1 Mechanics - 961 Systems Science","Number: 11647078, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 19YJAZH045, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; ","This work was supported by the Ministry of education of Humanities and Social Science project of China (Grant No.: 19YJAZH045), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 11647078) and Yunnan province inclusive finance development and innovation team, PR China. &#9734; This work was supported by the Ministry of education of Humanities and Social Science project of China (Grant No.: 19YJAZH045), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 11647078) and Yunnan province inclusive finance development and innovation team, PR China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the present work, we are the first time to report a label-free fluorescent assay for insulin determination based on the supramolecular recognition between cationic pillar[6]arene (CP6) and insulin. The approach is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) through competitive recognition between CP6 functionalized reduced graphene oxide (CP6@rGO) and probe/insulin molecules. Probe molecule (RhB) has strong fluorescent signal, and its fluorescent is quenched by rGO based on FRET. When target protein molecule (insulin) is added to CP6@rGO, the probe is displaced by insulin and a host-guest complex CP6@rGO/insulin is formed, resulting in a 'turn-on' fluorescence signal. The fluorescence intensity of complex increased linearly with the increase of insulin concentration ranging 0.01–0.50 and 1.0–16.0 μM, respectively with a detection limit of 3 nM. The sensor was successfully utilized to determine insulin in artificial serum. The molecular docking result showed that the N-terminal Phe of insulin's B chain was included in the CP6 cavity through electrostatic interaction and formed a stable host-guest complex. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","49","Insulin","Energy transfer - Forster resonance energy transfer - Graphene - Molecules - Probes - Proteins - Rhodium compounds - Supramolecular chemistry","Cationic pillar[6]arene - Fluorescence intensities - Fluorescence signals - Host guest complexes - Host-guest recognition - Insulin concentrations - Reduced graphene oxides - Supramolecular recognition","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 2018BC005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Key Research and Development Program; Number: C176240209, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018FA005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 21565029, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21764005 , 21565029 ), Key Projects of Yunnan Natural Science Foundation ( 2018FA005 ), Key Research and Development Projects of Yunnan ( 2018BC005 ), Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University ( WX069051 ) and the Program for Donglu Scholars of Yunnan University ( C176240209 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Carbide slag is a by-product generated in the process of acetylene production, and its main components are Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. In this work, CO2 was chemisorbed by CaO solid particles derived from precalcination of inexpensive and widely available carbide slag. The reaction mechanism was investigated by the thermodynamics software-FactSage and by Thermogravimetric Analysis-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA). The study found that the temperature of CO2 capture should be more than 650 °C and lower than 900 °C. Moreover, the carbide slag showed good stability for over 20 cycles of calcination/carbonation. Further, the kinetics of calcination/carbonation were investigated by the Kissinger method, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method and Coats-Redfern method.

In this study, the reflection loss coefficient of paracetamol powder under different temperature, water content, and thickness was calculated based on the principle of electromagnetic wave transmission. The results show that the absorption performance of powder fluctuates dynamically with a series of absorption peaks, and the position of the absorption peak shifts toward the smaller thickness direction as the water content increases or the temperature rises. Because of the influence of the powder thickness on absorbing efficiency, the powder thickness should be adjusted in real time to increase drying efficiency. This study provides the thickness range for which the absorption performance of paracetamol powder under different conditions is over 99%.

In addition, the hardness of the steel subjected to deep cryogenic treatment was higher than that of the non-cryogenically treated one during tempering. The deep cryogenic treatment causes the carbon atoms in the steel to segregate and precipitate as carbides during the tempering process. Compared with the steel without deep cryogenic treatment, the carbon content in the martensite matrix of the steel subjected to deep cryogenic treatment was lower after tempering, which indicated that more carbides were precipitated in the deep cryogenic treated steel during the tempering process.

However, observational studies are still scarce at such background sites. In this study, continuous hourly observations of air pollutants (O3, CO, SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10) and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) were performed for one year (from January 1 to December 31, 2017) at the Gongga Mountain background station (GGS; 101°97′E, 29°55′N; elevation: 3541 m) in southwestern China. The concentrations and variations of these air pollutants and greenhouse gases were determined, and the effect of transboundary atmospheric transport on the air pollution at the study site was investigated. The results showed that the average annual concentrations (mixing ratios) of the O3, CO, SO2, NO2, CO2, CH4, N2O, PM2.5 and PM10 were 74.7 ± 22.0 µg m–3, 0.3 ± 0.2 mg m–3, 0.5 ± 0.6 µg m–3, 1.7 ± 1.3 µg m–3, 406.1 ± 9.5 ppm, 1.941 ± 0.071 ppm, 324.5 ± 14.8 ppb, 6.5 ± 6.2 µg m–3 and 10.6 ± 11.2 µg m–3, respectively. The concentrations (mixing ratios) of the abovementioned substances at the GGS are comparable to those at other background sites in China and around the world. The slight differences among concentrations at different sites may be mainly attributable to the impacts of anthropogenic emissions near the background sites and meteorological conditions. High values of O3 were observed in spring and summer, while SO2 and PM2.5 showed higher concentrations in summer than in autumn. Relatively high CO, NO2 and PM10 values were mostly observed in spring and winter. Relatively low CO2 concentrations were observed in summer due to the vigorous summertime photosynthesis of vegetation. The lowest concentrations for CH4 were recorded in summer, whereas the levels in the other three seasons were similar to each other; by contrast, the highest N2O concentrations were observed in summer due to enhanced microbial activity resulting from high ambient summer temperatures. A diurnal variation in O3 was observed, with early morning minima and afternoon maxima. CO and NO2 displayed higher concentrations in the daytime than in the nighttime. A slight increase in both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations was also recorded in the daytime. These patterns were closely related to scattered anthropogenic emissions and regional atmospheric transport. Nevertheless, CO2 exhibited lower concentrations in the daytime than in the nighttime, although CH4 showed no obvious diurnal variation. The N2O concentration peaked between 10:00 and 12:00 (local time), which can be ascribed to the enhancement of microbial activity due to the increased soil temperature. The results based on the relationship between the wind and the concentrations of air pollutants and greenhouse gases were almost consistent with those based on the potential contribution source function. It appears that O3 and its precursors in parts of Inner Mongolia and Gansu, Ningxia, Sichuan, Chongqing and Hubei Provinces as well as adjacent areas of Hunan, Guizhou and Guangxi Provinces contributed to the increase in O3 at the study site. The potential source areas for CO and SO2 were similar and mainly distributed in India and Pakistan and areas of Inner Mongolia and Gansu and Guizhou Provinces in China. Potential source areas for NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were found in neighboring countries of South Asia in addition to domestic regions, including Inner Mongolia, Gansu Province and the Cheng-Yu economic region. Furthermore, parts of Yunnan Province (China) as well as India and Pakistan were potential source areas for CO2, CH4 and N2O. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","58","Air pollution","Atmospheric movements - Carbon dioxide - Greenhouse effect - Greenhouse gases - Mixing - Nitrogen oxides - Particulate emissions","Air pollutants - Anthropogenic emissions - Atmospheric environment - Atmospheric transport - Background station - Meteorological condition - PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations - Southwestern China","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451 Air Pollution - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: D17110900150000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission; Number: Z171100000617002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission; ","This work was supported by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project (D17110900150000 and Z171100000617002), CAS Key Technology Talent Program and National Research Program for Key Issues in Air Pollution Control (DQGG0101).

The power-to-gas (P2G) energy conversion method provides an effective solution to the energy dilemma in China. Nevertheless, this method requires a high-value chain for application due to its high investment cost at present. Producing, and then selling, hydrogen via electrolyzers is more valuable than storing it for a later generation. The two hydrogen production methods of SMR and electrolysis can be combined with the operation optimization of electrical and natural gas systems to form a flexible energy-use mechanism. A model of the flexible energy-use mechanism is established. The model can be integrated into interdependent natural gas and electricity systems, aiming to alleviate the shortage of natural gas, improve energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions. To demonstrate the economic feasibility and carbon dioxide emissions reduction of the proposed mechanism, a bus-6 power system integrated with a node-6 natural gas system and an IEEE 30-bus system with a modified Belgian 20-node gas system are examined. It is concluded that the proposed flexible energy-use mechanism in the power and natural gas systems has higher economic value and lower carbon emissions than the power-to-hydrogen-to-methane-to-pipeline path. © 2019","37","Gas emissions","Carbon dioxide - Economic analysis - Electrolytic cells - Emission control - Energy conversion - Energy efficiency - Gas plants - Global warming - Hydrogen production - Investments - Methane - Natural gas - Natural gasoline plants - Scheduling - Steam reforming","Carbon dioxide emissions - Day-ahead scheduling - Economic feasibilities - Electrolyzers - Energy use - Hydrogen production method - Natural gas systems - Operation optimization","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 513.2 Petroleum Refineries - 522 Gas Fuels - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 912.2 Management","Number: YNKJXM20180254, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Hubei Electric Power Research Institute; ","This work was supported by Electric Power Research Institute of Yunan Power Grid Company , P.R.

This study demonstrates that a continuously accelerated ZVI corrosion driven by depositing copper on the ZVI surface to form a Fe–Cu galvanic cell system, thereby increasing the ZVI corrosion rate and arsenic removal rate. Experimental studies showed that ZVI simply coupled with CuSO4 resulted in almost complete arsenic remove in waste acid within 30 min under the experimental conditions of an iron-to-arsenic molar ratio of 6, a CuSO4 concentration of 0.5 g/L, and a reaction temperature of 35 °C. Under the optimal conditions, the concentration of arsenic in waste acid decreased from 525 mg/L to 1.04 mg/L, and the arsenic removal rate reached 99.8%. Products such as magnetite and As2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction analyses, while As(III), Fe(III), Fe(II), and Cu0 were detected on the surface of these corrosion products through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. During ZVI surface corrosion accelerated by the Fe–Cu galvanic cell system, copper plays a continuous and stable activation (overcoming iron passivation) on the ZVI surface. A large amount of fresh and reactive magnetite and hydroxyl radicals was continuously generated, and arsenic was effectively removed through various mechanisms such as adsorption and precipitation. Thus, a simple combination of ZVI and CuSO4 could remove arsenic from waste acid quickly and efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","49","Chemicals removal (water treatment)","Arsenic - Arsenic compounds - Copper compounds - Copper corrosion - Corrosion rate - Electrochemical cells - Galvanic corrosion - Heavy metals - Iron compounds - Magnetite - Molar concentration - Molar ratio - Pollution control - X ray diffraction analysis - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Corrosion products - Experimental conditions - Galvanic cells - Hydroxyl radicals - Optimal conditions - Reaction temperature - Waste acids - Zerovalent irons","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 539.1 Metals Corrosion - 702.1 Electric Batteries - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 2017FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; ","This work was supported by a Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Key Project (No. 2017FA026).
