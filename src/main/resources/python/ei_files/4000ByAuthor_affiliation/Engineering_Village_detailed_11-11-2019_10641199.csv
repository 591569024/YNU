The effects of temperature and frequency on the dielectric constant, dielectric loss factor, loss tangent, and penetration depth were studied. The results indicate that spent automobile catalyst is weakly polar, making it difficult to transform electromagnetic energy into heat. The relaxation time and conductivity obtained by numerical calculations further explain from the microlevel that spent automobile catalyst cannot dissipate electromagnetic energy through dipole loss or conduction loss under microwave irradiation.

In order to explore the differences of travel behavior among private bicycle (PB), public bicycle sharing (PBS) and FFBS, a survey was conducted in Kunming, China in 2018. Firstly, the differences of travel characteristics among these three modes were analyzed based on 522 valid questionnaires. Then, a multinomial logistic model was applied to explore the influential factors among them. The results show that: 1) PB and FFBS are more attractive for long-distance travel enthusiasts compared with PBS, PB is rarely used for transfer in suburbs while FFBS is the most desirable in connecting other travel modes. The theft problem and high maintenance costs are main obstacles for PB. 2) The elderly, high-income and non-student groups in inflexible travel activities show a preference for PBS, while the young, low-income and student groups in flexible travel demands have a tendency towards FFBS. 3) PB and PBS imped the use of FFBS to a certain extent, while PB seems to have less impact on PBS. 4) FFBS is desirable in temporary travel demand while PBS is more preferable in fixed demand. Interestingly, residents with registered permanent residence tend to use PBS while those without registered permanent residence prefer FFBS. Finally, several management strategies and policy recommendations were proposed for the government and FFBS enterprises to improve the management of bicycles. © 2019, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","46","Bicycles","Motor transportation - Surveys","Characteristic difference - Influential factors - Multinomial logistics - Policy recommendations - preferences","432.2 Passenger Highway Transportation",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Furthermore, we studied the correlations between the power stability of the multi-send HVDC systems and the effective short circuit ratio, revealed the relations between the power stability of the multi-send HVDC systems and the influence factor, and put forward an evaluation criterion for stable operation of the multi-send HVDC systems. The analyses show that the sending HVDC systems are hard to maintain stable operation when their MIESCRs are less than 1.2 and the sending HVDC systems can maintain high power stability margin when their MIESCRs are greater than 2.0.

To a leaderless team with homogeneous space-based robots, a multirobot controller architecture is proposed in which information flow is included. For each robot, there are two coupled feedback loops with different control objectives. One feedback loop is for guidance and is designed so that each robot can rapidly maneuver and rendezvous at the target point in a neighboring orbit. The other feedback loop is for formation control and is designed so that all robots in the group maintain a desired formation during a maneuver. A modified linear quadratic regulator method is used to design the guidance and control laws, where separate performance indexes are used for the two loops. By analyzing the interaction between the formation control and the maneuver guidance, a new restriction on the communication topology is proposed. An estimator for the state of the formation center is included in this control loop, and to guarantee a consensus on the formation center state estimates among all of the robots, a distributed Kalman filter based on the consensus algorithm is developed.

The Ni(CH3COO)2-containing activator is used in the pretreatment process and the effects of CrCl3 concentration, ChCl-EG concentration, temperature, ZTA concentration, and deposition times on the plating process are investigated systematically. The results show that the formation of Ni active sites on ZTA surface by Ni(CH3COO)2 activation pretreatment can efficiently simplify operation and lower cost compared with the SnCl2 sensitization-AgNO3 activation method.

Here we present the first high-resolution clay mineral record combined with Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from a 300-m long sediment core recovered in the western South Yellow Sea. Our study suggests that large-scale transgression in the Yellow Sea occurred after ∼0.8 Ma, possibly related to tectonic subsidence of eastern China coast and the Min-Zhe Uplift. In contrast, the sedimentary environment of Bohai and Yellow Seas was mainly dominated by fluvial/lacustrine deposits at 3.5–0.8 Ma. Provenance analysis suggests a major change in sediment provenance from the Yangtze River to the Yellow River at ∼0.8 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of the final integration of the Yellow River in its present form. At the same time the major channels of the Yangtze River migrated from the South Yellow Sea to the modern Yangtze River delta due to the subsidence of east China coast. The consistence in timing of the provenance transition and large-scale regional marine transgression suggests that tectonic deformation, rather than climate change, is the first-order control on the evolution of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers and sedimentary environmental change in the Bohai and Yellow Seas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","104","Climate change","Binary alloys - Clay minerals - Deformation - Isotopes - Neodymium alloys - Rivers - Sedimentology - Sediments - Strontium alloys - Subsidence - Tectonics","Huanghe - Provenance - Quaternary - Sr-Nd isotopes - Yellow sea","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals","Number: 41576034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41622603, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: GASI-GEOGE-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction; Number: U1606401, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the Chinese Continental Shelf Drilling Program and the scientific party and technicians of Core CSDP-1 for recovering the samples.

A reasonable resource allocation is a key factor impacting on the energy efficiency of a system. Existing scheduling mechanisms in Map Reduce environments focus on the fair sharing of cluster resources among multiple users, allocated resources and scheduled jobs by a priority-based strategy. However, such mechanisms have little awareness of users' SLA (Service-Level Agreement). It is difficult to map the user's SLA to a certain priority. Additionally, they can't be sensitive to the energy-efficiency changes while a cluster is running and a work is going. Also users' SLA cannot be satisfied accurately and effectively. In this paper, an energy-efficiency-aware scheduling mechanism of a virtual resource for a big data application is addressed.

The surface tension test and low-temperature rheological property test were carried out to evaluate the adhesion of sulfate-incorporated asphalt mastic. Rapid freezing and thawing test with different concentrations of sulfate solution was conducted to explore the effect of sulfate concentrations and freeze-thaw cycles on the softening point and force ductility of matrix asphalt. Phases of the asphalt binder were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results show that sulfate has a negative impact on the road performance of the asphalt binder. Internal sulfate erosion decreased the adhesion of the asphalt binder. Also, the low-temperature rheological property of asphalt binder was deteriorated. After the freeze-thaw cycles of external sulfate erosion, softening point and tensile force peak of matrix asphalt increased and the low-temperature ductility decreased. The main reason of performance deterioration of the asphalt binder is the 'salt aging' effect causing by sulfate erosion.

In many ecosystems, some species have been shown to be non-segmented (NS species). However, it is unclear whether drought-induced mortality is related to VS. To understand this, we surveyed the mortality and recruitment rate and measured the hydraulic traits of leaves and stems as well as the photosynthesis of six tree species over five years (2012-2017) in a savanna ecosystem in Southwest China. Our results showed that the NS species exhibited a higher mortality rate than the co-occurring VS species. Across species, the mortality rate was not correlated with xylem tension at 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity (P50stem), but was rather significantly correlated with leaf water potential at 50% loss of leaf hydraulic conductance (P50leaf) and the difference in water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductance between the leaves and terminal stems (P50leaf-stem). The NS species had higher Huber values and maximum net photosynthetic rates based on leaf area, which compensated for a higher mortality rate and promoted rapid regeneration under the conditions of dry-wet cycles. To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the difference in drought-induced mortality between NS species and VS species. Our results emphasize the importance of VS in maintaining hydraulic safety in VS species. Furthermore, the high mortality rate and fast regeneration in NS species may be another hydraulic strategy in regions where severe seasonal droughts are frequent. © 2019 by the authors.","62","Population statistics","Drought - Ecosystems - Hydraulic conductivity - Plants (botany) - Reforestation","Hydraulic conductance - Hydraulic failure - Leaf water potential - Net photosynthetic rate - Rapid regeneration - Recruitment rates - Savanna ecosystems - Seasonal droughts","444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 632.1 Hydraulics","Number: 31600479, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31870385, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41861144016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600479; 31870385; 41861144016), the CAS Scholarship for visiting research (No. 2018-24), and the CAS "Light ofWest China" Program to Shubin Zhang.

As some image sensors need certain vacant time between two integrations, this assumption makes it somehow unrealistic to perform one measurement within a modulation period. Addressing this problem we investigated the four-integrating-bucket method with a shortened exposure time. We assume Ts to be any value between 0 and Tc/4 such that there would be some time between two adjacent integrations and the measurement can be fulfilled in one modulation period. The optimum modulation depth and phase offset of the sinusoidal modulation are deduced for different Ts by minimizing xthe phase noise induced by additive noise. It is found that the optimum modulation depth is always around 2.45 whatever the value of Ts is. What is more, decreasing the integration time to less than Tc/4 helps to improve the fringe visibility as well and to further reduce the phase noise by up to 2.5 dB at most, which are demonstrated by both simulation and experiment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","14","Interferometry","Additive noise - Modulation - Phase noise - Visibility","Fringe visibilities - Integrating buckets - Integration time - Modulation period - Phase shifting Interferometry - Sinusoidal modulation - Sinusoidal phase modulation - Surface profile measurements","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703 Electric Circuits - 741.2 Vision - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: 17JCQNJC01100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; Number: 2016QNRC001, Acronym: CAST, Sponsor: China Association for Science and Technology; Number: 2017YFF0204800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 51775377, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61501319, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61505140, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Key Research and Development Plan, China (2017YFF0204800), National Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 61501319, 51775377 and 61505140), Tianjin Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 17JCQNJC01100), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (No. 2016QNRC001).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The proximity between instances is defined by a distance threshold given by the user in traditional spatial co-location pattern mining. However, the user doesn't know which distance threshold is appropriate in most cases, even for experts. Besides, different densities of instance distribution are not considered in a dataset when using a unified distance threshold to measure the proximity. Also, global topological relations of instances are ignored in mining. In this paper, we consider the global topological relations by constructing Delaunay triangulation of spatial instances and calculate a distance constraint for each instance based on the constructed Delaunay triangulation. We redefine the proximity of instances according to the distance constraint so that users don't have to worry about giving an appropriate distance threshold when mining prevalent co-location patterns. We propose a new algorithm PTB based on a proximity relationship tree P-Tree which stores the proximity relationships between instances. The experimental evaluation of several real-world datasets shows that our algorithm can get better results. We also evaluate each parameter and the number of features and instances affecting the efficiency of the algorithm by using synthetic datasets. © 2019 IEEE.","13","Data mining","Clustering algorithms - Forestry - Information management - Location - Topology - Trees (mathematics) - Triangulation","Appropriate distances - Co-location patterns - Delau-nay triangulations - Distance constraints - Experimental evaluation - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining - Topological relations","405.3 Surveying - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Genome editing is now developing rapidly due to the precision and efficiency offered by engineered site-specific endonuclease-based systems, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) system. It has been demonstrated that these programmable nucleases can introduce genetic changes in embryos from many species including NHPs. In 2014, we reported the first genetic editing of macaques using TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9. Subsequently, we characterized the phenotype of a methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2)-mutant cynomolgus monkey model of Rett syndrome generated using the TALEN approach. These efforts not only accelerated the advance of modeling genetic diseases in NHPs, but also encouraged us to develop specific gene knock-in monkeys. In this study, we assess the possibility of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene replacement using TALENs in monkeys, and generate preimplantation embryos carrying an EmGFP fluorescent reporter constructed in the OCT4 gene. Result: We assembled a pair of TALENs specific to the first exon of the OCT4 gene and constructed a donor vector consisting of the homology arms cloned from the monkey genome DNA, flanking an EmGFP cassette. Next, we co-injected the TALENs-coding plasmid and donor plasmid into the cytoplasm of 122 zygotes 6-8 h after fertilization. Sequencing and immunofluorescence revealed that the OCT4-EmGFP knock-in allele had been successfully generated by TALENs-mediated HR at an efficiency of 11.3% (7 out of 62) or 11.1% (1 out of 9), respectively, in monkey embryos. Conclusion: We have successfully, for the first time, obtained OCT4-EmGFP knock-in monkey embryos via HR mediated by TALENs. Our results suggest that gene targeting through TALEN-assisted HR is a useful approach to introduce precise genetic modification in NHPs. © 2019 The Author(s).","39","Transcription","Cloning - Cytology - DNA - Efficiency - Fluorescence - Physiological models - Proteins","Fluorescent reporter - Genetic modifications - Homologous recombination - Non-human primate - Physiological functions - Pre-implantation embryos - TALENs - Transcription activators","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The first step of the proposed method is to extract the valuable features of the IR images based on frequency tuned based- LRR (FT-LRR) algorithm aims to separate the corresponding salient regions and backgrounds. Furthermore, we adopt a choose-maximum rule to retain the significance information of the source images to the maximum extent for the salient region. For the background, IR and VI images are decomposed into a low-pass coefficient and a series of high-pass coefficients using non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST). Then, the TV model is utilized to fuse the low-pass coefficient, in the meanwhile, the modified average gradient (MAG) is used to stimulate the S-DPCNN which aims to fuse high-pass coefficients. The fused background is obtained by taking inverse NSST. Finally, the robust fused image is generated by adding the fused salient region and background. Large amounts of experiment results and metrics demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits good visual performance and has obvious superiorities over other state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","22","Image fusion","Infrared imaging - Inverse problems - Neural networks","Information redundancies - Infrared and visible image - Low-rank representations - Pulse coupled neural network - Shearlet transforms - State-of-the-art methods - Subjective and objective evaluations - Total variation","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 746 Imaging Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

If the competence level or the 'reputation,' which can be explained as the probabilities of annotating the right label, for each crowdsourcing annotators is equal and biased to annotate the right label, majority voting (MV) is the optimal decision rule for merging the multiple labels into a single reliable one. However, in practice, the competence levels of annotators employed by the crowdsourcing labeling systems are often diverse very much. In these cases, weighted MV is more preferred. The weights should be determined by the competence levels. However, since the annotators are anonymous and the ground-truth labels are usually unknown, it is hard to compute the competence levels of the annotators directly. In this paper, we propose to learn the weights for weighted MV by exploiting the expertise of annotators. Specifically, we model the domain knowledge of different annotators with different distributions and treat the crowdsourcing problem as a domain adaptation problem. The annotators provide labels to the source domains and the target domain is assumed to be associated with the ground-truth labels. The weights are obtained by matching the source domains with the target domain. Although the target-domain labels are unknown, we prove that they could be estimated under mild conditions. Both theoretical and empirical analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Large performance gains are shown for specific data sets. © 2012 IEEE.","66","Crowdsourcing","Job analysis - Labeling - Learning systems - Personnel training - Reliability - Reliability analysis","Domain knowledge - Majority voting - Noise measurements - Task analysis - Theoretical guarantees",,"Number: 2016B010108010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Technology Talent Program; Number: [2017]476, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JSGG20160229115709109, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61572486, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received July 13, 2017; revised December 7, 2017 and April 5, 2018; accepted May 10, 2018.

Particular attention has been paid to mycobacteriophage-derived endolysin proteins. We herein characterized a small mycobacteriophage-derived peptide designated AK15 with potent anti-M. tb activity. AK15 adopted cationic amphiphilic α-helical structure, and on the basis of this structure, we designed six isomers with increased hydrophobic moment by rearranging amino acid residues of the helix. We found that one of these isomers, AK15-6, exhibits enhanced anti-mycobacterial efficiency. Both AK15 and AK15-6 directly inhibited M. tb by trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) binding and membrane disruption. They both exhibited bactericidal activity, cell selectivity, and synergistic effects with rifampicin, and neither induced drug resistance to M. tb. They efficiently attenuated mycobacterial load in the lungs of M. tb-infected mice. We observed that lysine, arginine, tryptophan, and an α-helix are key structural requirements for their direct anti-mycobacterial action. Of note, they also exhibited immunomodulatory effects, including inhibition of proinflammatory response in TDM-stimulated or M. tb-infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and M.tb-infected mice and induction of only a modest level of cytokine (tumor necrosis factorα (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) production in murine BMDMs and a T-cell cytokine (interferin- γ (IFN-γ) and TNF-α) response in murine lung and spleen. In summary, characterization of a small mycobacteriophage- derived peptide and its improved isomer revealed that both efficiently restrain M. tb infection via dual mycobactericidal- immunoregulatory activities.

To explain the evolution of the Jinsha drainage basin, most researchers have considered that the present-day Jinsha (the upper reach of the Yangtze) was once a tributary of a single, southward-flowing river system called the Paleo-Red River, which drained into the South China Sea and was captured by the Upper Yangtze River, after which the flow direction changed to eastwards. The sudden disappearance, at 5.5 Ma, of the Red River submarine fan, which was fed primarily by the Paleo-Red River system, provides an important chronological constraint on the drainage reorganization and the capture event. However, until now, no geomorphic evidence has been presented to support this hypothesized age. Considering this problem, nine well-preserved terraces (T9 to T1) at Jinjiangjie in the Middle Jinsha River were evaluated in this study. To establish the chronological framework of these terraces, a combined dating approach was employed, incorporating electron spin resonance dating, cosmogenic nuclide (26Al/10Be) burial dating, and optically stimulated luminescence dating. We obtained a complete chronological sequence for terraces T9–T1, with ages of approximately 1.07 (T9), 0.70 (T8), 0.65 (T7), 0.51 (T6), 0.47(T5), 0.44(T4), 0.30 (T3), 0.18 (T2), and 0.047 (T1) Ma, respectively. Constrained by this framework, we calculated an average long-term fluvial incision rate of ~147 mm/ka. The reconstruction of the paleo-topography and paleo-drainage, based on digital elevation model data for the re-filling of the deeply incised river valley, indicates that the present drainage pattern in the Middle Jinsha system was established after the disruption of the paleo-landscape surface at an elevation of ~2000 m above sea level. The age of the present-day Middle Jinsha drainage was determined at approximately 5.5 Ma by extrapolating the average valley incision rate, suggesting that the present-day Jinsha was formed at about this time. Our results agree with the previously estimated timing of the disappearance of the Red River submarine fan. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","62","Rivers","Catchments - Luminescence - Magnetic moments - Sea level - Submarines - Topography","Chronological sequences - Cosmogenic nuclides - Digital elevation model data - Electron spin resonance dating - Fluvial terraces - Incision rates - Jinjiangjie - Optically stimulated luminescence","471.1 Oceanography, General - 672.1 Combat Naval Vessels - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 41001010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41462007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41762014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to Prof. David for his excellent editorial work and help to this manuscript.

Lots of co-location pattern mining approaches have been proposed, but they often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result, the interesting pattern which involves spatial features with significantly different for the number of instances cannot be captured. In this paper, we are committed to address the problem of mining co-location patterns from the spatial database with rare features. Specifically, we first propose a new interest measure, namely the weighted participation index. This interest measure is related to the distribution of the number of instances for spatial features, and it has ability to capture the prevalent co-location patterns with or without rare features. Furthermore, we prove that the weighted participation index possesses the approximate monotonicity property, which can be utilized to improve the computational efficiency, and thereby an efficient algorithm is developed. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our approach is effective, efficient and scalable for mining co-location patterns embedded in the spatial database with rare features. © 2019 IEEE.","30","Location","Computational efficiency - Data mining - Database systems - Information management","Co-location patterns - Effective approaches - Monotonicity property - Participation index - Spatial data mining - Spatial database - Spatial dependencies - Spatial features","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.3 Database Systems",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although the presence of caffeine in tea plants has been identified, the molecular mechanisms regulating relevant caffeine metabolism remain unclear. For the elucidation of the caffeine biosynthesis and catabolism in Camellia plants, fresh, germinated leaves from four Camellia plants with low (2), normal (1), and high (1) caffeine concentrations, namely, low-caffeine tea 1 (LCT1, Camellia crassicolumna), low-caffeine tea 2 (LCT2, C. crassicolumna), Shuchazao (SCZ, C. sinensis), and Yunkang 43 (YK43, C. sinensis) were used in this research. Transcriptome and purine alkaloids analyses of these Camellia leaves were performed using RNA-Seq and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Moreover, 15N-caffeine tracing was performed to determine the metabolic fate of caffeine in leaves of these plants. Caffeine content was correlated with related gene expression levels, and a quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR analysis of specific genes showed a consistent tendency with the obtained transcriptomic analysis. On the basis of the results of stable isotope-labeled tracer experiments, we discovered a degradation pathway of caffeine to theobromine. These findings could assist researchers in understanding the caffeine-related mechanisms in Camellia plants containing low, normal, and high caffeine content and be applied to caffeine regulation and breeding improvement in future research. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","62","Caffeine","Binary alloys - Biochemistry - Gene expression - Liquid chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolism - Physiology - Plants (botany) - Polymerase chain reaction - Potassium alloys - RNA - Yttrium alloys","Camellia plants - catechins - Degradation pathways - Differentially expressed gene - Gene expression levels - Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry - Metabolic products - Molecular mechanism",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XRD data confirmed presence of silver at A sites (La3+/Ca2+/Sr2+) as Ag+ and segregates at grain boundaries (GBs) to form metallic silver. The electrical properties greatly improved by adding Ag2O. Significant enhancements in peak temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) at room–temperature (300 K) were observed for LCSMO:xAg2O composites. The peak TCR increased from 3.7% K−1 (299.3 K, for x = 0) to 14.8% K−1 (301.0 K, for x = 0.2), and MR rose from 16.9% (303.0 K, for x = 0) to 34.1% (300.6 K, for x = 0.2). These improvements in peak TCR were attributed to increased grain size and formation of metallic silver at GBs or within the composites. Moreover, peak MR was higher in Ag2O doped composites, which was mainly due to large spin polarization effect and strong coupling ferromagnetic domains under external magnetic field. Overall, the large room-temperature TCR and MR values of LCSMO:0.2Ag2O composites look promising for future advanced uncooling infrared bolometers and magnetic sensors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","39","Temperature","Bolometers - Grain boundaries - Infrared detectors - Magnetic sensors - Magnetoresistance - Manganese oxide - Photoelectron spectroscopy - Scanning electron microscopy - Silver - Silver oxides - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Spin polarization","Ferromagnetic domains - Large rooms - Metallic silver - Peak temperatures - Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) - Strong coupling - Temperature coefficient of resistivity - Under external magnetic field","547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.3 Glass - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11674135, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11674135), the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology, and the Innovation Training Program for College Students (Grant no. 20180179).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

While the spatial variability is attributed to differences in climatic setting and sensitivity of these glaciers to climate change, an assessment of these factors to date has only been performed on a small sample of glaciers and a small set of climate perturbation scenarios. To advance the assessment to larger datasets, we first reconstruct the time series of reference-surface mass balance for 1952-2014 periods using an empirical model calibrated with observed mass balance from 45 glaciers across the HMA. Forcing the model with a set of independent stepwise changes of temperature (±0.5 K to ±6 K) and precipitation (±5% to ±30%), we assess the reference-surface mass balance sensitivity of each glacier in the sample. While the relationship between the change in mass balance and the change in precipitation is linear, the relationship with the change in temperature is non-linear. Spatial heterogeneity in the simulated mass balance sensitivities is attributed to differences in climatic setting, elevation, and the sensitivity of mass-balance profile (gradient) to changes in temperature and precipitation. While maritime and low-lying continental glaciers show high sensitivity to temperature changes and display a uniform mass-balance sensitivity with elevation, the high-lying continental glaciers show high sensitivity to precipitation changes and display a non-uniform mass-balance sensitivity with elevation. Our analysis reveals the dominant drivers of spatial variability in the mass balance sensitivity across the region: temperature as a single driver for maritime glaciers, and a superposition of temperature, precipitation seasonality, and snow/rain differentiation for continental glaciers. Finally, a set of sensitivity tests with perturbed model parameters confirms the robustness of our results. The model's ability and robustness to resolve spatial patterns in the sensitivities and their drivers implies that simple modeling approaches remain a powerful tool for analyzing glacier response to climate change in HMA. © 2019 by the authors.","70","Climate change","Climate models - Landforms","Glacier mass balance - High mountains - Mass balance - Precipitation change - Sensitivity tests - Spatial heterogeneity - Spatial variability - Surface mass balance","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 481.1 Geology - 921 Mathematics","Number: 41671057, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41761144075, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: YJRC3201702, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","This research was funded by the Fundamental Program from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST) (grant No. 2013FY111400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41761144075), Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZZD-EW-12-1 and XDA19070501), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 41671057), the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant No. 131C11KYSB20160061), as well as Yunnan University (YJRC3201702), grants for the development of world class Yunnan University.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, the classification and regression of supervised learning is used to model and analyze multi-dimensional cloud resource allocation, for the different scale of problem, three resource allocation predict algorithms based on linear regression, logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are proposed.

However, the application of machine learning as a potential alternative for the traditional data structures, especially using deep learning, is a relatively new and largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network-based learned inverted index, called Pavo, to efficiently and flexibly organize inverted data. The basic hash function in the traditional inverted index is replaced by a hierarchical neural network, which makes Pavo be able to well adapt for various data distributions while showing lower collision rate as well as higher space utilization rate. A particular feature of our approach is that a novel unsupervised learning strategy to construct the hash function is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no similar results, in which the unsupervised learning strategy is employed to design hash functions, in the existing literature. Extensive experimental results show that the unsupervised model owns some advantages than the supervised one. Our approaches not only demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning-based data structures for index purpose but also provide benefits for developers to make more accurate decisions on both the design and the configuration of data organization, operation, and parameters tuning of neural network so as to improve the performance of information searching. © 2013 IEEE.","17","Long short-term memory","Big data - Data structures - Deep learning - Hash functions - Indexing (of information) - Unsupervised learning","Data distribution - Data organization - Hierarchical neural networks - Information searching - Learning Index - LSTM - Parameters tuning - Space utilization",,"Number: 2017HC012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team; Number: 61762092, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61762089, Grant 61663047, Grant 61863036, and Grant 61762092, and in part by the Science and Technology Innovation Team Project of Yunnan Province under Grant 2017HC012.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The precipitated B-bearing particles, i.e., ZrBx, were determined to be ZrB2 via electron probe microanalysis. The composition of the Al-Si alloy, which could form stable ZrB2 particles, was determined by measuring and calculating the equilibrium concentrations of Zr and B and the solubility products of ZrB2 in a Si-saturated Al-Si alloy at different temperatures. Thereafter, the segregation coefficients of B between solid Si crystals and the Si-saturated Al-Si melt with and without Zr addition were estimated thermodynamically. The mechanism whereby the B removal from Si was enhanced with Zr addition was as follows: The Zr not only reduced the concentration of B in the molten Al-Si but also significantly reduced the segregation coefficient of B between the solid Si and Si-saturated Al-Si melt. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","33","Aluminum alloys","Electron probe microanalysis - Segregation (metallography) - Silicon alloys - Solar cells - Thermodynamics - Zirconium","Al-Si alloy - Equilibrium concentration - Segregation coefficients - Si crystals - So-g si - Solubility product - Thermodynamic studies - ZrB2","531.2 Metallography - 541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 702.3 Solar Cells - 801 Chemistry",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and elemental analysis were used for further characterization. The results showed that: the thermal stability of hemicellulose was the worst, while that of cellulose was higher with a narrow range of pyrolysis temperatures. Lignin decomposed over a wider range of temperatures and generated a higher char yield. After catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 catalyst, the conversion ratio increased. The ratio for the three components was in the following order: lignincellulose biomass(15.41%) > lignin (14.75%) > cellulose (6.73%). The pyrolysis of cellulose gave the highest yield of bio-oil rich in levoglucosan and other anhydrosugars with minimal coke formation. Xylan gave a high gas yield and moderate yield of bio-oil rich in furfural, while lignin gave the highest solid residue and produced the lowest yield of bio-oil that was rich in phenolic compounds. After catalytic pyrolysis, xylan gave the highest yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 76.40%, and showed selectivity for benzene and toluene. Cellulose showed higher selectivity for xylene and naphthalene; however, lignin showed enhanced for selectivity of C10 + polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, catalytic pyrolysis method can effectively improve the properties of bio-oil and bio-char. © 2018 Energy Institute","64","Pyrolysis","Activation energy - Aromatization - Biofuels - Biomass - Cellulose - Characterization - Chemical reactors - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Hydrocarbons - Kinetics - Lignin - Mineral oils - Naphthalene - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Reaction kinetics - Thermodynamic stability - Toluene","Activation energies (Ea) - Biomass models - Catalytic pyrolysis - Fixed bed reactor - Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Pyrolysis temperature - Thermochemical behavior - Thermogravimetric analyzers","513.3 Petroleum Products - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018JS325, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2018FB071, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31670599, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Department of Yunnan Province (Award No. 2018FB071 ); the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Project Foundation (Award No. 2018JS325 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Award No. 31670599 ).

This process also is involved in cancer progression and prognosis. The potential of APA events as novel prognostic biomarkers has been suggested. CCND2 gene, which is overexpressed in various cancer tissues, tends to utilize the proximal APA site and produces a more prominent mRNA isoform with shorter 3’ untranslated region in the cancer cells. In this study, an ultrasensitive detection for CCND2 APA was successfully achieved using electrochemical biosensors constructed by gold nanoparticles-Fe3O4 nanocomposite and p-sulfonated calix[8]arene functionalized reduced graphene oxide as nanocarriers. The detection ranges of CCND2-S and CCND2-L by the constructed biosensors were 10−18–10−11 and 10−17–10−11 M, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of CCND2-S was 0.176 aM (the RNA concentration at the single-cell level). To the best of our knowledge, this value was the lowest LOD among the reported non-coding RNA detection. In real samples, the results of the electrochemical detection using the constructed biosensors showed that the lung cancer cell H292 expressed considerably higher CCND2-S than CCND2-L. This result was in agreement with those obtained by RT-qPCR method. The electrochemical method had showed simpler operation, accurate quantitation, faster detection, and cheaper supplies compared with traditional methods. Therefore, this technology not only provides an ultrasensitive and feasible method for APA detection, but can also be applied in the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer progression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","47","Chemical detection","Biosensors - Cytology - Diseases - Fiber optic sensors - Genes - Gold nanoparticles - Graphene - Iron oxides - Magnetite - Metal nanoparticles - Nanometals - Nucleic acids - Oncogenic viruses - Polymerase chain reaction - RNA","Calix[8]arene - Electrochemical biosensor - Non-coding RNAs - Polyadenylation - Single-cell level","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2018BC005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Key Research and Development Program; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 2018FA005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21565029, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21764005 , 21565029 , 31760311 ), Key Projects of Yunnan Natural Science Foundation ( 2018FA005 ), Key Research and Development Projects of Yunnan ( 2018BC005 ), Program for Excellent Young Talents , and Yunnan University and the Program for Donglu Scholars, Yunnan University .

However, the relationship between the numerical simulation and actual heat transfer process is still unclear. This work compares the simulated average temperature of two different phase change materials (PCMs) with experimental result at different operation conditions for the purpose of developing a temperature correction model. A novel empirical heat transfer model is then established to improve the simulation accuracy of PCM-based solar thermal systems. The contributions of this work include that (1) the system performance could be evaluated by the proposed empirical heat transfer model under sunny and cloudy weather conditions; (2) two PCMs (i.e., PCM1 and PMC2) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed empirical heat transfer model. The analysis results demonstrate that (a) during solar irradiation variations, the temperature of the latent heat storage tank is much more stable than that of the sensible heat storage tank; (b) the heat transfer power and heat storage amount of PCM1 per unit mass are less than that of the heat transfer oil, while the observations on PCM2 are as opposed to these obtained from PCM1; (c) there is a critical time/temperature for switching the operation mode of the heat storage between different weather conditions; (d) under the conditions of low temperature, low solar radiation intensity and short-time heat storage, LHTES may prefer to perform sensible heat storage rather than latent heat storage, and vice versa.

In order to take advantage of the line commutated converter based HVDC earlier, a method for rapid reconfiguration of local networks that supports LCC- HVDC startup in receiving-end system was proposed in this paper. By this method, the system strength of reconfiguration network can rapidly meet the start-up requirements of LCC-HVDC in the shortest time. Firstly, based on the branch addition method, it was quantitatively analyzed that the main factors affecting the system strength in system restoration are generator parallel and transmission line restoration. Taking generators and branches as decision variables, a combinatorial optimization model for reconfiguration of a local network supporting LCC-HVDC startup was proposed. Then, an improved multi-objective differential evolution algorithm was used to solve this model and the optimal local reconfiguration network is obtained. In this algorithm, two modification operations of network reduction and loop addition were proposed to speed up network restoration, increase the system strength and improve the optimization speed of the algorithm. The IEEE 39 bus system and a provincial power gird of China are employed to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed method. © 2019 Chin. Soc. for Elec.

Based on the complex permittivity and permeability results, the Reflection loss (RL) of the Fe3O4/Fe/C composites were calculated. The Fe3O4/Fe/C composites show a RL peak of −51.3 dB for a 2 mm thick positioned at 17.2 GHz frequency. When the absorber thickness was adjusted to 2.3 mm, the effective adsorption bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) is 5.6 GHz (12.4–18 GHz) frequency. Simultaneously, the RL peak of the absorber still reaches −40.8 dB at 14.7 GHz frequency. The RL peak is explained using the quarter-wave cancellation model. The microwave absorption behavior of Fe3O4/Fe/C composites can be attributed to the reasonable impedance matching and the existence of interfaces around the composites.

And this so-called 'weak interaction' has long been studied extensively. Thanks to its unique orientation and specificity of bonding, hydrogen bonding effect can regulate molecular aggregation perfectly, which has been widely applied in synthesis of crystal materials. Especially, the hydrogen bonds formed with the assist of ion or charge, namely the charge-assisted hydrogen bonds (CAHB), exhibit a binding strength stronger than ordinary hydrogen bond, and equivalent to covalent bond, which has aroused numerous interests of researchers. Different from ordinary hydrogen bonds, there is a charge distribution between the two substances that form the CAHB. Actually, just the distribution of charge in a given resonance structure dominant the formation of the relatively strong CAHB. In addition, there is also Coulomb interaction between the amphoteric ion component and the carrier carrying the opposite charge. The existence of two energy-equivalent valence bond resonance forms result in the stronger binding CAHB. Specifically, (+)CAHB is formed between the positive charge on the proton donor atom; and (-)CAHB is formed between the formal negative charge on the proton accepting group. It has been also found that CAHB, as a kind of low-resistance hydrogen bond or a salt bridge similar to a cation bridge, is ubiquitous in environmental processes. They possess not only bonding strength much stronger than ordinary hydrogen bonds, but also characteristics similar to covalent bonds, which is beneficial to the self-assembly process of many environmental media. The super macromolecular structure formed by CAHB is the main form of natural organic matter (NOM) in the environment. Adsorption is commonly used to remove the dissociable amphoteric organic pollutants in water environments. The electrostatic interaction between carbon-based adsorbents and ionic compounds may be the main adsorption mechanism for the removal of these ionic compounds. However, a number of other studies have noted that individual electrostatic interaction alone is not able to explain the effect of pH on the adsorption of dissociated ionic contaminants. Apparently, there exists additional physical or chemical interaction mechanisms that need to be further investigated. While CAHB can be well used to explain some abnormal phenomena in adsorption experiments, such as the strong interaction between the negatively charged adsorbates and the adsorbents. In this article, the key formation mechanism of CAHB in the environment and their environmental effects are summarized. Combining with some experimental data, the important mechanism of natural organic matter (including humic substances and dissolved organic matter) conjugating and forming supramolecules via CAHB is discussed with emphasis.

Benefiting from its layered structure and efficient electron transport channels, Sn-PMA electrodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1567 mAh g−1, at 100 mA g−1, and maintained a reversible capacity of 707 mAh g−1, at 800 mA g−1, after 400 cycles. Furthermore, the detailed post-electrochemical structural, morphological and compositional analysis is carried out to unveil the structural changes and Li-ion storage mechanism of electrodes. Ex-situ XRD and XPS results revealed that, in Sn-PMA electrode, O atom, coordinated to the Sn atom, exhibited higher electronegativity, served as major Li-ion storage site and rendered excellent cyclic stability due to a stable structure.

The results illustrate that ADH has excellent compatibility and dispersion stability without affecting the film formation of the polymer latex. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and mapping analysis of the hybrid films also demonstrate that ADH is homogenously dispersed in the polymer matrix. Compared with neat polymers, the thermal properties of hybrid films are improved, for example, T0.5 increases by 8.3 °C. According to qualitative tests of the 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazol-red/green/blue (AHMT-RGB) method, the hybrid films demonstrate high formaldehyde removal efficiency.

The decomposition of the internal insulation material of GIE is directly related to the internal insulation status of the equipment, therefore, in this paper, using SF6 decomposition characteristics to evaluate the internal PD degree of GIE was proposed. A free metal particle defect model was developed on the established SF6 DC-PD decomposition experiment platform, and the PD caused by this defect was divided into three levels. Two kinds of voltage in each of the PD levels were selected for the decomposition experiments of SF6. Based on the principle of minimum- redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR), the characteristics of SF6 decomposed components had been selected. The PD severity was diagnosed by back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, and the ratio of SF6 decomposition components which could most effectively characterize the severity of PD was extracted, and the PD status was evaluated. The results show that there was a certain relationship between the SF6 decomposed components and the PD severity.

A relatively high pulling speed of 40 µm/s was used for improved energy efficiency. After cooling, samples underwent AEM–DS, and efficient separation was obtained. The Si content in Si-rich areas exceeded 85 wt.% (considerably higher than the content in others) and exhibited not a slight relevance with the original Si contents in the hypereutectic Al–Si alloy. With regard to purification, impurities— particularly metallic impurities (Fe, Ti, and Ca)—can be removed to a low level. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) indicated that B content was lower in the Si-rich area than in the Al–Si alloy, suggesting that the segregation of B in solid primary Si was higher than that in Al–Si melt during AEM–DS. Moreover, the contents of metallic impurities (Fe, Ti, and Ca) and B decreased when the initial Si content in the Al–Si melt decreased. This finding was attributed to a lower silicon content, which indicated a lower melt temperature, thus allowing segregation at a lower temperature. © 2018","34","Silicon alloys","Aluminum - Electromagnetic fields - Electron probe microanalysis - Energy efficiency - Purification - Segregation (metallography) - Separation - Solidification","Alternating electromagnetic field - Lower temperatures - Melt temperature - Metallic impurity - Primary silicon - Separation and purification - Si alloys - Silicon contents","525.2 Energy Conservation - 531.2 Metallography - 541.1 Aluminum - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: U1702251, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

To meet the demand for talented people, universities are also actively developing “Java Programming” courses, but There is a big gap between the requirements of talents and employers. The essential reason is that the teaching quality of Java is not high, and the talent cultivated by the old-fashioned training model cannot meet the diverse needs of the society. For this reason, this paper analyzes the general problems in the teaching process of Java Programming, such as the selection of teaching materials, teaching methods, unscientific assessment and other issues. They belong to the problem of textbook models. This paper discusses how to reform curriculum teaching mode to improve teaching quality.

Image rendering methods with non-photorealistic rendering based can simulate different illustrations and increase its aesthetic appeal. Despite many kinds of methods have been put forward to obtain various styles, technical subtleties and stylistic potential of the embroidery simulation are litter attention. This paper offers a detailed review of the embroidery art style simulating approach from a 2D photograph, and performs an evaluation features for these tasks. The primary novelty of this method is that the stitch features are generated through an embroidery stroke model, and stitch stoke will be merged to source image. Therefore, it avoids irregular needling embroidery, and highlights the stereoscopic effect which is not revealed in other rendering methods. Firstly, we generate noise image through gray adaptive method to guide the embroidery lines produced. After that, an improved line integral convolution technique is presented to generate stitch strokes, and scattered noise is normalizing to a certain line based on Hough transform. Next, the paper focuses on the raised strokes, which are rendered and obtained through bulging process technique in this paper. Finally, we can exploit mergence strategy based on mapping method to produce embroidery art style. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, this paper compares its simulating results with the real embroidery work and measure of image MSSIM is also used to evaluate the simulation quality. In all cases, the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve embroidery style stitch visual quality and rich the aesthetic expression. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","47","Rendering (computer graphics)","Convolution - Hough transforms - Merging - Quality control - Stereo image processing - Textile printing - Three dimensional computer graphics","Color simulations - Image mergence - Image rendering method - Line integral convolution - Miao embroidery - Non-Photorealistic Rendering - Process techniques - Simulation quality",,"Number: 2014FA021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Number: 1108000197, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This research was funded by the grants (No.61462093, 61662087, 61761046) from the Research Natural Science Foundation of China, the Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (No.2014FB113, 2014FA021), the Postdoctoral fund of the Ministry of education of China, Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds in 2017 (1108000197)..",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Here, the authors used ab initio molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the interatomic interaction in Sn-Sb-based lead-free solders. By calculating the electron density distribution, bond population, and partial density of states, the authors found that the Sn-Sb bonds are a mixture of nonlocalized metal and localized covalent bonds. The covalent bond between Sn and Sb is easy to break at higher temperatures, so Sn-Sb (6.4 wt%) had better fluidity than other studied Sn-Sb alloys. Furthermore, adding Cu or Ag into Sn-Sb alloys can decrease the strength of covalent bonds and stabilize the metal bonds, which improves the metallicity and wettability of the Sn-Sb-Cu and Sn-Sb-Cu-Ag systems when the temperature increases. These results are all in good agreement with experimental findings and have significant value for the development of new solder alloys.

Previous studies have generally focused on stemflow volume, efficiency and influential factors but have failed to depict stemflow processes and quantify their relations with rainfall characteristics within events, particularly for xerophytic shrubs. Here, we measured the stemflow volume, intensity, funneling ratio and time lags to rain at two dominant shrub species (Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) and rainfall characteristics during 54 events at the semiarid Liudaogou catchment of the Loess Plateau, China, during the 2014-2015 rainy seasons. The funneling ratio was calculated as the ratio between stemflow and rainfall intensities at the inter-and intra-event scales. Our results indicated that the stemflow of C. korshinskii and S. psammophila, on average, started at 66.2 and 54.8 min, maximized 109.4 and 120.5 min after rain began, and ended 20.0 and 13.5 min after rain ceased. The two shrubs had shorter stemflow duration (3.8 and 3.4 h) and significantly larger stemflow intensities (517.5 and 367.3mmh-1) than those of rain (4.7 h and 4.5mmh-1). As branch size increased, both species shared the decreasing funneling ratios (97.7- 163.7 and 44.2-212.0) and stemflow intensities (333.8-716.2 and 197.2-738.7mmh-1). Tested by the multiple correspondence analysis and stepwise regression, rainfall amount and duration controlled stemflow volume and duration, respectively, at the event scale by linear relations (p 0.01). Rainfall intensity and raindrop momentum controlled stemflow intensity and time lags to rain for both species within the event by linear or power relationships (p 0.01). Rainfall intensity was the key factor affecting stemflow process of C. korshinskii, whereas raindrop momentum had the greatest influence on stemflow process of S. psammophila. Therefore, rainfall characteristics had temporally dependent influences on corresponding stemflow variables, and the influence also depended on specific species. © Author(s) 2019.","67","Rain","Catchments - Drops - Soil moisture","Caragana Korshinskii - Effects of rainfalls - Influential factors - Multiple correspondence analysis - Rainfall characteristics - Rainfall intensity - Root zone soil moistures - Stepwise regression","443.3 Precipitation - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on Hertzian elastic contact theory, a research on non-linear excitation mechanism excited by the spall fault was carried out, and the internal excitation mechanism of double-impulse phenomenon was studied. As a result, a novel coupled non-linear dynamic model for double-impulse behavior of the ball bearing with a spall on the inner race was proposed, by considering the contact characteristics between the rolling elements and the bearing races and the excitation mechanism of time-varying displacement and contact force. The coupled solution to the second order non-linear differential equations was obtained by applying the Runge-Kutta numerical integral method, the relationship of double-impulse time spacings extracted from the simulated vibration signal was investigated. By comparison of the simulated, experimental and theoretical double-impulse time spacings under diverse shaft rotating speeds and inner race spall sizes of the ball bearing, all the relative errors between the simulated and theoretical double-impulse time spacings were less than 2 percent, and that between the simulated and the experimental double-impulse time spacings were less than 12 percent. In addition, the simulated signal agreed well with the experimental signal.

A widely used method is artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, artificial neural networks, which can be trained over both historical values of irradiance and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation. In this paper, a novel version of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) method is combined with weather forecasts in order to predict solar irradiance. This method is used to forecast irradiance over a horizon of 24 h. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to outperform other AI methods. In particular, GRU using weather forecast data reduces the root mean squared error by 23.3% relative to a backpropagation neural network and 11.9% relative to a recurrent neural network. Compared to long short-term memory, the training time is reduced by 36.6%. Compared to persistence, the improvement in the forecast skill of the GRU is 42.0%.

By combining TCM research with genomics, herbgenomics can help to establish the scientific validity of TCM and bring it into wider usage within the field of medicine. Salvia Linn. (S. Linn.) is a large genus of Labiatae that includes important medicinal plants. In this herbgenomics study, the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of two Salvia spp.—namely, S. przewalskii and S. bulleyana, which are used as a surrogate for S. miltiorrhiza—were sequenced and compared with those of two other reported Salvia spp.—namely, S. miltiorrhiza and S. japonica. The genome organization, gene number, type, and repeat sequences were compared. The annotation results showed that both Salvia plants contain 114 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding, 30 transfer RNA (tRNA), and four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Repeat sequence analysis revealed 21 forward and 22 palindromic sequences in both Salvia cp genomes, and 17 and 21 tandem repeats in S. przewalskii and S. bulleyana, respectively. A synteny comparison of the Salvia spp. cp genomes showed a high degree of sequence similarity in the coding regions and a relatively high divergence of the intergenic spacers. Pairwise alignment and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses found some candidate fragments to identify Salvia spp., such as the intergenic region of the trnV–ndhC, trnQ–rps16, atpI–atpH, psbA–ycf3, ycf1, rpoC2, ndhF, matK, rpoB, rpoA, and accD genes. All of the results—including the repeat sequences and SNP sites, the inverted repeat (IR) region border, and the phylogenetic analysis—showed that S. przewalskii and S. bulleyana are extremely similar from a genetic standpoint.

Large volumes of cyanobacteria algae have also been recorded in this lake; its growth, distribution and metabolism are believed to directly or indirectly affect water quality. The relationship between metabolism of cyanobacteria and COD-Cr in Dianchi Lake, and the causes of this relationship, are examined in this study. Results show that the increase of COD-Cr concentration is closely related to the metabolism of algae, and that organic substances containing nitrogen and sugars, produced by metabolism, contribute to an increase of COD-Cr to a certain extent. The characteristics of fluorescence spectra of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Waihai area of Dianchi Lake are similar to those of algae culture water, and their dominant substances are protein-like substances. Algae release organic substances into water during its growth cycle and extracellular organic substances are mainly released during its normal growth and metabolism stages. Once algae cells enter the decline stage, internal organic matter is released during the dying and decomposition stages, resulting in a distinct increase of COD-Cr. A high concentration of organic matter is present in Dianchi Lake sediments, dominated by native organic matter predominantly derived from aquatic plants and plankton. This finding indicates a potential long-term risk of organic pollutants being released from dead algae cells into the lake. Practitioner points: There is a distinct positive correlation between COD-Cr and Chl-a concentration in Dianchi Lake. Organic substances containing nitrogen and sugars produced by algae metabolism contributed to COD-Cr. The cells die and decompose organic matter content in the water substantially increases, resulting in a distinct increase of COD-Cr. Weight >20 kDa are mainly released into the water body during the decomposition of algae cells after mortality.

These models were subjected to bidirectional seismic waves, and a total of 16 test scenarios were obtained. The results show that for the mid-story isolation model, the story acceleration and story drift of each story of the tower decreases sharply, indicating an excellent damping effect on the tower. The story acceleration response and the story drift of the podium increase slightly, which indicates that there is almost no damping effect on the podium. The podium enters into the elastic-plastic stage under the peak acceleration of 0.4g, and a medium damage level was reached under the peak acceleration of 0.6g.It is thus suggested that the stressed components of the podium should be strengthened, and the limit of elastic-plastic displacement angle of the podium should be increased in engineering application. © 2019, The Editorial Board of Journal of Basic Science and Engineering.

The thermal conductivity of the activated carbon was very poor, resulting in performance delays of the system. To improve the performance of the heat transfer for the adsorbent bed, a new adsorbent bed with finned tubes was designed and studied using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Two-dimensional (2D) numerical models of two kinds of adsorbent tubes (finned and smooth tubes) were constructed and simulated. The two different 2D numerical models had similar cell numbers and the same boundaries and initial conditions. An experiment for a grid verification model of the designed finned tube was conducted, and the model of the finned tube was validated via comparison between the numerical and experimental results. In addition, the heat performances of the newly designed finned tube and the smooth tube were compared in this paper. The temperature gradients of the activated carbon in the smooth and finned tubes were approximately 28.1 °C and 4 °C during isosteric heating, respectively.

This paper introduces a top-down strategy to fabricate a series of bifunctional metal-free catalysts derived from the plant residue. Among them, the catalyst BRCAC8502 shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER (E1/2 = 0.85 V, Ei=10 = 1.68 V vs RHE). A zinc-air battery equipped by catalyst BRCAC8502 even displays a superior performance to that of Pt/C-RuO2. The excellent ORR and OER performances are mainly attributed to 3D hierarchical structures and rich active sites of the catalyst, including N functional groups, oxygen vacancies, and carbon defects. The strategy of preparing plant residues into the outstanding bifunctional catalyst demonstrated in this study may enlighten to the design of various other functional catalysts.

We present two approaches for multiple outliers detection in terms of well known mean-shift model. One use traditional way as in classical regression model to derive the test statistic in which the heterogeneity variance parameter is fixed first and then replaced by its estimator under the null model; this method is called as one-step approximation. However, this one-step approximation ignores the impact of heterogeneity variance estimation if the outliers detected are highly influential on estimating heterogeneity variance. Therefore, we propose a new approximate method to derive test statistic of multiple outliers in meta-regression model, in which the effects of estimating heterogeneity variance are taken into consideration. The formulae based on MLE and REMLE are both considered. The power performance of test statistics are examined and compared via simulation studies and we find our approximate method is more effective to identifying outliers in meta-regression models. In addition, we propose a modified model to accommodate outliers in meta-regression model. Two examples are analyzed for illustration. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","31","Regression analysis","Anomaly detection - Approximation theory - Data handling - Random processes - Statistical tests - Statistics","Approximation methods - Mean shift model - outliers - Regression model - Step approximations","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, based on the relief amplitude and slope information reflected by the original point cloud, the terrain niche index model was established, and the natural discontinuity method was used to block the point cloud in the experimental area. Secondly, a multi-scale virtual grid was constructed based on the terrain and vegetation growth of each block to extract more accurate initial ground points, and the initial terrain surface was constructed based on these points. Finally, a set of ground point judgment parameters is determined, and the ground point is extracted in combination with the initial terrain surface, to realize the denoising processing of the debris flow valley point cloud.

Additionally, with the simultaneous decline of carrier thermal conductivity upon Co/Ni doping, potentially, at least, 1.21/1.13-fold increase in thermoelectric figure of merit of β-Zn4Sb3 at room temperature are achieved, indicating that the substitution of Co and Ni for Zn can effectively elevate thermoelectric performance of β-Zn4Sb3. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","59","Thermoelectricity","Calculations - Density functional theory - Electronic density of states - Electronic structure - Quantum chemistry - Thermal conductivity - Thermoelectric equipment - Transition metals","Ab-initio electronic structure calculations - Boltzmann transport equation - Conduction-band minimum - Relaxation time approximation - Thermo-Electric materials - Thermoelectric figure of merit - Thermoelectric performance - Thermoelectric properties","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 615.4 Thermoelectric Energy - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 11674322, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Center for Computational Sciences, University of Kentucky; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 11674322 , No. 51672278 ), Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Yunnan Province , and the Center for Computational Science, Hefei Institutes of Physical Sciences .",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Additionally, the inner diameter of the as-prepared biomimetic tubular PP foams can be easily adjusted from extreme low (∼0.4 mm) to very high (∼20.0 mm) size through a fixed 2.0 mm circle extruder die by carefully controlling the radially distributed temperature and melt viscoelasticity.

More interestingly, thanks to the above biomimetic structure, the as-prepared PP foam strips exhibited both superior absorption and filtration ability during the oil-water separation, in which the deionized water could be filtered quickly through the foam strips while the oil was absorbed in seconds. Besides, the relationship between pore size and hydrophobicity of polymer foams was theoretically analyzed by the Young-Laplace equation.

This research demonstrates that delignified wood (DL-wood) can further improve the efficiency of steam generation via increasing both the water transportation and water evaporation. The results show that after placing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on DL-wood, the efficiency of steam production is higher than that of natural wood coated with CNTs by 20% under ambient sunlight conditions.

The spatial distribution of control points in different regions is not similar. If we put down the multiple images and have known their exterior orientation elements regarding the same control points under the same region, as a sample set, the overall descent direction can be obtained by supervised learning under the circumstance that every initial values of exterior orientation elements have been given. What's more, in the case of non-convergence in original space resection of single image because of the reasons mentioned before, it can be approximately solved by using the overall descent direction. From this angle, a supervised learning method for solving space resection of single image is proposed. The process mainly includes: Training stage, in which supervised learning process is utilized and the descend direction set of exterior orientation elements is obtained by solving the overall exterior orientation elements of images set with different attitude in the same survey area. Testing stage, in which for any image in study area, the exterior orientation elements can be calculated iteratively if the initial value and the descend direction set were given from the process of supervised training. Experimental results show that the method in this paper is more efficient in numerical procedure convergence and dependence of the initial value than the current there realized.

Long-term changes in deep water flow have been studied using seismic reflection profiles but the seismic stratigraphy was poorly constrained and not resolved for the time period from the late Miocene onward. Here we present results from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1475 (Agulhas Plateau) located over a sediment drift proximal to the entrance of North Atlantic Deep Water into the Southern Ocean and South Indian Ocean. Site U1475 comprises a complete carbonate-rich stratigraphic section of the last ~7 Ma that provides an archive of climate-induced variations in ocean circulation. Six marker reflectors occurring in the upper 300 m of the drift are identified here for the first time. The formation of these reflectors is mainly due to density changes that are mostly caused by changes in biogenic versus terrigenous sediment deposition. Synthetic seismograms allow age assignments for the horizons based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Prominent reflectors are related to late Pleistocene glacial/interglacial variability, the middle and early Pleistocene transitions, and the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciation. A peculiar early Pliocene interval (~5.3–4.0 Ma) bounded by two reflectors is characterized by fourfold elevated sedimentation rates (>10 cm/kyr) and the occurrence of sediment waves.

Then, all the data were reduced to a low-dimensional space using Fisher discriminant analysis. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the test data and the training data after the Procrustes analysis was calculated, and the class recognition was achieved based on the discriminant principle of Fisher discriminant analysis.

Herein we report a novel solvent-free route of synthesizing Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite, which is featured by using Fenton's reagent as a promoter. The influences of crystallization time, amount of hydrogen peroxide and low-temperature pretreatment on the synthesis of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite were investigated in detail. The results indicate that the combination of solvent-free synthesis with Fenton's reagent can facilitate the rapid crystallization of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite. The resultant Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite was used as a catalyst for phenol hydroxylation, and characterized by XRD, SEM, ICP-AES, N2 physisorption and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Notably, it exhibits a much better catalytic performance as compared with the reference catalyst by conventional solvent-free method. The observed enhanced catalytic performance for this Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst is attributed to its larger BET surface area and mesoporous volume as well as enrichment towards phenol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","40","Zeolites","Atomic emission spectroscopy - Catalysts - Energy efficiency - Hydroxylation - Phenols - Solvents - Temperature","Catalytic performance - Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy - Fe-ZSM5 - Fenton's reagents - Hydroxylation of phenol - Low temperature pretreatment - Phenol hydroxylation - Solvent free synthesis","525.2 Energy Conservation - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 17JR5RA124, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province; Number: 21666019, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21666019 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, China (Grant No. 17JR5RA124 ).

As this urbanisation is expected to continue in the future, it is important to understand its environmental impacts and the role that spatial planning strategies and urbanisation regulations can play herein. This is addressed by (1) quantifying the cities' expansion and intra-urban restructuring using Local Climate Zones (LCZs) for three periods in time (2005, 2011 and 2017) based on the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) protocol, and (2) cross-referencing observed land-use and land-cover changes with existing planning regulations. The results of the surveys on urban development show that, between 2005 and 2011, the city showed spatial expansion, whereas between 2011 and 2017, densification mainly occurred within the existing urban extent. Between 2005 and 2017, the fraction of open LCZs increased, with the largest increase taking place between 2011 and 2017. The largest decrease was seen for low the plants (LCZ D) and agricultural greenhouse (LCZ H) categories. As the potential of LCZs as, for example, a heat stress assessment tool has been shown elsewhere, understanding the relation between policy strategies and LCZ changes is important to take rational urban planning strategies toward sustainable city development. © 2019 by the authors.","86","Climate change","Economics - Environmental impact - Environmental regulations - Expansion - Land use - Public policy - Urban growth - Urban planning","Kunming - Land use/land cover change - Local climate - Urbanisation - WUDAPT","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Universiteit Gent; ","This research received funding in the form of a student travel grant from the Scientific Research Commission of the Faculty of Bio-science Engineering, Ghent University.

First, analysis of the basic morphology and elemental characterization of the materials were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS). Second, the effects of conductivity on the separation and recombination efficiency of the photo-generated carriers were investigated using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), transient fluorescence, electron spin resonance (ESR), transient photocurrent density (TPD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These results showed the addition of carbon promoted the separation of photo-generated carriers. Transient fluorescence measurements showed the separation and recombination of carriers was an ultrafast kinetic process and the photo-generated carriers exhibited the following three recombination mechanisms during fluorescence decay: bulk recombination, surface migration and defect recombination. In this study, photocatalytic carrier separation was improved by the addition of carbon materials, which resulted in improved photocatalytic degradation. Examination of the kinetic process of carbon-modified BiVO4 composites resulted in a deeper understanding of the composite process of the photo-generated carriers and the development of a better research method for improving photocatalytic degradation effects. © 2019","77","Electron spin resonance spectroscopy","Bismuth - Bismuth compounds - Dynamics - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Fluorescence - Graphene - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Image enhancement - Magnetic moments - Morphology - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN) - Photoluminescence spectroscopy - Scanning electron microscopy - Semiconductor quantum dots - Semiconductor quantum wells - Separation - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy - Yarn","BiVO4 - Carbon material - Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy - Fluorescence measurements - Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) - Photo catalytic degradation - Photogenerated carriers - Recombination efficiency","549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 819.4 Fiber Products - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018YFD1100501, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [ 2018YFD1100501 ].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
