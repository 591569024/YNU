In many applications, they pay more attentions in the direct relationship in data. However, with the development of the Internet and complex network, the data set is growing bigger and bigger, and the latent relationship in data sets is becoming more and more important. Taking all of these into consideration, a community detection approach on data latent relationship is proposed in this paper. The frequent item-sets and item-association Markov network are introduced to present the data latent relationship, and it also can processed in distributed stations.

The improvement of service performance and low-power consumption are the two challenges for these medical WBANs, because those energy-limited wireless medical sensors must transmit the monitoring data to the personal server (PS) via intra-WBAN in time. Further, precise mathematical modeling combining with the sleeping state to measure this improvement theoretically is still lack. Therefore, a polling control with exhaustive service using the sleeping schema is proposed to address the problems in WBANs communication for smart health. Based on the managed access phase (MAP) specified in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, it has been attempting to improve the energy efficiency through a self-managing sleeping schema for both the sensor nodes and the PS according to the load in intra-WBANs, in which the node will soon turn to sleep upon completion of transmitting all its current data packets. Additionally, by employing the embedded Markov chain and probability generating function, the proposed model is established, and the performance characteristics—the mean cyclic period and queue length at the polling moment—were accurately obtained to justify the service performance can be guaranteed. In addition, the expressions of the quantitative relationship among sleeping time, performance characteristics and network parameters were derived in closed form, which can easily evaluate the energy efficiency.

Here, we collect data (including six trace metals and three lithogenic elements) from well-dated sediment cores of seven alpine lakes in southeast Tibet, which is adjacent to southwest China. This area has a documented history of preindustrial pollution. Metals such as cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) are found at relatively low concentrations until a clear increase is observed after 1950s across lakes. This result is consistent with accelerating atmospheric metal deposition due to socio-economic development in the region. We observe no synchronous trend across lakes in the changes of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag), which show no significant increase after ∼1950 over the last two centuries in most of the study lakes. The historical trends of 206Pb/207Pb ratio reflect an important source of anthropogenic Pb associated with preindustrial mining and smelting in this study region, suggesting a substantial impact of legacy contamination from ancient mines. Furthermore, the temporal variations in these six anthropogenic metals are largely accounted for by terrigenous elements (e.g. aluminum (Al) and titanium (Ti)) in most of the study lakes, and to a lesser degree by sediment grain sizes and organic matter content, suggesting a significant role of catchment erosion in modulating sediment metal signals. In all, this study highlights the legacy effect of historical pollutants may have enhanced the forcing of catchment erosion in modulating the sediment signals of anthropogenic deposition in southeast Tibet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","54","Lake pollution","Catchments - Deposition - Economics - Erosion - Lakes - Lead smelting - Metals - Meteorological problems - Runoff - Sediments - Trace elements","Anthropogenic deposition - Atmospheric depositions - Atmospheric metal deposition - Catchment erosion - Lake sediments - Socio-economic development - Southeast Tibet - Trace metal","442.1 Flood Control - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 453 Water Pollution - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 533.2 Metal Refining - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2017YFA0605202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41771239, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 213034A, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","This work is primarily supported by grants of the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFA0605202 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U1133601 , 41771239 ) and the Ministry of Education of China ( 213034A ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Therefore, this paper presents a feature-based spectroscopy combined with improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Method of choosing. First, we measure the importance score of each feature through mutual information, and then sort the features according to the importance of the features in descending order. This effectively avoids the problem of losing important information caused by using the principal component reduction method. Secondly, the concept of jump degree is introduced and a method of feature stratification is constructed. Similar features of similar importance are merged into the same feature subset, and the descending ordered feature set is segmented into different feature subsets, avoiding the screening uncertainty caused by artificially setting the score of feature importance score during feature process. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm with fast convergence rate and few control parameters is used as the optimal feature subset optimization method. At the same time, particle swarm optimization is improved in two aspects: The chaotic model is introduced to increase the diversity of the population and improve the global searching ability of PSO, so as to avoid getting into local optimum. The number of features is introduced into the fitness function, and the influence of the number of features on the fitness function is adjusted by the penalty factor in the early iteration to improve the adaptability of the algorithm. The stratified data is collected as a feature subset and then added as a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm to select the high-resolution feature subset. In this paper, the nicotine index as an example of the feature selection process is described, using Nicolet company Antaris II near infrared spectrometer near infrared spectrum data acquisition, spectrum scanning range is 4 000~10 000 cm-1. First, we use the mutual information theory to calculate the importance score of 1 557 features of the whole spectrum on the quantitative modeling of the index to be measured, and take the average of 30 experiments. Secondly, all the features are sorted in descending order of importance scores to calculate the jumping degree of all the features. According to the jumping degree, the critical points of the feature stratification are searched, and the features are divided into different feature layers to construct a feature containing 8 feature subsets set S={S'1, S'2, S'3, S'4, S'5, S'6, S'7, S'8}. Then, the feature subset is in turn {S'1}, {S'1, S'2}, {S'1, S'2, S'3},..., {S'1, S'2, S'3, S'4, S'5, S'6, S'7, S'8} as a candidate for initial particle swarm. With R/(1+RMSEP) as the evaluation criteria of the pros and cons of feature subsets, each iterative experiment 50 times, the ratio of the largest feature subset is the optimal feature subset. In order to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm, we select representative tobacco near-infrared spectral data as a training set and a test set, establish a PLS quantitative model of nicotine and total sugar, and compare with the full-spectrum, stratified characteristic spectrum, particle swarm algorithm selected by the characteristic spectra. The simulation results show that the modeling correlation coefficients R of nicotine and total sugar selected by this algorithm are respectively 0.988 5 and 0.982 2, RMSECV of mutual verification are 0.098 4 and 0.889 3 respectively, RMSEP of prediction root mean square error are 0.901 6 and 0.100 7 respectively, Accuracy are significantly higher than the other three methods. From the selected number of features, the proposed algorithm has the least number of selected features, effectively eliminating the weak correlation and noise and redundant information in the original feature set, minimizing the number of main factors of the model and reducing the complexity of the model, and the model is steadier, more adaptable. © 2019, Peking University Press.

It has been proved to be effective to dewater high moisture content in mineral substance via the application of the dielectric loss of materials. In this study, the effects of microwave power levels (250–550 W) and different sample masses (20–40 g) on microwave drying behavior of pyrolusite have been investigated. For the purpose of the mechanism and morphological changes to the pyrolusite in the process of drying, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used, respectively. The experiment results demonstrated that an increase in the microwave power as well as sample mass was found to increase the drying rate during pyrolusite drying processes, with there are four main mass loss stages from 20 to 900 °C. The SEM-EDS analysis results show that morphological changes with the presence of more pores and appearance in spiral cross-linking way reduced the particle size and the shrinkage of the faces and edges, in which it can been concluded that the microwave drying is an effective method to produce the high-grade pyrolusite. By analysis, the increased pore structure and shrinkage phenomena can be observed, which increase the specific surface area of manganese ore effectively and may benefit the subsequent reduction process of high valence manganese, after the process of microwave heating. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","34","Microwave heating","Dewatering - Dielectric losses - Dielectric materials - Drying - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Microwave generation - Ore analysis - Ore reduction - Ores - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Physicochemical properties - Pore structure - Scanning electron microscopy - Shrinkage - Size distribution - Thermogravimetric analysis","Drying kinetic - Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS) - High moisture contents - Microwave drying - Microwave power levels - Morphological changes - pyrolusite - Subsequent reduction","642.1 Process Heating - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 713.2 Oscillators - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through compositional engineering, the photoluminescence emission spectra are readily tunable in the range of 430–690 nm, covering most of the visible spectral region. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of FAPbX3 QDs are of the characteristics including narrow emission line-widths of 16–34 nm largely, high quantum yields (QYs) of as high as 88%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 19.8–53.0 ns. Furthermore, FAPbBr3 QDs exhibit single decay dynamics and nearly non-blinking at single-dot level have been observed. We also demonstrate the green light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on the as fabricated highly efficient perovskite QDs, which shows a high efficient luminance of 403 cd m−2, and a moderately high max external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.8% after optimizing the thickness of the perovskite QD layer. Additionally, the LEDs based on FAPbBr3 QDs demonstrate good stability of emission peaks with increasing applied voltage. These results indicate that FAPbX3 QDs have great potential application in lighting devices. © 2019","71","Quantum efficiency","Charge transfer - Costs - Efficiency - Emission spectroscopy - Lead compounds - Light - Light emitting diodes - Nanocrystals - Perovskite - Perovskite solar cells - Photoluminescence - Semiconductor quantum dots","External quantum efficiency - Green light emitting diodes - Photoluminescence emission spectra - Photoluminescence spectrum - Power conversion efficiencies - Room temperature synthesis - Solution-processing - Visible spectral regions","482.2 Minerals - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 913.1 Production Engineering - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics","Number: 2017FA024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; Number: GJJ170582, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Jiangxi Province; Number: 20181BAB201016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Number: 20171BCB23052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21563013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 11774141 , 61765011 , 51863016 and 21563013 ), the Key Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2017FA024 ), Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Yunnan Province, Outstanding Youth Funds of Jiangxi Province ( 20171BCB23051 and 20171BCB23052 ), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province ( 20181BAB201016 , 20181BBE58005 , 20181BAB202028 , 20181BBE50022 , 20171BAB202036 , 20171BAB216017 ,and 20161BAB212035 ), Science and Technology Project of the education department of Jiangxi Province, China ( GJJ150727 , GJJ160681 , GJJ170582 and GJJ170591 ).

Firstly, the directional field and the frequency estimation were calculated and a Gabor filter was applied to enhance the low quality fingerprint image. Subsequently, the pixel direction of fingerprint ridge was computed, then the directional image of fingerprint ridge was obtained by dividing the directions into three parts. Finally, after eliminating the noise and completing the non-ridge area, singularities under multi-scales of smoothing were detected. Furthermore, information fusion was applied to eliminate the false feature points to accurately locate the singularities. Experimental results on FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 show that the accuracy of singularity detection obtained by the proposed method is improved and the accuracy ratio is 92.35%.

While several studies have documented the negative effects of habitat degradation and distance from natural habitats on pollinator diversity in tropical areas, such studies have focused on single crops in particular areas without examining entire plant-pollinator communities. Here, we compared the plant-pollinator network structure between mixed fruit orchards that were near to (7 km) tropical forests and further investigated the effect of landscape composition in surrounding areas on plant-pollinator network structure. Our ten pairs of orchards were in Thailand and grew a range of tropical fruits pollinated by insects, birds and bats. The average number of visitor-flower interactions was higher at sites near the forest. Similarly, network robustness (the resistance of the network to losing species as a result of primary species removal) and interaction evenness (evenness of interactions among species) were higher at the sites closer to the forest. Robustness was strongly positively influenced by the proportion of lowland mosaic within a 1 km radius, while interaction evenness was positively affected by the proportion of urban area and montane mosaic within a 4 km radius of each site. Conservation of (semi-) natural habitats is therefore important for maintaining the diversity of wild pollinators and agricultural production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","73","Orchards","Crops - Ecosystems - Forestry - Fruits - Plants (botany) - Robustness (control systems) - Seed - Tropics - Urban growth","Agricultural productions - Forest proximity - Habitat degradation - Interaction evenness - Landscape composition - Natural habitat - Network robustness - Network structures","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 443 Meteorology - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 731.1 Control Systems - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 2018M633436, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: U1602265, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: PSU, Sponsor: Prince of Songkla University; Number: Yunnan, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","This work was supported by the Royal Golden Jubilee [grant numbers PHD/0225/2552 ], the graduate school at Prince of Songkla University, Postdoctoral Fellowship of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018M633436 ), the CAS President&rsquo;s International Fellowship Initiative, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1602265 , Mapping Karst Biodiversity in Yunnan), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20050202 ), the Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences ( Y4ZK111B01 ).

Fragmentation and feedback are two important processes during the early phases of star formation. Aims. Massive clumps tend to fragment into clusters of cores and condensations, some of which form high-mass stars. In this work, we study the structure of massive clumps at different scales, analyze the fragmentation process, and investigate the possibility that star formation is triggered by nearby H ii regions. Methods. We present a high angular resolution study of a sample of massive proto-cluster clumps G18.17, G18.21, G23.97N, G23.98, G23.44, G23.97S, G25.38, and G25.71. Combining infrared data at 4.5, 8.0, 24, and 70 μm, we use a few arcsecond resolution, radiometer and millimeter inteferometric data taken at 1.3 cm, 3.5 mm, 1.3 mm, and 870 μm to study their fragmentation and evolution. Our sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have neighboring H ii regions. Taking advantage of that, we tested triggered star formation using a novel method where we study the alignment of the center of mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales. Results. The eight massive clumps, identified based on single-dish observations, have masses ranging from 228 to 2279 Mo within an effective radius of Reff 0.5 pc. We detect compact structures towards six out of the eight clumps. The brightest compact structures within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact radio continuum sources. The smaller scale structures of Reff 0.02 pc observed within each clump are mostly gravitationally bound and massive enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star. Many condensations have masses larger than 8 Mo at a small scale of Reff 0.02 pc.

They grow quickly, and are therefore important substitute for timber. Bamboo forest management and cultivation often include removing competitive trees; thus these shifts in forest composition should cascade to impact soil communities and the processes they mediate. Using a long-term (12 year) bamboo forest management study, we determined the impact of bamboo forest management on soil microbial and nematode community composition through time (2008–2010). Surprisingly, we found that conversion from a mixed and relatively diverse bamboo forest to a pure bamboo forest did not affect bamboo biomass. However, the soil fungal:bacterial ratio, nematode diversity index, and fungivores:bacterivores all declined within and across years. Taken together, our results suggest that conversion from mixed to pure bamboo forest can cause a switch from the fungal-based to the bacterial-based energy channel, i.e., accelerate the energy flow and reduce the stability of the soil ecosystem. The findings suggest that managing for a mixed bamboo forest may increase forest diversity and health overtime. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","15","Forestry","Bamboo - Convergence of numerical methods - Ecosystems - Fungi - Soils - Tropics","Energy channels - Forest compositions - Forest diversity - Fungal:bacterial ratios - Nematode communities - Phyllostachys pubescens - Soil food web - Soil nematode","443 Meteorology - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 811.1 Pulp and Paper - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2015303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31470559, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1804101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1804101, 31470559), Zhongyuan Scholar Program (182101510005), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2015303) and "International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR)".",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, a trident-like lateral flow biosensor (LFB) for multiple on-site authenticity detection of horse and donkey meat was established for the first time based on species-specific TM-LAMP (tag-labeled multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification). Firstly, a novel, accurate model for screening chromosomal endogenous reference genes was constructed using Perl as the bioinformatics language, based on which the single-copy genes LOC106782588 and LOC106825524 were selected as the endogenous reference genes for horses and donkeys, respectively. Secondly, antigen tag-labeled multiplex LAMP based lateral flow biosensor was established. Following optimization, the limit of detection (LOD) reached a level as low as 40 pg, which was equivalent to 15 copies in horses and donkeys. TM-LAMP was proved to be suitable for on-site detection since the process took only 40 min, with no need of any precision instruments. The analysis of various processed foods and mixed meat products indicated that this biosensor displayed high specificity and sensitivity consistently. As a universal platform, this biosensor can be custom-designed for on-site detection of other species by changing specific primers, which might be an excellent prospect for the identification of species authenticity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","39","Biosensors","Authentication - Genes - Meats","Analysis of various - Endogenous reference genes - Lateral Flow - Limit of detection - Loop mediated isothermal amplifications - On-site detection - Precision instrument - Universal platform","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 822.3 Food Products","Number: 2018ZX08012-001-004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Major Science and Technology Projects of China; ","This work was supported by National Major Science and Technology Projects of China (2018ZX08012-001-004).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the analysis of the results of ESI-MS and 13C-NMR of the reaction products between AG and formaldehyde prepared under different pHs, it was found that the pH has strong effects on these reactions. Under strong acid conditions, such as pH 1–3, the methylolation reaction mainly occurred at the aliphatic amino groups of AG. However, it was very difficult for the resulted methylolated AG to be further condensed. Under weak acid conditions, such as pH 5, both the methylolation reaction between amido groups and formaldehyde and the further condensation reaction were possible. However, the condensation reaction was still rather weak under these conditions. At alkaline conditions, the methylolation reaction occurred between all of the three types of amino groups of AG and formaldehyde with both methylene bonds and methylene–ether bonds present in the system. Methylene bonds were mainly from the reaction between AG methylols and amido groups and aliphatic amino groups of AG.

Fuel mixtures included coal, woody biomass, and agricultural waste. Compared to previously published emission measurements of similar stoves, these measurements have higher CO and PM2.5 emission factors. Real-time data show two distinct burn phases: a devolatilization phase after fuel addition with high PM2.5 emissions and a solid-fuel combustion phase with low PM2.5 emissions. The average emission factors depend on the relative contributions of these phases, which are affected by the services provided by the stoves. Differences in stove and fuel characteristics that are not represented in emission inventories affect the variability of emission factors much more than do the type of solid fuel or stove.

A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship model of α-glucosidase inhibitors with good predictive capability [comparative molecular field analysis, q2 = 0.529, optimum number of components (ONC) = 10, R2 = 0.996, F = 250.843, standard error of estimation (SEE) = 0.064, and two descriptors; comparative similarity index analysis, q2 = 0.515, ONC = 10, R2 = 0.997, F = 348.301, SEE = 0.054, and four descriptors] was established and indicated that meta positions of ring B favored bulky and minor, electron-withdrawing, and hydrogen bond donor groups. The presence of electron-donating and hydrogen bond acceptor groups at position 4′ of ring B could improve α-glucosidase activity. Position 3 of ring C favored minor, electron-donating, and hydrogen bond donor groups, whereas position 7 of ring A favored bulky and hydrogen bond acceptor groups.

Apigenin-7-O-glucoside (60 μM) can effectively improve insulin resistance, and glucose uptake increased by approximately 73.06% relative to the model group of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells.

Before the insulin resistance alleviation experiment, the cytotoxicity of these flavonoids to HepG2 cells was determined through the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. These five flavonoids exhibited no cytotoxicity at concentrations of up to 60 &mu;M. Therefore, concentrations of 40 and 60 &mu;M were adopted in subsequent glucose uptake assays. The effect of compounds 11 , 17 , and 27 on the alleviation of insulin resistance at the concentration of 60 &mu;M was similar to that of rosiglitazone (20 &mu;M), which is a thiazolidinedione agent that can alleviate insulin resistance. These dietary flavonoids considerably improved glucose consumption by insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. As shown in Figure 8 , the considerable reduction in glucose consumption by the model group (insulin-resistant HepG2 cells) relative to that by the control group (normal HepG2 cells) indicates that the insulin resistance model was successfully established. These flavonoid compounds alleviated insulin resistance in a concentration-dependent manner. The activities of compounds 27 , 17 , and 11 in improving insulin resistance at the concentration of 60 &mu;M were high and increased by 73.06, 70.08, and 69.48%, respectively, relative to those of the model group. However, the ameliorative effect of these compounds, except for compound 27 , against insulin resistance at low concentrations (40 &mu;M) showed no significant difference from that of the model group. Scazzocchio et al. reported that cyanidin-3- O -glucoside upregulated PPAR-&gamma; activity to enhance GLUT4 translocation in human omental adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells and to improve glucose uptake activity. (40) Nomura et al. summarized the key structural features of several flavonoids. Specifically, they reported that a hydroxyl in the 4&prime; position or 3&prime; and 4&prime; position of ring B and C2&#9552;C3 double bond in ring C of flavones and flavonols confer considerable inhibitory effects against insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in MC3T3-G2/PA6 adipose cells. (30) Another report also revealed that extracts, including apigenin-7- O -glucoside, from Paulownia fortunei flowers could alleviate insulin resistance in obese mice via the AMPK pathway.

Means with different letters are significantly different ( p < 0.05). The results of the present work indicate that 27 dietary flavonoids may exert beneficial effects on the alleviation or prevention of T2DM. For &alpha;-glucosidase inhibitors, compound 1 (myricetin) possessed the most potent &alpha;-glucosidase inhibitory effects among those dietary flavonoids, followed by apigenin-7- O -glucoside, fisetin, cyanidin-3- O -glucoside, and luteolin. The 3D-QSAR results indicate that the meta position of ring B favored bulky and minor, electron-withdrawing, and hydrogen bond donor groups. The presence of electron-donating and hydrogen bond acceptor groups at position 4&prime; of ring B would likely improve &alpha;-glucosidase activity. Furthermore, position 3 of ring C favored minor, electron-donating, and hydrogen bond donor groups, whereas position 7 of ring A favored bulky and hydrogen bond acceptor groups. Five flavonoids, namely, baicalein, isorhamnetin-3- O -rutinoside, apigenin-7- O -glucoside, kaempferol-7- O -&beta;-glucoside, and cyanidin-3- O -glucoside, were screened out as potential insulin sensitizers through molecular docking analysis and further verified by an insulin resistance model of HepG2 cells. According to the present results, apigenin-7- O -glucoside may be used as both the most effective &alpha;-glucosidase inhibitor and insulin sensitizer.

In most cases, material failures usually start from the surface. Therefore, the surface modification is crucial to improving the mechanical properties of metallic materials. The surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) is one of the most effective surface modification methods. It can be used to manufacture gradient nanostructured materials that there is no interfaces between the surface and the coarse-grained matrix. Additionally, the gradient nanostructured metallic materials fabricated by SMAT exhibit a preferable combination of strength and ductility compared with conventional homogeneous materials. It is generally believed that the high strength of the SMAT-ed metallic materials is owing to the surface fine-grain strengthening. Whereas the improved ductility can be attributed to the coarse-grained matrix and the superior work hardening ability of the gradient structured (GS) materials.

With this approach, Si@Ni composite particles were fabricated by electroless deposition of a nickel template directly on silicon; then, three-dimensional (3D) graphene layers were grown in situ around the composite particles to obtain a Si@Ni@GR structure. After removing the nickel interlayer, some voids were generated between the silicon particles and the graphene layers, thus forming a Si@void@GR structure. The coexistence of voids and the graphene layer may provide a synergistic effect. The voids may reserve space for silicon particles during volume expansion and buffer the mechanical pressure of the graphene layer. Meanwhile, the graphene cover may enhance lithium-ion transport efficiency and electron transport rate, thereby improving the electrical conductivity of the anode. The well-coated layers can also prevent the Si particles from being directly exposed to electrolyte, which can promote the formation of a stable SEI film and reduce the irreversible consumption of Li+. Therefore, such unique yolk-shell structures offer the resultant Si@void@GR electrode a high reversible discharge capacity (1595 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1) and the capacity to deliver a discharge capacity of 990 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 4.8 A g−1. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The contribution of urban surface expansion to urban-related warming was determined using the daily mean SAT averages based on four time records each day (00, 06, 12, and 18 h UTC, T4) and averages of the SAT maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) (Txn). The contribution of urban surface expansion to urban-related warming (relative value) in Beijing was 0.110°C per decade (22.8% of total warming) for T4 and 0.094°C per decade (20.2%) for Txn. The values obtained when using T4 were larger than those obtained when using Txn. Differences in the urban-related warming calculated using T4 and Txn could be attributed to the smaller changing trends in Txn in the urban-surface expansion experiment, which resulted from a large changing trend in Tmin and a much smaller changing trend in Tmax. The changes in the diurnal cycle of the energy budget due to urban surface expansion induced changes in the diurnal cycle of SAT, as evidenced by the four time records each day, as well as Tmax and Tmin. This was especially true for periods of intense urban surface expansion, although the annual mean SAT calculated using Txn was larger than that calculated using T4. The increase in impervious area (walls, streets, etc.) due to urban surface expansion, as well as the widespread use of building materials with a large heat capacity resulted in a marked increase in ground heat flux in the daytime. This restricted the increase in SAT in the daytime, but promoted it at night. The increases in SAT due to urban surface expansion were not symmetrical, being smaller in the daytime and larger at night. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","25","Atmospheric temperature","Budget control - Climate models - Heat flux - Numerical methods - Specific heat - Weather forecasting","Changing trends - Mean temperature - Surface air temperatures - Urban surfaces - Urban-related warming",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, a low-temperature solid-state synthesis route for a novel Li2NaBP2O8:Eu3+ (LNBP:Eu) phosphor is reported. The phase structure, morphology, and elemental composition of its powder phase are characterized. According to photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, the occupancy site and oxidation state of doping europium are discussed. Under near-UV (395 nm) excitation, the powder phase exhibits reddish-orange emission with a dominant 5D0 → 7F1 transition of europium.

The optimal content is 0.04 mol, and concentration quenching is ascribed to energy transfer among the nearest-neighbor europium ions. Moreover, chromatic properties are investigated in detail.

Unlike the conventional c-axisnormal direction (ND) basal texture which usually hinders the deformation ability of the Mg sheet during secondary forming, such a special texture component could supply soft orientations of extension twinning for subsequent rolling. The results indicated that the new grain orientations induced by extension twinning, which are dependent on consuming the pre-introduced tilted texture during rolling, would lie around the ND. This positioning could offer diverse orientation gradients along different directions. Meanwhile, such randomly distributed orientation gradients could provide relatively random growth directions for the new recrystallized grains during annealing and contribute to weakening of the basal texture, as well as promoting the symmetry of texture distribution (distribution of basal poles show rotational symmetry around the (0002) pole figure center). As expected, the “precompressed + annealed” and subsequently “rolled + annealed” sample showed improved uniaxial tensile properties (including lower yield strength, higher ductility and more symmetrical planar mechanical performance along different directions) and a considerably improved multiaxial stamping property (Erichsen value increased ~120%) compared with that of the as-extruded sheet or the directly rolled and annealed sample. This study confirmed that preparing soft orientations of extension twinning for subsequent rolling (e.g., employing in-plane precompression along with rolling processes) could be a highly efficient way to optimize the texture and mechanical properties of Mg sheets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","47","Textures","Annealing - Magnesium alloys - Magnesium printing plates - Mechanical properties - Poles - Rolling","Deformation abilities - Magnesium alloy sheets - Mechanical performance - Orientation gradients - Pre-compression - Recrystallized grains - Rotational symmetries - Texture distributions","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 542.2 Magnesium and Alloys - 745.1.1 Printing Equipment - 951 Materials Science","Number: 106112016CDJZR138801, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 2016YFB0301104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 51531002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51801179, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502272, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1764253, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB0301104), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1502272, 51801179, 51531002 and U1764253), Yunnan Science and Technology Projects Grants (2018ZE001, 2018ZE006 and 2018ZE021), Platform project of Materials Genome Institute of Yunnan University (2018ZE023), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (106112016CDJZR138801).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The process of identifying the mapping relationship between the software features and source code is called feature location. Information retrieval feature location method is widely used in software maintenance, code search and other fields because of its high usability and low overhead. All the information retrieval feature location methods are based on semantic similarity calculation. However, there are two main problems: 1) There is a lot of noise data in the source code corpus. The noise data will interfere with the result of similarity calculation. 2) Different index methods' limitation will lead to the similarity calculation results being inaccurate. To solve these problems, a semantic similarity integration method for software feature location problem is proposed. This method introduces the Part-of-Speech filtering in the preprocessing process, effectively filtering the source code noise data, and improving the accuracy of similarity calculation. Then, different index methods are integrated to calculate similarities based on the source code's structured characteristics. Experiments are performed on the open data benchmarks. Compared with the existing methods, the POS filtering improves by an average of 30.88% on the mean reciprocal rank performance, while similarity integration improves an average of 10.28%.

The new rule lowers the learning ability of a player if its payoff is larger than the average payoff of its neighbors, thus enhancing its chance to hold onto its current strategy. Conversely, when a player gaining less than the average payoff of its neighborhood, its learning ability is increased, thus weakening the player by increasing the chance of strategy change. Furthermore, considering the nature of human pursue fairness, we let a loser, someone who has larger learning ability, can benefit from another network, whereas a winner cannot. Our results show that moderate values of the threshold lead to a high cooperation plateau, while too high or too small values of the threshold inhibit cooperation. At moderate thresholds, the flourishing cooperation is attributed to species diversity and equality, whereas a lacking of species diversity determines the vanishing of cooperation. We thus demonstrate that a simple winner-weaken-loser-strengthen rule significantly expands the scope of cooperation on structured populations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","41","Game theory","Biodiversity","Co-evolution - Cooperation - Evolutionary game theory - Learning abilities - Moderate value - Structured population - Winner-Weaken-Loser-Strengthen Rule",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Tropical rainforests have been replaced by extensive rubber plantations, which has resulted in ecological problems such as the loss of biodiversity and local water shortages. It is vitally important to accurately map the rubber plantations in this region. Although several rubber mapping methods have been proposed, few studies have investigated methods based on optical remote sensing time series data with high spatio-temporal resolution due to the cloudy and foggy weather conditions in this area. This study presented a rubber plantation identification method that used spatio-temporal optical remote sensing data fusion technology to obtain vegetation index data at high spatio-temporal resolution within the optical remote sensing window in Xishuangbanna. The analysis of the proposed method shows that (1) fused optical remote sensing data with high spatio-temporal resolution could map the rubber distribution with high accuracy (overall accuracy of up to 89.51% and kappa of 0.86). (2) Fused indices have high R2 (R2 greater than 0.8, where R is the correlation coefficient) with the indices that were derived from the Landsat observed data, which indicates that fusion results are dependable. However, the fusion accuracy is affected by terrain factors including elevation, slope, and slope aspects. These factors have obvious negative effects on the fusion accuracy of high spatio-temporal resolution optical remote sensing data: the highest fusion accuracy occurred in areas with elevations between 1201 and 1400 m.a.s.l., and the lowest accuracy occurred in areas with elevations less than 600 m.a.s.l. For the 5 fused time series indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and tasseled cap angle (TCA)), the fusion accuracy decreased with increasing slope, and increasing slope had the least impact on the EVI, but the greatest negative impact on the NDVI; the slope aspect had a limited influence on the fusion accuracies of the 5 time series indices, but fusion accuracy was lowest on the northwest slope. (3) EVI had the highest accuracy of rubber plantation classification among the 5 time series indices, and the overall classification accuracies of the time series EVI for the four different years (2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) reached 87.20% (kappa 0.82), 86.91% (kappa 0.81), 88.85% (kappa 0.84), and 89.51% (kappa 0.86), respectively. The results indicate that the method is a promising approach for rubber plantation mapping and the detection of changes in rubber plantations in this tropical area. © 2019 by the authors.","53","Remote sensing","Aspect ratio - Biodiversity - Data fusion - Forestry - Mapping - Rubber - Rubber plantations - Time series - Tropics - Vegetation","Classification accuracy - Correlation coefficient - Enhanced vegetation index - Normalized difference moisture indices - Normalized difference vegetation index - Optical remote sensing data - Spatio-temporal resolution - Vegetation phenology","405.3 Surveying - 443 Meteorology - 454 Environmental Engineering - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 818.1 Natural Rubber - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 41801242, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are thankful to the opening access of the LEDAPS software by NASA, the freely accessible GNSPI and ESTARFM codes by Xiaolin Zhu.

Despite its high adaptivity and frequency resolution, the effectiveness of VMD highly depends on parameters, including mode number $K$ , initial center frequency ωinit, and the penalty coefficient α. To tackle this problem, an improved VMD is proposed, which involves: 1) the spectrum of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) to determine optimal K, ωinit and 2) the summation of permutation entropy (SPE) to optimize α, respectively. The presence of nonlinearity can be monitored by investigating the relationships among different frequencies of the process variable (PV) in the control loops. In addition, the oscillation detector based on the improved VMD is capable of distinguishing multiple oscillations, even when both nonlinear and linear oscillations from different sources occur. The proposed method is completely adaptive and data driven, which acts without a priori knowledge.

A SiO2-assisted polybenzoxazine (PB) coating strategy is used to synthesize highly monodispersed Si@C microspheres. After thermal carbonization of PB layers and selective removal of the SiO2 layers, Si@C microspheres were prepared. The resultant Si@C microspheres exhibit uniform spherical morphology and clearly double-shelled yolk-shell structures. The obtained Si@C microspheres are employed to prepare the chemically modified electrode for the sensitive determination of Cd(II) and Pb(II).

The remarkable results, such as excellent resistance to interference ions, good repeatability, and reproducibility were also obtained. Furthermore, compared with those Cd(II) and Pb(II) sensors known in the literature, the analytical performance of Si@C-based electrode is better.

Low-cost CuFe2O4 spinel has been widely researched as an electrocatalyst in electrochemical sensors and catalysis. Nevertheless, the low utilization of active sites in bulk CuFe2O4 and the poor electro conductivity of CuFe2O4 invariably restrict its upgrade in catalytic efficiency. Herein, by utilizing the facile electrospinning technique and without involving any template or surfactant, we successfully design three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous architecture woven by abundant ultrafine CuFe2O4 crystal-coupled porous carbon nanowires (denoted as CuFe2O4/PCFs). Characterization results verify the 3D net-like textural structures of CuFe2O4/PCFs. Especially, the hierarchically porous structure, high surface area, and abundant carbon edges boost the uniform dispersion of tiny CuFe2O4 crystals; these obviously promote the amounts of electrochemically available CuFe2O4 active sites while decreasing the mass transport resistance of CuFe2O4/PCFs in electrocatalytic processes. Meanwhile, introducing carbon matrices can drastically enhance the electrical conductivity of CuFe2O4/PCF nanowires. All these advances in structural and physical performances truly make tremendous progress for CuFe2O4/PCFs for H2O2 reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis compared with bulk CuFe2O4. For instance, the CuFe2O4/PCF catalyst exhibits a high sensitivity of 69.18 μA mM−1 cm−2, low detection limit of 1.20 μM and wide linear range of 0.11–22.0 mM for H2O2 sensing. Meanwhile, the CuFe2O4/PCF catalyst just needs a potential value of 1.589 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to achieve the OER catalysis current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, it only shows a small Tafel slope of 89.34 mV dec−1 for the OER as well. Our catalyst design strategy of CuFe2O4/PCF nanowires not only demonstrates the successful design of a novel high-efficiency non-noble-metal catalyst for both OER and H2O2 reduction catalysis but also affords a new methodology for boosting the electrocatalytic abilities of spinel-type hybrid materials by designing a 3D structure and improving conductivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","40","Iron compounds","Carbon - Catalysis - Copper compounds - Costs - Crystal structure - Electrocatalysts - Electrochemical sensors - Electrospinning - Energy conversion - Hybrid materials - Nanowires - Oxygen - Porous materials - Potassium hydroxide - Precious metals - Reduction","CuFe2O4 - Electrospinning techniques - Energy conversion devices - Hydrogen peroxide reduction - Mass-transport resistance - Oxygen evolution reaction - Porous carbons - Reversible hydrogen electrodes","525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 547.1 Precious Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.3 Fiber Chemistry and Processing - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018T20170019, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the &#64257;nancial support provided by the scientific research start-up fund from Kunming University of Science and Technology of introducing talents ( 130214119417 ) and the analysis and test fund from Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2018T20170019 ).

The mass ratio of the HAFA–Na2CO3 mixtures used in all experiments was 1:1. The study found that the microwave absorption capabilities of HAFA alone do not change significantly within the range of temperatures examined. For both Na2CO3 and HAFA–Na2CO3 mixtures, however, a sharp increase in absorption capability was observed above 400°C. The microwave heating behavior of the HAFA–Na2CO3 mixtures can be divided into two stages: in the first stage (2CO3; however, in the second stage (≥ 350°C), a sharp increase in heating rate was observed, linked to the strengthened absorption capability of the Na2CO3.

Rolling process was carried on such an asymmetrically textured sheet to regulate the microstructure and texture, and thus to try to modify the poor room temperature mechanical properties. The results indicated that the plastic deformation mechanism activated in the c-axisTD textured grains during rolling was sensitive to the rolling paths. When the rolling direction was perpendicular to the tilted direction of the texture component, prismatic slip and extension twinning would be activated in the c-axisTD oriented matrix, and their activities readily varied with the pass reduction. Whereas when the rolling direction was parallel to the tilted direction of the texture component, only extension twinning based on consuming the tilted texture component was permissible. As a result, the microstructure, texture, rollability and the final modified mechanical properties of the sheet were strongly dependent on the rolling paths, and their evolutions during various rolling processes were investigated in detail.

In a tropical montane rainforest in southwestern China, plots were established along a forest degradation gradient ranging from mature and regenerated forests to open land to examine the impacts of forest degradation and deforestation on ecosystem diversity and function. Here, we evaluated the changes in belowground fungal diversity and community composition using a metabarcoding approach. Soil saprotrophic fungal richness declined with increasing forest disturbance. For example, Penicillium spp. (phosphorus [P]-solubilizing fungi) dominated in mature forest but were less abundant in regenerating forests and showed the lowest abundance in open land sites. Conversely, the abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased along the disturbance gradient. The decline in soil saprophytic fungi may be a direct result of forest disturbance or it may be associated with increased availability of soil phosphorus indirectly through an increase in soil pH. The increase in abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi may be related to reduced competition with saprotrophic fungi, changes in microclimate, or increased spore rain. These results demonstrate a loss of dominant P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi along the disturbance gradient, indicating a change from soil P limitation in mature tropical forests to soil C limitation in deforested sites. The increased prevalence of pathogenic fungi may inhibit plant succession following deforestation. Overall, this research demonstrates that soil fungi can be used as a sensitive indicator for soil health to evaluate the consequences of forest disturbance. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.","75","Fungi","Biodiversity - Deforestation - Ecosystems - Phosphorus - Reforestation - Soils - Tropics","Community composition - Disturbance gradients - Ecosystem diversity - Forest disturbances - Illumina - Sensitive indicator - Soil health - Tropical forest","443 Meteorology - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31470546, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number QYZDY-SSW-SMC014).

This paper attempts to propose an approach of adding a small amount of SF6 to improve the dielectric strength of the CF3I-N2 mixture, by making an all-around consideration of dielectric strength, impact on the environment and the limitations of engineering pressure and the lowest ambient temperature. The influences of adding different amounts of SF6 on the electron energy distribution function, the reduced ionization, attachment and effective ionization coefficients, the critical reduced electric field strength and critical electron temperature of ternary SF6-CF3I-N2 mixtures are investigated by Boltzmann analysis. Then the relations of the critical electric fiend strength, mixed ratio and saturated vapor pressure of the ternary SF6-CF3I-N2 mixture are built and analyzed. The results demonstrate that an effective improvement of its dielectric strength can be obtained by adding a small amount of SF6 into the CF3I-N2 mixture, and that a proper choice of the mixed ratio and the gas pressure of the ternary SF6-CF3I-N2 mixture can provide a comparable dielectric strength to pure SF6. © 2019 Author(s).","33","Sulfur hexafluoride","Dielectric properties of gases - Distribution functions - Electric fields - Electron energy levels - Ionization of gases - Mixtures","Dielectric strengths - Electric field strength - Electron energy distribution functions - Gas pressures - Impact on the environment - Ionization coefficient - Saturated vapor pressure - Synergy effect","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Herein, self-supported P-doped nickel superstructure films (NiPx) developed on Cu foil were prepared via a facile one-step electrodeposition route from the choline chloride-ethylene glycol (Ethaline)-based deep eutectic solvent (DES). Two depositional patterns including potentiostatic deposition and a consecutive potential cycling approach were compared, and the latter model with a potentiodynamic control was found to be a valid electrochemical protocol to create crack-free NiPx films which were highly active for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under an alkaline condition. The optimal deposited sample with a Ni/P ratio of 1:0.056 achieved a low overpotential of 105 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with a small Tafel slope of 44.7 mV dec-1 and excellent catalytic stability for at least 60 h. Detailed experimental investigations coupled with theoretical analyses revealed that the high-performance catalytic activity of the NiPx films originated from the enriched active sites and enhanced electronic conductivity induced by P-doping, which also altered the surface electronic structure of the material and resulted in a lower energy barrier for water dissociation and favorable H adsorption free energy.

To better investigate the interannual variability of GPP and its covariance with climate factors in China, this study adopted a multi-model analysis based on three GPP models (i.e., Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon flux model [TEC], Breathing Earth System Simulator model [BESS], and MOD17 GPP model). The results show that annual GPP in China increased by 0.021–0.057 Pg C year−1 from 2000 to 2015 attributable to atmospheric-CO2 fertilization effects and favourable climate change, that is, increasing precipitation (Pr) and temperature (Ta). However, northern China and southern China had a large difference in the amplitude of these GPP changes; annual GPP increased by 0.017–0.039 Pg C year−1 in northern China but only 0.001–0.018 Pg C year−1 in southern China. Northern China and southern China occupy contrasting climate zones and this contrast produced different interannual variability of GPP through different mechanisms. Northern China has a dry climate with GPP changes sensitive to Pr. As a result, more Pr along with higher Ta in northern China produced the strong uptrend of GPP from 2000 to 2015. In contrast, southern China has a wet climate with its GPP sensitive to solar radiation and Ta. For the interval of 2000–2015, decreasing radiation plus drought exerted a negative influence on GPP in southern China. This study highlights the diverse mechanisms in which climate change affects GPP in dry and wet climate zones. A robust multi-model analysis is preferred to reduce uncertainties arising from a single GPP model and its driving data. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","74","Climate change","Climate models - Earth (planet) - Factor analysis - Model structures - Uncertainty analysis","Climate factors - Climate impacts - Different mechanisms - Gross primary production - Interannual variability - Meteorological factors - Multi model - Terrestrial ecosystems","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the RSSI ranging phase, the parameters of ranging model are estimated and corrected by the difference between different reference points. In the localization phase, the nonlinear cost function is constructed according to the measurable quantity. Simultaneously the simulated annealing and decreasing inertia weight mechanism are introduced to the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) localization algorithm, which effectively improves the algorithm's global optimization ability and local search accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with an existing method and the PSO localization algorithm, the modified DW-SAPSO localization algorithm has better convergence performance and can improve the average localization accuracy of the latter by about 32.7%, which has some practical value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","15","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Cost functions - Global optimization - Parameter estimation - Simulated annealing","Convergence performance - Empirical parameters - Localization accuracy - Localization algorithm - Localization method - Nonlinear cost functions - Optimization ability - Reference points","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The calcium absorbing ability of VGLPNSR-Ca in the intestine was studied by Caco-2 cell monolayer model in vitro. According to the results of UV, XRD and SEM, VGLPNSR-Ca was formed as a stable compound. FTIR analysis indicated that the chelation sites of VGLPNSR-Ca were mainly the nitrogen atom of the amino group and the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group. Combined with LC-MS/MS, the chelation reaction of VGLPNSR with calcium ions was mainly involved in the nitrogen terminal of Val, the carbon terminal of Arg and the amino acid Asn. Based on the above results and analyses, the molecular structure of VGLPNSR-Ca was predicted. In addition, the calcium absorption rate of VGLPNSR-Ca in Caco-2 cell monolayer was 31.97%, twice as high as calcium absorption of calcium chloride, proving that VGLPNSR-Ca can effectively improve the bioavailability of calcium. © 2019, Higher Education Press.

According to supposed mechanism during formation process of SnO2 nanorods, tiny crystal nucleus of Sn(OH)2 and a bit of SnCO3 are generated from SnCl2 and urea. Then the crystal nucleus gather together to form a nanorod. With continued reaction, nanorods gather together to form sheets and the sheets grow up to lamellar morphology and the intermediate decomposes into SnO because of the hydrothermal process. The SnO intermediate convert to SnO2 with sheets breaking to nanorods after calcination.

In this study, we performed the whole-exome sequencing of Han Chinese patients with familial and/or early-onset Alzheimer's disease, followed by independent validation, imaging analysis and function characterization. We identified an exome-wide significant rare missense variant rs3792646 (p.K420Q) in the C7 gene in the discovery stage (P = 1.09 × 10−6, odds ratio = 7.853) and confirmed the association in different cohorts and a combined sample (1615 cases and 2832 controls, Pcombined = 2.99 × 10−7, odds ratio = 1.930). The risk allele was associated with decreased hippocampal volume and poorer working memory performance in early adulthood, thus resulting in an earlier age of disease onset. Overexpression of the mutant p.K420Q disturbed cell viability, immune activation and β-amyloid processing. Electrophysiological analyses showed that the mutant p.K420Q impairs the inhibitory effect of wild type C7 on the excitatory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons. These findings suggested that C7 is a novel risk gene for Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese. © The Author(s) 2018.

Analysis of measurements of air pollutants form a fundamental basis for understanding the characteristics of air pollution and are important references for policy-making. In this study, five-year measurements of air pollutants at 6 sites in Lhasa, a typical high altitude big city in southwestern China, were analyzed from January 2013 to December 2017. Air pollutants at all the 6 sites in Lhasa generally displayed similar patterns of both diurnal and monthly variations, indicating the mixed atmospheric environment and the overall effect of the meteorological conditions in the city. Spatially, the air pollutant concentrations at the 6 sites were generally characterized by high concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 at urban sites and high O3 concentrations at suburban sites. In comparison with other provincial capital cities in China, Lhasa has low concentrations of air pollutants, except for O3, and thus, better air quality. Although Lhasa has experienced rapid urbanization and economic development, air pollution conditions have remained rather stable and even decreased slightly in term of particular air pollutants. We suggested that the relatively isolated location, low air pollutant emissions associated with its industrial structure and renewable energy consumption, and effective air pollution control measures, collectively contributed to the synchronous improvement of the economy and air quality in Lhasa. Such 'Lhasa pattern' may serve as a positive example for other regional hub cities in China and beyond that experience socioeconomic development and simultaneously seek to improve air quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","49","Air pollution control","Air quality - Economic and social effects - Economics - Energy utilization - Industrial emissions - Particles (particulate matter) - Quality control - Urban growth","Air pollutant concentrations - Air pollutant emission - Analysis of measurements - Atmospheric environment - Economic and social development - Meteorological condition - Renewable energy consumption - Socio-economic development","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2016070, Acronym: YIPA, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association; Number: XDA20040501, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41630748, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: SKLCS-OP-2019-07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science; ","This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( XDA20040501 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41630754 , 41630748 ) and State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science ( SKLCS-ZZ-2019 and SKLCS-OP-2019-07 ).

This study selected the Liangshan town watershed to quantify variation in the vertical zonality of rill erodibility (kr) in China's ecologically fragile Hengduan Mountains. Soil types comprised of yellow–brown (soil A), purple (soil B), and dry-red (soil C) in a descending order of occurrence from the summit to the valley, which roughly corresponds to the vertical climate zone (i.e. cool-high mountain, warm-low mountain, and dry-hot valley sections) of the study area. With elevation, vertical soil zonality varied in both soil organic matter (SOM) content and soil particle-size fractions. A series of rill erosion-based scour experiments were conducted, using water discharge rates of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mL min-1. Additionally, detachment rates (Dr) were measured under three hydrological conditions (the drainage, saturation, and seepage treatments). Results show that both Dr and flow shear stress () values increased as discharge increased. As elevation increased, the kr values decreased, while the vertical zonality of critical shear stress (c) values showed no obvious variation. The highest kr values were observed during the seepage treatment, followed by the saturation treatment then drainage treatment, indicating that variation in vertical hydraulic gradients could significantly alter kr values. This study also found that land-use types could also alter kr and c values. Further research, however, is necessary to better quantify the effects of subsurface hydrological conditions and land-use types on kr under different soil zonalities in China's Hengduan Mountains. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","55","Soils","Erosion - Land use - Landforms - Particle size - Seepage - Shear flow - Shear stress","Critical shear stress - Hydrological condition - Rill erosion - Soil erodibility - vertical zonality",,"Number: 2017ZX07101-001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment; Number: 2015CB452704, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2017YFC0505102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); ","Acknowledgements—Financial support for this study was provided by the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China (2015CB452704), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0505102), and the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2017ZX07101-001).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Nevertheless, little is known about the role and the underlying mechanism of miR-16 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) methotrexate resistance. In this study, we firstly examined the miR-16 expression in the serum and synovial fluid from RA patients who were unresponsive to methotrexate monotherapy (UR-MTX patients) and responsive RA patients (R-MTX patients). Secondly, the miR-16 expression was measured in both fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLS) and methotrexate resistance RA-FLS cells (FLS-MTX). FLS cells used in this study were isolated from synovial tissue specimens obtained from patients with RA who underwent total joint replacement. FLS-MTX cells were conducted by gradually increasing the concentration of methotrexate in the medium. The construction of FLS-MTX cells was confirmed by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay. Thirdly, in order to further investigate the role of miR-16 in FLS-MTX cells, we introduced miR-16 inhibitor into FLS-MTX cells to knockdown the expression of miR-16, used fluorescence quantitative PCR to detect the inhibition efficiency. The effects of miR-16 inhibition on cell viability, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in FLS-MTX cells were monitored with MTT and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. And the regulation of miR-16 on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was performed using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Fourthly, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-κB pathway inhibitor, was applied to verify the mechanism by which miR-16 involved in to regulate the P-gp expression, and thus contributing to the methotrexate resistance in FLS-MTX cells. MiR-16 was upregulated in the in serum and synovial fluid from UR-MTX patients as well as in FLS-MTX cells. Inhibition of miR-16 re-sensitized the FLS-MTX cells to methotrexate by suppressing the cell viability, cell promoting cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and enhancing apoptosis. Knockdown of miR-16 significantly reduced MDR1 mRNA expression and P-gp protein expression in FLS-MTX cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB pathway by PDTC reinforced the effect of miR-16 knockdown on P-gp expression, cell viability, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In conclusion, our study illustrated that inhibition of miR-16 in FLS-MTX cells alleviated methotrexate resistance by inhibiting MDR1/P-gp expression through inactivation of the NF-κB pathway.

Combined with GIS technology and statistical analysis, based on the actual situation of water shortage, limited land resources and the prominent contradiction between the supply and demand of water-soil resources in the karst mountain area of southeast Yunnan province. This paper studies the coupling coordination relationship between the water-soil resources utilization and eco-environment in karst rocky region and evaluated the coupling coordination degree between the utilization of water-soil resources and the eco-environment by using the entropy weighting method and the system coupling theory. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation between water-soil resources utilization and eco-environment parameters precisely. On this basis, the stress response mechanism of social and economic development and water-soil resources under the constraint of water-soil resources is further discussed by using impulse response function simulation, so as to provide theoretical and technical support for the sustainable development of regional water-soil resources. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","5","Water resources","Economics - Environmental management - Impulse response - Landforms - Planning - Soils - Sustainable development","Coordination degree - Entropy weighting method - Human activities - Impulse response functions - Social and economic development - Spatial and temporal variation - Supply and demand - Technical support","444 Water Resources - 454.1 Environmental Engineering, General - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 912.2 Management - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The as-prepared CaTiO3 tetragonal microrods with vertical V-type holes were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM and selected area electron diffraction. In order to understand the formation mechanism of the CaTiO3 tetragonal microrods with vertical V-type holes, a series of KOH concentration- and time-dependent experiments were carried out. Generally, low KOH concentrations lead to slow formation of calcium titanate species and a subsequent mild crystallization to CaTiO3 perovskite. Moreover, the dehydration and condensation of the K2Ti6O13 nanofibers and Ca(OH)2 precipitates for the calcium titanate species lead to a Ca2+ ion substitution for K+ ions in the lattice of the layered K2Ti6O13 nanofibers. In consequence, some K2Ti6O13 nanofibers are embedded in the originally formed CaTiO3 tetragonal particles and the single-crystalline perovskite CaTiO3 tetragonal microrods with vertical V-type holes along the [010] direction are derived by the dissolution of the embedded K2Ti6O13 nanofibers at a moderately low KOH concentration of ca. 1.0 mol L-1. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","31","Perovskite","Crystalline materials - Electron diffraction - Field emission microscopes - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydrated lime - Hydrothermal synthesis - Nanofibers - Potassium hydroxide - Scanning electron microscopy","Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Formation mechanism - High-resolution TEM - Hydrothermal routes - Perovskite CaTiO3 - Selected area electron diffraction - Single-crystalline - Tetragonal particles","482.2 Minerals - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: LY18E020001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; Number: 51602282, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation, China, under grant No. LY18E020001 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under grant No. 51602282.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We used well-known classification methods to diagnose the affected regions of the brain at different stages of age using biomarker modalities and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at the resting state, and later marked the affected brain region on MRI. We have used well-known support vector machine (SVM), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, artificial neural network, and logistic regression for the classification of AD. In the context of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, an SVM provided the best classification among AD stages.

Although several studies have addressed individual environmental elements in the study area, efforts for integrated analysis of environmental factors and human settlements are still lacking. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial distribution of physical environments for human settlements to support population distribution planning. This study includes 10 factors (topography, landform, vegetation, elevation, fault, rock, soil, earthquake intensity, temperature, and precipitation) as indicators for the assessment of human settlement suitability based on the analytic hierarchy process and grey correlation methods. Geographic information system functions were used to help understand the spatial distribution of human settlements and the causal factors. This study reveals different spatial units of the watershed suitable for human habitation from the viewpoint of physical environment and provides recommendations for urban planning and siting, land use planning, and disaster mitigation in the watershed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).
