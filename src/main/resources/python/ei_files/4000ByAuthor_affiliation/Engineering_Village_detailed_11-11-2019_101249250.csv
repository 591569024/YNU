EGCG is the most abundant, active, and thoroughly investigated compound in green tea, and its bioactivity might be improved by complexing with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). We investigated interactions between four catechins and β-CD in a PBS buffer solution of pH 6.5 at 25 °C using biolayer interferometry and isothermal titration calorimetry, and to determine whether β-CD could enhance the anti-osteoclastogenesis effect of EGCG. β-CD could directly bind galloylated catechins at a stoichiometric ratio close to 1 : 1, with high specificities and affinities, and these inclusion interactions were primarily enthalpy-driven processes. We synthesized the EGCG-β-CD complex and identified it using infrared radiation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.

We propose a new carbon monolayer, named hexagonal-4,4,4-graphyne (H4,4,4-graphyne), which is a nanoporous structure composed of rectangular carbon rings and triple bonds of carbon. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the structure, stability, and band structure of this new material. We found that its total energy is lower than that of experimentally synthesized β-graphdiyne and it is stable at least up to 1500 K. In contrast to the single Dirac point band structure of other 2D carbon monolayers, the band structure of H4,4,4-graphyne exhibits double Dirac points along the high-symmetry points and the corresponding Fermi velocities (1.04–1.27 × 106 m/s) are asymmetric and higher than that of graphene. The origin of these double Dirac points is traced back to the nodal line states, which can be well explained by a tight-binding model. The H4,4,4-graphyne forms a moiré superstructure when placed on top of a hexagonal boron nitride substrate.

Taking the hydropower-rich power grid with hundreds of plants in China southwest as engineering background, this paper developed a new practical method for short-term hydropower scheduling based on dimension reduction of operation characteristics. In this method, all plants were divided into several types using system level, spatial properties, operation requirements, special scheduling needs, etc. A correction strategy of spill water based on peaking operation, and a load balanced reduction strategy during off-peak periods, were proposed to analyze the given generation schedules and adjust them suitably. An optimization model with the objective of minimum total water consumption and the fixed total generation profile was formulated to optimize the load distribution among cascaded hydropower plants. An optimization model for peak-shaving of large and major cascaded hydropower plants was given to meet the peak loads. Besides, a method with equal load rate for the automatic generation control (AGC) hydropower plants was designed to balance the load demands at all periods. The proposed method was verified by making day-ahead schedules of 162 hydropower plants in Yunnan power grid. The results show that the method can quickly give reasonable operation results, satisfying the requirements of timeliness and practicability of real-world operations. © 2019 Chin. Soc. for Elec.

Meanwhile, the factors influencing the accuracy of calibration are also analyzed. Finally, the direction of improving the measurement work is determined. These results show that the measurement error of this system in the calibration region is mainly composed of the radiometric calibration error and random error, whose values are 2.4719% and 0.0790%, respectively. In addition, the composite error is 2.4732%. For most of excellent astronomy sites, the atmospheric radiation intensity is far lower than the calibration value, and thus the extrapolation measurement is unavoidable. The estimation results of the extrapolation measurement errors indicate that the extrapolation measurement can lead to relatively high measurement errors. Therefore, in order to improve the precision of atmospheric background radiation measurement, the standard radiation sources with low radiation intensity are indispensable.

The proposed GMDH–GA model was constructed, trained, and tested based on a collection of 84 actual datasets collected from the Shur river dam region. In the modeling, four input parameters were considered: maximum charge per delay, distance between the blasting point and monitoring station, powder factor and rock mass rating. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and variance account for (VAF), as the statistical performance indices, were used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed GMDH–GA model. Consequently, the results indicate that the predicted values using the GMDH–GA model are in excellent agreement with the actual data (with the R2 of 0.988), which demonstrate the reliability of the GMDH–GA model. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","71","Coefficient of performance","Blasting - Data handling - Experimental reactors - Genetic algorithms - Mean square error - Soft computing","Air overpressure - Blasting operations - Coefficient of determination - Group method of data handling - Monitoring stations - Root mean square errors - Statistical performance - Undesirable effects","621 Nuclear Reactors - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We developed an efficient method for arsenic (As) removal and biomass reduction of As-rich biomass of the As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata by coupling ethanol extraction with anaerobic digestion. This study assessed As partitioning among the three phases (gas, liquid and solid) after anaerobic digestion of P. vittata biomass. Biomass with and without As was first extracted with ethanol. Ethanol extraction removed ~93% As, with remaining As concentration at 197 mg kg−1. The extracted biomass was then digested at 35 °C under anaerobic conditions for 35 d. Arsenic in the digested biomass was reduced by 89%, with remaining As concentration at 60 mg kg−1. In addition, anaerobic digestion reduced the biomass by 64–71% and decreased the volatile solids content from 94 to 15–18%. Methane production was 145 and 160 LNCH4/kgVS after 35 d for As-rich and control biomass, respectively. As a final step, As concentration in anaerobic digestate supernatant was reduced to 0.26 mg L−1 by As-Mg precipitation. Overall, coupling ethanol extraction with anaerobic digestion decreased As concentration in P. vittata biomass from 2665 to 60 mg kg−1, or by 98%. At this level (−1), P. vittata biomass can be considered a safe material based on USEPA regulations.

Firstly, bifurcation analyses are carried out to show that the Filippov predator-prey ecosystem may have very complex dynamics, i.e. the system may have periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic solutions, as well as period doubling bifurcations. Meanwhile, the model is analyzed theoretically and numerically to understand how resource limitation and periodic forcing affect pest population outbreaks, the intersection between the initial densities (pest and natural enemy populations) and pest control has been discussed. Furthermore, the sliding surface, sliding mode dynamics, the existence and stability of sliding periodic solution of the proposed model and its application in IPM strategy are investigated. Our results show that several hidden factors can adversely affect our control strategy in limited resource and fluctuating environment.

Firstly, the typical characteristics of settlement curve are analyzed from the aspect of geomechanics theory and based on the grey theory, the grey Verhulst model (GVM) with unequal time-interval is proposed. Then, according to the theory of Markov chain, the grey Verhulst model is built to revise the relative residuals of the GVM, in which the effects of volatility characteristics can be considered. Finally, the PSOMGVM model based on PSO algorithm and Markov chain is set up, which whitens the parameters of the grey interval.

Providing cognition on the effects of the policy on the distribution of dominant species is important to better understand plant community structures, development dynamics, regeneration conditions, and possible underlying ecological mechanisms. The purport of this study is to inspect the population structure of Pinus yunnanensis in a 2500 m2 area of abandoned farmland where restituted to forest in 2004. The results showed that the population structure of P. yunnanensis settled on tree age formed an inverted J-distribution (20.1% seedlings, 34.2% young trees, 38.5% middle-aged trees, and 7.1% adult trees) since 2009, whereas seedlings, young trees, and middle-aged trees showed clustered distribution. Seedlings showed the highest aggregation degree (g(r) = 6.4), followed by young trees (g(r) = 2.3) and middle-aged trees (g(r) = 1.7), but a random distribution showed in adults throughout the research area. The spatial relationships among seedlings, young trees, middle-aged trees, and adults indicated that the aggregation consequences increased with the decreasing difference in the diameter at breast height. Furthermore, the correlation of canopy height and diameter at breast height decreased with the increasing competition among the individuals signified that seedlings and young trees growing in the same area might use fewer resources than needed. Generally, the study illustrated that intra-specific competition due to environmental resources is a rarely occurring event. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","53","Reforestation","Conservation - Farms - Population distribution - Spatial distribution","Density dependent - Diameter-at-breast heights - Ecological mechanisms - Environmental resources - Intraspecific competition - Population structures - Sloping land - Spatial distribution patterns","405.3 Surveying - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 921 Mathematics","Number: 41361046, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41761040, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by grants of the National Natural Science Foundations of China (41761040 and 41361046), Research project "Innovation in Culture Adaptation: Fostering Sustainable Community-Based Natural Resource Management in the South-Western Ethnic Minority Region, China (15XSH023).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We report a comprehensive study of the interlayer coupling effect on the magnetization dynamics in [Ni/Co]4/Ru(tRu)/[Co/Ni]3 perpendicular magnetic films by the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect approach. By controlling the antiferromagnetic (AF) interlayer coupling field Hex and external magnetic field H, we demonstrate distinctly different dynamic behaviors upon laser excitation. First, three kinds of demagnetization process, including nonchange, ultrafast increase, or decrease in Kerr signal, can occur within the short time delay of 2 ps. Second, in the relaxation process, in addition to the normal coherent precession, an additional out-of-phase mode is detected for the AF-coupled samples, whose amplitude and frequency depend also strongly on Hex and H. The H-dependent frequency curves of both modes are well interpreted with the deduced analytical expression by taking the bilinear and biquadratic coupling into account. Additionally, the magnetic damping of optical mode not only is coupling-dependent but also shows a strong peak at a critical field Hcrit, which is found to scale with Hex. These results provide new insights into the magnetic dynamics in perpendicularly exchange-coupled systems for spintronic applications with ultrafast control of information operation.

Fe(AC)2/o-HPBA/PVP/DMF(N,N-Dimethylformamide) slurries are first electrospunned into three-dimensional (3D) networks. Due to the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged –O− groups surrounding N and B atoms, N and B atoms can be kept far away from each other. Upon optimizing o-HPBA dosages, the maximum amount of isolated B and N atoms are successfully doped into the 3D porous iron carbide (Fe3C) embedded B and N co-doped carbon fibers (Fe3C@B1.0NPCFs) networks with tiny B–N clusters. Electrochemical measure results demonstrate that Fe3C@B1.0NPCFs exhibit much better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity than 20 wt% Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte. In acidic electrolyte, Fe3C@B1.0NPCFs also displays ORR activity comparable to Pt/C (its onset and half-wave potentials are just 40 and 50 mV more negative than those of Pt/C). Moreover, Fe3C@B1.0NPCFs show better stability and methanol tolerance ability than Pt/C for ORR in both alkaline and acidic solutions.

Conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are prone to be trapped at a local maximum power point (LMPP), which is inadequate to achieve MPPT in practice. This paper designs a novel MPPT algorithm called modified salp swarm algorithm (MSSA). Based on original salp swarm algorithm (SSA), memetic algorithm is firstly introduced into MSSA. Then, multiple slap chains are employed to improve the global exploration and local exploita-tion. Meanwhile, salp chains are regrouped by information sharing between all salps in community for the enhance-ment of convergence stability. Three case studies are carried out, including constant temperature and constant solar irradiation, constant temperature and varying solar irradiation, as well as varying temperature and varying solar irradia-tion. Simulation results demonstrate that MSSA could achieve the fastest and most stable global MPPT under PSC in comparison to incremental conductance (INC), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and SSA, Lastly, a dSpace based hardware-in-loop (HIL) test is undertaken which validates the im-plementation feasibility of MSSA. © 2019, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

Here, we combined down-core analyses of sedimentary mercury (Hg) and aluminum (Al) with multiple proxies (i.e. nitrogen stable isotope, chlorophyll a pigments, diatoms) for a radiometrically-dated sediment core of an alpine lake in southeast Tibet to track the atmospheric deposition of pollutants, and to examine possible effects of climate and catchment forcing over the past three centuries. The sediment data revealed that airborne deposition of Hg was recorded from the ~1860s, with an accelerating increase in anthropogenic Hg flux since the ~1960s. A synchronous decrease in reconstructed lake-water TOC indicated that acid deposition may have affected lake-water carbon concentrations and impaired catchment export of decomposed organic matter (OM). A moderate depletion of bulk sediment δ15N started from the ~1820s, but was followed by an enriching trend after the ~1970s. This positive shift of δ15N was associated with elevated sediment OM and decreased catchment runoff of clastic materials (as inferred by Al). Sediment OM content displayed an accelerating increase from the ~1960s, with an increased input of autochthonous sources (i.e. lower bulk sediment C:N ratios), such as algae (as inferred by sedimentary chlorophyll a pigments). Meanwhile, climate warming and decreased lake-water TOC enhanced the production of algae, which was characterized by a more enriched δ15N signal than that of allochthonous OM. Furthermore, atmospheric acid deposition was significantly related to diatom assemblage changes, with an increase in acidophilous taxa. Our sediment evidence revealed the dominating impact of climate and catchment processes on lake-water chemistry and algal shifts in the context of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and highlighted an increasing link of external forcing with in-lake processes in enriching sediment δ15N signal over the last few decades. © 2018","79","Lake pollution","Air pollution - Algae - Aluminum coatings - Atmospheric chemistry - Catchments - Chlorophyll - Concentration (process) - Isotopes - Lakes - Meteorological problems - Nitrogen - Runoff - Sedimentology - Sediments","Atmospheric depositions - Catchment erosion - Climate warming - Lake waters - Nitrogen stable isotope","442.1 Flood Control - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451 Air Pollution - 453 Water Pollution - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Core; Number: 2017YFA0605202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: A3, Acronym: CRS, Sponsor: Cancer Research Society; Number: 41171048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1133601, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 213034A, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","This work was supported by National Key R & D Program of China [ 2017YFA0605202 ], Ministry of Education of China [ 213034A ], and National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 41171048 , U1133601 ].

In this study, we imaged the azimuthal anisotropy of the Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity in the period range of 10–60 s beneath SE Tibet. The model provides seismological evidence for the existence of asthenospheric upwelling beneath the Indo-China block (ICB) and east-central Tibet. Stratified anisotropy architectures around the Eastern Himalaya Syntaxis (EHS) are observed, and the upper boundary of the subducting Indian slab at least extended to the center Lhasa block (LSB). Additionally, our models also reveal the complex deformation pattern of different blocks in the crust and upper mantle beneath SE Tibet, and the crustal deformation is much more complicated than that of the upper mantle. The EHS and LSB are deformed in the whole crust, which is affected by the subducting Indian lithosphere. The Qiangtang block, ICB and Songpan-Ganzi block deformation was mainly controlled by the strikes of the faults and the west-east tectonic movement of the plateau materials. The deformation of the Sichuan-Yunnan diamond block is related to mid-lower crustal flow. In the upper mantle, the fast-propagation directions of most of the blocks match the fast-polarization directions of SKS and the absolute plate motion, excluding the ICB and east-central Tibet. Based on the combined results of the isotropic and anisotropic models and previous studies, two dynamic models are proposed to shed new light on the complex deformation and dynamics processes in SE Tibet. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","108","Deformation","Anisotropy - Phase velocity - Rayleigh waves - Tomography","Asthenospheric upwelling - Azimuthal anisotropy - Lithospheric structure - Mantle dynamics - Rayleigh wave tomography","484 Seismology - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 746 Imaging Techniques - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: -, Acronym: WHU, Sponsor: Wuhan University; Number: Wuhan, Acronym: CUGB, Sponsor: China University of Geosciences, Beijing; Number: 2017ZX02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015IC015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41704046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41474093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41874169, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Seismic data were acquired from the Earthquake Administration of Yunnan Province and IRIS Data Management Center.

It is still a technical challenge to be taken into account the impact of complex spatio-temporal contexts of service invocations and make use of their characteristics in the forecasting process. To this end, we propose two universal spatio-temporal context-aware collaborative neural models (STCA-1 and STCA-2)to make QoS prediction by considering invocation time and multiple spatial features both of service-side and user-side. Our proposed models utilize hierarchical neural networks to realize the embedding expression of original features, the generation of second-order features, the fusion of first-order and second-order features, the interaction between spatial features and temporal features layer by layer. In particular, attention mechanism is introduced to automatically assign weights to spatial features and realize the discriminative application in feature fusion. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: (1)The prediction error can be significantly reduced in comparison with the baseline methods particularly in the case of sparse training data, where our models achieve a performance improvement by about 10.9–21.0% in term of MAE and NMAE, and by 2.4–7.8% in term of RMSE.

When facing these markets, the small and medium manufacturers are usually weak and risk sensitive vis-à-vis their counterpart power retailers, like Walmart, Carrefour, and TESCO. Therefore, human estimations on uncertain market information given by experienced experts and risk sensitivity of the weak manufacturers are of great significance for the optimal pricing strategies. Accordingly, this paper investigates the pricing decision problem in an uncertain supply chain where two risk-sensitive manufacturers distribute substitutable products into the same market through a common dominant and risk-neutral retailer. Uncertainty theory is employed to deal with human-estimation information and chance-constrained programming models are proposed to formulate the pricing decision problem with risk sensitivity. Moreover, numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Interestingly, we show that the results critically depend on the comparison between how much the demands and manufacturing costs of two competing products change with the manufacturers’ risk-sensitivity levels. Correspondingly, based on the estimated uncertainty distributions of uncertain variables by experts, the weak manufacturers are suggested to adjust their risk-sensitivity levels strategically for their profitability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","49","Costs","Commerce - Computer programming - Decision theory - Manufacture - Risk perception - Sales - Supply chains - Uncertainty analysis","Chance-constrained programming - Chance-constrained programming model - Numerical experiments - Pricing decision - Risk averse - Substitutable products - Uncertainty distributions - Uncertainty theory","723.1 Computer Programming - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 912 Industrial Engineering and Management - 913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing - 913.4 Manufacturing - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Grid-based clustering maps data streams into grid structures to form data summaries, and then clusters data summaries. This method usually has high efficiency, but each grid is processed independently, and the interaction between the grids is not considered, so the clustering quality needs to be improved. In this study, the coupling relationship between grids is considered rather than processed independently in the clustering process, and an algorithm for clustering data stream based on grid coupling is proposed. The proposed approach improves the quality of clusters as the coupling of the grid more accurately captures the correlation amongst the data.

The relationships between LST and land use/land cover types, vegetation coverage and impermeable surfaces are analyzed, and those relationships between surface temperatures and impervious surfaces, vegetation, bare land and water bodies are studied quantitatively. The results show that the influence of the impervious surface on LST is much larger than that of vegetation, bare land and water bodies. The main factors affecting the surface temperature of Taiyuan City in the past 14 years are identified.

In addition, analytical solution of stress components near crack tip is added to stress function applying to complementary energy functional. When the number of the holes is over a hundred thousand, the ordinary finite element needs about hundreds of millions of meshes which are solved impossibly. However, there is the characteristic of keeping the number of grids with hole number in new Voronoi cell which makes large scale simulation possible.

In this paper, we introduce a new mechanism of punishment that the punishment fine can be multiplied if there are several punishers decide to punish a defector, which leads to a low payoff of defector and promotes the level of cooperation. This mechanism can simulate group hunt which is common in natural animal world, for example, in biological system, a pack of animal in which every individual cooperates with each other can hunt a prey which is stronger than an individual inside the pack. This phenomenon can be explained by that the ability of punishment is multiplied by individuals cooperating with each other to carry out the punishment. A pack of wolves can make the process of hunt easier than the hunt implemented by a lone wolf, inspired by which we construct this mechanism of punishment to simulate the group punishment. Interestingly, we find that this mechanism can dramatically promotes the level of cooperation when we compare the simulation result with traditional evolutionary public good game. In order to figure out how our new mechanism of punishment promotes the cooperation, we have drawn several figures below to explain the mechanism.

Identifying human essential genes helps us to study the functions of human genes, but also provides a way for finding potential targets for cancer and other diseases. Recently, with the publishing of human essential gene data and the availability of a large amount of biological data, some computational methods have been proposed to predict human essential genes based on genes’ DNA sequence or their topological properties in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. However, there is still some room to improve the prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel supervised method to predict human essential genes by network embedding protein-protein interaction network. Our method extracts the features of the genes in network by mapping them to a latent space of features that maximally preserves the relationships between the genes and their network neighborhoods. After that, the features are input into a SVM classifier to predict human essential genes. Two human PPI networks are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The prediction results show that our method outperforms the method that only uses genes’ sequence information, but also is obviously superior to the method utilizing genes’ centrality properties in the network as input features. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","38","Genes","Bioinformatics - Embeddings - Forecasting - Proteins - Topology","Essential gene - Feature representation - Network embedding - Prediction accuracy - Protein-protein interaction networks - Sequence informations - Supervised methods - Topological properties","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory","Number: 2016FB107, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31560317, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472133, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61502166, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61502214, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61702122, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560221, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 31560317, No. 61502214, No. 61472133, No. 61502166, No. 61702122 and No. 81560221.

In serotinous populations, the size of the seed bank was 20 times greater than that of non-serotinous populations. The number of seeds stored on the forest floor was considerably lower than the number input by seed rain. Almost all seeds on the floor lost viability within 17 months, and most died during the rainy season. Seed mortality in the canopy was considerably lower than either on or in the soil.

Firstly, the multipoint kurtosis (MKurt) of MOMEDA filtered signal is used as the optimization objective, and the optimal filter size and periodic initial value which matched with the vibration signal can be determined adaptively through multiple iterations of GOA. Secondly, the periodic impact contained in the vibration signal is extracted by the optimized MOMEDA, and the fault features in the impact signal are extracted by Hilbert envelope demodulation. Finally, the simulation signal and bearing signal are processed by the proposed approach. The results show that the introduction of GOA not only solves the problem of parameter selection in MOMEDA, but also achieves better performance compared with other optimization methods. Meanwhile, the feasibility and superiority of the approach are fully proved by comparing it with the three methods MED, MCKD, and FSK after parameter optimization. Therefore, this approach provides a novel way and solution for fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing, gear, and shaft. © 2019 ChengJiang Zhou et al.","47","Signal processing","Entropy - Higher order statistics - Matched filters - Optimization - Parameter estimation - Roller bearings","Feature extraction methods - Minimum entropy deconvolution - Multiple iterations - Optimization algorithms - Optimization method - Parameter optimization - Parameter selection - Simulation signals","601.2 Machine Components - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 703.2 Electric Filters - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The morphological, structural, and chemical contents of the Co7Fe3/NPCSs and other control samples are analyzed by X-ray (powder) diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption–desorption, Raman spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The glucose oxidation and detection performances of each catalyst are evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The experimental results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic abilities of the resultant catalysts toward glucose oxidation decrease in the order of Co7Fe3/NPCSs > Co/NPCSs > CoFe/NPCSs > Fe2C-Co3Fe7/NPCSs > Fe2C/NPCSs. The experimental results prove that a small number of Fe atoms in Co7Fe3 can increase the number of active Co4+ sites. Meanwhile, the ultrafine Co7Fe3 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed along the porous carbon nanosheets’ surfaces, which further improved the dispersion of the abundant electrochemically available active sites. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structures, high-density active sites and excellent electron conductivity, the optimal Co7Fe3/NPCSs display the best glucose detection efficiency of all the catalysts examined. For instance, the Co7Fe3/NPCSs exhibit large sensitivity values (795.28 µA cm−2 mM−1 between 0.001 and 2.20 mM and 401.98 μA cm−2 mM−1 between 2.20 and 14.00 mM), a rapid response time (2.2 s), a low detection limit (1.0 µM), excellent anti-interference toward electroactive molecules, a perfect reproducibility and a superior long-term stability. The Co7Fe3/NPCSs also exhibit a satisfying efficiency for glucose detection in human serum samples.

For each model, the range of VIP values of PLS-DA is wider than the range of the important variables of RF, and PLS-DA was more time-efficient and high-ability than RF model. Besides, the geographical origin PLS-DA classification model with all collected samples was used to verify the results with accuracy rates of calibration set and validation set of 98.34% and 93.78%, respectively.

To address this issue, we present a novel unsupervised robust discriminative manifold embedding approach called URDME, which aims to offer a joint framework of dimensionality reduction, discriminative subspace learning, robust affinity representation and discriminative manifold embedding. The learned robust affinity not only captures the global geometry and intrinsic structure of underlying high-dimensional data, but also satisfies the self-expressiveness property.

The enhanced flow incurred more homogeneous temperature distribution of silicon melts and reduced radial temperature gradient, which then leads to the flatter solid/liquid (s/l) interface. However, as temperature gradient of the crystal increased, thermal stress of the silicon ingot was strengthened as a result.

The main purpose of this paper is to reveal the impact of vegetation change on regional climate simulation over Eastern China. Therefore, we have performed three 30-year simulations from 1982 to 2011 with the WRF model coupled with the Noah land surface model as follows: a control experiment with climatology green vegetation fraction (GVF) (CTL), a sensitive experiment with WRF default climatology GVF (CLMV), and a sensitive experiment with dynamic vegetation (DYNV). The climatology difference between the CTL and CLMV experiment points out that during 1982–2011 over Eastern China, the increase of vegetation causes the decrease of temperature; on the other hand, the increase of temperature often corresponds to the reduction of vegetation. In the meantime, the increase/decrease in GVF is quite consistent with the simulated increase/decrease in precipitation, which is caused by both circulations and water vapor distributions at lower levels. The difference in the temperature trend between the CTL and DYNV experiment is almost opposite to that between the DYNV and GVF trend, which means that the decreased/increased vegetation will increase/decrease the surface air temperature. However, the trend of precipitation variation shows no clear relation with that of GVF. In response to GVF change, the results show that in the vegetation-climate feedback the moisture feedback is dominant over the radiation and momentum feedback. Significant decrease in GVF and LAI is detected across the East China, which leads to the decrease in the latent heat flux and increase in the sensible heat flux. For extremes and heat waves, it is shown that DYNV leads to better stimulation on the maximum of daily maximum temperature (TXx), warm spell days (WSDI), heat wave days (HWNY) and the averaged heat wave duration (HWDU) than CTL does over most of the Southeast China, although it may introduce some new biases in the Eastern coastal regions as well as the Northeastern China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","44","Climate change","Feedback - Heat flux - Vegetation - Well stimulation","East China - Extremes - Precipitation variation - Regional climate simulation - Surface air temperatures - Temperature changes - Vegetation-atmosphere interactions - Water vapor distribution","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 731.1 Control Systems","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Number: 2016YFA0600303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2018YFA0606003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41875124, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work is jointly funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606003, 2016YFA0600303) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41875124).

For the fusion of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography), a novel algorithm is proposed in this paper based on LatentLRR (Latent Low Rank Representation) and gradient transfer. LatentLRR is a meaningful tool for separating out detailed information and saliency information. In order to produce saliency information fused result, image statics is used through the corresponding detailed information. For detailed information, it is separated into high frequency parts and low frequency parts by NSCT (Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform), the former are fused by the method of scale based, and the latter are merged by local energy maxima. To obtain the reconstructed image, it needs to integrate high frequency fused parts and low frequency fused parts into one image by inverse NSCT. Finally, the final image can be given by combining the reconstructed images and saliency information fused result into one image, and for a better visual effect, optimize the final result by gradient transfer. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the experiments of ten pair clinical medical images MRI/CT, the proposed algorithm receives a comprehensive advantage in preserving the detailed and gradient information, not only in visual effects but also in objective evaluation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","37","Image fusion","Computerized tomography - Diagnosis - Image reconstruction - Inverse problems - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging","CT (computed tomography) - Image statics - LatentLRR - Low-rank representations - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Scale based - State-of-the-art methods","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 746 Imaging Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The introduction of p-COFs hinder the recombination of electrons and holes, decreasing their band gap (Eg), thereby which improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Compared with pure porphyrin, p-COFs exhibited enhanced photocurrent intensity. An amplified photocurrent conversion efficiency and enhanced photocurrent results from H2O2, which act as active molecules and electron donors. As an unprecedented application of COFs in PEC bioanalysis, the detection of CRP with a PEC aptasensor is presented. The assembly of a CRP aptamer on the surface of Ag nanoparticles hinders the electron transfer, resulting in the decrease of the photocurrent response.

The phase microstructure and morphologies of Mo and MoSe2 films were evaluated by X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that a relatively high argon pressure during the sputtering process allows Mo films to deposit with a multi-crack structure. The microcracks increase the inner surface area of Mo films and provide a rapid transmission tunnel for selenium diffusion, which allows MoSe2 nanosheets to grow vertically with a c-axis // substrate texture. The growth mechanism for vertically aligned MoSe2 films has been proposed based on the experimental results. The growth orientation of MoSe2 film can be precisely controlled by adjusting the density of Mo film precursor under the same selenization condition.

In this study, the extending lifetime of jute fiber-based biosorbents for sequentially remedying aniline and heavy metal ions was demonstrated by a simple and practical chemical conversion. After jute fibers were firstly used for adsorbing aniline from water, the surface-adsorbed aniline was polymerized by using ammonium persulfate initiator at 5 °C to form a PANI overlayer, and the resulting PANI/jute fiber composites exhibited effective metal ion decontamination from water. The influence of parameters such as sorbent dosage, solution pH and contaminant concentration on the removal efficiency was investigated. The equilibrium adsorption, thermodynamics, kinetics and removal mechanism also were exhibited. The crude jute fibers showed a moderate adsorption capacity of 8.43 mgg−1 for aniline removal. After in-situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of jute fibers, the resulting PANI/jute fiber composites can effectively remove and reduce metal ions. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cd(II) and Cr(VI) reached to 140 and 50 mgg−1 respectively.

Bayesian networks have gradually become one of the hotspots and important achievements in artificial intelligence research. Establishing an effective Bayesian network structure is the foundation and core of the learning and application of Bayesian networks. In Bayesian network structure learning, the traditional method of utilizing expert knowledge to construct the network structure is gradually replaced by the data learning structure method. However, as a result of the large amount of possible network structures, the search space is too large. The method of Bayesian network learning through training data usually has the problems of low precision or high complexity, which make the structure of learning differ greatly from that of reality, which has a great influence on the reasoning and practical application of Bayesian networks. In order to solve this problem, a hybrid optimization artificial bee colony algorithm is discretized and applied to structure learning. A hybrid optimization technique for the Bayesian network structure learning method is proposed.

The components and surface morphology of unused and recycled steel slag were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence, demonstrating the gradual decrease of CaO and FeO. Radical scavenger studies confirmed that all of the O2•-, S O4•- and •OH contributed to the BPA degradation with the contribution of 68.97%, 9.52% and 21.51%, respectively. The degradation efficiency was enhanced in tap water due to the existence of HCO3- and was weakened in municipal wastewater effluent due to the radical scavenge by other organics. A redox mechanism was proposed and claimed that both the base oxides and iron oxides of steel slag were responsible for the peroxydisulfate activation.

Our group has focused on the application of chemical looping gasification (CLG) with a PG oxygen carrier characterized by high silicon content. FactSage 7.1 software was used for the thermodynamic simulation analysis of the reaction mechanism and reaction characteristics at different temperatures. Experiments were conducted at a laboratory scale in a fixed-bed facility with lignite as fuel using PG as an oxygen carrier and N2/H2O as gasifying agents at a temperature of 1173 K. We investigated the gasification performance and silicon transfer behavior during chemical looping gasification using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results indicated that the silicon in PG participated in the production of syngas through a series of parallel and tandem side reactions (R10-R15) during the reduction process. The high-silicon PG was more conducive to syngas production than the desilicated PG during the reduction process of CLG under the investigated experimental conditions. At 1173 K, the sequence of the parallel reactions was R15 > R8 > R12 > R9, suggesting that an increase in the silicon content inhibited the production of H2S (R8) by increasing the silicon content, which is highly desirable for a clean production process. In CLG, the silicon in the fresh oxygen carrier PG was transformed from SiO2 into CaSiO3, Ca3SiO7, and Ca2SiO4; distributed unevenly; and attached to the surface of CaSO4 after eight cycles.

(2) At 1173 K, the sequence of the parallel reactions was R15 , R8 , R12 , and R9 , suggesting that an increase in SiO 2 content inhibited the production of H 2 S (R8); this is highly desirable for the clean production process of PG as an OC.

For this, we present a Social Regularized Collaborative Metric Learning model (SRCML) for item recommendation. SRCML first defines a similarity function which integrates social preferences and rating preferences to measure user similarity, and then constructs a regularization component to reconstruct the loss function of collaborative metric learning, so that users with similar hobbies are closer to each other in the metric space. At the same time, the metric function that measures the distance between the users and the items is optimized. Finally, a model learning method based on gradient descent is given.

The gradual leaching of 137Cs into the lower strata of surface soils in exposed areas are likely to facilitate higher bioavailability to the mycelia of this species which penetrate to relatively greater depths and may account for the continuing high activity levels noticed in Polish samples (e.g. activity within caps in some locations was still at 11,000 Bq kg−1 dw in 2008 relative to a peak of 18,000 in 2002). The associated dietary intake levels of 137Cs have often exceeded the tolerance limits set by the European Union (370 and 600 Bq kg−1 ww for children and adults respectively) during the years 1996–2010. Human dietary exposure to 137Cs is influenced by the method of food preparation and may be mitigated by blanching followed by disposal of the water, rather than direct consumption after stir-frying or stewing. It may be prudent to provide precautionary advice and monitor activity levels, as this mushroom continues to be foraged by casual as well as experienced mushroom hunters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","118","Fungi","Biochemistry - Food products - Soil pollution - Soils","Contaminated soils - Exposure - Forest - Human dietary exposures - Long-lived radionuclides - Northern Hemispheres - Radiocaesium - Radiotoxicity","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 822.3 Food Products","","Technical assistance by Katarzyna Barg&lstrok;owska, Ada Borkowska, Ilona Bochentin, Karolina Czapiewska, Anna Dry&#380;a&lstrok;owska, Dorota G&oacute;rska, Aleksandra Jab&lstrok;o&#324;ska, Gra&#380;yna (Jarzy&#324;ska) Krasi&#324;ska), Anna K.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to prepare CoP nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on N, P dual-doped carbon (NPC) electrocatalysts with high concentration N and P dopants through a pyrolysis-deposition-phosphidation process. The great bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both HER (the overpotential of 98 mV and 86 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively) and OER (the overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte) were achieved. When CoP@NPC hybrid was used as two electrodes in the 1 M KOH electrolyte system for overall water splitting, the needed cell potential for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 1.6 V, and it also showed superior stability for HER and OER after 10 h’ test with almost negligible decay. Experimental results revealed that the P atoms in CoP were the active sites for HER and the CoP@NPC hybrid showed excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic properties due to the synergistic effects between the high catalytic activity of CoP NPs and NPC, in which the doping of N and P in carbon led to a stronger polarization between Co and P in CoP, promoting the charge transfer from Co to P in CoP, enhancing the catalytic activity of P sites and Co sites in CoP for HER and OER, respectively. Specifically, the improvements could result from the changed charge state, the increased active specific surface area, and the facilitated reaction kinetics by N, P co-doping and admixture.

The metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) provides a simple, convenient, low-cost and high efficient approach to fabricate Si NWs, which is most likely to achieve large-scale commercial application and has aroused considerable attention in the past decades. The processes of preparing silicon nanowires by metal-assisted chemical etching can be separated into two steps. First, a layer of metal (Ag, Au, Pt, et al. ) nanoparticles is deposited on the surface of clean silicon wafer to oxidize the nearby silicon atoms. Then dissolve the oxide layer by HF and etch the silicon wafer to form an array of Si NWs. Nevertheless, this simple and efficient approach for preparing Si NWs presents several uncontrollable defects. Firstly, the deposited metal nanoparticles on silicon wafer surface would gradually grow larger and agglomerate together, resulting in low density of Si NWs. Secondly, nonuniformity distribution of metal nanoparticles on silicon wafer not only leads to relatively wide diameter range (50-200 nm) of the fabricated nanowires, but also causes the disorder of nanowire arrays and the difficulty to control their spacing. Thirdly, it is commonly observed that long nanowire clusters at tips, due to van der Waals. In view of the problems in conventional approaches and the requirements of diverse devices for the morphology, types and diameters of the silicon nanowires, therefore, recent studies have focused on reducing of clusters at the top of nanowires, regulating the surface roughness and diameter of nanowires, and preparing ordered silicon nanowires at low cost. Notable progress has been achieved in optimizing the conventional MACE methods, which can be concluded as follow. . Pre-surface treatment of silicon wafer using acid solution or UV/Ozone will improve the uniformity of nanowire arrays as well as increase the density (from 18% to 38%). . Depositing a layer of metal nano-film on the surface of silicon wafer by physical vapor deposition, followed by etching, can effectively reduce the clusters and improve the uniformity of nanowire diameter. . Template methods (polystyrene spheres templates, porous anodic alumina templates, silica templates, and photoresist templates, etc. ) can realize the fabrication of ordered nanowire arrays. The controllable diameter of polystyrene nanoparticles, ranging from 30 nm to 90 nm, were successfully prepared by ion beam etching technology in our research group, which pave an effective way for preparing ordered Si NWs with small size (less than 100 nm). In this article, the basic synthetic processes and fundamental etching mechanism of MACE are briefly introduced. Specifically, the impact of type of silicon substrate, the concentration of etching solution, temperature and etching time on the morphology, surface roughness, etching direction and etching rate of Si NWs are discussed. The mechanism of etching path deviation from the vertical direction under excessive amount of H2O2 and the reason for the variation of etching rate with the solution concentration are explained by the relevant theories. Emphasis is put on the research progress of reducing the cluster at the top of nanowires, improving uniformity, preparing ordered nanowires with controllable diameters and spacing by approaches including pretreatment of silicon wafer using oxidation layer, deposition of metal nanofilms using physical method, the treatment of annealing and template method. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

This study investigated the implications of monsoon fluctuation and regional topography on precipitation variation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, and it examined the potential link between monsoons and river flow. The results indicated that the fluctuations of the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) played different roles in precipitation variation. The areas in which precipitation variation was found synchronous with the WNPSM were much larger than those associated with the ISM. Significant positive correlation was found between precipitation during June-September (JJAS) and the WNPSM index (WNPMI) and the ISM index (IMI) over 29.3% and 12.8% of the basin, respectively, and that these areas were distributed mainly on the left and right bank downstream, respectively. A strong (weak) WNPSM was found to increase (decrease) moist westerlies that caused excess (deficient) orographic precipitation through the interaction with the Annamite Mountains. During strong (weak) WNPSM years, observed river flow during JJAS at the Mukdahan, Pakse, and Stung Treng stations in the downstream area were 8.0% (5.0%), 8.2% (12.6%), and 12.1% (19.5%) higher (lower) than the mean, respectively, showing that downstream river flow is modulated by the WNPSM intensity. These findings could support long-term hydrological predictions, and be beneficial for optimal flood control and water resource utilization in the basin. © 2019 by the authors.","41","Rivers","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Flood control - Stream flow - Topography - Watersheds","Mekong river basins - Monsoon fluctuation - Orographic precipitation - River flow - Spatial and temporal distribution - Water resource utilization - Western north pacific summer monsoons - WNPSM","407.2 Waterways - 442.1 Flood Control - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FB073, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Number: 41601026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are gratefully acknowledging the editors of the journal and the anonymous reviewers for their useful and detailed comments that improved the overall quality of the manuscript.

However, it remains a great challenge to design well-defined P-N heterojunctions, which hinders the achievement of high-performance P-N heterojunction gas sensors as well as the recognition of the P-N-heterojunction-enhanced gas-sensing mechanism. In this work, an α-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite with well-defined core@shell P-N heterojunction nanobelts was prepared via a facile method. Benefitting from a well-defined P-N heterojunction construction, the α-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite exhibited the highest response (Rg/Ra = 20.3) towards 100 ppm acetone, which was 17.2 times higher than that of pristine α-MoO3 (Ra/Rg = 1.18) and 6.6 times higher than that of pristine NiO (Rg/Ra = 3.07). Gas-sensing measurement revealed that the response of n-type α-MoO3 could be greatly improved by anchoring p-type NiO nanosheets. The main mechanism for the enhanced acetone sensing properties of the α-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite was investigated. The well-defined α-MoO3@NiO P-N nanocomposite offered abundant Mo-O-Ni bonds at the heterointerfaces, which could induce the large hole depletion regions in p-type NiO and hence benefit oxygen adsorption and gas-sensing reactions at the interfaces. This work not only demonstrates that the α-MoO3@NiO nanocomposite is a promising material for fabricating acetone sensors but also provides useful guidance for designing well-defined core@shell P-N heterojunctions in gas-sensing applications. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","55","Oil field equipment","Acetone - Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Gas adsorption - Gas detectors - Gas sensing electrodes - Gases - Heterojunctions - Molybdenum oxide - Nanobelts - Nanocomposites - Nickel oxide - Phase interfaces - Shells (structures)","Acetone sensing - Acetone sensor - Depletion region - Gas sensing applications - Gas sensing mechanism - Hetero-interfaces - Oxygen adsorption - P-n heterojunctions","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 511.2 Oil Field Equipment - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 51602134, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51702140, 51602134, 61664005).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although recent studies have reported that exposure to Cu-NPs leads to organ accumulation and obvious toxicity, it remains unclear whether Cu-NPs can be translocated to and cause damage in the uterus. In this study, we investigated the potential for uterine injury and gene expression patterns in female rats exposed to 3.12, 6.25, or 12.5 mg/kg/d Cu-NPs via intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days. The results indicated that exposure to Cu-NPs led to significant decreases in the relative uterine weight coefficients and increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, mitochondrial swelling and vacuolization, shortened and reduced endometrial epithelial cell microvilli, and apoptosis. Furthermore, exposure to Cu-NPs increased malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Signal transduction mechanism studies indicated that exposure to Cu-NPs activated caspases 3, 8, and 9 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (tBid), reduced B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, and increased the expression of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and cytochrome c. A microarray analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of 963 genes; of these, 622 were upregulated and 341 were downregulated. The results of further evaluations of some altered genes, including matrix metallopeptidase 12 (Mmp12), using quantitative RT-PCR agreed with the microarray findings. These results provide strong evidence that Cu-NPs can trigger both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways to mediate uterine injury, resulting in oxidative stress-related changes in gene expression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","54","Gene expression","Cell death - Copper - Enzymes - Gene expression regulation - Metal nanoparticles - Microarrays - Rating - Rats - Signal transduction","Copper nanoparticles - Gene expression patterns - Intraperitoneal injections - Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways - Mitochondrial swelling - Signal transduction mechanism - Superoxide dismutases - uterus",,"Number: 2016YFC1000903, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2015ZDTD050, Acronym: HUST, Sponsor: Henan University of Science and Technology; Number: 81671507, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: no. 81671507; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: HUST; grant no. 2015ZDTD050; National Key Research and Development Program , Grant/ Award Number: no. 2016YFC1000903",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We calculated and compared the ozone effective height Heff and effective temperature Teff, which are two important parameters in ground-based total ozone retrieval through the use of various profile datasets. This is used to verify the accuracy of the operative values (Heff(0) = 23 km, Teff(0) = −46.3 °C (or −45 °C)) from the World Meteorological Organization. The results show that the deviation of MLS and AIRS ozone profiles from ozone sounding data has significant oscillation and scatter in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The average difference of MLS at 82.5 hPa is (80.5 ± 65.1) %, and that of AIRS at 70 and 100 hPa are (105.6 ± 74.9) % and (107.0 ± 67.8) %, respectively. The two satellite temperature profiles have differences within ±3 °C and can effectively describe the vertical distribution and variation of temperature. When calculating the Heff and Teff, upper stratospheric data missing from the sounding data must be filled in by the satellite profile data; otherwise the calculated results will show large errors of 3.2 km and 3.3 °C. The Heff and Teff at Kunming are respectively 24.36 to 25.51 km and −48.3 to −43.6 °C.

They exhibit a high optical absorption coefficient and strong photoconductive property in the ultraviolet and visible regions. Therefore, they have been found to have many potential applications, such as gas sensors, resistors, photodetectors, photocatalysts, and solar cells. However, the existing preparation methods for SnS2 QDs are complicated and require a high temperature and high pressure environments; hence they are unsuitable for large-scale industrial production. An effective method for the preparation of monodispersed SnS2 QDs at normal temperature and pressure will be discussed in this paper. The method is facile, green, and low-cost. In this work, the structure, morphology, optical, electrical, and photoelectric properties of SnS2 QDs are studied. The synthesized SnS2 QDs are homogeneous in size and exhibit good photoelectric performance. A photoelectric detector based on the SnS2 QDs is fabricated and its JV and CV characteristics are also studied. The detector responds under λ = 365 nm light irradiation and reverse bias voltage. Its detectivity approximately stabilizes at 1011 Jones at room temperature.

Carbon films are an effective strategy to conquer this challenge by fabricating silicon/carbon (Si/C) multilayer thin film electrodes. Here, a multi-layered Si/C thin film structure was directly fabricated by magnetron sputtering method without applications of any binders. Carbon-covered Si/C multilayer structural electrode (*C/Si/C/Si/C) attains an initial discharge specific capacity up to 2316.0 mAh g−1 and a high cyclability with retention of 90.1% (1220.9 mAh g−1) after 200 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2C (797.1 mA g−1). The carbon film layer acts as a strong and flexible buffer during cycling process and form a stable SEI, which is beneficial to achieving fast Li+ migration and abating the volume expansion of Si active film. Moreover, the relatively moderate growth temperatures from 100 °C to 300 °C are proved to play a major role to effectively improve the specific capacity of these film electrodes.

The development of plant source anti-inflammatory agents and the assessment of their anti-inflammatory properties still face many challenges, such as high costs and long testing periods. Exogenous anti-inflammatory factors can be evaluated at the protein level using the NLRP3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) THP-1 cell-based biosensor. To achieve this, THP-1 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the GFP reporter gene that is under the transcriptional regulation of the NLRP3 promoter. Because the NLRP3 promoter controls the green fluorescent signal, the fluorescence is an indicator of NLRP3 activity. Our results show the fluorescence intensity was dependent on both the degree of inflammation and the effect of the anti-inflammatory agent.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying nZnO tolerance and root sensing of NP stresses have not been elucidated. Here, we compared the differential toxic effects of nZnO and Zn2+ toxicity on plants during exposure and recovery using a combination of transcriptomic and physiological analyses. Although both nZnO and Zn2+ inhibited primary root (PR) growth, nZnO had a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of elongation zones, whereas Zn2+ toxicity had a stronger toxic effect on meristem cells. Timely recovery from stresses is critical for plant survival. Despite the stronger inhibitory effect of nZnO on PR growth, nZnO-exposed plants recovered from stress more rapidly than Zn2+-exposed plants upon transfer to normal conditions, and transcriptome data supported these results. In contrast to Zn2+ toxicity, nZnO induced endocytosis and caused microfilament rearrangement in the epidermal cells of elongation zones, thereby repressing PR growth. nZnO also repressed PR growth by disrupting cell wall organization and structure through both physical interactions and transcriptional regulation.

Meanwhile, the value of heat recovery of power-to-gas units is analyzed, and the NBI(Normal Boundary Intersection) approach is employed to provide a feasible solution to the Pareto frontier. By comparing the planning and operation strategies under different unit costs and exothermic efficiencies of power-to-gas, the impacts of power-to-gas with heat recovery on the integrated energy system planning and operation are analyzed. Numerical results on typical examples show that under the abandoned wind co-accommodation mode of power-to-gas and heat storage, the reduction of unit cost and the improvement of exothermic efficiency of power-to-gas positively contribute to accommodating wind power.

The study of solar physics is one of the most active interdisciplinary frontiers of astronomy, planetary and space science, plasma physics, etc. The eventual solution of many fundamental scientific problems would greatly benefit from breakthroughs in solar physics, e.g., problems such as the origin of magnetic field in astronomical objects, the formation and evolutionary mechanisms of the stellar magnetic cycle, the impact of stellar magnetic activities on the habitability of planets and the origin of life, and the forecast of solar eruptions to guard against adverse space weather effects. In the last ten years, solar physics has stepped into an era of multi-messenger, full electromagnetic spectrum, full time-domain, high-resolution, multi-scale, multi-view and high-precision detection. A new era is looming on the horizon with two revolutionary missions, namely, Parker Solar Probe, which was launched in 2018 and will probe the solar corona from as close as 6 million kilometers to the Sun's surface, and Solar Orbiter, which will be launched in 2020 to image the Sun's polar regions for the first time. In China, the first space mission dedicated to the Sun, the Advanced Space Based Solar Observatory (ASO-S), will be launched in 2021, targeting the next solar cycle. In addition, the Advanced Ground Based Solar Observatory (ASO-G) has been incorporated within the framework of national planning; under construction are two important instruments for solar physics, MUSER (Mingantu Ultrawide Spectral Radioheliograph) and AIMS (Accurate Infrared Magnetic field measurements of the Sun). Embracing the upcoming advancement in observing the Sun, we review in this article the prominent progresses made by Chinese scholars in the last ten years, mainly in studying the solar magnetic field, fine structures and dynamics of the lower atmosphere, and solar eruptions. At the frontier of solar magnetism, we have made headway in predicting the solar cycle, understanding the magnetic topology and the evolution of magnetic helicity, and modeling the coronal magnetic field. At the frontier of fine structures and dynamics of the lower atmosphere, we have advanced the understanding of not only new phenomena, such as ultraviolet bursts, but also traditional subjects, such as sunspot light bridges, Ellerman bombs, as well as mass and energy transfer from the lower to higher atmosphere. At the frontier of solar eruptions, we have made progress in identifying the eruption progenitor, clarifying its formation, structure, and evolution toward eruption as well as the subsequent propagation and interaction in interplanetary space, and understanding various aspects and consequences of magnetic reconnection, a fundament plasma process in the universe. On the basis of the review, we look forward to the future development of solar physics in China and to the prospect of Chinese scholars making even more substantial contributions to the solar physics research. © 2019, Science Press.

To study the regulatory networks involved in the growth and development of microalgae, the relationship between calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling in the regulation of cell growth and lipid biosynthesis and Cd biosorption after Cd treatment were analysed. The highest lipid content (52.78%) and productivity (96.75 mg L−1 d−1) were enhanced by 1.59- and 1.39-fold in algal cells treated with 80 μM and 40 μM Cd, respectively, compared to the control. The protein content, ROS, antioxidases, Ca2+ and lipid biosynthetic gene transcription levels were upregulated by Cd induction. Additionally, the results indicated that increased endogenous Ca2+ could alleviate oxidative stress by activating antioxidases and mediating Cd biosorption, resulting in cell growth modulation and lipid accumulation. These results demonstrated that Cd stress is a useful strategy for lipid production and Cd bioaccumulation in microalgae and that there is vital interaction between ROS and Ca2+ levels in the regulation of lipid accumulation under Cd stress. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","61","Chemicals removal (water treatment)","Algae - Biochemistry - Biosorption - Biosynthesis - Cadmium - Calcium - Cell growth - Cell signaling - Cost effectiveness - Growth kinetics - Lipids - Microorganisms - Transcription - Wastewater treatment","Cadmium biosorption - Cadmium stress - Growth and development - Lipid accumulations - Lipid biosynthesis - Micro-algae - Reactive oxygen species - Regulatory network","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.2 Biochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 911.2 Industrial Economics","Number: 21766012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China , China (No. 21766012 to Xuya Yu and No. 21666012 to Peng Zhao).

The root cause of the oscillation phenomena is investigated in this work. The vector margin (VM) method, which has a closed-form stability margin expression, is utilized to analyze the phenomena, the analysis reveals that the large phase lags of hydro-power turbines at the oscillation frequency are the culprit. It is proved analytically that a hydro-dominated system model always includes a right-half-plane zero, and this zero introduces the large phase lag afore-mentioned and places a fundamental conflict between the stability and tracking performance. A frequency-domain robust fixed-order controller design method is proposed to maximize the tracking performance with specified stability margin in multiple operating points. Case studies of the four-machine two-area system and Yunnan Grid validate the introduced results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","31","Design","Controllers - Frequency domain analysis - Robust control - Stability criteria","Nyquist stability criterion - Parameter optimization - Performance limitations - The vector margin (VM) method - Ultra low frequencies","731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 732.1 Control Equipment - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2016YFB0900605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was partially supported by National Key R&D Program of China ( 2016YFB0900605 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
