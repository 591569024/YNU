In this study, montmorillonite (MT-Na) and Fe2O3 modified montmorillonite (MT-Fe2O3) were used to remove catechol at various pH. Higher efficacy and faster removal of catechol was detected for MT-Fe2O3 than MT-Na. Catechol removal from solution was higher with MT-Na with increasing pH, while MT-Fe2O3 showed a reverse trend. Removal kinetics results showed fast and slow compartment of catechol removal involving adsorption and subsequent degradation of the latter. For MT-Fe2O3, fast compartment was attributed to adsorption and initial degradation. The retardation of catechol degradation rate manifested in the slow compartment was attributed to the hindrance of the active reaction sites by intermediate degradation products, Fe2O3 mediated generation of •OH is central regarding removal of catechol using MT-Fe2O3. Efficient degradation of organic contaminants by montmorillonite underscores the importance of clay particles as capable adsorbent.

The companions of the exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) that produce type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have still not been conclusively identified. A red-giant (RG) star can fill this role as the mass donor of the exploding WD - this channel for producing SNe Ia has been named the symbiotic channel. However, previous studies on this channel have given a relatively low rate of SNe Ia. Aims. We aim to systematically investigate the parameter space, Galactic rates, and delay time distributions of SNe Ia arising from the symbiotic channel under a revised mass-transfer prescription. Methods. We adopted an integrated mass-transfer prescription to calculate the mass-transfer process from a RG star onto the WD. In this prescription, the mass-transfer rate varies with the local material states. First, we obtain the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia by evolving a large number of semidetached WD+RG systems with the Eggleton stellar-evolution code. Second, we investigate the Galactic rates and delay-time distributions of SNe Ia using a binary population synthesis method. Results. The parameter space of WD+RG systems that can produce SNe Ia is enlarged significantly judging by our calculations. This channel could produce SNe Ia with intermediate and old ages, contributing up to 5% of all SNe Ia in the Galaxy. Our model increases the SN Ia rate from this channel by a factor of five. We suggest that the symbiotic systems RS Oph and T CrB are strong candidates for the progenitors of SNe Ia. © ESO 2019.","101","Supernovae","Chromium compounds - Giant stars - Mass transfer - White dwarfs","Binaries: close - Delay time distributions - Mass transfer process - Mass transfer rate - Population synthesis - Stars: evolution - Stellar evolutions - Supernovae: general","641.3 Mass Transfer - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 11673058, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements.

In order to evaluate the performance of asphalt mixture exposed to dynamic water and chlorine salt erosion, the asphalt mixture dynamic water-salt erosion apparatus was self-designed and the test parameters were reasonably set for the accelerated simulation of chlorine salt-water-temperature-load coupling action to asphalt mixture under real working conditions. Splitting test (25 °C and −10 °C) was adopted for assessing the performance of asphalt mixture suffered from chlorine salt-water-temperature-load coupling action. Then the grey entropy method was applied to analyze the significance of influencing factors on the performance of asphalt mixture such as dynamic water scouring times, temperature, salt solution concentration. Then the mechanism of performance deterioration of asphalt mixture was explored to some extent. The results show that the process of chlorine salt erosion and deterioration to asphalt mixture is accelerated by dynamic water and is closely related to the concentration and temperature of salt solution. Scouring times is the most significant factor influencing the performance of asphalt mixture exposed to dynamic water and chlorine salt erosion. The crystallization erosion caused by salt solution infiltrating into the voids and cracks of asphalt mixture is an important inducement for the performance deterioration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","19","Asphalt mixtures","Chlorine - Corrosion - Deterioration - Dynamics - Erosion - Mixtures - Temperature","Deterioration mechanism - Dynamic waters - Entropy methods - Road engineering - Splitting strength","411.1 Asphalt - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2014M550476, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 310831163501, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51608046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 310831173701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Support Program for Longyuan Youth and Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Gansu Province; ","The authors wish to thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51608046 , No. 51608045 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M550476 ) the Preeminent Youth Fund of Chang’an University (No. 310831163501 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Chang’an University (Nos. 310831171001 , 310831173701 and No. 310821161016 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effects of piston skirt profile on the dynamic behavior of piston and the vibration characteristics of engine block is studied synthetically by the method of a combination of experimental test and numerical simulation. The temperature distribution of the piston top surface under rated working condition is tested by a hardness plug, which is used as the boundary condition to carry out the thermodynamic simulation of diesel engine working process, to obtain the hot profile of the piston. Then, the dynamics model of piston assemblies are formally established, and the skirt profiles of different bump positions of the piston skirt are optimally designed. Based on the above analysis, a comprehensive study on the influence of bump position on the piston dynamic behavior is carried out. Then, applying the modal testing method for the engine block and crankshaft to establish the elastic multi-body dynamics model of diesel engine and load the piston slapping force at different bump positions, the vibration response of the surface structure under the action of different piston slapping forces is also studied. The results show that the mechanical vibration of engine block will become more severe with the hiking up of bump position at the piston skirt. Also, the vibration behavior of the engine block in the middle and high frequency section is very sensitive to the bump position of the piston skirt, especially in the frequency range of 1600 Hz–3150 Hz. In addition, vibration noise performance can be significantly improved by adjusting the bump position of piston skirt downwards. Particularly, the vibration noise performance can be best achieved when the bump position of piston skirt is 5 mm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","24","Engine pistons","Crankshafts - Diesel engines - High pressure effects - Hot working - Modal analysis - Numerical methods - Pistons - Roads and streets - Surface testing - Vibrations (mechanical)","High pressure common rail diesel engine - Multibody dynamics model - Non-road - Piston secondary motion - Piston skirt profile - Thermodynamic simulations - Vibration behavior - Vibration characteristics","406.2 Roads and Streets - 535.2 Metal Forming - 601.2 Machine Components - 612.1.1 Internal Combustion Engine Components - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics","Number: 51366006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51765025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51765025 and No. 51366006).

In the prisoner's dilemma, if an individual's fitness exceeds the aspiration level, its weight becomes larger; otherwise weight decreases. While such an adjustment of weight is defined by the intensity parameter δ it is interesting that there is an optimal range for δ guaranteeing the best evolution of cooperation. The facilitation of cooperative behavior mainly depends on the weight distribution of players, which is based on the formation of a cooperative cluster controlled by high-weight cooperators. These cooperators are able to prevail against defectors even when there is a large temptation to defect.

The CeNiXOY catalyst could provide a >99% yield of imine in the model alkylation reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol at 100 °C. The Pd-promoted Pd-CeNiXOY catalyst surprisingly showed an enhanced imine yield (>99%) at a mild temperature of 60 °C. This catalyst exhibited good reusability, and moreover, demonstrated high performance towards imine synthesis from various amines with alcohols. The presence of Pd species and the Ni/Ce molar ratio showed a synergistic impact on the conversion of aniline, as well as on the product selectivity, which was believed to be related to the improvement on the intrinsic activity of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Various physicochemical techniques, including ICP-MS, XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, UV-Raman, H2-TPR, TEM, EPMA and XPS, were employed to study mainly the composition, structure and redox properties of the catalysts. The proportion of Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies, which can be manipulated by the Ce-Ni redox system and the interaction between Ce and Ni, was crucial to the selective activation of alcohols in the presence of reactive amines.

For the preparation of the MOFs derivatives with different catalytic functions and high efficiency, it was necessary to focus on the influence of the properties of MOFs materials (structure, doped heteroatoms, etc.) and heat treatment conditions (activation atmosphere, temperature, time, and heating gradient, etc.) on the performance of catalysts.Hence, the preparation of MOFs derivatives and their application in ORR, HER were introduced according to different metal dopants for better design of efficient electrochemical catalysts. At last, an outlook for future research in the field of catalysis with MOFs derivatives was given. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

The effects of H2O2 concentration, etching time and reaction temperature on the inverted pyramid-like structure and anti-reflective ability were systematically investigated. The results show that the lowest average reflectivity (4.3%) in the wavelength range of 300~1000 nm was obtained under the optimum conditions of 0.06 mol/L copper nitrate, 3 mol/L H2O2 concentration and 2 mol/L hydrofluoric acid (HF) at 60 °C for 5 min. The formation mechanism of the inverted pyramid structure is discussed and can be attributed to the moderate catalytic activity of nanocopper particles that induce etching preferentially along the non- directions of the silicon.

Based on the traditional distance estimation technique, the median approach was introduced to improve the algorithm's robustness. The position coefficient was used to screen out features to better suppress the overlap ratio among different states. Furthermore, the sensitivity of each feature was comprehensively investigated according to feature samples' polymeriability, divisibility and position distribution relation. Finally, the acoustic emission data in different damage stages of rolling bearings tested on a self-made rolling bearing fatigue test platform were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

We set up the standard clustering and identifying model of forty-one Camellia varieties by hierarchical cluster combined with principal component analysis. The accuracy rate of clustering by using average spectra from one hundred and twenty-three genomic DNA samples is 92.68%. The identification accuracy rate is 100%. Clustering results showed that the forty-one Camellia varieties fall into nine categories based on a 1.0 cluster distance limit, and into three bigger categories at a 15.0 cluster distance limit.

Groundwater was one of the first sources since the prehistoric times to cover human needs. Initially, the exploitation of groundwater has been made by shallow wells and later by boreholes. A water well is constructed through excavation in the ground by digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater in aquifers. Groundwater wells were used in the Helladic world since Neolithic times. Ancient China developed a sophisticated tool for drilling water wells that is similar to modern machines. Qanat, a system of wells, originated in Iran (Persia), but was adopted by other countries. Moreover, the Indus valley civilization had well-constructed wells mainly for drinking purposes. The construction of wells varied according to local conditions, determined by geology, hydrogeology, and morphology, as well as by local tradition. Furthermore, a well was not just a water source but also became a cultural symbol throughout history, related to local religion and custom. The stepwells in India became not only sources of drinking water, but also holy places (sanctuaries) for bathing, meditation and prayer. In the present review, the evolution of wells through the centuries is examined. The study of water well technologies demonstrates their diachronic evolution and, furthermore, reveals that the ancient people had an outstanding engineering knowledge of water exploitation, which is interesting for water engineering and hydrogeologists, even nowadays. © IWA Publishing 2019 Water Supply","80","Potable water","Aquifers - Boreholes - Boring - Groundwater resources - History - Hydrogeology - Infill drilling - Water wells","Cultural aspects - Diachronic evolutions - Dug well - Engineering knowledge - Groundwater wells - Qanat - Stepwell - Water engineering","444 Water Resources - 444.2 Groundwater - 481.1 Geology - 511.1 Oil Field Production Operations - 604.2 Machining Operations - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The phenomena of Cu dendrites appearing on the upper surface of the Cu layer and the Cu whiskers growing along the crack of the ceramic coating under the Cu layer after thermal cycling (900 °C, Ar), and the formation mechanism are explained using FE-SEM, XRD, EPMA, and EBSD. The Cu dendritic and Cu whiskers changed the stress state of the interface and enhanced the anti-crack-propagation ability of the coating. In addition, nanoparticles surrounding the Cu layer using EBSD were observed in the Cu particles added to the AT40 coatings (C-AT coating) by plasma spraying. The calculations of surface energy indicated that the nanoparticles improved the wettability of the interface and promoted the interfacial coupling behaviour. A model of the relationship between stress and crack propagation in the process of heating and cooling was used to analyse the effect of the plastic metallic-barrier layer (Cu) on crack propagation.

The surface porous layers are mainly consisted of α-Ti, HA phases and a few reaction phases of CaO, CaTiO3, Ti5P3. A stable metallurgical bonding on matrix alloys and surface porous layers of the composites could be observed. With increasing of HA contents, the reaction phases of surface porous layers are increased and the bonding degree of interface is deterioration. The average porosity and pore size of surface layers are appeared in a slowly increasing trend. As a result, the average compressive strength and compressive elastic modulus of the surface porous Ti-HA/Ti-Ag composites are decreased. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the composites are reduced at higher HA contents. In vitro bioactivity tests show that lots of bone-like apatite are deposited on the surface porous Ti-HA/Ti-Ag gradient biocomposites after soaking in SBF for 7 days and the apatite formation ability is significant enhanced with increasing of HA contents. © 2019, Editorial Office of Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica.

Among the synthesized catalysts, Ni-Co/C-N presents a high ORR current density of 8.5mAcm-2 in a 0.5molL-1 KNO3 solution. The ORR electron transfer number of the catalyst Ni-Co/C-N is 3.8, indicating that O2 is almost completely reduced to H2O. A neutral zinc-air battery utilizing a 0.5molL-1 KNO3 solution has been assembled by using the prepared composite catalyst coated on carbon paper as an air cathode, and Zn plate as an anode. The battery with the cathode catalyst Ni-Co/C-N delivers the open-circuit voltage of 1.13V and the maximum power density of 65mWcm-2. The constant discharge current density of 50mAcm-2, 100mAcm-2 and 150mAcm-2 can last 202h, 93h and 11h, respectively. A stable voltage plateau appears at various discharge current densities.

Co3O4 NPs decorated Mn-Co-O solid solution, donated as Co3O4/MnXCo, was prepared by co-precipitation method and used as non-precious metal catalyst for base-free oxidation of HMF to FDCA in the presence of O2 and water. Comprehensive characterizations such as XRD, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, XPS, NH3/CO2-TPD and TEM were used to study materials properties especially the oxygen mobility and acidity-basicity. The effect of Mn/Co molar ratio in catalyst and the reaction conditions were investigated and optimized. In addition, the kinetics of the reaction was monitored to reveal the reaction route and rate-determining step. The variation of Mn/Co molar ratio was found to affect not only HMF conversion but also distribution of products. When the Mn/Co ratio was of 0.2, the Co3O4/Mn0.2Co catalyst showed the optimal catalytic performance (i.e., >99% yield of FDCA obtained under 1 bar O2 at 140 °C after 24 h) due to the highest content of both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites on the surface, leading to the strongest ability of HMF adsorption and COOH group formation, as well as the enhanced oxygen mobility.

The compatibility and stability of the BED and its compact on diesel engine performance and emissions were studied experimentally with six different BED fuels. The results show the following findings. Firstly, the biodiesel, ethanol, and diesel constituents can keep soluble at certain proportions when the volume ratio of the biodiesel is 25%~55% of the BED fuels. Secondly, the engine power decreases slightly, and the reduction amplitude becomes larger when the proportions of ethanol and biodiesel increase at medium speeds and high loads. Moreover, the power of the engine using the B30E10D60 fuel decreases by 10.2% when the engine is running at maximum torque condition. Thirdly, there is no significant variation in equivalent fuel consumption rate at low loads, and the fuel consumption rate becomes lower with the increase of oxygen content at high loads. Therefore, the equivalent fuel consumption rates of BED fuels are lower than that of pure diesel (petrochemical diesel). Finally, the CO emission of the BED is almost the same as that of pure diesel at low loads, but becomes lower at high loads. The NOx emission of the BED is slightly lower than that of pure diesel at low loads, but becomes higher at high loads. The NOx emission increases with the increase of biodiesel proportion and decreases with the increase of ethanol proportion. The THC emission of the BED is almost the same as that of pure diesel at low loads and becomes lower at high loads. The THC emission decreases when the biodiesel proportion increases, and increases when the ethanol proportion increases. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","26","Ethanol fuels","Biodiesel - Compounding (chemical) - Convergence of numerical methods - Diesel engines - Diesel fuels - Ethanol - Nitrogen oxides","Diesel engine performance - Emission characteristics - Emission decrease - Equivalent fuel consumption - Fuel consumption rates - performance - Performance and emissions - Physical and chemical properties","523 Liquid Fuels - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Taxa- and habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity, or ‘biodiversity indicators’, are commonly used to convey information about the state of the biological community since they can be assessed relatively quickly and cheaply by non-experts. Direct measures of a component of biodiversity are also increasingly feasible using DNA metabarcoding; ‘Next Generation Sequencing’ has facilitated the rapid characterisation of combined multiple species samples by sequencing their DNA barcodes in parallel, simultaneously reducing the need for taxonomic expertise and the time and cost required to obtain biodiversity data across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We investigated whether biodiversity information obtained from DNA metabarcoding of mass-trapped arthropods and from a range of taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. carabid beetles, vascular plants) provide: 1) similar estimates of alpha and beta diversity and 2) provide similar forest management related conclusions. We also explored how well habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. stand structure, volume of deadwood) predict observed biodiversity patterns. The study was conducted in Thetford Forest, UK within 15 forest plantation stands (5 Scots pine-oak mixtures, 4 Scots pine and 6 oak monocultures). Our results demonstrated a high level of congruence between the metabarcoding and taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity. The wider range of taxonomic groups identified using a metabarcoding approach offered the potential to identify taxa sensitive to the environmental variable that was being manipulated experimentally (i.e. the composition of forest stands). Most habitat-based measures of biodiversity failed to predict species assemblage differences between stands. © 2019","77","Forestry","Biodiversity - DNA - Ecosystems - Gene encoding","Alpha and beta diversities - Biodiversity indicators - Forest management practices - Malaise traps - Monitoring and assessment - Next-generation sequencing - Surrogate measures - Tree identity","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology","","This work has been jointly sponsored by the Forestry Commission and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund ERDF) within the framework of the Forestry Commission Climate Change Adaptation and Biodiversity Programmes and the European INTERREG IV A 2 Mers Seas Zeeën Cross-border Cooperation Programme 2007–2013 (Project 090316016-FR MULTIFOR: Management of Multi-Functional Forests).

In the paper, the transparency of PLLA films and modified PLLA films was studied. First, PLLA films and a series of modified PLLA films were prepared. Star-shaped POSS-g-PLLA was prepared by using L-lactic acid and POSS-NH3Cl in the presence of stannous (II) octanoate (Sn (Otc)2) catalyst. A series of modified films were prepared by using octa(γ-chloroammoniumpropyl) octasilsesquioxane (POSS-NH3Cl) and POSS-g-PLLA. Meanwhile, the reaction was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometry (FTIR). Secondly, transparency of PLLA films, PLLA/POSS-NH3Cl films, PLLA/POSS-g-PLLA films and POSS-g-PLLA films were investigated, respectively. The conclusions were as follows: (1) the transparency of PLLA/POSS-NH3Cl, PLLA/POSS-g-PLLA and POSS-g-PLLA films was improved. (2) The transparency of POSS-g-PLLA films was the best, and the transparency of PLLA/POSS-g-PLLA films was better than that of PLLA/POSS-NH3Cl films. (3) The transparency of POSS-g-PLLA films was significantly improved. In the visible spectral range (400–800 nm), the transparency of POSS-g-PLLA films was increased with the increase of POSS-NH3Cl, and the transparency of the films improves even 58% in some wavelength.

Additionally, the contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus to water pollution in Dianchi Lake were discussed. The results showed that the atmospheric depositional nitrogen concentration in Dianchi Lake is generally consistent with the characteristics of the low rainy season and high dry season. The nitrogen and phosphorus load of atmospheric deposition was positively correlated with rainfall. Seasonal changes were mainly characterized by low dry season and high rainy season. The atmospheric depositional nitrogen load was dominated by dissolved inorganic nitrogen, which accounted for 63.70% of the total nitrogen deposition load. The phosphorus load was mainly PP, which accounted for 45.54% of the total phosphorus precipitation load. Excessive fertilization and loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers are the major sources of nitrogen and phosphorus in atmospheric wet deposition. Combined with data from rivers entering the lake, the settlements of TN and TP in the atmospheric deposition of Dianchi Lake were 6.14% and 12.76% of the river load, respectively. Therefore, the primary source of pollution in Dianchi Lake was still the load brought by the river into the lake. However, the nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in the atmospheric deposition of Dianchi Lake were at intermediate levels compared with other regions, so this contribution requires further investigation. © 2019, Science Press.

We assessed variations in meteorological and hydrological variables using innovative trend analysis (ITA) and traditional trend analysis methods at a practical significance level, which is also of practical interest. We developed threshold levels of hydrological variables and developed a non-parametric climate-sensitivity model of the high-altitude catchment of the western Himalayas. The runoff of Zone I decreased, while the temperature increased and the precipitation increased significantly. In Zone II, the runoff and temperature increased but the precipitation decreased. A two-dimensional visualization of the Pardé coefficient showed extreme drought events, and indicated greater sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature than to precipitation. The threshold levels of runoff for Zones I and II were 320 and 363 mm using the Q80 fixed method, while the mean runoff amounts were estimated to be 79.95 and 55.61 mm, respectively. The transient threshold levels varied by month, and the duration of droughts in Zones I and II ranged from 26.39 to 78.98 days. The sensitivity of the hydrological regime was estimated based on a modified climate-elasticity model (Εp = 0.11-0.23, Εt = -0.04-2.39) for Zones I and II, respectively. These results highlight the sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature, which influences the melting process.

Under irradiation, T-TCP micelles generated ROS, which triggered simultaneous thymol release and also resulted in additional ROS-inducing bactericidal effects, both effectively eradicating biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.

The results showed that the addition of La to either Ni/Al2O3 or Ni/SiO2 led to the reduced size of metallic nickel, the reduced reduction degree of nickel oxide, the increased alkalinity number and the increased activity for methanation of CO2. Furthermore, the addition of La to the Ni/SiO2 catalyst could suppress the formation of CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Ni/SiO2 was much more active than the Ni/Al2O3, even though nickel size was much bigger. The in situ Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies showed that the addition of La to Ni/Al2O3 interfered with integration of hydroxyl group with *CO2 species and formation of the bicarbonate and carbonate, while favored formation of the formate specie, enhancing the catalytic activity. For Ni/SiO2, instead of formate, CO* became the main reaction intermediate. The strong absorption of CO* favored its further conversion and explained the low selectivity of the silica-based catalysts toward CO. The addition of La to Ni/SiO2 catalyst facilitated further hydrogenation of CO* species to CH4 and promoted the catalytic activity. © 2019 Energy Institute","48","Water gas shift","Addition reactions - Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Carbon dioxide - Catalyst activity - Catalyst selectivity - Catalyst supports - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Hydrogenation - Lanthanum - Methanation - Nickel oxide - Reaction intermediates - Silica","Catalytic behavior - Diffuse reflection infrared fourier transform spectroscopies - Hydrogenation of CO - Ni/SiO2 catalysts - Reverse water gas shift - Situ DRIFT - Strong absorptions - Supported nickel catalysts","547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","","This work was supported by the Strategic International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation Special Funds of National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFE0204000), the Program for Taishan Scholars of Shandong Province Government, the Recruitment Program of Global Young Experts (Thousand Youth Talents Plan) and Natural Science Fund of Shandong Province (ZR2017BB002).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Heavy metals have a potential impact on the environment, meanwhile, it also threatens people's health. So it is necessary to detect the stagnant water samples of FPSCs. To improve the reliability of the test results of FPSC water samples, the ultra pure water was used for the stagnation of the FPSC. The ultra pure water was used to wash the FPSCs before stagnation to reduce the effect of pipe impurities on the results. The pipes materials of FPSC were made of TP2 phosphorous deoxy copper. The standard solution contains 21 kinds of heavy metal elements, such as As, Ca, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn and so on. The concentration gradients of the standard solution were 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg•L-1, respectively. The blank sample and standard solution should be analyzed before testing the water sample. The water samples of different aluminum substrate FPSC (the blue-film coating, the black chromium coating and the anode oxidizing coating) were analyzed, and the content of heavy metal elements in water samples were also detected by ICP-OES method. Moreover, the best analytical spectrum of the 21 heavy metal elements were ensured by relevant parameters. The best analytical spectrum of partial heavy metal elements of the standardsolution were respectively (nm): As(188.979), Ca(317.933), Zn(206.200), V(290.880), Cu(327.393), Ni(231.604), Sb(206.836), Pb(220.353). It was shown that ICP-OES can simultaneously detect the content of various heavy metal elements in water samples accurately. The higher content of heavy metal elements in water samples, the greater the amplitude of the spectrum. There were not 12 heavy metal elements (Be, Co, Cd, Cr, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Se, Sr, Tl, Ti) in the water samples of three kinds of FPSCs, but 9 heavy metal elements (As, Ni, Cu, Ca, Mg, V, Pb, Zn, Sb) were detected in the same experiments. The changeable rule of heavy metal content in water samples showed that the heavy metal content increases with the FPSCs stagnation time, the heavy metal content increases to the peak value and then decreases with the FPSCs stagnation time, and then it decreases to the lower content gradually. The changeable rule of heavy metal content with the stagnation time was obtained with the analysis of the stagnant water samples of the FPSCs, and the superscalar and the excessive stagnation time of different heavy metal elements were also given too. The limit value of water quality standards for urban water supply (CJ/T 206-2005) for heavy metal elements was taken as reference, so these heavy metals elements (Cu, Ni, Zn) of water samples of three kinds of FPSCs were not more than that of the limit of the national standard. However, the contents of As, Pb and Sb in water samples of three kinds of FPSCs exceeded the limit of the standard after 8 days stagnation. The maximum superscalar of As, Pb and Sb elements were 0.007, 0.006 and 0.004 mg•L-1, respectively. And the superscalar of the As elements was the highest in the water samples of the blue-film coating collector and the anode oxidizing coating collector, and the superscalar of the Pb elements was the highest in the water samples of the black chromium coating collector. The detection results had certain reference significance to the manufacturers and the customers, and the technology of FPSC's pipes should be further improved to reduce the precipitation of heavy metals. The research results can also provide some references for the research of the FPSC and the establishment of national standards. © 2019, Peking University Press.

To further investigate those selective absorption, we construct an equivalent structural model, and our calculations show that these absorption peaks have the extraordinary response to the imaginary part of the effective mass density and bulk modulus. The results exhibit that the imaginary part of the effective mass density and bulk modulus at the frequencies of the absorption peaks abruptly appear, in the meanwhile the real part of those become zero.

The present results reveal that (Cu, Ag)-doped ZnS structures have relatively small formation energy, implying that they are more easily obtained in experiment. Moreover, the absorption is enhanced obviously in the visible-light region for (Cu, Ag)-doped ZnS, but their energy levels are still suitable for water splitting to generate H2, which means that (Cu, Ag)-doped ZnS structures are promising candidate photocatalyst materials for H2 production driven by visible light. ZnS and (Cu, Ag)-doped ZnS were prepared using chemical precipitation method. (Cu, Ag)-doped ZnS samples showed an improved photocatalytic activity compared with undoped ZnS.

Simultaneously, after conditioning, about 45.16% of organics such as proteins, polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant was degraded, thus dissociating large amount of active group which accelerated immobilization of dissolved heavy metals and weaken its toxicity. In addition, MPG with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals and transform them into residual fraction, leading to a considerable decrease in their mobility risk level. Besides, linear regression models showed that a strong oxidizability of sludge, and destruction of colloidal network could greatly promote dissolution of unstable heavy metals. Simultaneously, sludge oxidizability and organics degradation rate, and disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) layer highly accelerate immobilization of unstable metals.

At an altitude of 1920 m, four calibration parameters deeply affecting performance of the diesel engine were selected at the rated power condition, that is, injection quantity, injection timing, injection pressure, and VNT nozzle opening. In order to reduce thermal load of the diesel engine running in the plateau environment, reasonable coded levels of Design of Experiments (DoE) factors were chosen, and an experimental design matrix was selected based on the Box–Behnken design. The interaction effects of the four calibration parameters on engine performance were investigated using the response surface methodology. Power recovery optimization was carried out by means of sequential quadratic programming under a minimum smoke limit and durability constraints. The results show that this performance optimization method can effectively recover engine performance at high altitude. Moreover, it can, to an extent, alleviate the problems such as deterioration of fuel consumption and high thermal load induced by the rise in elevation. With optimized calibration parameters, the rated power of the diesel engine at an altitude of 1920 m proved to be recovered to that at sea level, and there was an increase of brake specific fuel consumption by less than 3% compared with that in the plain area, which met the performance and durability requirements for general turbocharged internal combustion engines at altitudes lower than 2000 m. © IMechE 2018.","40","Diesel engines","Calibration - Design of experiments - Durability - Fuel consumption - Fuels - Nozzles - Quadratic programming - Recovery - Sea level - Superchargers - Surface properties - Thermal load - Turbomachinery","high altitude - Power recovery - Response surface methodology - Sequential quadratic programming - variable nozzle turbocharger",,"","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (grant numbers 51466003 and 51666005).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

From this starting point, the sufficient condition of globally fixed-time attractivity of a prespecified locally fixed-time stability region is obtained. Combining the locally fixed-time stability and the globally fixed-time attractivity of a prespecified locally fixed-time stability region, the globally fixed-time stabilization problem for PH system is effectively solved. Furthermore, the globally fixed-time control scheme independent of locally fixed-time stability region has also been derived by constructing a novel Lyapunov function. A illustrative example shows that the results obtained in this paper work very well in fixed-time control design of PH systems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","33","Hamiltonians","Lyapunov functions - Stabilization - System stability","Attractivity - Fixed time - Interconnection and damping assignment - Passivity based control - Port-Hamiltonian systems - Stability boundaries - Stabilization control - Stabilization problems",,"Number: 61472331, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61472331, 61772434), in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0800601), in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. XDJK2015C078) and in part by the Talents of Science and Technology promote plan, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission.

The ratios of denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) to polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) under different IRF conditions were measured using a batch experiment. On this basis, the variation of nutrient transformations was studied using the IRF changes by the mass balance method. The results showed that, for the OD system that had an anaerobic zone upstream from the circular corridor and set anoxic and aerobic zones along the circular corridor, when the IRF was between 3.4 h1 and 7.5 h1, the DPAOs/PAOs ratio reached about 50%. Approximately 20% of the total phosphorus (TP) was removed and over 11% of the total nitrogen (TN) was transformed into nitrogen gas by the DNPR process, and meanwhile the total removal efficiencies of the TP and TN were over 93% and 80%. When the IRF was greater than 11.5 h1, the TN removal efficiency decreased significantly, and this was not conducive to simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The results indicated that the OD process would possess a better DNPR potential if the IRF were controlled within the proper scope. © IWA Publishing 2019","31","Biological water treatment","Activated sludge process - Anoxic water - Bacteria - Denitrification - Efficiency - Internal oxidation - Nitrogen - Nitrogen removal - Phosphorus - Sewage lagoons","Denitrifying phosphorus removal - Denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms - Enhanced biological phosphorus removal - Internal recirculations - Oxidation ditch - Phosphorus removal - Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms - Simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removals","445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 452.2 Sewage Treatment - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: 51678388, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51108299 and No. 51678388).

XW-6-66, and its enzymatic properties were investigated. With the putative catalytic triad Ser114–Asp203–His235, AesZY belongs to the Acetyl esterase (Aes) family which is included in the α/β hydrolase superfamily and contains the consensus Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif. The maximum activity of AesZY was detected at pH 8.0 and 40 °C. AesZY was stable at different pH values ranging from 5.0 to 12.0, and was tolerant to several metal ions. Furthermore, the deacetylation activity of AesZY toward 7-ACA was approximately 7.5 U/mg, and the Kcat/Km value was 2.04 s−1 mM−1.

Its biosorption properties as a function of environmental parameters such as contact time, initial concentration, pH, temperature and bacterial dosage were investigated through batch experiments, and the removal capacity peaked at pH 6.0, 40 °C and 0.5 g biomass L−1 at an initial concentration of 105 mg L−1. Sorption occurred extremely rapidly at the beginning, equilibrium was reached after approximately 1 h and 4 h for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively, and the biosorption kinetic data for both metals were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model (r2 > 0.99). Sorption isotherms showed that the adsorptions of both metals were highly favourable, and equilibrium data were better described by the Langmuir model (r2 > 0.98 for Cu2+ and 0.99 for Cd2+), with the estimated maximum sorption capacities of 12.6 and 26.5 mg g−1 for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively. Desorption assays suggested that biosorption was a chemical process and that a fraction of the metal ions might have entered the bacterial cells. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl and phosphate functional groups on the bacterial cell walls might be mainly responsible for the biosorption, although their contributions to the binding of Cu2+ and Cd2+ were different.

Characterization of obtained materials indicated that hierarchical porosity was generated from microporous NaP1 zeolite and macroporous ceramic support, and the former accounted for about 23.1 wt% of the total material. Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the ammonium ion adsorption performance on the as-prepared adsorbent. Results indicated that the adsorption capacity could be affected by contact time, initial ion concentration, and solution temperature. Adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model with a small thickness of boundary film revealing a chemical reaction related to valence forces and weak ion diffusion resistance to adsorption sites due to the hierarchically porous structure of the adsorbent. Adsorption isotherms coincided well with the Langmuir model. The thermodynamic study suggested that the adsorption was an endothermic and spontaneous process.

The scope of this paper is to propose a novel soft-computing framework for predicting the AOp through the implementation of hybrid evolutionary model based on artificial neural network (ANN) with teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO). The parameters considered during the formulation of the prediction model were maximum charge per delay, rock mass rating, and distance from the blasting face as the inputs and AOp as the output. Totally, 85 blasting events in Shur river dam region have been monitored and the mentioned parameters have been measured. Then, the performances and prediction efficiency of the models have been compared on the basis of performance indices, namely the R square (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE). The obtained results show that the ANN–TLBO with R2 of 0.932 and RMSE of 2.56 yields the better performance for the prediction of AOp as compared to ANN. As a conclusion, it can be found that the proposed ANN–TLBO model has an excellent potential for the prediction aims. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","37","Computer aided software engineering","Blasting - Forecasting - Mean square error - Neural networks - Soft computing","Air overpressure - Area of interest - Evolutionary models - Hybrid model - Performance indices - Rock mass rating - Root mean square errors - Soft computing framework",,"","The authors really appreciate Dr. Mahdi Hasanipanah who allowed us to access and use his data.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The IFS is introduced because of its comprehensive consideration of preference and nonpreference, and is used to represent qualitatively evaluated information from investors and experts. Furthermore, an intuitionistic fuzzy investment scenario is established and a trisection approach is designed to distinguish three types of risk investors, based on which three corresponding IFPS models are constructed. After this, a portfolio selection process under the intuitionistic fuzzy environment is provided, and a simple example is given to show the application of the process. In addition, the investment opportunities and efficient frontier of the IFPS model are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed portfolio selection model.

As the generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) are more useful to express more fuzzy and ambiguous information. Meanwhile, to consider human's hesitance, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (DHq-ROFSs) are presented which can be more valid of handling real MADM problems. To fuse the information in DHq-ROFSs more effectively, in this article, some Muirhead mean (MM) operators based on DHq-ROFSs environment, which consider any number of being fused arguments, are defined and studied. Evidently, the new proposed operators can obtain more exact results than other existing methods. In addition, some precious properties of these MM operators are discussed and all the special cases of them are investigated which indicates MM operator is more powerful than others. Afterward, the defined aggregation operators are used to solve the MADM with dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (DHq-ROFNs) and the MADM decision-making model is developed. In accordance of the defined operators and built model, two operators are applied to deal with the MADM problems for supplier selection with the DHPFNs information and the availability and superiority of the proposed operators are analyzed by comparing with some existing approaches.

The aroma and flavonoid aglycone enhancement effect of BG in tea soup was investigated. The immobilized BG-synthesized nanocomposite morphology and structure were characterized by using different analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The immobilized BG showed enhanced pH and temperature endurance at an optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 65 °C. After seven cycles of reuse, immobilized BG showed 51.8% initial activity. Immobilized-BG treatment in green tea and black tea soup elevated the aroma content by approximately 16% and 48%, respectively. In addition, flavonoid aglycones, such as myricetin, kaempferol, and quercetin, in green tea and black tea soup increased by approximately 65- A nd 5-fold, respectively. These results suggested that immobilized BG showed excellent potential in the enhancement of aroma and effectively hydrolyzed the flavonoid glycosides to release flavonoid aglycones in tea soup.

Based on the first-principles calculations of density functional theory, the stacking orders, electronic and optical properties of ZnSe/AlP heterostructure were explored by us. The results demonstrate that the stability of the ABI pattern with the interlayer spacing of 2.65 Å is better than other structures and the charge will accumulate between the ZnSe and AlP monolayers. We find that the band gap of the heterostructure is sensitive to changes of the interlayer spacing, external plane strain and electric field. Under in-plane strain, the transition from direct to indirect band gap will occur in the heterostructure, but this phenomenon is not observed to the cases of external electric field. In addition, the band gap will disappear at the 1.0 V/Å for the AAII pattern (-1.0 V/Å for the ABI pattern), wherefore the heterostructure exhibits metallic properties. Compared with the isolated monolayers, the light absorption of the heterostructure at the blue-ultraviolet region is greatly enhanced. The adjustable band gap and outstanding light absorption capacity indicate that the ZnSe/AlP heterostructure is promising as an effective candidate for the optoelectronic devices. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","60","Phosphorus compounds","Aluminum compounds - Calculations - Density functional theory - Electric fields - Electronic properties - Energy gap - II-VI semiconductors - III-V semiconductors - Light absorption - Monolayers - Optical lattices - Optical properties - Optoelectronic devices - Selenium compounds - Strain - Van der Waals forces - Zinc compounds","Absorption capacity - Electronic and optical properties - External electric field - First principles - First-principles calculation - Interlayer spacings - Metallic properties - Two Dimensional (2 D)","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the GS layer, the alloys with different SFE exhibit various grain morphologies, grain size distributions and densities and distributions of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs). Because of these differences in the microstructural features of the GS layers, the alloys show different variations associated with SMAT during the Bauschinger unloading-reloading tests, i.e. the increment of true stress decreases sharply with a decrease of SFE at small strains, while it slightly decreases at large strains. It is found that SFE can significantly affect grain boundary strengthening and back stress hardening to synthetically improve the tensile strength of GS Cu-Al alloys to different levels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","42","Copper alloys","Aluminum alloys - Binary alloys - Grain boundaries - Grain size and shape - Hardening - Microstructural evolution - Stacking faults - Tensile strength - Unloading","Back stress - Cu-Al alloys - Gradient structure - Stacking fault energies - Surface mechanical attrition treatments","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 18YF1428600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51561015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51664033, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51701036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work was financially supported by the Shanghai Sailing Program (China, Grant No. 18YF1428600 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (China, Grant No. 51664033 , 51561015 and 51701036 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

First, we analyze the time correlation of a traditional state space model (SSM) and derive a convolutional space model (CSM) to decode the movement position of the macaque finger. Compared with the traditional model, the model can correlate the current moment state with the previous moment. In addition, we have improved the original SSM model using the CSM model. In its observation equation, the number of spike signals at one is expanded to the number of spike signals at multiple previous moments. In this way, the current time state in the improved model can be related to the number of spike signals at a plurality of previous times. In the experiment, a group of public data are used to validate the decoding performance of the model, and a least squares, a batch recursive least squares, and a gradient descent algorithms are used to train the model. The experimental results show that the decoding error of the CSM model and the improved SSM model is smaller than that of the traditional model, and thus, they have a better decoding accuracy.

Statistical data show that equipment failure rate of GIS is only 20%-40% of traditional open switching devices. However, as GIS is designed as a fully enclosed structure, once something goes wrong, the diagnosis process is much more complex and the time necessary for fault repair becomes much longer [4-5]. For instance, a severe short circuit fault occurred in Jiangsu Power Grid, China in 2014 due to the development of cracks on a disc insulator.

The mechanical properties of cemented backfill in the goaf were analyzed. It was found that the cemented backfill mainly improved the stress state of the roof rock mass, which provided the support for the broken rock mass of the roof and the lateral pressure for the surrounding rock of the stope, resisted the closure of the stope and limited the flow of tailings. Therefore, a compressive strength model was established under the dangerous mechanical environment for cemented backfill (one side is exposed and the other side bears the pressure of tailings). This model was based on the collapse caused by shear failure of cemented backfill, and fully considered the factors affecting its stability. In this model, the wedge sliding theory was also used to analyze the limit equilibrium condition of the 3D wedge-shaped structure with a slip trend on the sliding surface of cemented backfill. The reasonability of the strength model has been verified by the vertical stress measurements and the stability of the 51 exploratory line cemented filling body of 48-54 panel of Dahongshan copper mine. The results provide significant references to the theoretical study of filling mining in-depth and the corresponding application in similar mines. © 2019, Science Press.

In this study, a nanocomposite film based on PLA incorporated with 0-, 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-, or 15-wt% nano-Ag was developed. Effect of multiscale structure on the barrier properties of PLA/nano-Ag films was studied. The PLA nanocomposite film with 5-wt% nano-Ag had the lowest water vapor permeability (WVP) value. Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) value for PLA nanocomposites with 3-wt% nano-Ag was found to be the lowest among all the samples. Multiscale structure was demonstrated by the scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction measurement, and differential scanning calorimetry results. The crystallinity of the PLA phase increased with the content of nano-Ag in the PLA composites. The evolution of the PLA phase crystallinity could improve the barrier properties of PLA/nano-Ag composite films for food packaging applications. From the view of multiscale structure, it is better to achieve a balance among short-range conformation in the amorphous region, long-range-ordered structure, and ordered aggregated structure to improve the barrier properties of PLA/nano-Ag composite films. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","33","Nanocomposite films","Amorphous films - Crystallinity - Differential scanning calorimetry - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Lactic acid - Nanocomposites - Oxygen permeable membranes - Scanning electron microscopy - Silver compounds - Structural properties - Water vapor","Aggregated structure - Biodegradable packaging - Gas barrier properties - Multi-scale structures - Oxygen transmission rates - Pla nanocomposites - Poly lactic acid - Water vapor permeability",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Our algorithm hybridizes deep-learning algorithms such as word2vec and recurrent neural network (RNN) with classical techniques to improve the performance of text analysis. Given the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the software requirement descriptions on websites, the instance-transfer learning method is utilized to construct a robust classifier and predict domain feature knowledge based on domain knowledge similar to the target domain. The bagging clustering algorithm is utilized with multiple clustering algorithms to help select transfer instances. [Author to confirm changes.]The RNN-based algorithm is utilized as a useful alternative to predict missing features by studying the requirement descriptions of a related software system, while word2vec is utilized to extract sensible feature keywords for the specific software domain. [Author to confirm changes.]Our RNN model for every subclass is based on the clustering result, and we construct subclass classifiers to recommend requirement keywords. Requirement features recommended by our algorithm potentially increase opportunities for requirement classification, promote software requirement quality, and deliver more reliable software products.
