In our study, the geographical origin and cultivation year classification of 662 cultivated P. yunnanensis rhizome, stem and leaf samples from Yuxi, Lijiang and Honghe cities were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectra using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF) methods combined with multi-source information fusion strategies. Firstly, samples collected from Honghe procedure among all geographical origins were showed higher consistency by biomass analysis. Besides, the PLS-DA model of leaves part was obtained the better geographical origin classification ability than that of underground part (rhizomes), which demonstrate that leaves can be applied to identify geographical origins of P. yunnanensis effectively. And the geographical origins have a greater influence on the P. yunnanensis samples than the cultivation years. Thirdly, the PLS-DA model based on aerial parts combined with high-level multi-source information fusion strategy and important variables selection method can reach the best classification effect (100%) as same as the models of individual dataset of rhizomes.

This article presents a new framework design and establishes validations for the simulator for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (SimPCNL) assessment with the consideration of cybersecurity in the implementation. In particular, the new cybersecurity awareness design includes code security and hardware security. SimPCNL is mainly composed of a personal computer and two PHANTOM Omni (three-dimensional haptic device) with one stylus that mimics the percutaneous needle. A database storing clinical fluoroscopic images of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and a reproduced visual–haptic environment mimicking actual surgical performance consist of the training interface. In total, 54 professors comprising 36 medical students and 18 urologists were employed to evaluate the simulator we designed, which performed in the surgical department of Yunnan First People’s Hospital. Objective metrics and Global Rating Scale questionnaire are used to record the face and content validities, skills improvement validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. The median appraisal value of the face and content was 4 (1–5) by 18 urologists. Professors’ results demonstrated extremely better than medical students’ in total evaluation results. After a training group of medical students, SimPCNL showed a better result than the commercial training framework, especially for the quantitative feedbacks group. SimPCNL Global Rating Scale scores and objective assessment demonstrated a better result than PERC Mentor in percutaneous renal access surgical training. Training percutaneous renal access on SimPCNL is reliable and versatile through the face, content, improvement construct, and criterion validations.

It had been proved that BPCAs could be adopted to describe the carbon black or condensed organic matter in the environment quantitatively and qualitatively. Then, biochar was prepared from cellulose (CE) and lignin (LG) at different temperatures (0-500). The variations of BPCAs information before and after NaClO oxidation were analyzed and compared by conventional physicochemical characterization. The results indicated that the total content of BPCAs and the relative content of benzene hexacarboxylic acid (B6CA) increased with the increasing preparation temperature of biochars, which meant that the condensation degree of biochar increased with the increasing temperature and the condensation degree of lignin biochar was higher than that of cellulose biochar at the same temperature. NaClO oxidation resulted in a BPCAs mass loss of 1.8%-79.3% in biochar, while there was no obvious change of BPCA proportion in each individual monomer, indicting that NaClO oxidation would not alter the distribution pattern of BPCAs in biochar. Both the ratios of benzene pentacarboxylic acid/benzene hexacarboxylic acid (B5CA/B6CA) and benzene hexacarboxylic acid/benzene tetracarboxylic acid (B6CA/B4CAs) were employed to discriminate the source of environmental carbon black, and the denoted same biochars sources before and after NaClO oxidation confirmed that BPCAs method is highly reliable in identifying biochar sources in the environment. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

The effect of microwave heating temperatures, crystallization time and silica to alumina ratio on the synthesis of Y-type zeolite is systematically investigated. The synthesized samples are characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, N2 sorption and particle size analysis. Microwave treatment was found to promote the high-temperature synthesis of Y-type zeolite with the advantages of shorter crystallization time and product properties of the produced Y-type zeolite. Specifically, under the optimized conditions, such as input ratio of Si/Al of 4, microwave heating temperature of 150 °C, crystallization time of 0.5 h, pure Y-type zeolite is synthesized with BET specific surface area of 645 m2/g and the total pore volume is 0.322 cm3/g. The evolution order of zeolites with crystallization temperature is as follows: amorphous phase, Y-type zeolite, and P2 zeolite. An extended crystallization time or increased ratio of Si/Al facilitated the formation of P2 zeolite and analcime-C. The synthesis process promoted by microwave is explained by the high-speed rotation of polar water molecules, the formation of isolated water molecules and the dispersion of initial aluminosilicate gel in the microwave field. © 2019","34","Zeolites","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Molecules - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Silica - Synthesis (chemical)","BET specific surface area - Crystallization temperature - High temperature - High temperature condition - High-temperature synthesis - Liquid-phase synthesis - Microwave synthesis - Y-type zeolites","711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018M633424, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, China ( 2018M633424 ); the first batch of Yunnan Provincial Postdoctoral Research Fund Project , China; Yunnan Province Post-Doctoral Training Fund, China in 2018; Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province, China in 2019 and Kunming University of Science and Technology, China for Post-Doctoral Fellowship.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Here we investigate dominant climatic drivers and test actively-discussed hypotheses of Southeast China δ18Op variability over multiple timescales, using an 8-yr-long daily δ18Op record from Guangzhou and updated GNIP dataset from Hong Kong. Our moisture source diagnostic analyses suggest that the primary moisture of Guangzhou precipitation essentially comes from the proximal northern South China Sea (SCS). Convective activities over the primary moisture source regions, measured by cumulative precipitation along back-trajectory, regional precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, play a key role in regulating δ18Op variability across different timescales. These effects can be related to the direct changes of convection intensity over the SCS or the indirect changes associated with the shift of moisture source. In consequence, δ18Op records seasonal monsoon dynamics associated with the intertropical convergence zone migration and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Further tests of different hypotheses and their links to the ENSO via the 2015 strong El Niño event support the above conclusions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Southeast China δ18Op represents a spatial-temporally integrated measure of precipitation and convection tracing from the measured site to moisture sources, shedding light on the interpretation of paleo-isotope data in the monsoon domain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","48","Moisture","Atmospheric pressure - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Climatology - Heat convection - Isotopes - Statistical tests","Cumulative precipitation - ENSO - Intertropical convergence zone - Moisture sources - monsoon - Northern South China Sea - Outgoing longwave radiation - Oxygen isotopes","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2019M653505, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 32110-31610332, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 41672162, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41807415, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41872217, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank X.

SPRRI includes three sub-indexes, which contain (1) the labile P pool size, (2) resupply constant (r) and desorption rate (Dspt rate) for P transfer and (3) the molar ratio between iron (Fe) in sequential extraction for sediment P by bicarbonate-dithionite (BD) and aluminum (Al) by NaOH (at 25 °C), i.e. BD(Fe)/Al[NaOH25] in sediment solid. The first sub-index considers P release from (i) sediment with NH4Cl-P+BD-P pool, i.e. the loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P) plus iron associated P (BD-P), or (ii) sediment with NH4Cl-P pool, respectively. The second and third sub-indexes reflect kinetic P desorption and resupply ability of solid phase, and the effect of P sequestration by Al hydroxide on P release, in turn. The inner relationship between SPRRI and sub-indexes, and their effects on P release risk are elucidated. SPRRI can be used to evaluate sediment P reactivity by five release risk ranks. For Lake Dianchi (China), P transfer dynamics, labile P pool, resupply ability and Al-P in sediment, and 'external P-loading' control and affect P release risk in different regions, which is reflected by the spatial distribution map for SPRRI.

The main idea behind portal-based rendering is that when a given portal is visible, the cell which is behind the portal is visible, and otherwise it is invisible. In order to simplify the complexity of visibility determination, they always define portal as a planar convex polygon and the usefulness of portals for scene composition is limited. A more useful portal is a general portal which can be an arbitrary polygon or be thick and connect any two independent cells, and we call it arbitrary portal. In this paper, we provide an improved scan-line algorithm, which is based on portal texture for rendering arbitrary portal. First, we simplify an arbitrary portal to rectangle portal. Then, we use ray-casting method to sample the visible area of rectangle portal and get the corresponding portal texture. Thirdly, an improved scan-line algorithm is created to render arbitrary portal correctly by using portal texture. Our focus is to discuss the details of the improved scan-line algorithm. We have devised some tests to verify the correctness of our algorithm. The testing results showed that our system could run smoothly on the general personal computer and render the arbitrary portals correctly. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","13","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geometry - Intelligent computing - Personal computers - Visibility","Convex polygon - Ray casting - Scan line - Scene composition - Visibility determination","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 741.2 Vision - 921 Mathematics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The first part of this two-paper series developed and validated the continuous kinetic-dynamic-hydro fully coupled temporal-spatial scale relativistic hybrid particle-in-cell and lattice Boltzmann (RHPIC-LBM) model and code for investigating the fine structure evolution of the 2.5D solar atmosphere LTSTMR activities. Based on the model and code developed in Part I, in this paper, we investigate the turbulence of the magnetic helical structure, current density vector fields, self-generating-organization magnetic potential vector fields, self-feeding-sustaining plasma motion, and the ion and electron acceleration of 3D LTSTMR with 100,000 CPU cores on the Tianhe-2 from National Supercomputer Center in Guang Zhou (NSCC-GZ). According to the simulation evidence, we discovered and confirmed the following results: (i) Slipping magnetic reconnection (MR) exists in the adjacent magnetic field lines (MFLs) during the compress-stretch-slip process on the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs and MFLs drastically change and form a linkage span) and the adjacent MFLs’ break-rejoin MR exists on the separatrix surfaces (SLs). Both are consistent to observations [1,2]; (ii) The slipping MR (defined as 1st type MR) and the MFLs’ break-rejoin MR (defined as 2nd type MR) are closely linked with the oblique and resistive tearing instabilities, respectively. In the 3D model, the 1st type MR forms O-type null points, while the 2nd type MR forms X-type null points. The magnetic energy conversion is dominated by turbulence-induced oblique instabilities in the 3D model instead of the resistive tearing instabilities in the 2D/2.5D model, which is consistent with the 3D observations [3–5]; (iii) Magnetic energy conversion occurs in the interaction of the plasmoid-to-flux rope, plasmoid-to-plasmoid, and flux rope-to-flux rope. The turbulent acceleration is an independent acceleration mechanism in LTSTMR, induced by the interaction of waves-to-waves and waves-to-particles, which is different from the original hybrid acceleration mechanism (composed of parallel electric fields, betatron, shock and Fermi); (iv) Particles can be energized and accelerated at a longer time scale (−30 s) and can be accelerated to relativistic energies after being pre-accelerated by a Fermi-Betatron-shock wave acceleration process. These results are in agreement with the observations [6–9]. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","87","Magnetoplasma","3D modeling - Acceleration - Betatrons - Charged particles - Electric fields - Energy conversion - Magnetic bubbles - Magnetic fields - Plasma turbulence - Rope - Shock waves - Supercomputers","3D LTSTMR - Acceleration mechanisms - Current density vectors - Electron acceleration - Magnetic reconnections - Parallel electric fields - Relativistic HPIC-LBM - Turbulent magnetic reconnections","525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932.1.1 Particle Accelerators - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: 11333007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013CBA01503, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: U1501501, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1631130, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the strategic priority research program of CAS (XDA17040507, XDA15010900), the national basic research program of China (2013CBA01503), the key program of NSFC (11333007), joint funds of NSFC (U1631130), frontier science key programs of CAS (QYZDJ-SSWSLH012), the program for innovation team of Yunnan Province, the program for Guangdong introducing Innovative and entrepreneurial teams (2016ZT06D211), and the special program for applied research on super computation of the NSFC-Guangdong joint fund (second phase) under No. U1501501.

Rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were used to assess the in vitro biocompatibility of porous Ti-40Nb alloys. Results showed that porous Ti-40Nb alloys consisted of β and phase. The pore characteristics of the Ti-40Nb alloy could be controlled by the combination process of SPS technique and space holder method. With different volume ratios (10%-50%) of the space-holder (NH4HCO3) added, Ti-40Nb alloys possessed interconnected structures with micro/macro-pores and 13.4%-61.2% porosity. The elastic modulus and compression strength of porous Ti-40Nb alloys were in the range of 18.4-27.3 GPa/326-452 MPa, which were close to the natural human bone. Cell morphology and cell proliferation studies showed good cell adherence and growth on all group of alloys, suggesting non-toxicity and great biocompatibility of Ti-40Nb alloys.

The reinforced rock and pipe-roofs can be considered as an anisotropic plate on elastic foundation with specific constraints on the four edges. The model of anisotropic plate on elastic foundation is established and solved by finite element method-COMSOL PDE. The mechanic behaviors of pipe-roofs are analyzed. The supporting effects of two commonly used types of pipe-roofs(Φ76 mm and Φ108 mm) are compared and analyzed based on the model tests' result. The research shows that: (1) the stress and deformation of the grouting stabilization area mainly appear in the section no more than 6m ahead of the working face. After adjusting Φ76 mm pipe-roof to Φ108 mm pipe-roof, My and Mx increase by 56.9% and 5.5% respectively, while the maximum deflection decreases by 38%. It shows that the greater the stiffness of pipe-roof support, the more upper load it needs to bear. So the deformation of surrounding rock can be effectively controlled by reducing the relaxation deformation and stress release of the upper surrounding rock. My of Φ108 mm and Φ76 mm pipe-roof are 13 and 20 times the size of Mx respectively, which indicates that the pipe-roof has obvious effect on My along the tunnel. But the Mx can not be neglected. Model tests show that a bearing arch is formed with the pipe-roof and the surrounding rock to bear the upper load during the tunnel's excavation. Along the longitudinal direction of the tunnel, the pipe-roof plays a role of supporting beam to reduce the rock mass's deformation and the stress release and improve the stabilization of the working face.The achievements are successfully applied in the shallow buried tunnel's construction. The tunnel's section is large, and the surrounding rock mass is very weak, and an existing highway project stands nearly.

This system was previously known to host two transiting planets: one with a period of 3 days (R = 2.4 R; Kepler-411b) and one with a period of 7.8 days (R = 4.4 R; Kepler-411c), as well as a transiting planetary candidate with a 58-day period (R = 3.3 R; KOI 1781.03) from Kepler photometry. Here, we combine Kepler photometry data and new transit timing variation (TTV) measurements from all the Kepler quarters with previous adaptive-optics imaging results, and dynamical simulations, in order to constrain the properties of the Kepler-411 system. From our analysis, we obtain masses of 25.6 ± 2.6 M for Kepler-411b and 26.4 ± 5.9 M for Kepler-411c, and we confirm the planetary nature of KOI 1781.03 with a mass of 15.2 ± 5.1 M, hence the name Kepler-411d. Furthermore, by assuming near-coplanarity of the system (mutual inclination below 30°), we discover a nontransiting planet, Kepler-411e, with a mass of 10.8 ± 1.1 M on a 31.5-day orbit, which has a strong dynamical interaction with Kepler-411d. With densities of 1.71 ± 0.39 g cm-3 and 2.32 ± 0.83 g cm-3, both Kepler-411c and Kepler-411d belong to the group of planets with a massive core and a significant fraction of volatiles.

This paper abstracted the spread of toxic gas in a limited space and was considered to be analogous to the spread of traffic congestion. Initially, real-time traffic data through a web crawling service of the high-tech map API was carried out using Python; subsequently, the crawling data, floating car data, traffic data monitored by SCATS, and additional relevant traffic information, were preprocessed. Considering the influence of traffic status of the neighbor nodes, road sections, and different levels of road, on the congestion transmission range, the space-time model of urban road congestion radiation based on the Cloud model was established. The model adjustment parameter U was calibrated, and it was observed that U values of the express and the main trunk roads were obtained as 1 compared to the U values of secondary trunk roads, which were obtained as 0.7. Subsequently, the results of the model calculation were compared with the actual values and the predicted values based on high-tech map for verification using the sample in the study. The model used in the study exhibits positive attributes, including maximum radiation boundary and higher prediction accuracy of congestion radiation time, strong applicability, and high compliance to the entire congestion process. Finally, based on the space-time model of urban road congestion radiation, using the principle of shear stress damage caused to materials in material mechanics, and taking a particular direction of congestion as the research objective, the failure value of traffic capacity is calculated, which is caused by congestion radiation transmission to a section of the road network. Analysis of the damage impact on capacity decline of road network service capability, and further to provide identification method for the importance of the road segment. This study can serve as a reference model for traffic management departments to strengthen the management of key road sections and formulate congestion mitigation policies. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

In this work, from the viewpoint of crystal structure, we develop a novel Mn2+-doped phosphor, SrGa2Si2O8:Mn2+, to realize multi-band and thermal-stable emission. We found that the multiple band emission originates from three Mn2+-induced luminescence centers, i.e. Mn2+ in Ga3+ site, Mn2+ in Sr2+ site, and Mn2+-Mn2+ dimers, due to their different crystal field environments. Meanwhile, excellent thermal-stable emission (up to 200 °C) is obtained as a result of the energy transfer between the traps and the luminescence centers. What is more, the different energy transfer paths of the SrGa2Si2O8:Mn2+ lead to a red-shift of emission, which can help to improve color rendering index of light sources. Our results demonstrate that this new phosphor shows a potential for the application of high-power PC-wLEDs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","43","Crystal structure","Energy transfer - Light - Light emitting diodes - Luminescence - Phosphors - Red Shift - Thermodynamic stability","Broadband emission - Color rendering index - High thermal stability - Long-wave emissions - Luminescence centers - Luminescent centers - Thermally stable - White light emitting diodes","641.1 Thermodynamics - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2016FB081, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: KKSY201632046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11774138, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 11774138 , 11664022 , 51862020 , 11804255 , and 11664022 ), the Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FA021 and 2016FB081), and the project for personal training fun supported by Kunming University of Science and Technology ( KKSY201632046 ).

In addition, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA)algorithm was introduced to realize a multi-scenario simulation to facilitate different decision-making preferences. The results showed that (1)the overall landscape ecological risk probability in Shenzhen, China, was higher in the west than in the east, and the dominated probability levels were low and moderate. (2)Three decision-making scenarios were simulated: basic risk control, moderate risk control, and strict risk control. About 307.88 km2 of unstable risk probability areas were identified, of which the relationship between development and protection should be scrutinized more in the “eastward strategy” for the future. (3)As for the methodology, this index system contained multiple dimensions including ecological processes, external threats, and landscape feature patterns.

The results showed that the max release of DTP was reduced in covering material, which attributed to the changes of pH, Eh and characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by the effect of covering material. The application of iron oxide material significant reduced the release of DTP in the northern and southern part of the lake, with decrease rate of 44.3% and 35.7%, respectively. by contrast, the application of aluminum oxide material significant reduced the release of DTP in the middle part sediment, with decrease rate of 29.6%. Furthermore, the release of SRP and DOP in different sediments has significant difference after added different material. In northern part of sediment, the release of SRP and DOP reduced by 35.6% and 36.2% after added iron oxide material. This is because iron oxide can reduce the pH and Eh but increase the availability of DOM in northern, and then benefits for inhibiting the release of SRP and DOP. In the middle, the release of sediment SRP and DOP reduced by 28.9% and 31.6% after added aluminum oxide material. This is because the aluminum oxide can facilitate the availability of DOM in middle, and then inhibits the release of SRP and DOP. In southern part of the lake, the release of sediment SRP and DOP reduced by 47.4% and 16.5% after added iron oxide material. This is largely attributed to the effect of iron oxide on the pH and Eh. Therefore, to control the release of P in the sediment from Lake Erhai, iron oxide material should be selected in the northern and southern parts, whereas aluminum oxide should be selected in the middle part of the lake. © 2019, Science Press.

The most extant software for detecting footprints of WGDs has been restricted to a well-assembled genome. However, the massive poor quality genomes and the more accessible transcriptomes have been largely ignored, and in theoretically they are also likely to contribute to detect WGD using dS based method. Here, to resolve these problems, we have designed a universal and simple technical tool WGDdetector for detecting WGDs using either genome or transcriptome annotations in different organisms based on the widely used dS based method. Results: We have constructed WGDdetector pipeline that integrates all analyses including gene family constructing, dS estimating and phasing, and outputting the dS values of each paralogs pairs processed with only one command. We further chose four species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Juglans regia, Populus trichocarpa and Xenopus laevis) representing herb, wood and animal, to test its practicability. Our final results showed a high degree of accuracy with the previous studies using both genome and transcriptome data. Conclusion: WGDdetector is not only reliable and stable for genome data, but also a new way to using the transcriptome data to obtain the correct dS distribution for detecting WGD.

Among various anodes, the CuO anode possesses a high specific capacity of 670 mAh g−1. However, the CuO anode suffers from capacity fading after the first cycle, and the reason is not clear up enough to now. To investigate the nature of CuO anode lithiation–delithiation conversion in lithium-ion batteries, we investigated the phase conversion of CuO anode by in situ X-ray diffraction. We discovered that the specific discharge capacity of CuO during the first discharge cycle is usually more than 670 mAh g−1, but this value decreases to approximately 400–450 mAh g−1 after the second cycle and is stable for the subsequent cycles. The in situ X-ray diffraction observations reveal that in the discharge process of the first cycle, the CuO crystalline phase changes gradually to Cu. However, during the charge process of the first cycle, the delithiation product phase is Cu2O. The same phenomenon occurs again in the second charging–discharging cycle. The obtained scientific understanding reveals that the nature of CuO anode lithiation–delithiation phase conversion in Li-ion battery is between Cu2O and Cu, not CuO and Cu, which is responsible for capacity fading of CuO anode. The present research provides a certain scientific basis for the application of CuO in lithium-ion batteries. The in situ XRD method is helpful to understand the mechanism of electrochemical behaviour of other transition metal oxygen (sulphur, and fluorine) and can make an in-depth study of the searching for commercial anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","29","Lithium-ion batteries","Anodes - Charging (batteries) - Copper oxides - Ions - Lithium compounds - Transition metals - X ray diffraction","Crystalline phase - Discharge process - Electrochemical behaviour - High energy densities - High specific capacity - In-situ X-ray diffraction - Phase conversion - Specific discharge capacity",,"Number: 2015Z118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD059, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21463028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; ","This work was financially supported by National Natural Scientific Fund of China (No.21463028, No.21761035, No.21565031, 21665027), YMU-DEA-KIN International Associated Laboratory on Functional Materials, Key Laboratory of Resource Clean Conversion in Ethnic Region, Education Department of Yunnan Province, the general program of the application and basic research foundation of Yunnan province (2016FD059), the key project of scientific research foundation of educational bureau of Yunnan province (2015Z118), Innovative Training Program of Yunnan Minzu University for Undergraduates.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The SFCC catalyst is firstly activated in microwave field by acid solution and then used as an aluminum source for the synthesis of zeolite-Y. The activation effect of hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid on the SFCC catalyst, and the synthesis effects of zeolite-Y production from the activated SFCC catalyst under microwave are studied by ICP, XRD, SEM, and N2 sorption studies. The results show that microwave-assisted acid activation process can facilitate the formation of the active γ-Al2O3 and as well enhance the crystallinity of zeolite-Y in the SFCC catalyst, which is beneficial for the synthesis of zeolite-Y. Compared with the inactivated SFCC catalyst, the activated SFCC catalyst has a larger specific surface area and a lower contaminated metal content. The specific surface areas of SFCC catalyst after activation by hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid are 197.1 and 113.6 m2/g, respectively, indicating better activation by hydrochloric acid compared to oxalic acid in the microwave field. The results demonstrate that increasing the synthesis temperature and prolonging the crystallization time favor the growth of zeolite-Y crystal particles, however, zeolite-Y partially transforms into zeolite-P. The priority of different aluminum sources in zeolite-Y synthesis is: hydrochloric acid activated SFCC catalyst > oxalic acid activated SFCC catalyst > inactivated SFCC catalyst. The zeolite-Y having a particle size range of 0.3–1 μm is successfully synthesized from the activated SFCC catalyst at 100 °C for 2 h under microwave at 2 kg/cm2 pressure and 1000 W power. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","36","Oxalic acid","Activated alumina - Aluminum - Aluminum oxide - Catalysts - Catalytic cracking - Chemical activation - Hydrochloric acid - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Particle size - Specific surface area - Zeolites","Acid activation - Contaminated metal - Crystallization time - Microwave heating process - Microwave synthesis - Spent FCC catalysts - Synthesis temperatures - Zeolite-Y","541.1 Aluminum - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 2018M633424, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2015FA017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; ","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant ( 2018M633424 ), Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province ( 2015FA017 ), The first batch of Yunnan Provincial Postdoctoral Research Fund Project, Post-Doctoral Training Fund Program of Yunnan Province in 2018 and Kunming University of Science and Technology for Post-Doctoral Fellowship.

The use of the groundwater level in monitoring tectonic strain, however, is hindered by the enigmatic response discrepancy among wells (different responses may be recorded by even closely clustered wells). Therefore, understanding the factors that control the sensitivity of well-aquifer systems in response to different periodic loadings is important. In this paper, we analyzed two closely located wells that show no response to seismic waves and respond differently to earth tides and barometric pressure. We discuss these wells’ sensitivity of response to periodic loadings by using the spectrum, barometric response function, tidal response, and slug test methods. Our results show that the different response characteristics are due to the differences in permeability and confinement of the well-aquifer systems. Well-aquifer systems with a low permeability cannot record coseismic responses, even if they can record clear tidal and barometric signals. In addition, periodic loading signals in shallow aquifers will be easily masked by the interference from the surface, for example rainfall or pumping, which diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio of the tectonic activity. Thus, the hydrogeological and tectonic settings are the two key factors that should be considered in choosing a suitable monitoring well location for tectonic strain monitoring. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","34","Groundwater resources","Aquifers - Atmospheric pressure - Hydrogeology - Seismic waves - Seismology - Signal to noise ratio - Strain - Tectonics - Testing - Tides - Water levels","Aquifer systems - Barometric pressure - Barometric response - Mechanical coupling - Periodic loading - Response characteristic - Response functions - Tidal response","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.2 Groundwater - 471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 951 Materials Science","Number: 41502239, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41602266, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1602233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: ZDJ2014-05, Acronym: CEA, Sponsor: China Earthquake Administration; Number: ZDJ2014-13, Acronym: CEA, Sponsor: China Earthquake Administration; ","The original water level and barometric pressure data supporting this article are from the monitoring center of the Yunnan Earthquake Agency, China, these data were extremely important for the study and the knowledge gained.

Currently used detection methods have many shortcomings, such as incomprehensive consideration of influencing factors, poor model adaption, and low accuracy. We propose a method that detects the ultraviolet pulse number (P), temperature (T), and humidity (H). Meanwhile, discharge intensity (J') was preliminarily estimated by UV detection using a fuzzy algorithm. Next, the ANFIS algorithm with a self-study mechanism and an artificial neural network was introduced, which assessed that the discharge intensity is J. A UV detection circuit was established while carrying out a field test. The preliminary evaluation data of the fuzzy were used as training and testing data of ANFIS. The optimized model was obtained after ANFIS multiple trainings. Experimental results show that the relationships between P, T, H, and J in the optimized model are consistent with those of theoretical deduction. The assessment results remain highly stable with the occurrence of changes in external conditions, which indicates the feasibility of the ANFIS algorithm in UV detection of discharge intensity of electric equipment.

Also, the effects of doping level, AgNO3 concentration, and HF concentration on the morphology and structure of porous silicon nanowire were investigated. The results show that the higher doping level is beneficial for etching the silicon wafer and forming silicon nanowire arrays. This is because the higher doping level introduces more impurities and defects on the surface of the silicon wafer, and at the same time, the Schottky barrier between the silicon wafer with the higher doping level and the solution is lower. Thus, the silicon wafer is easier to oxidate to form nanowire arrays. The AgNO3 concentration plays a critical role in the fabrication of the porous silicon nanowire arrays during the one-step MACE process. If AgNO3 concentration is too low or too high, corrosion pits and collapsed clusters of nanowires could form on the surface of the silicon wafer. When AgNO3 concentration was 0.02 mol•L-1, silicon nanowires grew and became longer, eventually forming a porous array of silicon nanowire. In the meantime, as silicon nanowires grew, capillary stress between nanowires caused agglomeration at the top of some nanowires. Furthermore, when HF solution concentration exceeded 4.6 mol•L-1, the length of silicon nanowire increased with increasing HF concentration. Furthermore, a porous structure was formed on top the silicon nanowire, and the porosity of the silicon nanowires increased with increasing HF concentration. This was due to a large number of Ag+ random nucleations at the top of the nanowires, and lateral etching of the silicon nanowires occurred. In the end, the formation process of the porous silicon nanowires is explained by a model based on the experimental phenomena. It is attributed to the deposition of silver ions and the oxidation of dissolved silicon substrates. © All right reserved.","20","Porous silicon","Corrosion - Etching - Fabrication - Hydrofluoric acid - Metal ions - Monocrystalline silicon - Morphology - Nanowires - Porosity - Schottky barrier diodes - Silicon wafers - Silver compounds","Deposition of silvers - Formation mechanism - Metal-assisted chemical etching - Morphology and structures - Porous silicon nanowires - Porous structures - Silicon nanowire arrays - Silicon substrates","531.1 Metallurgy - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 712.1.1 Single Element Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Through the sample sedimentation coefficient and viscosity characteristics, the effects of dispersant type and mass fraction, NiFe2O4 nanoparticle mass fraction, emulsifier type and temperature on the magnetic field sedimentation stability of magnetic fluid were studied, and the better parameters for preparing cycloalkyl NiFe2O4 magnetic fluid were obtained.

For stereoscopic displays, the horizontal disparity is the most important information to produce depth perception. When the stereo pair stimuli are presented separately to both eyes with disparities and those two stimuli also differ in color but share an iso-luminance polarity, it is possible for stereopsis and color rivalry to coexist. In this paper, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to quantitatively measure the color fusion limit at different disparity levels. In particular, it examined how disparities affect the binocular color fusion limit. A binocular color fusion limit was measured at five relative disparity levels: 0, ±60, and ±120 arc minutes for five sample color points, which were selected from the 1976 CIE u'v' chromaticity diagram. The experimental results show that the color fusion limit for each sample point varies with the disparity magnitude, disparity sign, and color direction. It is new research finding that the color fusion limit increases as the disparity increases from -120 to +120 arc minutes. The average color fusion limit ranges from 0.036 to 0.064 in terms of Euclidean distance in the u'v' chromaticity diagram ( \Delta \text {E}-{\mathrm {u'v'}} ). The new finding shows that the human eye has different information processing mechanisms for crossed disparity (sign -) and uncrossed disparity (sign +), and uncrossed disparity can contribute to color fusion. We suggest that the color fusion limit varies with the color direction, but it has nothing to do with the distribution of cone cells. The color fusion limit was quantified by using ellipses in the chromaticity diagram, and the axis of the ellipses ranges from 0.017 to 0.145~\Delta \text {E}-{\mathrm {u'v'}}. The experiments and data analysis in this paper indicate that the binocular disparity fusion affects binocular color fusion.

Second, according to the engraving plotter direct solution equation, the boundary of workspace is determined and the volume is calculated by using the optimisation algorithm. In order to understand the change of workspace in different z planes, the workspace of the parallel part is intercepted by some planes, which are parallel to XOY; thus, the authors know that the cut plane area of the workspace increases with the increase of Z values.

The biosynthesis of dencichine requires the participation of sulfur. Selenium and sulfur are congeners. The purpose of this study was to reveal if selenium participates in the synthesis of dencichine, and to determine whether dencichine plays a role in anti-stress effects. P. notoginseng and planting soil were sampled from different sites and subjected to selenium and dencichine determinations. Biosynthesis of dencichine was investigated by exposing the seedlings to different selenium concentrations in pot and hydroponic experiments. The effects of dencichine on the regulation of the antioxidant enzyme system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also tested in hydroponic experiments. The results indicated that the selenium and dencichine contents of roots were 0.69-0.98% and 0.21–1.18 mg kg−1, respectively, and the soil selenium content in 18 planting areas in Yunnan Province was 0.16-0.32 mg kg−1. Dencichine and selenium contents in soil or plants were positively correlated (R2 = 0.1643***, R2 = 0.3084***, respectively). Selenium treatment increased the dencichine content by 69–111% in pot experiments using 5 mg kg−1 and by 23–33% in hydroponic experiments using 2 μM. The key genes in the dencichine biosynthetic pathway, such as β-cyanoalanine synthase and serine acetyltransferase, were significantly upregulated by the 2 μM selenium treatment. Dencichine treatment (30 μM) significantly enhanced root activity, increased antioxidant capacity, decreased ROS content, and reduced lipid peroxidation of the cell membranes. Therefore, selenium promoted the synthesis of dencichine, which acted as an anti-stress agent in P. notoginseng. However, the selenium content was deficient in the P. notoginseng planting soil from Yunnan Province. These results suggest that appropriate selenium supplementation is beneficial for the growth and development of P. notoginseng and the accumulation of dencichine. © 2019","35","Selenium","Amino acids - Antioxidants - Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Cytology - Plants (botany) - Soils - Sulfur","Hydroponic experiments - Non-enzymatic antioxidants - Reactive oxygen species - Root activities - Selenite - Selenium concentrations - Selenium supplementation - Serine acetyltransferase","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 41661069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81460580, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81460580; No. 41661069), Ministry of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2017ZF014, 2016ZF001), Standardization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Project (ZYBZH-C-YN-58).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Different kinds of depressants interact with pyrite to form hydrophilic film, prevent the oxidation of xanthate, occupy active sites of collector on pyrite surface, generate complexes, and adsorb extracellular secretion from microbial bacteria such as polysaccharides and proteins on pyrite; high alkali environment commonly used acid and salt activator to dissolve the hydrophilized film of pyrite to activate and recycle pyrite. The analysis suggested that the current research on the complex environment of minerals and pulp is still unclear, and it should be strengthened by means of modern analysis and testing and computer technology.

The myristicin-N-acetylcysteine adduct was identified by comparing the metabolic maps of myristicin and 1′-hydroxymyristicin. The supplement of N-acetylcysteine could protect against the cytotoxicity of myristicin and 1′-hydroxymyristicin in primary mouse hepatocytes. When the depletion of intracellular N-acetylcysteine was pretreated with diethyl maleate in hepatocytes, the cytotoxicity induced by myristicin and 1′-hydroxymyristicin was deteriorated. It suggested that the N-acetylcysteine adduct resulting from myristicin bioactivation was closely associated with myristicin toxicity.

PD will happen in flexible terminals at the working voltage when the temperature falls to -40. The PD of flexible terminal is more severe in negative half-cycle at low temperatures, and the asymmetric degree increases with the decrease of temperature and the development of discharge. Furthermore, the discharge mark is found in the boundary between the stress control tube and main insulation by dissecting a cable terminal. It is concluded that the reason for discharge is the reduction of matching ability between stress control tube and main insulation. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Yangzong Lake, one of the nine largest plateau lakes in Yunnan Province, has experienced severe arsenic contamination since 2008. Monitoring data further showed that lake-water arsenic concentration consistently exceeded the standards for drinking water quality, posing severe risk for water safety and ecosystem health. A spatial survey and analysis of surface water quality and phytoplankton in Yangzong Lake was conducted bimonthly from April 2015 to February 2016, covering the south, central and north parts of the lake basin, respectively. A total of 68 algal taxa were identified, with the largest number of taxa belonging to Chlorophyta. However, Cyanophyta was absolutely dominant throughout the study period, and consisted of Pseudoanabaena, Planktothrix and Aphanizomenon. These results were consistent with previous surveys of phytoplankton from this lake, confirming the cyanobacteria-dominated community structure after the occurrence of arsenic pollution. The analysis of variance demonstrated that the phytoplankton biomass exhibited a significant seasonal fluctuation, with a maximum value found in August (14.06 mg/L) and a minimum biomass occurring in December (1.23 mg/L), while no significant spatial variation was observed. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that phytoplankton total biomass was significantly and positively correlated with water temperature and pH, but negatively correlated with arsenic concentration, water transparency, manganese concentration, sodium concentration, potassium concentration and total phosphorus concentration. Redundancy analysis displayed that water temperature, arsenic concentration, calcium concentration, manganese concentration and potassium concentration altogether accounted for 57.18% of the community variation in Yangzong Lake. The variation partitioning further showed that the water temperature, calcium concentration and arsenic concentration accounted for 32.05% of the spatio-temporal variation of phytoplankton community in Yangzong Lake, while the water temperature, calcium concentration and arsenic concentration independently accounted for 12.45%, 8.28% and 2.33% of the total variance, respectively. The coupling of arsenic concentration and water temperature explained 9.46% of the community variation. Therefore, we infer that seasonal fluctuation of water temperature may have caused the change in lake stratification and the increased water mixing under lower temperature may promote the sediment release of arsenic, resulting in higher lake-water arsenic concentration and stronger community turnover of phytoplankton. This study will help to evaluate the long term ecological effect of heavy metals on lakes and provide scientific evidence for restoration of arsenic polluted plateau lakes. © 2019 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","56","Lake pollution","Arsenic - Biomass - Calcium - Correlation methods - Ecosystems - Health risks - Heavy metals - Lakes - Manganese - Metal analysis - Phytoplankton - Potable water - Potassium - Quality control - River pollution - Surveys - Temperature - Water pollution control - Water quality","Arsenic contamination - Community structures - Environmental factors - Pearson correlation analysis - Phytoplankton distributions - Potassium concentrations - Spatio-temporal variation - Spatiotemporal characteristics","444 Water Resources - 445.2 Water Analysis - 453 Water Pollution - 453.2 Water Pollution Control - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.7 Health Care - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Discrete Fourier transformation was used for analyzing the frequency domain characteristics of the surface temperature change, and the defects can be detected by identifying the abnormal regions in amplitude and phase thermal image sequences. The porosity and delamination defects at different depths in the sheath of composite insulators were detected by experiments, which proved the advantage of low frequency-domain thermal images in detecting the deeper defects.

Meanwhile, F is discharged in the form of SiF4(g). Kinetic analysis shows that the carbothermal reduction reaction is a graded reaction. Reaction order decreases with the increase of temperature. The reaction rate increases with temperature and decreases with time. The activation energy is 188.96 kJmol-1, which indicates that it is a highly energy-consuming reaction.

Copper-based chalcogenides as the core materials of optoelectronic applications have unique advantages and have attracted increasing attention. Among many copper (Cu)-based chalcogenides, ternary compounds of CuMO2 with delafossite structures have been used as promising candidates in many optoelectronic fields. However, there is not a comprehensive understanding of the variations of the intrinsic nature of delafossite CuMO2 compounds because of M3+-ion substitution. To solve these issues, CuMO2 (M = IIIA, 3d, 4d, 5d, and RE elements, a total number of 49) compounds are systematically analyzed by density functional theory based on a high-throughput computational platform. In the quasi-two-dimensional layered superlattice structure of the delafossite CuMO2 compound, the transport behavior of photogenerated carriers is affected mainly by the Cu hexagonal closed plane. The [CuO2] dumbbell structure and [MO6] octahedra mainly determine the generation of carriers excited by incident photons. The [CuM3O] tetrahedra that connect the other motifs mainly affect the behaviors between the generation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the heteroatomic interactions in the [CuM3O] tetrahedra are the decisive factors for the band gap values of delafossite CuMO2 compounds, which can be quantitatively described by the physical properties of the M component and can accurately predict the band gap value. Finally, these 49 delafossite CuMO2 compounds are classified and screened for the potential optoelectronic applications according to requirements and screening criteria of the band gap values for different optoelectronic functional applications. These calculated results will contribute to the further development of novel Cu-based optoelectronic functional materials and provide scientific support and theoretical guidance for subsequent related research. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","62","Density functional theory","Calculations - Chalcogenides - Computation theory - Copper - Copper oxides - Coremaking - Energy gap - Functional materials - Geometry","Computational platforms - First-principles calculation - Functional applications - High throughput screening - Optoelectronic applications - Optoelectronic functional materials - Photogenerated carriers - Super-lattice structures",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Unscrupulous traders used fibrous root powder pretending to be main root and rhizome powder of Panax notoginseng, and such behavior has serious influence on the quality and efficacy of Panax notoginseng. In this study, we have established a rapid method to discriminate the main root, rhizome and fibrous root powder and detect saponins content of Panax notoginseng in order to provide some research bases for rapid quality assessment of Panax notoginseng. A total of 60 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the main root, rhizome and fibrous root powder of Panax notoginseng were collected, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was used for measuring the content of notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd of samples. The origin data of identify model were processed by ordinate normalization and second derivative, and 2/3 of the 60 individuals were selected to form the calibration set by using Kennard-stone algorithm as well as the other 1/3 were used as validation set. Calibration set data were used to establish the discriminant model of support vector machine (SVM) and the cross-validation was used for screening optimal parameters c and g, and validation set data were used to verify the results of SVM discriminant model for external validation. The origin data used to predict saponins content were calculated by first (1D) and second derivative (2D), Savitsky-Golay smoothing with five, seven, nine, and eleven points. 2/3 of the 60 individuals were selected to form the calibration set and the rest were used as validation set. The orthogonal signal correction-partial least squares regression (OSC-PLSR) model was established by calibration set and the validation set was utilized to verify the results of the model for external validation. Results showed that, (1) with second derivative processing, the overlapped peak of FTIR spectra were efficiently separated and the resolution of the spectra has been improved. (2) The optimal parameters c and g of support vector machine calculated by cross-validation were 2.828 43 and 4.882 81×10-4 respectively and the optimal accuracy rate of calibration set was 100%. (3) The parameter of support vector machine model was set as the optimal parameter and the accuracy rate of validation set was 100%, and all samples in validation set have been identified correctly. (4) The prediction content of greatest model of notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd was close to the content measured by UPLC. The result indicated that, FTIR combined with support vector machine could effectively identify the main root, rhizome and fibrous root powder of Panax notoginseng. OSC-PLSR could accurately predict the content of four saponins of Panax notoginseng.

In this paper, we build an ethnical Chinese face database including three ethnical groups, and then manifold learning technique is applied to analyze facial ethnic features for discriminant semantic representation. Firstly, we conduct manifold analysis on the basis of facial geometric indicators that are proposed by anthropologist, which are eventually shown not distinguishable in semantics concepts. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the scope of facial features by calculating the complete distances, angles and indexes associated with landmarks. Then, mRMR-based feature selection is applied to select 2926 distance indicators, more than 210,000 angle indicators and more than 4,100,000 index indicators ethnical feature representation, and 5 datasets with features of distance, angle, index, anthropology and combinations are obtained. Secondly, several popular manifold learning methods, such as LPP, ISOMAP, LE, PCA and LDA are utilized to investigate the ethnic features obtained above, and the results show the distinguishable manifold structure of facial ethnical features and clusters in 4 of the 5 datasets. In order to evaluate the validity of filtered features, the classification algorithms, J48, SVM, RBF Network, Bayesian, and Bayes Network in Weka, are carried out based on the filtered features. The experimental results reveal that the average of classification accuracy on the dataset with combined features is higher than other datasets, and the corresponding indexes are more salient than other geometric features. Finally, the sub-manifold structures with semantic concepts are found based on the ethnic facial data. Facial features of three Chinese ethnic groups exist in different ethnic semantic sub-manifolds in the low-dimensional space. Facial measurement indicators obtained by manifold analysis and feature selection provide not only a method for computational facial ethnic groups analysis, but also an enrichment and improvement to the related research in anthropology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","46","Face recognition","Bayesian networks - Classification (of information) - Feature extraction - Geometry - Learning systems - Semantics","Classification accuracy - Classification algorithm - Ethnical Chinese groups - Facial ethnic features - Feature representation - Geometric similarity - Low-dimensional spaces - Semantic representation","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921 Mathematics - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The eutectic temperature of Sn-Bi binary alloy was 139 , and it could meet the requirements of low-temperature solder. Though the addition of Bi would make the material brittle, the intermetallic compound Ag3Sn by adding a small amount of Ag could improve brittleness of the alloy. The specimens with 99.95% purity of tin, bismuth and silver were melted in a certain proportion to form a certain shape. The phases, organization, melting point, microstructure, chemical composition, tensile strength and weldability of the samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscope (OM), thermal analyzer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), universal material testing machine and solder ability tester. The effects of Bi and Ag on phase composition, microstructure, melting point and weld ability were studied.The cooling and solidification process of SnBiAg three-phase diagram was analyzed. The results showed that the main crystalline phases of SnBiAg alloy were B-Sn phase with BCC structure and Bi phase with rhombic layered structure according to the XRD test. During the cooling and solidification process, the β-Sn phase was precipitated, and the Ag3Sn and Bi phases were subsequently precipitated. With the increase of Bi phase, Sn phase decreased and Ag3Sn phase was basically unchanged. The result was consistent with the phase equilibrium principle, the Sn phase and Bi phase did not change, and Ag3Sn phase increased with the increase of Ag content. As Bi content increased, the melting point decreased slightly, Bi phase changed from strip to lump, and the overall wettability became worse. As the Ag content increased, the segregation of Bi could be reduced, the melting point remained unchanged and the wettability was improved. Finally, the better alloy formula was Sn-38Bi-0.7Ag. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

The role of the degree of P–Silicon (Si) cross linking on the P removal from silicon using slag treatment was highlighted by comparing the dephosphorization data. The results show that adding Na2O into acidity slag (CaO/SiO2 = 0.5) from 0 to 30 wt% results in the first increase and then decrease of the removal ratio of P from silicon. When Na2O content is near 15 wt%, the removal ratio of P is above 60%. P2O5 oxidized of P from silicon can be incorporated into the silicate network through P–BO–Si bonds and be stabilized in slag in the form of Q3 (Si and P) species. The removal ratio of P presents a same trend as the relative amount of P–BO–Si bonds and Q3 (Si and P) species, demonstrating fixing P in slag could promote the P removal. Q2 (Si) species of the silicate network as primary intermediate structure could capture P to form Q3 (Si and P) species.

Black phosphorene (BP) has outstanding flame retardant properties, however, it causes the mechanical degradation of waterborne polyurethane (WPU). In order to solve this problem, the graphene is introduced to fabricate the black phosphorene/graphene (BP/G) composite material by high-pressure nano-homogenizer machine (HNHM). The structure, thermo-stability, flame retardant properties, and mechanical performance of composites are analyzed by a series of tests. The structure characterization results show that the BP/G composite material can distribute uniformly into the WPU. The addition of BP/G significantly improves the residues of WPU in both of TG analysis (5.64%) and cone calorimeter (CC) test (12.50%), which indicate that the BP/G can effectively restrict the degradation of WPU under high temperature. The CC test indicates that BP/G/WPU has a lower peak release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR), which decrease by 48.18% and 38.63%, respectively, than that of the pure WPU, respectively. The mechanical analysis presents that the Young's modulus of the BP/G/WPU has an increase of seven times more than that of the BP/WPU, which indicates that the introduce of graphene can effectively improve the mechanical properties of BP/WPU. © 2019 by the authors.","43","High pressure engineering","Composite materials - Elastic moduli - Fabrication - Flame retardants - Graphene - Mechanical properties - Polyurethanes","Black phosphorene - Flame retardant properties - Mechanical analysis - Mechanical degradation - Mechanical performance - Structure characterization - Waterborne Polyurethane - Waterborne polyurethanes","761 Nanotechnology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 951 Materials Science","Number: 21406098, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21663015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51603096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Cultivation Fund for Yunling Scholar (no. 10978195, Yunnan, China), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 21406098, no. 21663015, and no. 51603096), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (no. 2016FB018), the Project of Youth Academic and Technology talents of Yunnan Province (no. 2015HB022), and the Fund for scientific research in Education Department of Yunnan Province (no. 2018Y022).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The mode converter is formed by connecting a single-mode fiber, a taper-core multi-mode fiber, and a few-mode fiber (FMF) together. The taper fiber core is designed to convert LP01 mode to LP02. The few-mode fiber is used to cut off the modes that are higher than LP02. It is shown that the proposed mode converter provides 20 dB extinction ratio and low insertion loss in a very broad optical bandwidth of 200 nm, from 1465 to 1665 nm. By further optimizing the FMF radius only for each of the O-, E-, S-, C-, U-, etc. bands, the mode converter can apply to any band of interest with higher performance. It is found that the performance of the mode converter has a large tolerance to structural parameters. The mode converter has the same performance in reciprocal operation, i.e., LP02 to LP01. © 2019 Optical Society of America.","23","Single mode fibers","Optical fibers","Extinction ratios - Few-mode fibers - Low insertion loss - Mode conversions - Mode converter - Optical band width - Reciprocal operations - Structural parameter","741.1.2 Fiber Optics","Number: 61561051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61561052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61861046, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (61561052, 61561051, 61861046); Yunnan High-Tech Top-Talents Recruitment Project (2012HA005); Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan (2013FA027).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

How to deeply explore the distribution characteristics of electricity customers and analyze their sensitivities to electricity blackouts has become an especially important problem. This paper takes over 0.1 billion data, collected by various smart devices of the Internet of Things in the power system of China, such as smart meters, intelligent power consumption interactive terminals, data concentrators, and other cross-platform data, for example, 95 598 telephone records, complaint information, user bills, user information, and maintenance records, as study objects, to analyze the consumption characteristics of power users. It has been found that there is a wide range of power users who pay different electricity bills; a long-tail distribution following a power law lies in the number of users versus their paid electricity bills. Meanwhile, there are two Pareto effects (2-8 rule): the number of residents and non-residents versus their electricity bills, and the number of large industrial users and general industry (business users) versus in their electricity consumption and bills. Then, a decision tree algorithm is proposed to capture the characteristics of electricity consumers and to recognize the crowd who is power blackout sensitive. The evaluation indexes and parameters of the decision tree are discussed in detail, and a comparison with other intelligent algorithms shows that the decision tree has a good recognition performance over that of others, and the characteristics used to identify the blackout-sensitive crowd is various. All the results state that except for economic factors, positive social effects should also be considered. Various marketing strategies to satisfy different requirements of power users should be provided to promote long-term relationships between the power companies and power customers. © 2013 IEEE.","48","Outages","Big data - Commerce - Customer satisfaction - Data mining - Decision trees - Economics - Electric industry - Electric power system economics - Electric power systems - Electric power utilization - Electric utilities - Internet of things - Power markets - Power quality - Reliability - Sales - Trees (mathematics)","blackout sensitivity - long-tailed - Pareto effect - Power system reliability - Security",,"Number: 2017YFB0306405, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 61364008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0306405, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61562056, Grant 61364008, and Grant 61603420.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, the generator nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics, stochastic wind speed are all aggregated into a perturbation, which is estimated online by a perturbation observer. Then, sliding-mode control (SMC) is employed to fully compensate the perturbation estimate, such that a globally consistent control performance under various operation conditions and significant robustness against different uncertainties can be achieved. Meanwhile, POSMC adopts the perturbation estimate to replace the upper bound of perturbation used in SMC, thus POSMC can effectively resolve the over-conservativeness of SMC hence more proper control costs could be resulted in. Lastly, POSMC is easy to be implemented as it does not require an accurate PMSG model while only the measurement of d-axis current and mechanical rotation speed is needed. Three cases are carried out, including step change of wind speed, stochastic wind speed, and generator parameter uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate that POSMC can extract the optimal wind power and provide the greatest robustness in various operation conditions compared to that of vector control (VC) and SMC. At last, dSpace based hardware-in-loop (HIL) test validates the implementation feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2019, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

But, in many applications, these assumptions may be questionable because the true distributions of heterogeneity parameters are usually unknown. To this end, this paper relaxes these assumptions imposed on heterogeneity parameters to develop a nonparametric approach to purchase model and lifetime model, in which unknown distributions of heterogeneity parameters are approximated by a truncated Dirichlet process prior. A nonparametric empirical Bayesian method is developed to obtain Bayesian estimations of unknown parameters in the proposed nonparametric models. The blocked Gibbs sampler is presented to draw observations required for Bayesian inference from the corresponding posterior distributions of the components of parameters.

However, such studies are still very limited in subtropical regions which show a wide variety of climate regimes. We monitored stem radius variations (SRV) of Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis (Szemao pine) over five years (2012-2015 and 2017) in the subtropical monsoon mountain climate of the Ailao Mountains, Yunnan Province, southwest China. On average, the stem radial growth of Szemao pine started in early March and ended in early October, and the highest growth rates occurred during May to June. Stem radius increments were synchronous with precipitation events, while tree water deficit corresponded to the drought periods. Correlation analysis and linear mixed-effects models revealed that precipitation and relative humidity are the most important limiting factors of stem radial increments, whereas air temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly affected tree water balance and may play an important role in determining the growing season length and seasonality (i.e., duration, start, and cessation).

The studied strain includes in-layer uniaxial strain and biaxial strain. Green phosphorene can be viewed as a combination of black and blue phosphorene segments in regular order. We adopt the HSE06 method to correct the calculated results. The results reveal that, firstly, strain-free monolayer green phosphorene is a stable direct band gap 2D semiconductor with the anisotropic optical property. The transmittance of infrared and visible light along the zigzag direction is better than that along the armchair direction. However, the transmittance of the UV-light along the armchair direction is better than that along the zigzag direction. Secondly, the optical properties, such as the absorption coefficient and reflectivity, along armchair and zigzag direction respond very differently to the various applied strains. As for the electronic properties, the band gap exhibits different changing trends by applying either in-layer biaxial strain or uniaxial strain in different directions. Besides, the near-band-edge electronic orbitals exhibit different bond nature in different directions. These results suggest that green phosphorene shows strong anisotropy in electronic and optical properties. By calculating and comparing the energies of near-band-edge states after applying different strains on green phosphorene, the reason for the anisotropy of the new 2D material is analyzed. This study implies that the electronic and optical properties of green phosphorene, a stable direct band gap anisotropic semiconductor, could be efficiently tuned by in-layer biaxial or uniaxial strain. Therefore, green phosphorene can be used in linear polarizers and other anisotropic photoelectric devices. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","59","Optical properties","Anisotropy - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Light - Monolayers - Polarization - Strain","Absorption co-efficient - Anisotropic optical properties - Electronic and optical properties - Electronic orbitals - First-principles study - green phosphorene - Optical and electrical properties - Two Dimensional (2 D)","741.1 Light/Optics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

QLY-1 at multiple levels was investigated in this study. The results indicated that the highest lipid content (59.53%) in QLY-1 was achieved by combining FA treatment and salinity stress. Compared with the control group and FA addition alone, the group treated with both FA and salinity stress had increased contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidases, and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the addition of FA enhanced the expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and key genes related to lipid biosynthesis in QLY-1 under salinity stress. Collectively, biochemical analyses indicated that ROS, NO, MAPK, expression of lipid biosynthesis-related genes and antioxidant systems were involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathways of QLY-1 under the combined treatment of FA and salinity stress. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","49","Organic acids","Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Enzymes - Genes - Nitric oxide","Fulvic acids - Lipid productions - Micro-algae - Mitogen activated protein kinase - Salinity stress","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 21766012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21766012 and No. 21666012 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

For reaction kinetics, activation energy of the reactions in the temperature range 436.15–694.15 K was calculated by five different model-free methods, among which, FWO (105.47 kJ·mol−1) model-free method with the best fitting precision was applied as the parameter to deduce the reaction models and describe the kinetic mechanism. It was confirmed that three diffusion models (D1, D2, D3) dominated at the beginning/middle of the reactions and one reaction order model (F2) dominated at the later part. According to the deduced mechanism, diffusion enhancing and reaction temperature enhancing strategies were introduced. For diffusion process of mercury volatiles, the laminar state of the protective gas was confirmed when the nitrogen flow rate is 100 L/h; based on the boundary simplifications, the thickness and the pressure difference of the boundary layer were calculated. According to the results of pressure difference, mercury diffusion process has two stages: Higher pressure diffusion stage and Residual mercury removal stage. Reaction kinetics and diffusion calculation give a better understanding of the mercury removal process and the parameters obtained in this work are useful to design the reactor. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","41","Mercury compounds","Activation energy - Association reactions - Catalysts - Chlorine compounds - Desorption - Diffusion - Kinetics - Laminar boundary layer - Polyvinyl chlorides - Reaction kinetics - Surface morphology","American Institute of Chemical Engineers - Comprehensive utilizations - Diffusion calculation - Diffusion process - Mercury chloride - Non-isothermal kinetic - Pressure differences - Reaction temperature","631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Number: 2013HA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51522405, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by The National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars of China (No.51522405) and Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents Scheme Technological Leading Talent of China (2013HA002).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

On the basis of noise filtering, this method extracts the effective prediction information from different fluctuations and integrates them into the same time scale. The noise reduction and out-of-sample portfolio performance are evaluated, respectively. The robustness of out-of-sample portfolio performance is further tested by changing partial conditions The empirical results indicate that the denoising performance of multiwavelet denoising method is clearly better than the traditional wavelet denoising methods. Furthermore, in any sample period, the multiwavelet denoising-integration MF-DCCA method also performs better than the existing popular methods in terms of profitability and Sharp ratio. Besides, the long-term scales (s=60, 80) are superior to the short-term scales (s=20, 40) in most situations. Robustness results verify the above conclusions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","49","Investments","Commerce - Crude oil - Fractals - Information filtering - Integration - Noise abatement","DCCA methods - De-noising - Denoising methods - International crude oil markets - Portfolio - Portfolio strategies - Prediction informations - Wavelet denoising method","512.1 Petroleum Deposits - 751.4 Acoustic Noise - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921 Mathematics - 921.2 Calculus","Number: 2017J01518, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province; Number: 71473039, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71573042, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are thankful for the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 71573042, NO. 71473039), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (2017J01518), Major projects of social science planning in Fujian (FJ2017Z006) and Key Laboratory of Financial Mathematics of Fujian Province University (Putian University) (JR 201804).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
