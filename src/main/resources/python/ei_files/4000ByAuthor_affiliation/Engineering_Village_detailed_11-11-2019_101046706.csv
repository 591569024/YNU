It is also used in some skin-care balm by local people. Nevertheless, the research on the active components of the plant related to skin-care is not enough, which mainly involved some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory active compounds. This study investigated the extracts and components from rhizome of Z. cassumunar for their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, HDFa collagen secretion promotion, tyrosinase inhibition, and NO generation inhibition activities for the purpose of identifying ingredients with potential anti-aging, skin-whitening, and anti-inflammation for use in cosmetics. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of the plant showed significant NO generation inhibition, DPPH radical scavenging, tyrosinase inhibitory activities, and weak promoting collagen secretion activity while petroleum ether (PE) extract showed obvious NO generation inhibition activity. Six active compounds, (E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-propenal (1), cis-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-2,4,5-trimehoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (2), 1-feruloyloxy cinnamic acid (3), (1E,4E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (4), bisdemethoxycurcumin (5), and curcumin (6), were isolated from PE and EtOAc extracts by bioassay-guided fractionation. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 showed significant NO generation inhibition activity with IC50 of 22.67 ± 2.36, 7.00 ± 0.22, 15.40 ± 0.63, 5.47 ± 0.09, and 7.16 ± 0.05 μM, respectively. 3 also showed potent DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 of 22.96 ± 0.87 μg/mL. 4 was a good tyrosinase inhibitor with the inhibitory rate of 42.56 ± 1.02% under the concentration of 100 μg/mL. 2 and 4 showed significant HDFa collagen secretion promoting activity with EC50 of 13.91 ± 1.56 and 8.50 ± 1.31 μg/mL, respectively. This is the first report on components from Z. cassumunar for their HDFa collagen secretion promotion and tyrosinase inhibition activities.

Here, a reliable method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was established for the comprehensive analysis of chemical constituents of DZSMC and their metabolites in rat plasma after gastric perfusion. Two acquisition modes, including MSE mode and Fast DDA mode, were performed for acquiring more precursor ions and cleaner precursor-product ions background during the study of constituents of DZSMC. As a result, a total of 125 constituents were unambiguously characterized or tentatively identified. For the first time, a total of 92 components, including 44 prototype components and 48 metabolites were unambiguously or tentatively identified in rat plasma. The metabolic pathways included phase I reactions (hydration, hydrogenation, oxidation, demethylation and hydroxylation) and phase II reactions (conjugation with glucuronide, sulfate and methyl). Furthermore, the metabolites from caffeic acid and scutellarin were characterized and validated by phase II metabolic reactions in vitro, which could be established as a simulated in vivo environment of metabolites identification and verification of TCM formula.

Through the measurements of THz Fourier transform spectroscopy (2.5–6.5 THz) and THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS, 0.2–1.2 THz), we find that the real part of optical conductivity increases for ML MoS2 on SiO2Si and sapphire substrates and decreases for it on quartz with increasing radiation frequency. It is shown that the complex optical conductivity for ML MoS2, obtained from THz TDS measurements, can fit very well to the Drude–Smith formula. Thus, the dependence of optical conductivity of ML MoS2 on different substrates can be understood via a mechanism of electronic localization, and the electron density, relaxation time, and localization factor of the sample can be determined optically. Furthermore, we examine the influence of temperature on these key parameters in ML MoS2 on different substrates. The results obtained from this Letter indicate that THz spectroscopy is a very powerful tool in studying and characterizing ML MoS2-based electronic systems, especially in examining the electronic localization effect which cannot be directly measured in conventional electrical transport experiment.

There are many literatures studied the approach of discovering co-location patterns. However, a lot of proposed approaches need some thresholds given by the user, and it is difficult to give the proper thresholds. Moreover, most proposed approaches treat the spatial object as a point during the mining process, but spatial objects are dynamic or appear in the form of a cluster normally, which means that their locations are polygons rather than points. This paper provides a novel framework to mine co-location patterns from spatial regional objects. At first, we redefine the interest measure of significant co-locations. In our framework, the user does not need to specify any threshold, and the redefined interest measure is monotonically non-increasing which can be used for improving the mining efficiency. Then, an algorithm based on the grid partition is proposed to reduce time complexity further. Finally, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach by extensive experiments. © 2019 IEEE.","13","Location","Data mining - Efficiency - Information management - Mining","Buffer - Co-location patterns - Dynamic spatial - Grid partition - Mining process - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial objects - Spatial proximity","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The synthesis was carried out without the use of any structure directing agents and hydrothermal conditions. The microspheres were found to be consisting of many single-crystalline and highly oriented nanosheets that were hierarchically self-aggregated in spherical form for the minimization of surface energy. An experimentally validated time-dependent formation and growth mechanism was proposed for the development of microspheres. The characterization results indicated that the morphology-preserved thermal decomposition of H2WO4 into WO3 microspheres occurred at 400 °C, whereas a morphology distortion was noticed for the sample synthesized at 600 °C. The increase in annealing temperature further increased the crystallinity of WO3 without changing its monoclinic crystal structure. However, it has a diminishing effect in the specific surface area, pore size and pore volume of the annealed samples. Moreover, the adsorption of methylene blue in aqueous medium was carried out to evaluate its potential environmental application. The WO3 microspheres synthesized at 400 °C showed high adsorption capacity (63 mg/g) compared to the same at 600 °C (56 mg/g). The high activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effects of high surface area, low particle size, porosity, specific morphology and more negative zeta potential. The adsorption further followed pseudo-second-order kinetics with a best fit of the experimental and theoretical values. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","99","Morphology","Adsorption - Annealing - Aromatic compounds - Crystal structure - Crystallinity - Decomposition - Dyes - Hydrothermal synthesis - Microspheres - Nanosheets - Particle size - Pore size - Thermolysis - Tungsten compounds","Annealing temperatures - Environmental applications - High adsorption capacity - Hydrothermal conditions - Monoclinic crystal structure - Negative zeta potentials - Pseudo second order kinetics - Structure directing agents","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science","Number: 10988880, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 2019M653845XB, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 21566014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the Postdoctoral Research Funding of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 10988880), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M653845XB) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21566014).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, an Hg(II)-resistant bacterial strain, Bacillus sp. DC-B2, was isolated from a metal-contaminated site, and its ability to remediate five types of Hg-contaminated soils was investigated. RESULTS: The isolate DC-B2 showed strong resistance to multiple metals and volatilized 91.6% of the Hg(II) in a culture with an initial Hg(II) concentration of 10 mg L−1 within 8 h. Microcosm experiments showed that the addition of DC-B2 culture improved Hg(II) removal by 11.7–17.2% from four artificially Hg(II)-spiked soil samples with initial Hg contents of approximately 100 mg kg−1 after incubating for 30 days under flooded conditions compared to the control treatment. For the field-contaminated farmland soil containing 2.50 mg Hg kg−1, an Hg(II) elimination rate of 82.1% was achieved within 30 days with the DC-B2 inoculation, relative to the 34.1% elimination rate observed for the uninoculated control. The amendment of peptone broth slightly inhibited Hg removal (2.2–8.7%). The remediation effectiveness was verified by observations of longer root and shoot lengths of lettuce plants grown in treated soils compared to those grown in the control soil. CONCLUSION: The isolate Bacillus sp. DC-B2 shows great potential to be developed as a bioagent for effective bioremediation of Hg-contaminated soils. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","42","Mercury compounds","Bacilli - Bacteriology - Bioremediation - Biotechnology - Chemical industry - Contamination - Soil pollution - Soils","Global environmental problems - Hg removals - Metal contaminated sites - Microcosm experiments - Resistant bacteria - Soil bioremediation - Spiked soil samples - Uninoculated control",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The planar coil configuration, which favors magnetic interaction, has not been previously reported for shielding with any material. For all arrangements, the total shielding effectiveness (SET) is dominated by the absorption loss (SEA), whether the fiber is nickel-coated or not. The nickel coating (0.25-μm thick) increases SET from 26 dB to 13–26 dB for the planar coil configuration, but has little effect for the crossply/unidirectional configuration. Both SET and SEA are greatly increased by the nickel coating, which also reduces SEA's frequency dependence and increases the absorption's fractional contribution to shielding, particularly for the planar coil configuration below 1000 MHz (from 53%78% to 83%–94%). The advantage of the crossply configuration over the unidirectional configuration is greater without the nickel coating. Increasing the tow size from 12 K to 24 K (with the gap decreased from 3.0 to 2.0 mm) raises SEA for planar coil and unidirectional arrangements.

Four-probe resistivity temperature system was employed to characterize electrical and magnetic properties of all prepared specimens. Temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) yielded room temperature maxima of 4.9% K−1 at 299.2 K and 17.5% at 299.1 K. The enhancement in TCR and MR was mainly attributed to Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion and double exchange (DE) effect. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) all confirmed the existence of silver in metallic forms and the increase of Sr content. On the other hand, satellite peaks in low-temperature range of resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) curves gradually weakened as Sr-doped amount increased. The fitting of ρ-T curves in low-temperature region revealed that gradual vanishing of satellite peak may be due to presence of Sr, able of inhibiting various types of interactions: electron-electron, electron-phonon, and Kondo-like spin-dependent scattering. Overall, room temperature TCR and MR were both optimized by Sr doping, providing further understanding of CMR mechanism and application of manganite materials in electromagnetic equipment under room temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","25","Temperature","Ceramic materials - Curve fitting - Electrons - Enhanced magnetoresistance - Field emission microscopes - Inductively coupled plasma - Magnetoresistance - Manganites - Optical emission spectroscopy - Phonons - Photoelectron spectroscopy - Pollution detection - Scanning electron microscopy - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Spectrometers","Electrical and magnetic property - Electromagnetic properties - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer - Spin dependent scattering - Sr additions - Temperature coefficient of resistivity - X ray photoemission spectroscopy",,"Number: 2018M20172130004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11674135, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11674135 ) and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant no. 2018M20172130004 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the context of global warming, the LSWT of global lakes generally reveals an upward trend. With a continuous intensification of human activities and a rapid expansion of the impervious surface, urbanization has exerted an increasing impact on the environment, so the impact of human activities on LSWT cannot be ignored. Because of the special geographical location, the change of LSWT in plateau lakes has important impacts on climate diversity, biodiversity, and cultural diversity. As a result, it is critical to monitor and model the variation characteristics of LSWT in the plateau area. Based on the data set of natural factors representing climate change and human factors representing human activities, this study proposes a classification of lake types by K-Means clustering method. At watershed scale, 11 lakes in the study area are divided into three types: Natural Lake, Semi-urban Lake, and Urban Lake (UL). Based on this classification, the variation characteristics of LSWT for the eleven lakes from 2001 to 2017 are analyzed. The causal relationship and contribution of climate change and human activities to the rise of LSWT are discussed. Results show that (1) from 2001 to 2017, the annual mean of LSWT-day/night and near-surface air temperature in the 11 lakes show a warming trend, a significant correlation (R = 0.82, α = 0.0164 ©2019.

However, the water-use characteristics of rubber tree in these agroforestry systems (AFSs) were still rarely reported, and our current understanding of the below-ground competition in such tree and herb AFSs is also insufficient. Therefore, we adopted the techniques of stable isotopes to study the water use efficiency (WUE; through leaf δ13C) and the water-absorbing patterns (through δ2H and δ18O) of the aged rubber trees and the intercropped herbs for the investigation of their water competition, and we also measured the contents of their leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to check the competition effects on the nutrient status of rubber tree. As the results of Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) suggested, the aged rubber trees in the rubber monoculture still absorbed the surface and shallow soil water (0–15 cm depths) mainly, same as the intercropped herbs in these AFSs, but rubber trees in the AFSs prefer to absorb the middle and deep soil water (below 15 cm depths). Such phenomenon verified that the water-absorbing patterns of these aged rubber trees were still flexible. However, the leaf δ13C of the rubber trees in these AFSs indicated their WUE was not improved through the intercropping, and thus the soil water content decreased in the AFSs. In short, intercropping the shallow roots medicine herbs (i.e., A. villosum and C. spicatus) can help the aged rubber trees use deeper soil water, and thus help the rubber tree and intercrops form complementary water-absorbing patterns in the pronounced dry season, but there is no improvement in their WUE and the soil water conditions. In addition, the decreased leaf N of rubber trees in the AFSs suggests that the N absorption of rubber trees was limited. Therefore, intercropping the medicine herbs with rubber tree still need more consideration on the design of such AFSs, especially in terms of the soil water conservation and management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","55","Forestry","Nutrients - Plants (botany) - Rubber - Rubber plantations - Soil conservation - Soil moisture - Water conservation - Water supply","Agroforestry system - Amomum villosum - Clerodendranthus spicatus - Competition effects - Water use","444 Water Resources - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 818.1 Natural Rubber","Number: 2013FA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018M633437, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 31570622, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31800356, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: BX201700278, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; ","We thank Dr. Fu Y, Dr. Deng Y, Mr. Liu MN for their helps, and we thank the technical supports from the Central Laboratory of XTBG.

The effect of reducing dietary P supplementation and using a highly available P supplement for swine and poultry was determined. Manure collected in feeding trials involving the use of dicalcium phosphate (DCP) or mono-dicalcium phosphates (MDCP) that were 2O-, NaHCO3-, NaOH-, HCl- and residue-P). Manure total P varied with the amount of P supplemented, ranging from 14.5 to 22.3 g kg−1 for pigs, 4.7–13.6 g kg−1 for broilers and ducks, and 8.0–23.5 g kg−1 for layers. Determined using manure from pigs and birds receiving the highest supplemental amounts, MDCP reduced manure total P by up to 12.1% and H2O–P by up to 18.4% compared to DCP. Manure P extracted by weak NaOH and HCl was up to 9.4% higher for MDCP than DCP. Thus, using MDCP resulted in manure P that was lower in labile fractions than DCP. Soil leaching studies showed that dissolved P collected in leachate from manure was 9.4–32.6% lower when MDCP replaced DCP in the diet of pigs, broilers, ducks, and layers, confirming that MDCP reduced labile P in manure.

Owing to the large specific surface area and abundant multiple functional groups, the MPAC exhibited great adsorption performances for heavy metals with great adsorption capacities and rapid rate. Careful adsorption investigation indicated that the adsorption was mainly controlled by a charge transfer complex pattern. In addition, the adsorption impetuses were heterozygous involving electrostatic interaction, electron sharing or electronic-donor-acceptor interaction, etc. Moreover, the competitive adsorption reflected adsorption preference existed in the heavy metal removal using the MPAC as adsorbents due to the imparities in the adsorption affinity, thus resulting in the differences of the adsorption tolerance to exogenous influence. © 2019","42","Adsorption","Activated carbon - Charge transfer - Electron affinity - Eutrophication - Heavy metals - Specific surface area","Charge transfer complex - Competitive adsorption - Donor-acceptor interaction - Eichhornia crassipes - High specific surface area - Large specific surface areas - Large-scale applications - Metal contaminants","531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 51704121, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51704121 ).

Previous researches have suggested that prediction of protein function is essentially a multi-label classification problem. Nonetheless, the large number of protein functional annotation labels brings the huge challenge to various kinds of multi-label classifiers applied to protein function prediction. To achieve more accuracy prediction of protein function by multi-label classifiers, we consider the characteristics of high correlation between protein functional labels, and propose a framework of protein function prediction based on Boolean matrix decomposition (PFP-BMD). Meanwhile, considering the problem of hardly satisfying exact decomposition and column in condition simultaneously of current Boolean matrix decomposition algorithms, an exact Boolean matrix decomposition algorithm based on label clusters is proposed, which realizes the hierarchical extended clustering of labels by the label-associated matrix. What's more, we prove its ability of optimal Boolean matrix decomposition based on related deductions. The experimental results show that this exact Boolean matrix decomposition algorithm possesses considerable advantage in reducing the computational complexity in comparison with existing algorithms. In addition, the application of the proposed algorithm in PFP-BMD can effectively improve the accuracy of protein function prediction, and more importantly, reducing and restoring dimensions in the functional label space of proteins using this algorithm lays the foundation of a more efficient classification of various multi-label classifiers. © 2019, Science Press.

The RAC BET surface area was 1254.46 m2 g-1, and the results showed that microwave treatment could effectively regenerate the spent carbon. To increase the adsorption capacity of activated carbon, the surface was modified with H2O2 to increase oxygen-containing functional groups. The adsorption behavior of CR and MB on MRAC was studied, and equilibrium data were simulated by using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Temkin isotherm models. The isotherm experimental data were best fitted by the Redlich-Peterson model, and the maximum sorption capacities obtained were 254 and 318 mg g-1 for CR and MB on MRAC (7% H2O2), respectively. The adsorption kinetics were best described by the pseudo-second-order model, and the Weber-Morris model showed that the adsorption process includes three stages: boundary layer diffusion and two intra-particle diffusion stages.

The results showed the anaerobic digestion of swine wastewater with acclimatized EGS was much better than with IAS, 10th-day COD removal efficiency of 85% and 37% respectively. The better performance of acclimatized EGS was attributed to the more efficient degradation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as well as a stronger tolerance to the ammonia inhibition of swine wastewater.

How to make full use of the active reserve of variable-speed wind turbines and study the fast-flexible frequency modulation control method of wind farm become the key issues to improve the wind power consumption capacity. An improved active power control strategy for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines under full-wind speed condition is proposed, which can make the wind farm realize load shedding to response to the power dispatching order and provide active power reserve effectively. Considering the decentralized accessing scenario of wind farms and aiming at the monitorable, large-capacity single disturbance or fault event such as generator trip, load off-network, and so on, a new coordinated auxiliary frequency modulation method is proposed based on the principle of power balance control. When the power of the grid changes suddenly, the emergency power support capacity of different wind farms are started and allocated reasonably according to the shortest electrical distance between the wind farms and the disturbance node. Simulative results show that the designed power-frequency control strategy can effectively improve the frequency stability of the power grid after the disturbance from two aspects of reducing the amplitude of transient frequency deviation and the frequency recovery time. © 2019, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

Consequently, we studied the key technologies for DCCT field tests, such as the accurate extraction of DC components, the digital output interface of DCCT, the data synchronization of DCCT without synchronous signal access and the uncertainty of test system.Meanwhile, we analyzed and estimated the source of the uncertainty with the DCCT output signal acquired by the A/D acquisition unit, which is decomposed by the wavelet to obtain the direct current. Moreover, the FPGA was applied for the digital interface of the DCCT on the basis of the synchronization of the absolute time delay. In order to complete the field tests of DCCT, a set of DC transformer test system was developed for the ±500 kV Yongfu HVDC system. At last, the first field tests in China with multiple values of DC, from 10% rated current to 100% rated current, were carried out for all the DCCT with digital output in the converter station.

Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) method was adopted for water footprint and virtual water flow calculation. Results showed that the total water footprint of Yunnan was 11.35 billion m3, with 7.98 billion m3 (70%) of internal water footprint, demonstrating that Yunnan was a high water self-sufficient province. Moreover, Yunnan was a net virtual water exporter with a value of 1.18 billion m3, which was not good for Yunnan but was good for water scarce provinces. As for the detailed virtual water flow trade, high water intensity Guangxi, Hunan, Xinjiang were the top three net importers of Yunnan, while low water intensity Guangdong, Shanghai and Zhejiang were the top three export provinces of Yunnan. This did not affect Yunnan, but was not a good phenomenon for water sustainability of whole China. Moreover, agricultural sector was found to be the dominant sector for both virtual water import and export, accounting for about 88% and 86%, respectively.

However, few papers theoretically analyze energy efficiency. This paper presents a Parallel Gated Poll (PGP) access mechanism that exploits the PCF defined in the IEEE 802.11. The basic idea is, during the contention free period, idle stations can save energy by turning into sleep and active stations exchange data packet under a gated service polling scheme to improve the energy efficiency. Besides, the mean cycle analysis model is setup to evaluate the energy efficiency of a typically PCF protocol and PGP protocol.

However, the mechanisms underlying cardiac fluorosis have not been illuminated in detail. We performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on rat cardiac tissue to explore the molecular effects of NaF exposure. In total, 372 and 254 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between a group given 30 mg/L NaF and control and between a group given 90 mg/L NaF and control, respectively. The transcript levels of most of these genes were significantly down-regulated and many were distributed in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Transcriptome analysis revealed that herpes simplex infection, ECM-receptor interaction, influenza A, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were significantly affected. IL-6 and IL-10 may play a crucial role in the cardiac damage caused by NaF as external stimuli according to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed a marked decreased mRNA and protein levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 in the low concentration fluoride (LF) and high concentration fluoride (HF) groups, which was in agreement with RNA-Seq results.

One of the most widely used methods to estimate the force is proposed by Ito, which is based on the theory of plastic deformation. Soil arching effect is caused by the shear resistance because of the relative movement of the soil in the middle and behind the piles, and the effect has great impact on the lateral force. Considering the soil arching effect and Ito’s plastic deformation method, we deduced a new calculation method. The new formula defines the range of the value of thrust force on stabilizing piles. Contrasted with Ito’ method through the analysis of the examples quoted by Ito, the results by the new method was closer to the observed values. The similar conclusion also can be obtained through the contrast in the example of 5# pile in Shabei I Slope.

Firstly, the general idea of modeling the LCC-MMC hybrid multi-terminal HVDC system was analyzed, then the AC-side and DC-side equivalent circuits of the LCC/MMC were established. Different from the traditional DC-side equivalent circuit of MMC, the second-order differential equations describing the MMC DC-side circuit was used to construct the electro-mechanical transient model of the hybrid HVDC system. Besides, taking the firing angle limit of the LCC into account, we proposed a sequential power flow algorithm for a hybrid multi-terminal HVDC system. Finally, the power flow calculation and electro-mechanical simulation of the LCC-MMC hybrid HVDC system were implemented in electro-mechanical simulation platform PSS/E, and the model was applied to the case of China Southen Power Grid. The simulation and calculation results show that the proposed method can be used to ensure the reliability of system model initialization; and the step response characteristics of the electro-mechanical model and the detailed electromagnetic model are basically the same; the simulation in China Southen Power Grid embedded with Wudongde three-terminal hybrid HVDC system shows that, under the relatively serious three-phase short-circuit fault on the converter bus of the receiving-end system, the sending-end system can resume stable operation after the fault is cleared.

Meanwhile, user-related applications need to fulfill the varied demands for value-added services of consumers in vehicular ad hoc networks to retain existing consumers and to attract new ones.

The composite was characterized by XPS, XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. The results of the kinetics study indicate that BPA (50 mg·L−1)can be adsorbed onto the composite via electrons transfer as well as π-π interaction, and then be completely degraded at pH 6.0 within 30 min after the addition of H2O2 (1000 mg·L−1). The analysis of FTIR confirms that the degradation occurred through a combined process of adsorption and oxidation. BPA was pre-concentrated and fixed onto the composite surface and then degraded in-situ by hydroxyl radicals, which were generated through the interaction between H2O2 and surface active sites. To investigate the stability and regeneration properties of the catalyst, the powder composite was extruded into a small cylindrical sample and loaded in a fixed-bed reactor, which was operated under continuous-flow condition. The BPA removal efficiency after 4 h remained at 87%, while the leaching of Fe ions gradually increased. Further, degradation tests in different real waters including tap water and municipal wastewater spiked with BPA (50 μg·L−1)reveal that the influence of real matrix on the oxidation ability was very little.

Monomer addition model was employed to analyze the stability of intermediate, as well as the direction in which the reaction of silica particles proceeds. The analysis was carried out by Materials Studio. Results demonstrated that particle size of Nano-silica increases with increasing concentrations of H2O, NH3·H2O, and TEOS in ethanol, whereas the size decreases with increasing temperature. In addition, when proper amount of H2O was added into NH3·H2O at suitable temperature, silicic acid can act as a nucleus for amorphous Nano-silica particles, forming microspheres with round and smooth surfaces. By contrast, when TEOS was used, resultant nanoparticles have poor surfaces. During nucleation process of Nano-silica, silicic acid can also acts as nucleating agent providing a platform for the growth of nanoparticles with symmetric structure. Findings further indicated that the reaction proceeds by first silicic acid participates in the reaction, and the dimer and trimer molecules then react with the surface of silicic acid molecules; the same products could be produced by different reactions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","44","Particle size analysis","Addition reactions - Ammonia - Amorphous materials - Dimers - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Ethanol - Field emission microscopes - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Microspheres - Molecules - Monomers - Nanometals - Nanoparticles - Particle size - Reaction intermediates - Scanning electron microscopy - Silica - Sols - Spectrum analysis","Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Hydrolysis and condensation - Laser particle size analysis - Monomer addition mode - Nano Silica - Particle size and morphologies - TEOS",,"Number: 2017YFC0210303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China; Number: 2018M20172208037, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51764051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China , China ( 51764051 ), the National Key R&D Program of China , China ( 2017YFC0210303 ) and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of the Kunming University of Science and Technology , China ( 2018M20172208037 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the morphology and microwave absorption properties of tobacco stem materials as well as the pyrolysis of the resultant biomass (BMTS)were studied via thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and a vector network analysis (VNA). The results show that the BMTS pyrolysis involves four stages in air: dehydration, heat transfer, pyrolysis, and carbonisation, and it involves three stages in N2: moisture evaporation, de-volatilization, and charring. The microwave-assisted expansion of WTSs can improve the pore diameter and total porosity of the expanded tobacco stems (ETSs)and BMTS. The latter is a macroporous material with a total porosity of 78.2% and a probable pore size of 29.5 μm. Its pore size distribution ranges from 10.7 nm to 227 μm. The microwave absorption properties of the WTSs are affected by the moisture content, bulk density, and grain size; the properties can be enhanced by decreasing the grain size and increasing the moisture content and bulk density within the experimental range. The 3 dB bandwidth and amplitude vary by 0.45 MHz and − 0.406 dB per 1% increase in the moisture content of the materials, respectively. Our results demonstrate that tobacco stem materials with different moisture contents and grain sizes should be classified before the expansion or re-drying steps to ensure heating uniformity and product quality during the microwave radiation treatment. © 2019","79","Microwaves","Biomass - Carbonization - Differential scanning calorimetry - Electric network analyzers - Expansion - Grain size and shape - Heat transfer - Moisture - Moisture determination - Morphology - Pore size - Porous materials - Pyrolysis - Scanning electron microscopy - Thermogravimetric analysis - Tobacco","Different moisture contents - Macroporous materials - Mercury intrusion porosimetry - Microwave absorption properties - Moisture evaporation - Radiation technologies - Tobacco stems - Vector network analysis","641.2 Heat Transfer - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 944.2 Moisture Measurements - 944.6 Temperature Measurements - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2008IC014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2013HB127, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; ","This work was financially supported by the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (2008IC014)and (2013HB127), China.

Existing SDP solvers are often expensive for large-scale learning. In order to avoid directly solving SDP, some works convert SDP into a nonconvex program by factorizing Z as XX. However, this would bring higher-order nonlinearity, resulting in scarcity of structure in subsequent optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel surrogate for SDP-based learning, in which the structure of subproblem is exploited. More specifically, we surrogate unconstrained SDP by a biconvex problem, through factorizing Z as XY and using a quadratic penalty to penalize the difference of X and Y, in which the resultant subproblems are convex. Furthermore, we provide a theory bound for the associated penalty parameter under the assumption that the objective function is Lipschitz-smooth, such that the proposed surrogate will solve the original SDP when the penalty parameter is larger than this bound. Experiments on three SDP-based machine learning problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is as accurate as the state-of-the-art, but is faster on large-scale learning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","32","Machine learning","Structural optimization","Clustering - Higher order nonlinearity - Large-scale learning - Machine learning problem - Manifold learning - Positive semidefinite matrices - Scale method - Semi-definite program (SDP)","921.5 Optimization Techniques","Number: 11801500, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the Grants of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61663049, 61165012, 11801500 ).

By introducing a small temporal sinusoidal phase modulation to the phase shift and employing the phase-generated carrier (PGC) method, the time-varying interference phase α(t)can be demodulated from the Michelson interference signal, which is reflected by the fiber end faces and recorded concurrently with the recording of the fringe pattern. Integrate sin [α(t)] and cos [α(t)] respectively, and then the phase shifts between frames can be determined and consequently used to solve the phase map with least-squares PS algorithm. The noise model of this method is deduced from which the optimum modulation amplitude can be selected. In the experiment, four fringe patterns with uncalibrated phase shifts were recorded under strong environmental disturbance, and were analyzed by utilizing the Carre algorithm, the proposed method and the modified Fourier transform (MFT) method respectively. A visual criterion is used to evaluate the performances of these methods. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is much more robust to phase shift miscalibration than the Carre algorithm, and its performance is comparable to that of the MFT method while its computational complexity is substantially lower.

The accuracy of satellite-based gridded precipitation products have been continuously improved recently which is crucial to the study of cryosphere ecology and environment. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CHIRPS v2 (Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations data, version 2) and MSWEP v2 (Multi-source weighted-Ensemble Precipitation, version 2) daily-precipitation products over the QTP during the period 1981–2015. Validation was done using a time series of daily-precipitation data obtained from 104 hydrometeorological stations distributed over the QTP. Error metrics (The correlation coefficient CC, the relative bias BIAS, and root mean square error RMSE) were used for accuracy evaluation and detectability indicators (probability of detection POD, false alarm ratio RFA, and critical success index CSI) were used for the analysis of detection capabilities of rainfall occurrence events. The results indicate that when compared to rain gauge observations, CHIRPS and MSWEP daily-precipitation products represent well the spatial and temporal distribution of the mean daily precipitation over the QTP, while both of them overestimate the daily-precipitation (0.18 mm/d for CHIRPS, 0.56 mm/d for MSWEP). MSWEP performed better than CHIRPS according to CC (MSWEP is 0.44, CHIRPS is 0.23) and RMSE (MSWEP is 4.21 mm, CHIRPS is 5.03 mm) and MSWEP showed better detection capabilities with higher POD (0.65), lower RFA (0.50) and higher CSI (0.39) in the QTP. Both products are less accurate in dry conditions (the north QTP, winter) than in moist conditions (the south QTP, summer).

Most current approaches to groundwater flow simulation of naturally fractured media rely on the calculation of equivalent permeability tensors from a discrete fracture network (DFN). This study is aimed at developing a rational two-dimensional DFN by GEOFRAC, a geostatistical method of fracture direction and locations of sample data from a tin mine in the Gaosong area, Gejiu city, southwest China, and utilizing 3,724 outcrop fractures sampled on the ground of mountain Gaosong. Principal inputs of the DFN are density, direction, and continuity of disks that constitute a fracture plane. Fractures simulated by GEOFRAC were validated in that their directions corresponded well with those of the sample fractures. The permeability tensor of each modeling grid was then calculated based on the fracture network constructed.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that all bulk prepared specimens crystalized in LCSMO phase with orthogonal cubic structure (space group of Pnma) and without impurities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed good compactness with fewer holes. Average grain sizes and quantity of grain boundaries (GBs) correlated with Ag doping amounts. As z content rose, resistivity dropped, and both peaks temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) first increased and then decreased. Several previous studies indicated that Ag doping amount could affect TCR and MR peaks. At z = 0.3, TCR peaks reached maxima of 10.27% (289.56 K), at z = 0.1, MR peaks reached maxima of 15.63% (293.08 K). As z increased from 0 to 0.4, the temperature of peak TCR (Tk) was adjusted to room temperature from 289.56 to 294.22 K. TCR peak of La0.625(Ca0.285Sr0.09)MnO3:Agz material was improved at room temperature when compared to values reported in the literature.

The effective mode index, propagation loss and cutoff wavelength of higher order modes are investigated along the armchair (AC) and the zigzag (ZZ) directions of the black phosphorus. Moreover, the propagation characteristics of single-mode are investigated for different widths of the dielectric ridge and different polarization directions of the black phosphorus. Via tuning the carrier density, the electromagnetic field propagation features can be effectively modified. Also, the coupling effect by adding more dielectric bridges can tune the propagation properties.

Conservation tillage rotation, conserved soil water and enhanced soil fertility effectively, produced high and stable crop yields in a spring maize-winter wheat-fallow rotation over a two-year period (hereafter called maize-wheat-fallow rotation). Corresponding and appropriate fertilization practices should enable the full potential of tillage rotation. Therefore, a long-term two-factor split-plot experiment (2007–2016) was established in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, China, a typical rainfed dryland agricultural region. Beginning in 2007, three fertilization practices (balanced fertilization (BF), low fertilization (LF) and conventional fertilization (CF)) and four tillage systems (no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually (NS), subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually (SC), conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually (CN), and continuous conventional tillage (CT)) were conducted to assess crop yield and soil water variation. The results showed that CCN (CF + CN, 5440 kg ha−1) and BNS (BF+NS, 8415 kg ha −1) produced the highest crop yield for winter wheat and spring maize, respectively. LNS (LF + NS, 419 mm) had a better soil water condition in fallow periods. NS and CN rotations had a better soil water condition (reserved more soil water for crop growth) than SC and CT during the wheat and maize growth season. However, both the average ET of winter wheat and spring maize under all of the treatments had no significant differences (P > 0.05) in ten years. In ten years, NS and CN rotations had higher water use efficiency (WUEs) than the SC rotation and CT, BNS had the highest WUE (19.0 kg ha −1 mm−1) for the spring maize – winter wheat rotation. Tillage rotation and fertilization had an interactive effect on soil water use and crop growth, and the results might clarify the response of crop yield and soil water variation to fertilization and tillage rotations. For further and sustainable development of crop production, BNS (5133 and 8415 kg ha −1 for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 386 mm) and BCN (5221 and 8116 kg ha −1 for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 388 mm) are recommended as the optimal fertilization and tillage rotations for rainfed crop production on the Loess Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","30","Soil conservation","Crops - Cultivation - Landforms - Rotation - Sediments - Soil moisture - Water supply","Conventional tillage - Crop rotation - Crop yield - Fertilization - Long-term fertilization - Soil water - Split plot experiments - Water use efficiency","446.1 Water Supply Systems - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 931.1 Mechanics","Number: 201303104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest; Number: 201503116, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest; Number: 31571620, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31671641, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NO. 31571620 and 31671641), the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant NO. 2015BAD22B02), and Special Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest (Grant NO. 201303104 and 201503116).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The variable adjustment coefficient of DFIG is defined according to the current reserve capacity, which can be applied to adjust different operation conditions to regulate the frequency variation within a predefined allowable range. Since the DFIG can make full use of the reserve wind power in the system frequency regulation, the proposed method can address both the frequency regulation response and the economic performance.

Temperature rise indicates that PEF treatment played the dominant role in the process of disinfection. The energy efficiency depends mainly on treatment time and electric field intensity. The optimal operating conditions were found to be: treatment time less than 10 seconds and electric field strength around 5 kV/cm. This investigation implies that, in the future, PEF treatment has the potential to be applied to disinfect nutrient solution. © IWA Publishing 2019.","23","Disinfection","Disaster prevention - Electric fields - Energy efficiency - Fungi - Nutrients","Disinfection treatments - Electric field intensities - Electric field strength - Fusarium oxysporums - Nutrient solution - Optimal operating conditions - Pulsed electric field - Pulsed electric field treatments","525.2 Energy Conservation - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program; Number: 201610019065, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","The study was funded by the National College Students Innovation and Training Program (The Ministry of Education of China, Grant No. 201610019065).

Finally, the optimal allocation of land use space under the coordination of town-agriculture-ecological space in Fuxian Lake Basin is proposed. The results show: 1) From 2005 to 2015, in the Fuxian Lake Basin, the urban space is on the rise, the agricultural space is in a downward trend, and the ecological space is rising first and then decreasing. The spatial distribution pattern is basically the same in 10 years. 2) The paper selects important water source, lakeside wetland and large-scale natural forest land as protection sources, 8 resistance factors such as elevation and slope are selected. The minimum cumulative resistance model and the cumulative cost distance model are used to construct the ecological security pattern of the Fuxian Lake Basin, as well as the 'source' core area, ecological protection area, ecological margin area, agricultural development area, agricultural fringe area and urban construction area which are conducive to ecological protection. 3) Taking the ecological functional partition area in the ecological security pattern as a constraint, based on the Markov model's calculation of the number of land types, and simulating the town-agriculture-ecological space optimization layout in the urban construction scenario, agricultural development scenario and ecological protection scenario of the Fuxian Lake Basin in 2030 through the CLUE-S model. The urban construction scenario takes into account the current needs of life, and the development of the number and spatial structure of town-agriculture-ecological space led by the development of urban space under the guidance of policies; the agricultural development scenario controls the size of urban space and develops part of the ecological space potential; the area of agricultural space has decreased under the ecological protection scenario, and the urban space area has increased slightly. 4) In the 2030 comprehensive optimization scenario of the Fuxian Lake Basin, seven spatial types are classified according to different land functions: Urban space, agricultural space, ecological space, urban-agricultural space, urban-ecological space, agriculture-ecological space and town-agriculture-ecological space.There are large differences in various types of space: Agriculture - ecological space is minimal, ecological space is maximum. 5) By analyzing the advantages of regional development in four cases and combining with various factors such as cultivated land protection, ecological protection and socioeconomic development in the Fuxian Lake Basin, the study considers that the integrated scenario is more reasonable and more suitable for local development, while the other three single-element scenarios can complement and adjust the implementation of the integrated scenario.

Some special structures of SiNWs are also discussed. Furthermore, the development of some novel structures of GeQDs for further improving their optical properties is reviewed. Finally, the growth mechanism and structure evolution of SiNWs/GeQDs composites are illustrated from the view of theory and experiment. The strain in Ge shell layers and SiNWs, the relationship between Ge growth mode and SiNW diameter, and the distribution of GeQDs on the radial and axial directions of SiNWs are discussed in detail.

Herein, bovine serum albumin integrated manganese dioxide nanoparticles (BSA-MnO2) was synthesized via a biomineralization strategy. Then, the BSA-MnO2 nanoparticles was anchored on the surface of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and photosensitizer chlorine e6 (Ce6) co-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres (BSA-MnO2@HMSNs-DOX-Ce6, BMHDC) through the formation of disulfide bonds. The BSA-MnO2 gatekeeper can not only prevent the premature release of payloads, but also act as an oxygen generator by triggering the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, which is able to overcome the hypoxia-associated photodynamic therapy (PDT) resistance of tumors. The high stability of the fabricated BMHDC nanoparticles with appropriate sizes (150 nm) could prolong blood circulation time and increase tumor accumulation compared to HMSNs-DOX-Ce6 nanoparticles. Notably, such nanoplatform exhibits efficient payloads loading capacities (14% for DOX and 36% for Ce6) and pH/redox-sensitive DOX and Ce6 release behavior through the breakage of disulfide bonds in the presence of the intracellular GSH, thus lead to synergistic chemo-PDT effect with a combination index (CI) of 0.21. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the exible BMHDC nanoplatforms can effectively suppress human cervical carcinoma via synergistic therapy.

The multiple scales perturbation method is applied to obtain the frequency response equations near primary, superharmonic and subharmonic resonances. A thorough study on the stability is proposed, with a particular emphasis on delay feedback. The results show that the hardening and softening behaviors of the system depend on the location of lumped mass. Furthermore, the displacement feedback gain coefficient only makes the peak amplitude move to the low frequency, yet velocity feedback coefficient and their time delays can be used to effectively enhance the stability and quench the nonlinear vibration of the cantilever beam.

This study determined whether adding pre–formed calcium ferrite (CaO·Fe2O3, CF) effectively prevents the formation of CT during sintering with VTM. The formation behavior of CT in the CF–T system was investigated using X–ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Phase composition analysis by XRD indicates that CT is formed significant quantities in the CF–T system when the temperature is higher than the melting temperature of CF. DSC analysis shows that the CF–T samples undergo two reaction stages in continuous heating. Namely, CF first melts and forms its liquid phase, then TiO2 substitutes Fe2O3 in liquid CF to produce CT. SEM images confirm that CT could be generated at regions with a high concentration of CF. Non–isothermal DSC measurements on the formation kinetics of CT indicate that its activation energy reaches 252.00 kJ/mol and that the model function is f(α)=(1–α)2, revealing a second–order reaction based on Malek analysis. The kinetics equation of CT formation can be expressed by ln([Formula presented])=2ln(1−α)−[Formula presented]+16.71+10.33α.

Classical methods require standard samples from both the master and slave spectrometers, which is the major bottleneck of large-scale NIR applications. In this study, the calibration transfer method based on variable penalty dynamic time warping (CT-VPdtw) is proposed, which can handle standard-free calibration transfer well and greatly expand the application ranges of the established model. The corn dataset with standards from Cargill and the standard-free wheat dataset from international diffuse reflectance conference (IDRC) 2016 are used to benchmark the transfer ability. When transferring from M5 to MP5 of the corn dataset, the RMSEP reduced from 0.86 to 0.152 by CT-VPdtw, 0.176 by piecewise direct standardization (PDS) and 0.207 by domain-invariant partial-least-squares (di-PLS) respectively. For the standard-free wheat dataset, CT-VPdtw has significant advantages when comparing with PDS and di-PLS. Moreover, 11 slave spectrometers can be transferred to the master spectrometer with satisfactory RMSEPs easily in the wheat dataset, which demonstrates that CT-VPdtw has potential to perform large-scale calibration transfer. With the good transfer ability, the standard-free and large-scale advantages, CT-VPdtw has the potential to be a widely used method for calibration transfer in near-infrared spectroscopy.

However, complete periodontal regeneration has not been accomplished. Previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of using cell sheets and treated dentin matrix (TDM) to regenerate bio-roots. Methods: In this study, we regenerated periodontal tissue using cell sheets combined with TDM particles (TDMPs). Human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) were isolated and characterized. Human dental follicle cells sheets (hDFCSs) and human TDMPs (hTDMP) were fabricated and characterized. The osteogenic effect of hTDMP was evaluated on human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) in vitro and a rat calvarial bone defect in vivo. Real-time PCR, western blotting, radiograph analysis, and histological analysis were performed to evaluate the periodontal induction capacity of hTDMP. One-wall periodontal intrabony defects were prepared to evaluate the periodontal regeneration capacity of TDMP/DFCSs on beagle dogs. Results: The results showed that hDFCs were mesenchymal stem cells. hTDMP promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. New bone formation was observed in the rat calvarial bone defect zone in both the hTDMP and hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate groups. Periodontal-like tissues showed better regeneration in the canine TDMP + DFCS group than in the other groups. Significance: These results demonstrate the potential of using TDMP/DFCSs in periodontal regeneration. © 2019","59","Tissue regeneration","Bone - Cell culture - Cell engineering - Defects - Hydroxyapatite - Polymerase chain reaction - Rats - Stem cells - Tissue","Cell sheet engineering - Dental follicle cells - Histological analysis - Human bone marrow stromal cells - Mesenchymal stem cell - Osteogenic differentiation - Periodontal regeneration - Treated dentin matrixes","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018FE001-317, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 81760197, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 81760197 , 81660178 , and 81700932 ] and Project of the Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province [grant number 2018FE001-317 ].

The removal efficiency of H2S by electrochemical and liquid phase catalysis was better than that of pure liquid phase catalysis or pure electrochemistry. In the entire reaction system, oxygen played an important role in the production of active intermediate substances and the recovery of catalyst activity. The better electrode material was graphite electrode; the purification efficiency was slightly improved under large voltage conditions, along with the increase of energy consumption; the optimum electrode plate spacing was 5 cm. The mechanism of H2S gas purification with palladium and copper catalyst under external voltage was investigated in the selected conditions. In the reaction system, one portion of H2S was combined with metal ions to form metal sulfide precipitation. These metal sulfide precipitate was dissolved by electrochemical action and existed as ions in the solution to maintain their catalytic activity. The other portion of H2S was reduced to sulfur and SO42- under the catalytic oxidation of transitional metals and electroactive substances. Electroactive substances could restore certain catalytic activity of metal catalytic ions and form a catalytic cycle, which improved the purification efficiency of H2S. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","21","Catalyst activity","Air purification - Catalysis - Catalytic oxidation - Copper - Electrochemical electrodes - Electrochemistry - Energy utilization - Graphite electrodes - Hydraulics - Liquids - Metal ions - Oxygen - Palladium - Precipitation (chemical) - Reaction intermediates - Sulfur compounds","Active intermediates - Electrochemical conditions - Liquid-phase catalysis - Liquid-phase catalytic oxidation - Metal sulfide precipitate - Oxygen concentrations - Purification efficiency - Removal efficiencies","525.3 Energy Utilization - 531.1 Metallurgy - 544.1 Copper - 547.1 Precious Metals - 632.1 Hydraulics - 643 Space Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 2018YFC0213403, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China; Number: 21377048, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors hereby present the sincere gratitude for National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0213403) as well as the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21377048 ).

However, the mechanisms by which heterogeneous carbon structures of biochars immobilize organic contaminants are not yet fully understood. In this study, the noncondensed aromatic components in biochars were selectively removed through bleaching. Different techniques, such as 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, were applied to characterize the biochar compositions, and thus the role of the different carbon structures in organic contaminant sorption was discussed. The aromatic carbon structures in biochars were gradually developed and evolved from noncondensed to condensed structure with increasing pyrolytic temperatures from 300 to 700 °C. Based on elemental analysis, the carbon removed by bleaching decreased from 43.9% to 5.92% with increasing temperatures. After the surface area normalization of the apparent sorption, bleaching increased the sorption of carbamazepine and bisphenol A on biochars produced at 500 °C, but not for those produced at 300 and 700 °C. Bleaching removed noncondensed aromatics and enriched condensed aromatics, which resulted in increased sorption. However, bleaching also resulted in the blockage of micropores in biochars with abundant condensed aromatics, causing decreased sorption. The apparent sorption was determined by the balancing of these two opposite effects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","39","Organic carbon","Amides - Aromatization - Bleaching - Carbon - Cleaning - Phenols - Soil conservation - Soil pollution - Sorption","Aromatic components - Bio chars - Carbon forms - Carbon structures - Condensed structures - Increasing temperatures - Organic contaminant - Pyrolytic temperature","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.1.1 Papermaking Processes","Number: 2017YFD0801000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41725016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This project was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFD0801000 ), the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China ( U1602231 , 41725016 , and 41673098 ).

However, an inverse isotopic altitude effect occurs when there are diverse vapor sources. This paper takes the Quanfuzhuang River Basin (QRB), which lies in the Hani Rice Terraces region of the southern Ailao Mountains in southwest China, as the study area. The study analyzes the isotopic data of 42 precipitation samples collected between an elevation range from 1500 m to 2024 m a.s.l. during the rainy season (from May to October) of 2015. The results indicate that there is an inverse isotopic altitude effect of precipitation with a positive isotope altitude gradient of 0.47‰/100 m and 1.10‰/100 m for δ18O and δ2H, respectively, at the mountaintop, while the precipitation amount increases at related elevations. A mixture of over peak airflow and recycled vapor is responsible for the inverse altitude effect as well as increasing rainfall amount. The positive precipitation isotopic altitude gradient is primarily caused by the local water cycle, and the increased precipitation amount is mainly caused by over peak airflow. The inverse isotopic altitude effect is also found in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Central Hindu Kush Mountains and the Tianshan Mountains, and findings from those mountains support these findings on the influence of mixed moisture sources on isotopic inverse altitude effects. © 2019","46","Landforms","Isotopes - Moisture","Altitude gradients - Honghe Hani Rice Terraces region of the southern Ailao Mountains - Inverse altitude effect - Isotopic composition - Moisture sources - Oxygen isotopes - Precipitation samples - Rocky Mountains","481.1 Geology","Number: 41271203, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41271203 , 41761115 ).

Degradation of spectral response mainly occurred in the long wavelength region of solar cell due to the bigger displacement damage in the base layer of solar cell. Degradation properties of solar cell by electron and proton irradiation can be predicted by electron to proton damage equivalency factor Rep. © 2019 Author(s).","30","Solar cells","Electrons - Gallium alloys - Gallium compounds - Indium alloys - Proton irradiation - Radiation effects - Semiconducting indium gallium arsenide - Semiconductor alloys - Vanadium alloys","Degradation analysis - Degradation of cell performance - Displacement damage dose - Displacement damages - Electrical parameter - Long-wavelength regions - Series and shunt resistances - Single junction solar cells","543.6 Vanadium and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 702.3 Solar Cells - 712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials","Number: 61534008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61664010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 61534008), Director Foundation of Xinjiang Technical Institute of Phys. & Chem.

Economic benefits are crucial for residents to accept LCZEBs. However, few relevant case studies have been conducted. A comparative analysis between a NZEB and a LCZEB with a multi-story apartment in a temperate region that meets the requirements of local building energy codes as the reference building was conducted in this study to ascertain economic feasibility of LCZEB. First, a building model and an energy model were established on the basis of site test, survey, and monitoring data. Then, the energy balances of the NZEB and LCZEB were calculated on the basis of the results of energy simulation and the foregoing data. Finally, the LCZEB and NZEB were realized on the condition that high thermal performance materials and high energy efficiency building equipment were adopted in accordance with the principle of maximizing net present value (NPV) and solar energy was fully utilized. Results demonstrate that solar hot water and photovoltaic systems are critical to the NZEB and LCZEB. Annual net energy (ANE) and annual NPV per square meter of thermal collector are −571.11 kWh and $455.5, respectively, and ANE and annual NPV per square meter of photovoltaic panel are −115.62 kWh and $13.2. The NZEB and LCZEB are economically feasible in the temperate region although the NZEB is superior to the LCZEB in terms of economic benefits. Their NPVs for the calculation period (20 years) are $15369.64 and $4718.77, and their payback periods are 11 and 16 years.

This new problem has many important applications in our reality life, and it is defined as follows. In the MCEWSC problem Q, the objective is to choose a minimum-cost subset of edges from a graph such that these edges form a required subgraph (e.g., a spanning tree). In the CRS-SPFL problem Q′, these edges are further required to be constructed by some stock pieces of fixed length L, the new objective is to minimize the total cost to construct such a required subgraph G′, where the total cost is sum of the cost to buy necessary these stock pieces and the cost to construct all edges in such a subgraph G′. We obtain the following three main results. (1) Whenever the MCEWSC problem Q can be approximated by an α -approximation algorithm (for the case α= 1, the MCEWSC problem Q is solved optimally by a polynomial-time exact algorithm), we can design a 2 α -approximation algorithm to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q′ ; (2) In addition, when the MCEWSC problem Q is to find a minimum spanning tree, we provide a 32 -approximation algorithm and an AFPTAS to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q′, respectively; (3) Finally, when the MCEWSC problem Q is to find a single-source shortest paths tree, we present a 32 -approximation algorithm and an AFPTAS to solve the CRS-SPFL problem Q′, respectively. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","7","Approximation algorithms","Polynomial approximation - Trees (mathematics)","AFPTAS - Bin packing - Exact algorithms - Minimum spanning trees - Polynomial-time - Single source shortest paths - Stock pieces of fixed length L - Subgraphs","921 Mathematics","Number: 2018FY001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 11861075, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 11861075], IRTSTYN, and Key Joint Project of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department and Yunnan University [No. 2018FY001(-014)], Innovation Team Fostering Project of Yunnan Province.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The two heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were systematically investigated, and the system with H2O2 exhibited higher reactivity for Bisphenol A (BPA) elimination and total organic carbon (TOC) reduction. The two systems were comprehensively compared in terms of degradation kinetics, transformation way, water matrix species and catalyst stability. Systems with H2O2 and PS can remove 100% and 80.2% of the BPA after 120 min (0.22 mmol/L), respectively([H2O2] = 22 mmol/L, [PS] = 22 mmol/L). The oxidant efficiency in system with H2O2 was obviously higher probably due to the less radical scavenging. A mechanism was proposed that the interface interactions between solid and liquid phase will affect the collision among molecular of oxidants and catalyst, as well as the lifetime of radicals during the their diffusion process. The quenching experiments demonstrated that the primary radical species in two systems were ·OHand SO4·-/·OH, respectively, thus causing the different BPA degradation pathways and by-products. The catalyst presented good structural stability and relatively low Fe leaching in both systems during the recycle. The valence state transformation from Fe2+ to Fe3+ after the reaction explained the gradual catalytic activity loss. In the tap water and municipal wastewater, the system with PS was less influenced by the real water matrix due to the lower university of SO4·- toward organics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","44","System stability","Catalysis - Catalyst activity - Coal ash - Degradation - Fly ash - Iron oxides - Linear transformations - Magnetite - Organic carbon - Oxidants - Phase interfaces - Phenols - Surface reactions","Advanced oxidation process - Bisphenol a degradations - Coal fly ash - H2O2 - Heterogeneous AOPs - Municipal wastewaters - Persulfate - Structural stabilities","524 Solid Fuels - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Herein, sulfadiazine was adopted as a representative antibiotic to probe the alteration of photolytic kinetics along freshwater to seawater sampled from Qinzhou Bay, China. The results showed that the photodegradation rate constants of sulfadiazine significantly increased in estuarine waters along freshwaters to seawaters. Experiments in synthetic water samples with isolated local dissolved organic matter (IL-DOM)indicated that the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine is attributed to the integrative effect of both IL-DOM and halide ions. Radical quenching experiments with tert-butanol (quenching of ·OH)and isopropanol (quenching of both ·OH and reactive halogen species, RHS)demonstrated that RHS are largely responsible for the halide-specific enhancement in the photodegradation of sulfadiazine, rather than other reactive species, such as triplet-excited IL-DOM and ·OH. However, triplet-excited IL-DOM was involved in the production of RHS by the oxidation of halide ions by the triplet-excited states. Experiments conducted with DOM analogues verified DOM-sensitized RHS formation, and the degradation induced by RHS is positively correlated with the triplet-excited reduction potentials of DOM analogues. These findings are helpful in deeply understanding the transformation of antibiotics, and demonstrate the importance of RHS-induced degradation in antibiotics fate models in estuarine water systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","40","Photodegradation","Amides - Antibiotics - Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Estuaries - Ions - Quenching - Rate constants - Seawater - Sulfur compounds","Dissolved organic matters - Estuarine waters - Halide ions - Halogen species - Sulfonamides - Triplet-excited DOM","407.2 Waterways - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.2 Geochemistry - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 1411909411, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 21707058, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21707058 ) and High-Level Talent Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 1411909411 ).
