Previous research results demonstrate that the increase of thermal conductivity of PCMs can enhance the thermal performance in solar thermal systems; however, the corresponding mechanism is not clear. To this end, this work investigates the influence of PCMs properties on storage performance of solar thermal systems. First, experimental testing was conducted to verify the effectiveness of a thermal simulation model in the heat storage and release process. Then, the proposed simulation model was used to investigate the performance of several commonly used PCMs in the process of melting and solidification. The influence of thermal conductivity and phase transition temperature on the thermal storage properties was analyzed. The analysis results demonstrated that the influence of phase transition temperature on the thermal system performance was greater than that of the thermal conductivity in short time, while the thermal conductivity contributed greater influence on the system performance in long time. The phase transition temperature hardly affected the total system efficiency if given enough heat transfer time.

For multi-MGs (MMGs) which have multiple coexisting beneficiaries, it will be unfeasible to realize a cooperative control among them. Hence, we propose a game theoretic non-cooperative distributed coordination control (NCDCC) scheme to address multi-operator energy trading and facilitate a powerful control structure for MMGs. The proposed NCDCC coordinates the individual benefits of each MG and achieves a global objective based on differential game theory. Furthermore, it simplifies the implementation of many ADS control functions, including global coordination, local autonomy, and self-healing, by reconsidering an ADS as MMGs and every MG as an agent. Moreover, the NCDCC reduces the control dimension and number of agents by obviating the requirements for a central controller and complex communication topologies.

While GGTA1 knockout (GTKO) can protect xenografts from hyperacute rejection, complement-dependent cytotoxicity might still contribute to this type of rejection. To prolong the xenograft survival, we utilized a T2A-mediated pCMV-hCD55-T2A-hCD59-Neo vector and transfected the plasmid into GTKO Diannan miniature pig fetal fibroblasts. After G418 selection combined with single-cell cloning culture, four colonies were obtained, and three of these were successfully transfected with the hCD55 and hCD59. One of the three colonies was selected as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Then, the reconstructed embryos were transferred into eight recipient gilts, resulting in four pregnancies. Three of the pregnant gilts delivered, yielding six piglets. Only one piglet carried hCD55 and hCD59 genetic modification. The expression levels of the GGTA1, hCD55, and hCD59 in the tissues and fibroblasts of the piglet were determined by q-PCR, fluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, and western blotting analyses. The results showed the absence of GGTA1 and the coexpression of the hCD55 and hCD59. However, the mRNA expression levels of hCD55 and hCD59 in the GTKO/hCD55/hCD59 pig fibroblasts were lower than that in human 293T cells, which may be caused by low copy number and/or CMV promoter methylation. Furthermore, we performed human complement-mediated cytolysis assays using human serum solutions from 0 to 60%. The result showed that the fibroblasts of this triple-gene modified piglet had greater survival rates than that of wild-type and GTKO controls. Taken together, these results indicate that T2A-mediated polycistronic vector system combined with SCNT can effectively generate multiplex genetically modified pigs, additional hCD55 and hCD59 expression on top of a GTKO genetic background markedly enhance the protective effect towards human serum-mediated cytolysis than those of GTKO alone. Thus, we suggest that GTKO/hCD55/hCD59 triple-gene-modified Diannan miniature pig will be a more eligible donor for xenotransplantation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","50","Mammals","Alkylation - Body fluids - Cell culture - Clone cells - Cytotoxicity - Fibroblasts - Fluorescence microscopy - Genes - Genetic engineering - Proteins - Vectors","Bicistronic vector - Complement-dependent cytotoxicities - Genetic modifications - GGTA1-knockout - Immunohistochemical staining - Regulatory protein - Somatic cell nuclear transfers - Xenotransplantation",,"Number: 31560637, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by grants from Major Program on Basic Research Projects of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2014FC006), the National Genetically Modified Organisms Breeding Major Projects (Grant No. 2016ZX08009-003-006) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31560637).

However manual segmentation and artificial extracting features block MRI's practice when facing with the huge amount of data produced by MRI. An efficient and automatic image segmentation of brain tumor is still needed. In this paper, a novel automatic segmentation framework of brain tumors, which have 5 parts and resnet-50 use as a backbone, is proposed based on convolutional neural network. A dilated convolution refine (DCR) structure is introduced to extract the local features and global features. After investigating different parameters of our framework, it is proved that DCR is an efficient and robust method in Brain Tumor Segmentation. The experiments are evaluated by Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS 2015) dataset.

There are two challenges in the traditional supervised machine learning. One is that the test data distribution always differs largely from the training data distribution in the real world, while another is that there is usually very few labeled data to train a machine learning model. In such cases, transfer learning, which emphasizes the transfer of the previous knowledge from different but related domains and tasks, is recommended to deal with these problems. Traditional transfer learning methods care more about the data itself rather than the task. In fact, there is no one universal feature representation can perfectly benefit the model training work. But different feature representations can discover some independent latent knowledge from the original data. In this paper, we propose an instance-based transfer learning method, which is a weighted ensemble transfer learning framework with multiple feature representations. In our work, mutual information is applied as the smart weighting schema to measure the weight of each feature representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three facial expression recognition data sets: JAFFE, KDEF and FERG-DB. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than the traditional transfer learning method and the non-transfer learning method. © 2018 IEEE.","29","Learning algorithms","Application programs - Artificial intelligence - Engineering research - Human computer interaction - Supervised learning","Ensemble learning - Facial expression recognition - Machine learning models - Multiple features - Mutual informations - Supervised machine learning - Transfer learning - Transfer learning methods","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 901.3 Engineering Research","Number: 61402397, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61663046, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the Grant No. 61402397 and 61663046; Yunnan Applied Fundamental Research Project under the grant No 2016FB104; Yunnan Provincial Young Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Talents under the Grant No. 2017HB005 Yunnan Provincial Innovation Team under the Grant No. 2017HC012 Program for Yunnan High Level Overseas Talent Recruitment.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we chose three different irrigation emitter types (drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, 2-hole flow adjustable emitter and 8-hole flow adjustable emitter) as study subject under the water quality condition combined with three fertilization concentrations (0, 0.6 and 1.2 g/L) and three sediment particles size range were applied on root area infiltration irrigation and surface drip irrigation. The irrigation experiment of 5 min each time was conducted under working pressure of 20 kPa for three days. The difference in weight of the flowerpots before and after irrigation was the amount of water irrigated. After the experiment, the irrigation amount of emitters was recorded. If the relative flow rate of emitter was below 75%, the test stopped and then recorded effective irrigation times. The results showed that there was a very significant interaction between the soil particle size and emitter types, fertilizer concentration and emitter types, irrigation types and emitter types (P0.05). The bigger Yunnan red loam particle size, the easier clogging was made on flow adjustable emitter. Such as 2-hole flow adjustable emitter on surface drip irrigation,when the application rate of fertilizer was 0 g/L, the effective irrigation times of muddy water with three different particles size range were 11, 8 and 5, respectively. As for drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, Yunnan red loam particle size ranging 0.0385 - 0.074 mm was the easiest to cause clogging and the particle size ranging 0 - 0.0385 mm was the least to cause clogging. The fertilization has a significant influence on the clogging of the emitter. When the fertilizer concentration was less than 0.6 g/L, the large impact of fertilizer application on emitter was most obvious. When the fertilizer concentration was more than 0.6 g/L, the number of effective irrigation times did not have obvious change. However, the trend of the relative flow rate of the emitter increased, indicating that the blockage of the emitter increased. The irrigation type was an important factor affecting the clogging of emitter and it had different effects on different emitter. For 8-hole flow adjustable emitter, the anti-blocking performance of the surface drip irrigation was better than the root area infiltration irrigation. Under the surface drip irrigation, when the application rate of fertilizer was 0, the total effective irrigation times with three different particle sizes were four times more than root area infiltration irrigation. When the application rate of fertilizer was 1.2 g/L, the total effective irrigation times with 3 different particle sizes were 18 times and the root area infiltration irrigation were 15 times. For 2-hole flow adjustable emitter and drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch, two different irrigation types did not have abviously different for effective irrigation times. Under the condition of fertilizing in muddy water, the performance of different emitter on clogging was different. The most clogged emitter was 8-hole flow adjustable emitter, followed by 2-hole flow adjustable emitter and the last was drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch.

Compound 1 was characterized by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental, IR and thermal gravimetric analyses. Structural analysis reveals that the unit cell simultaneously contains MnIII-Salen dimer and monomer cation fragments, for which the Anderson-type polyanions serve as counter anions. In the packing arrangement, all the MnIIIdimers are well separated by polyoxometalate units and form tertiary structure together with MnIIImonomers. Interestingly, different from the previous work, in the exact same reaction conditions, we are able to template MnIII-Salen complexes into different configurations by varying the charge state of polyanions. Besides, the magnetic properties of 1 were also examined by using both dc and ac magnetic field of the superconducting quantum interference devices. Most importantly, our fitting of the experimental data to a Heisenberg-type spin model shows that there exists a ferromagnetic exchange interaction ∼5 K between the spins (S = 2) on MnIIIin the dimer, while antiferromagnetic ones exist among monomers and dimer (∼2 K). This meta-magnetic state could induce a slight spin frustration at low temperature, which would in turn affect the magnetic behavior. In addition, our ac field measurement of the susceptibilities suggests a typical signature for a single-molecule magnet. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","33","Dimers","Crystal structure - Ethylene - Magnetic properties - Magnetism - Magnets - Manganese compounds - Molecules - Monomers - Negative ions - Quantum interference devices - Single crystals - SQUIDs - Superconducting devices - Temperature - X ray diffraction","Controllable synthesis - Ferromagnetic exchange interaction - Magnetic analysis - Mn-Salen - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Single-molecule magnet - Supramolecular architectures - Thermal gravimetric analysis","641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: YNG2017006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: · DH1606, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31760257, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11564023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21761017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 31760257 , No. 21761017 , No. 11564023 ), the agricultural plastic film and products research and development of Plateau area (No· DH1606 ), and Yunnan Province Foreign Expert project ( YNG2017006 ).

The paper explored the relevance properties of the mean discharge quantity per second (Qsec) and SF6decomposition component. The results show that the stable decomposition components such as CF4, CO2, SO2F2, SOF2and SO2are produced. The concentration of CO2, SO2F2, SOF2and (SO2F2+SOF2+SO2) correlates well with Qsec. The generation speed RRMSof SO2F2, SOF2and (SO2F2+SOF2+SO2) linearly increases with Qsecroughly, which can be the characteristics of DC PD quantity.

Current icing flashover researches mainly focus on the model study of flashover voltage of iced insulators. On one hand, the model of flashover voltage cannot fully reflect the insulator flashover voltage under the combined effects of all factors. On the other hand, due to the data acquisition error in the information of the transmission lines, the current characteristics model of icing flashover is difficult to be directly used in the forecasting of icing flashover fault. Considering the development of data mining technology, the partial mutual information (PMI) and support vector machine (SVM) are proposed to predict the icing flashover fault. Firstly, PMI is adopted to select the key factors for input variables. Secondly, SVM forecast model of icing flashover is established to train and predict the sample data. The simulation results show that the forecast method based on the PMI and SVM can predict the icing flashover more effectively, which can act as a reference for the ice defense of power grid. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","23","Flashover","Data acquisition - Data mining - Electric lines - Electric power transmission networks - Forecasting - Insulator contamination - Support vector machines","Current characteristic - Data mining technology - Flashover faults - Flashover voltage - Iced insulators - Insulator flashover - Partial mutual informations - Variable selection","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing","Number: 51307078, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51307078), State Grid Corporation of China and State Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Protection and Control.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, these concepts are very abstract to outsiders. Direct measurements of the indicators related to entropy and exergy are difficult and involve large errors. Schneider and Kay (1994) bridged thermodynamic concepts, i.e., entropy and exergy, with perceivable ecological indicators, i.e., canopy surface temperature (Tsurf) and net radiation (Rn) in their maximum exergy destruction principle. However, the connection between entropy and exergy with Tsurfand Rnwas based on the similarity between the ecosystem and the Bénard cell, and not on thermodynamic reasoning. Considering the coherence of entropy production and exergy destruction, we analyzed the relationship between entropy production and Tsurfand Rn, based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and verified it using long-term monitoring data of a tropical seasonal rain forest. We demonstrated that total entropy production (exergy destruction) linearly increased with increasing Rnand decreasing Tsurftheoretically. Empirical data showed that the total entropy production increased, whereas specific entropy production decreased during the growing season. This indicates that plant growth can enhance exergy conversion efficiency. Rn, Tsurf, and related indicators can be used as surrogates for thermodynamic indicators to measure ecosystem status and development. The bridge between thermodynamic concepts and measurable ecological indicators will improve the application of thermodynamics in ecology studies and the understanding of thermodynamic processes in ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","57","Entropy","Atmospheric temperature - Ecosystems - Exergy - Surface properties - Thermodynamics","Ecosystem development - Exergy destructions - Specific entropy - Surface temperatures - Total entropy","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 31200307, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013FB078, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017XTBG-F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was funded by the Applied Fundamental Research Program of Yunnan Province ( 2013FB078 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 31200307 ) and the CAS 135 Program (No. 2017XTBG-F01 ).

It is extremely relevant to human stereopsis and considerable individual variability. Due to the contribution of color information to stereopsis is controversial, this study is focused on designing and conducting a stereoacuity test for different colors. In particular, the effect of color variations on stereoacuity was evaluated by using 3D displays to present color random-dot stereogram (RDS) stimuli. Seventeen color points sampled from the CIELAB color space were selected for the test. All sample color points are averagely distributed in red-green and yellow-blue directions at isoluminance. The stimuli had the same dot density of 50% and black background, with different colors and disparities. Then the minimum disparity was obtained as the stereoacuity of subject. The results of experiment show that the stereoacuities are not significantly different in red-green direction and blue-yellow directions. These results support the view that color does not contribute to the stereoacuity. © 2018 SPIE.","18","Three dimensional displays","Color - Color vision - Holography - Stereo image processing","Brain functions - Color information - Color points - Color variations - Disparity - Individual variability - Random dot stereograms - Stereoacuity","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.2 Vision - 743 Holography - 746 Imaging Techniques","Number: 2018FA033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61741516, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation of China (grant number: 61741516) and Key Program of the Yunnan Education Commission of China(grant number: 2018FA033).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

After irrigation, the change in the emitter discharge was tested, and the discharged particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyser. The results showed that the flushing treatments had a significant effect on the anti-clogging performance of the emitter and extended the emitter's service life by 35.2% on average. Among the three factors, the flushing pressure lengthened the emitter's service life most. With more irrigation events, the discharged particle sizes V10, V50, and V90 (i.e. the particle size with accumulating particle volumes of 10%, 50% and 90%, respectively) decreased under different flushing treatments. However, particle sizes were still larger than those without the flushing. Particles of all sizes could be trapped in the emitter channel. However, coarse particles were trapped more easily, which was the major reason for emitter clogging. Flushing treatments helped the discharge of sediments. The analysis of variance indicated that the flushing pressure had a significant effect on the discharge of coarse particles and flushing time had an obvious impact on fine particles.

Some of the primary motivations for the enterprise to adopt the container technology include its conveniency to encapsulate and deploy applications, lightweight operations, as well as efficiency and flexibility in resources sharing. However, there still lacks an in-depth and systematic comparison study on how big data applications, such as Spark jobs, perform between a container environment and a virtual machine environment. In this paper, by running various Spark applications with different configurations, we evaluate the two environments from many interesting aspects, such as how convenient the execution environment can be set up, what are makespans of different workloads running in each setup, how efficient the hardware resources, such as CPU and memory, are utilized, and how well each environment can scale. The results show that compared with virtual machines, containers provide a more easy-to-deploy and scalable environment for big data workloads.

By employing an in situ electrochemical alloying/dealloying generated nanoporous Ag (NPA) as the supporting substrate, we propose a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) synthesis route in a deep eutectic solvent (Ethaline), combined with an electrochemical activation process to fabricate monolithic 3D nanoporous Ag/Pd core/shell hybrids with ultrathin (sub 1 nm) amorphous Pt-rich skin (Pt-Pd@NPA), showing excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance and durability over a wide pH range. The optimized Pt-Pd@NPA requires low overpotentials of -28.1, -34.8, and -23.8 mV to drive a catalytic current density of -10 mA cm-2 with small Tafel slopes of 31.2, 32.2, and 32.5 mV dec-1 in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), neutral (1.0 M PBS), and alkaline (1.0 M KOH) media, respectively, which outperforms most previously reported noble-metal-based HER electrocatalysts. Impressively, this hybrid catalyst is capable of steadily delivering a fairly large current density of 1000 mA cm-2 in highly acidic media (0.5-7.0 M H2SO4), promising its practical use in advanced water-splitting devices. The superior HER performance is ascribed to the 3D interconnected nanoporous architectures and synergies between the Ag-Pd skeletons and active Pt.

The gas heater, one of the key components of the cycle, is typically heated in a fluid-to-fluid coupled way during the cycle utilization. Performance of gas heater under this thermal boundary condition is still unclear since most existing studies on supercritical heating were conducted at uniform heat flux condition. In this work a modified shear-stress transport model, with the incorporation of a variable turbulent Prandtl formulation, was employed to study performance of supercritical CO2 gas heater under coupled heating. Effects of source fluid operating parameters and buoyancy forces were analyzed. Results show that a nearly uniform thermal field was achieved by increasing the mass flux of source fluid, while increasing the inlet temperature of source fluid was ineffective to that end. Under heavy influence of buoyancy local deterioration still occurred under coupled heating, though much weaker than that reported in cases at uniform heat flux. Finally, various Nusselt correlations were evaluated under coupled heating conditions. among which the Dang & Hihara Correlation showed the best performance. © ACRA 2018 - 9th Asian Conference on Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning.

However, the thermal stability is an important issue for commercial application. In particular, thermoelectric materials are in the high temperature for a long time due to the working condition. The present work investigates the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of single crystal SnSe thermoelectric materials. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that the internal of SnSe crystal is not easily oxidized, while the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that the surface of SnSe is slight oxidized to SnO2. Even if the surface is oxidized, the SnSe crystal still exhibits stable thermoelectric properties. Meanwhile, the crystallization quality of SnSe samples can be improved after the appropriate heat treatment in the air, which is in favor of the carrier mobility and can improve the electrical conduction properties of SnSe. Moreover, the decrease of defect density after heat treatment can further improve the Seebeck coefficient and electrical transport properties of SnSe. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation verifies the important role of defect on the electrical conductivity and electron configuration. In summary, appropriate temperature annealing is an effective way to improve the transmission properties of SnSe single crystal thermoelectric materials. © 2018 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","54","Selenium compounds","Annealing - Density functional theory - Heat treatment - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Layered semiconductors - Oxidation - Oxidation resistance - Scanning electron microscopy - Single crystals - Stability - Thermodynamic stability - Thermoelectric equipment - Thermoelectricity - Transmission electron microscopy - Transport properties - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Commercial applications - Electrical conduction properties - Electrical conductivity - Electrical transport properties - Electron configuration - SnSe - Thermo-Electric materials - Thermoelectric properties","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 615.4 Thermoelectric Energy - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 61864012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","∗Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61864012). †Corresponding author.

X-ray diffraction results indicated that all bulk samples had single phase with orthorhombic phase (space group of Pbnm) without impurities. With the increase of Ag doping content, the resistivity of the samples decreased, while the remanent magnetization and coercive field increased. The metal to insulator transition temperature (Tp), temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and Curie temperature (Tc) for x = 0.20 were determined as 300 K, 9.38% (292.6 K) and 291.86 K respectively. The highest MR value of 28.36% (295.03 K) was obtained at x = 0.15. XPS data revealed that substitution between A-site ions and Ag+could increase the ratio of Mn4+ion. Double exchange effect (DE) enhanced by changing Mn–O bond distance, Mn–O–Mn bond angle, and increasing Mn4+ion concentration. These features promoted the transfer of itinerant electron between Mn3+and Mn4+ions. However, the magnetization obtained at x = 0.20 was less than that at x = 0, as diamagnetic Ag released magnetism of the samples.

The experimental results demonstrate that the Y-Y type microchannel reactor can be used for both Cu extraction and Cu stripping. The effects of residence time, aqueous phase pH, and concentration of extractant on the extent of extraction were investigated. The results indicated that the extent of extraction and the separation factor using a Y-Y type microchannel reactor are greater than those obtained with a conventional batch extraction. The maximum extraction of copper reached 86.02%. Also, the stripping reaction was studied with respect to Cu2+ concentration in the loaded organic phase, H2SO4 concentration, and the organic/aqueous phase ratio. The maximum stripping of copper reached 98.94%. The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients (KLα) were calculated to evaluate mass transfer characteristics. For comparison, conventional batch extraction experiments were also carried out, in parallel. The laminar flow pattern through the Y-Y microchannel was investigated by numerical simulation, and by experimental measurements. The maximum separation factors, βCu/Fe and βCu/Zn, were found to be 465.53 and 1249.70, respectively. Higher KLα values (0.4937–3.3969 s−1) were obtained for Cu within 5 s using a microchannel reactor compared with values (0.006–0.073 s−1) from batch experiments. Much higher overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients,KLα values (0.4937–3.3969 s−1) for Cu, and lower KLα values for Fe (0.0477–0.3173 s−1) and Zn (0.0395–0.2130 s−1), demonstrated an effective separation between Cu and Fe, Zn. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","43","Solvent extraction","Copper - Flow patterns - Laminar flow - Mass transfer - Microchannels - Solvents","Batch experiments - Batch extraction - Extractants - Mass transfer characteristics - Micro channel reactors - Residence time - Separation factors - Volumetric mass transfer coefficient","544.1 Copper - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals","Number: 201608740004, Acronym: SXSCC, Sponsor: Shanxi Scholarship Council of China; Number: 51504116, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 51504116 ) and the China Scholarship Council (Grant number: 201608740004 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, most of the acquired data are uncertain because of the gaps in data collection or to maintain subject privacy. Thus, we investigate co-location pattern mining problem in the context of uncertain data. The prevalent co-location pattern under uncertain environments has two different definitions. The first definition, referred as the expected prevalent co-location, employs the expected interest degree of co-location to measure whether this pattern is frequent. The second definition, referred as the probabilistic prevalent co-location, uses the probabilistic formulations to measure frequency. Here a novel system called UMine is proposed to compare this two different definitions with a user-friendly interface. The core of a system such as this is the mining algorithm, and UMine is integrated with the expected mining method, probabilistic mining method, and approximate mining method. In this paper, the system is introduced in detail, and the comparison between these two types of definitions is implemented. The experimental results show that the difference between these two definitions’ result sets changes as the threshold changes. By flexibly adjusting the parameters, users can observe interesting patterns in the data. In addition, the demonstration provides data generation and preprocessing function while showing its practicality for either real-world or synthetic data sets.

The predicting precision of the trammel pendulum(TP) model was evaluated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT, and the effects of fill level, tank sectional ellipticity, and excitation frequency on the model's predicting precision were analyzed. A generalized multi-mass TP model was proposed, the mass and distance between each part of fluid pendulum were reasonably distributed to adapt to the variations in tank sectional ellipticity and fill level. The dynamics equation for the generalized multi-mass TP model was derived based on the Lagrange approach. The method to determine the parameters of mass ratio and distance between the two masses, and the fitting formulas of double mass TP(DMTP) model were presented. The predicting precision of the proposed DMTP model was evaluated by the CFD method. Analysis result shows that the sloshing moment gained from the TP model is generally less than that computed by the CFD method, and the predicting error generally increases as the fill level increases. The predicting error of the peak sloshing moment increases from 15% to 65% when the fill level increases from 30% to 80%. This is mainly because the TP model is fitted under the conditions of small initial fluid incline angle and free sloshing. When the fill level and sloshing frequency are relatively high, both the length of pendulum arm and the sloshing fluid mass are less than the actual cases. The proposed DMTP model presents a relatively stable and high predicting precision in most conditions of fill levels, tank sectional ellipticities and excitation frequencies. Comparing with the TP model, when excitation frequency is 0.2 and 0.3 Hz, respectively, the mean value of the root mean square error(RMSE) of the predicted maximum sloshing moment in the DMTP model decreases by 54.2% and 43.9%, respectively, and the standard deviation decreases by 45.1% and 31.2%, respectively. The predicting precision of the proposed DMTP model is obviously higher than that of the TP model, and the DMTP model can especially well make up for the deficiency of low predicting precision of the TP model in the case of high fill level. 22 figs, 31 refs. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

Therefore, a novel isoamoxyphthalocyanine-attapulgite (ZnPc(3-iso-PeO)4-ATP) composites were fabricated by the ultrasonic impregnation menthod. The as-prepared ZnPc(3-iso-PeO)4-ATP composites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy spectra. The photocatalytic activities of as-obtained photocatalysts were measured by the degradation of malachite green (MG) under visible-light irradiation. The optimal conditions for the degradation of MG were determined with changing kind of catalysts and the ratio of phthalocyanine to attapulgite. In the ZnPc(3-iso-PeO)4-ATP system, it was demonstrated that preventing the aggregation of phthalocyanines was helpful to enhance the photocatalytic property. It was found that the degradation efficiency of MG reached 70% after 50 min when the ratio of ZnPc(3-iso-PeO)4to ATP was up to 2:1. Furthermore, the possible visible-light photocatalytic mechanism of ZnPc(3-iso-PeO)4-ATP composites for the photodegradation of MG was also discussed.

In addition, anatase TiO2 single crystals exposing large {0 0 1} crystal facets are facilely synthesized with “green” NaF plus HCl replacing HF for the morphology control. A series of comparative experiments are carried out for separately studying the effects of F− and H+ concentrations on the growth of TiO2 crystals, which have not been understood very much in depth so far. The results indicate that both F− and H+ synergistically affect the synthesis of truncated anatase octahedrons, where F− is preferentially adsorbed on the {0 0 1} facets resulting in lateral growth of these facets and H+ adjusts the growth rate of anatase TiO2 along different orientations by tuning the hydrolysis rate. Based on this information, anatase TiO2 single crystals with small size (1.3 μm) and large exposure of {0 0 1} facets (45%) are successfully prepared under optimal conditions ([H+]/[F−] = 20:1). Photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared products toward methylene blue photo-degradation are further tested.

The average value of total nitrogen/total phosphorus (TN/TP) ratio is widely used to determine the limiting nutrient; while it suffers from the risk of the incorrect description of data and neglecting dynamics of the nutrient limitation. A probabilistic method was thereby proposed in this study to explore dynamics of nutrient limitation, including (a) indicator definition as the probability of TN/TP ratio failing in Redfield ratio line (PFR), indicating the possibility of TN limitation, to improve a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation; (b) Bayesian ANOVA analysis for posterior distributions of different treatments; and (c) dynamics determination as PFRs to show dynamics of nutrient limitation. Lake Xingyun in Southwestern China was taken as a case to explore the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation. According to modeling results, we deducted that (a) for the interannual dynamics, the limiting nutrient shifted from TP to TN; and (b) for the seasonal dynamics, TN and TP were co-limiting. Deductions were further confirmed by the observed data. With the proposed probabilistic method, the co-limitation of TN and TP was identified for the seasonal dynamics; while using the average ratio solely denied the possibility of co-limitation. The current study also revealed that, due to neglecting the interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation, the average ratio might mislead the eutrophication management strategy by recommending reducing TN and TP concentration together. The proposed probabilistic method demonstrated that TN was the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton in recent years and actions should focus on the TN concentration reduction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","63","Nutrients","Analysis of variance (ANOVA) - Dynamics - Eutrophication - Lakes - Phytoplankton - Probability distributions","Bayesian - Concentration reduction - Management strategies - Posterior distributions - Probabilistic measures - Probabilistic methods - Seasonal dynamics - TN/TP ratio","471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51721006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB458900) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51721006).

In order to improve the education quality of rural schools, small rural schools are merged dramatically. After the consolidation rural school, the larger quantity and small scale problems in rural area have been solved, and the economies of scale and education quality have been improved. However, many problems emerge. For example, the distance from home to school is farther, the cost of family education becomes higher, and the school management is more complex. Adopting ArcGIS, this research explores the distribution of the rural primary schools in a mountainous county of China and assesses the school distribution and the existing problems. It is found that the distribution of educational resources in Zhenyuan County is not balanced. Via Proximity analysis, one can find that some villages are far from school, the actual service areas of the school increase, and some villages are in the service blind area. In the end, recommendation is offered that schools cannot be merged at present, instead, the necessary small schools and teaching points in countryside must be set and the network analysis is conducted to offer some suggestions on school location. © 2018 IEEE.","12","Rural areas","Economics - Geographic information systems","Economies of scale - Education quality - Educational resource - Existing problems - Rural primary schools - Rural schools - School layout - Spatial analysis","903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2017M623080, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 71764036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is partial funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71764036), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (No. 2017M623080).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

There is a large-scale copper (Cu)–zinc (Zn)–stannum (Sn) polymetallic ore deposit in Dulong, Yunnan Province, China. The polymetallic ore deposit contains a lot of silver (Ag) and indium (In). In this paper, the polymetallic ore is investigated to explore the characteristics of its process mineralogy by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), optical microscopy (OM), and electron probe micro-analyser (EMPA). The contents of the main valuable elements in the ore are Cu 0.20%, Zn 3.93%, Sn 0.47%, Fe 22.70% and S 9.90%. Cu, Zn, Sn, and Fe mainly occur in chalcopyrite, marmatite, cassiterite and magnetite, respectively. In addition, as rare metal elements, there are also Ag 4.9 g/t and In 90.50 g/t in the ore. Ag mainly occurs in matildite and an unknown mineral (Ag0.75(Zn, Fe)0.25S) and these two minerals are all enclosed and disseminated in marmatite. In does not form an independent mineral, but an isomorphism element which mainly occurs in marmatite.

In addition, the studied alloy also reveals a giant positive baroresistance (BR) effect with a saturated value of 115% at 242 K.

The transportation requirements for fresh food delivery have been continuously increasing. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to ensure that fresh food can be delivered just in time and with minimum total cost while maintaining the quality of fresh food. Considering that fresh food plants need multiple trucks to deliver multiple products to numerous geographically dispersed customers, the delivery of fresh food is considered in two stages in our study. The first stage is cluster consumers; that is, we determine to which consumers each truck is responsible for delivery. The second stage, which is based on the consumer grouping results, develops a total cost model that includes the transportation, refrigerated, devalued, and penalty costs incurred during distribution. This model is used to determine the optimal route selection, the temperature control, and the average speed of each truck in distribution. This paper designs decision variables based on a customer's seven requirement attributes; it also proposes a fuzzy clustering method for grouping customers and improves a fuzzy genetic algorithm that is used to solve the proposed total cost model. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using an example. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than that of a traditional genetic algorithm. This research work provides an optimal distribution total cost decision method for the logistics managers. This research also provides an effective means to ensure the safety of fresh food. © 2018 Yong Ming Wang and Hong Li Yin.","43","Food safety","Clustering algorithms - Fuzzy clustering - Genetic algorithms - Sales - Transportation routes - Trucks","Decision variables - Fuzzy - genetic algorithms - Fuzzy clustering method - Multiple products - Optimal distributions - Soft time windows - Traditional genetic algorithms - Transportation requirements","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 663.1 Heavy Duty Motor Vehicles - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Number: 2013FZ048, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 71262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71362030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71640028, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 71640028, no. 71362030, and no. 71262029) and Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan (no. 2013FZ048).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This makes them excellent candidates for organic linkers in the construction of photochromic coordination polymers. Such a photochromic two-dimensional coordination polymer has been prepared using N,N′-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (DPMNI). In crystallization tubes, upon slow diffusion of an MeOH solution of cadmium perchlorate into a CHCl 3 solution of DPMNI, the complex poly[[bis[μ 2 -2,7-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)benzo[imn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetrone-κ 2 N:N′]bis(perchlorato-κO)cadmium(II)] chloroform tetrasolvate], {[Cd(C 26 H 16 N 4 O 4) 2 (ClO 4) 2 ]·4CHCl 3 } n, (I), was obtained. The asymmetric unit contains one Cd 2+ cation, two DPMNI ligands, two coordinated ClO 4 - anions and four CHCl 3 solvent molecules. Each Cd 2+ cation is interconnected by four DPMNI linkers to generate a neutral two-dimensional naphthalenediimide coordination network with all the ClO 4 - anions above or below this plane. Strong interlaminar anion-π interactions between the coordinated ClO 4 - anions and the imide rings of an adjacent layer lead to a three-dimensional supramolecular structure. Compound (I) exhibits reversible photochromic behaviour and photocontrolled tunable luminescence properties, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the DPMNI ligand. © International Union of Crystallography 2018.","49","Cadmium compounds","Chlorine compounds - Crystal structure - Electron transitions - Free radical reactions - Inorganic compounds - Ligands - Luminescence - Naphthalene - Negative ions - Organic polymers - Photochromism - Positive ions","Coordination networks - Coordination Polymers - naphthalenediimide - Photo-induced electron transfer - Photochromic behaviour - Photochromic properties - Supramolecular structure - Tunable luminescences","741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","For this research was provided by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (award No. 51764048); Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

By studying the different numbers of mismatches in the linker sequences, we found that the presence of a single-nucleotide mismatch in the linker increases fluorescence more than the complementary nucleotide. Further study indicated the mismatch position of the linker sequence also affects the fluorescence of the hybridized DNA-Ag NCs. The evidence reported here indicated that the mismatch of the linker sequence affects the fluorescence enhancement of guanine-enhanced silver nanoclusters. We also found that DNA-Ag NCs is an excellent fluorescence sensor for cyanide, as cyanide effectively quenches the fluorescence of NCs at a very low concentration with high selectivity.

The environmental factors such as temperature-humidity and soil humidity are the key influencing factors on crop growth, therefore, how to rapidly and accurately acquire the environmental information of crop growth and learn about their real-time growing environment is of vital importance. The wireless sensor networks (WSN) can make real-time environmental information acquisition as well as communication and processing of network environmental data. Based on this, the RSSI range-based positioning method was optimized in this paper in order to greatly improve its precision. To be specific, in this study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was firstly applied in the hybrid mutation strategy to make more accurate node positioning and significantly improve the evolutionary performance by enlarging the hunting zone; besides, through the use of WSN, the influencing parameters on crop growth such as soil humidity, and temperaturehumidity etc. would be monitored; finally, to realize the precise location and derive the unseeded nodes, GPS was applied for accurate positioning, and the intelligence algorithm was adopted to determine the coordinate position of unknown nodes. At last, the actual field test indicates that the designed monitoring system in this paper satisfies the requirements for precise measurement, playing a positive role in promoting the development of precision agriculture. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.","20","Precision agriculture","Crops - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Seed - Sensor nodes - Wireless sensor networks - Zigbee","Agricultural development - Environmental information - Influencing parameters - Intelligence algorithms - Key influencing factors - Particle swarm optimization algorithm - Unseeded system - ZigBee technology","722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Most models describing its evolution suggest that the modern Jinsha River, draining the Tibetan Plateau margin, was once a tributary to a single, southward river system called 'Paleo-Red River', which drained into the South China Sea and then its flow direction changed to east to join the Yangtze River due to river capture. The Red River submarine fan, considered to have been primarily fed by the Paleo-Red River system, suddenly disappeared at 5.5 Ma provides an important chronological constraint on this reorganization of drainage lines and reversal event. However, no geomorphic evidence has been found to agree with this hypothesized timeframe. Here, we present electron spin resonance (ESR) ages from eight terraces preserved in the Jinjiangjie reach of the Jinsha River together with their GPS altimetry data. Their ages from old to young are 1.07 Ma, 0.70 Ma, 0.65 Ma, 0.51 Ma, 0.47 Ma, 0.44 Ma, 0.30 Ma and 0.18 Ma, with a calculated average river incision rate of 147 mm/ka since 1.0 Ma. The paleo-topography, reconstructed by filling the deeply incised river gorges with digital elevation model (DEM) data, shows that the upper reach of the Paleo-Red River was captured by the Yangtze River and changed its flow direction eastward at the time of disruption of the 2000 m asl paleo-topographic surface in the Jinsha River drainage basin. The age of the paleo-topographic surface formation would be approximately 5.5 Ma using the average river incision rate extrapolation, suggesting that the present Jinsha River system was born after 5.5 Ma. This data support the chronological constraint from the Red River submarine fan, and hypothesized evolution of the Jinsha River. © 2018, Science Press.

Herein, we proposed simple and intelligent ROS-responsive zinc phthalocyanine sensitized TiO2nanoparticles which conjugated with chlorambucil (CBL) (mTiO2-BCBL@ZnPC NPs) in an attempt to solve these issues. Not only were the nanoparticles triggered in near infrared radiation (NIR) for PDT with various reactive oxygen species (ROS) being generated, but the nanoparticles also realized the controllable release of CBL by H2O2, a major kind of ROS, through cleavage of the phenylboronic ester between CBL and the nanoparticle. Impressively, the controllable release of CBL under NIR irradiation showed an on-off characteristic and time dependency. In addition, the well-defined mTiO2-BCBL@ZnPC NPs with a 30 nm average diameter showed good stability and biocompatibility. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the mTiO2-BCBL@ZnPC NPs were more cytotoxic under NIR irradiation than the mTiO2@ZnPC NPs and CBL, while the mTiO2-BCBL@ZnPC NPs were less cytotoxic under dark conditions. The above results implied that photo-controlled drug release is a promising choice for cancer therapy due to its high selectivity, good safety and low side-effects, and would be expected to be used in chemo-photodynamic combined therapy for improving the therapeutic efficiency. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","53","Controlled drug delivery","Biocompatibility - Chemotherapy - Cytotoxicity - Diseases - Efficiency - Image enhancement - Infrared devices - Infrared radiation - Irradiation - Light sources - Nanoparticles - Oxygen - Photodynamic therapy - Targeted drug delivery - Titanium dioxide - Zinc compounds","Controllable release - Controlled drug release - Near-infrared radiations - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) - Reactive oxygen species - Therapeutic efficiency - TiO2 nano-particles - Zinc phthalocyanines","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects; Number: 81673369/H3008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 201604020157, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 81673369/H3008) and Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (grant number: 201604020157).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Taking a continuous rigid frame bridge located in Yunnan, China as an example, this paper establishes the finite element calculation model of the bridge to analyze the stress inhomogeneity in the construction stage. The results show that the shear lag coefficient of the section is constantly changing during the dynamic process of construction, with the increase of the length of the cantilever, the shear lag coefficient gradually converges to 1; prestress is the most important factor that causes the lateral inhomogeneity of the positive stress. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2018.","6","Bridges","Environmental engineering - Fiber optic sensors - Internet of things - Rigidity","Bridge structures - Construction stages - Continuous rigid frame bridges - Dynamic process - Inhomogeneities - Inhomogeneous distribution - Lateral inhomogeneity - Positive stress","401.1 Bridges - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 951 Materials Science",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The tree seedling community in an old-growth subtropical forest was monitored using 500 2 m × 2 m seedling plots at six-month intervals for 2 years. With a focus on recruitment following canopy damage, we related abiotic and biotic environmental variables to seedling dynamics, and we tested if significant topographic and light habitat associations were present for seedlings recruiting via a torus translation test. Then, we used variance partitioning to examine the relative effects of spatial, topographic and light variables on the temporal assemblages of seedlings. A total of 3047 seedlings from 58 species recruited in the first 2 years following snow damage. At the community level, increases in seedling abundance and richness were positively correlated with canopy openness and negatively correlated with elevation. At the species level, both pioneer and late-successional tree species had more recruits in high light environment than in low light environment. 84.3% of the recruiting seedlings were significantly associated to either light environment (35.7%), topography (26.5%) or both (22.1%). Despite this, at the plot level, spatial variables (PCNM) explained the majority of the variability in seedling composition over time. Our results suggest that snow damage to the canopy increases species richness and abundance via light-facilitated seedling recruitment, and that the composition of recruiting seedlings was largely spatially dependent. Topographic habitat filtering acts as a persistent force in determining the recruitment of seedlings and increases in strength with increased light-facilitated seedling recruitment. Our results highlight that, in this subtropical forest, both light requirement and topographic specialization interact over time to play a key role in promoting coexistence of tree species through selection of individuals at the seedling stage. We also suggest exploring the possibilities of management intervention to speed up the recovery of this forest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","85","Reforestation","Ecosystems - Light - Plants (botany) - Snow - Topography - Tropics","Disturbance - Environmental variables - Forest gap - Habitat associations - Management interventions - Regeneration - Seedling dynamics, topography, environmental filtering, Ailaoshan - Seedling recruitment","443 Meteorology - 443.3 Precipitation - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 741.1 Light/Optics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2014GA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: Y4ZK111B01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2017XTBG-T01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: GJHZ201317, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB954100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31400362, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31570430, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31670442, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China ( 2014CB954100 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31670442 , 31400362 and 31570430 ), the West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Externa1 Cooperation Program of BIC , Chinese Academy of Sciences ( GJHZ201317 ), Applied Fundamental Research Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2014GA003 ), Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, CAS ( Y4ZK111B01 ) and the CAS 135 program (No. 2017XTBG-T01 ).

In order to classify sentences more effectively, we propose a hybrid L-MCNN model to represent the semantics of sentences, and this model consists of two parts, bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) and multichannel convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Different from the existing methods, our model utilizes the bidirectional LSTM to acquire the max contextual information of every position in sentences, and then the abstract semantics would be fed into the multichannel convolution layer which uses several filters to extract active local n-gram features. By combining the advantages of both architectures, the L-MCNN model can capture both long-distance dependencies and local information within sentences to improve the classification performance.

Moreover, the influence of different drying air temperatures on the dryer performance, the drying characteristic and the drying kinetics of mango slices in this dryer have been investigated. The experimental results showed that the temperatures at four different locations of the drying chamber were varied within a narrow band. Meanwhile, the average thermal efficiency of IFCSD was between 30.9% and 33.8%, the specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) was 1.67 (kg water/kWh) with the drying temperature of 52 °C. In addition, results revealed that the Page's model was the most appropriate for describing the drying kinetics of mango slices in IFCSD. The effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) values of mango slices were obtained from the Fick's diffusion equation varying from 6.41 × 10−11to 1.18 × 10−10m2/s, over the temperature range of 40–52 °C. Furthermore, results revealed that Deffvalues increased with the increasing of drying air temperatures, due to the increase of heating energy would increase the activity of water molecules of mango slices.

PA-44 (VPR), mesophilic Engyodontium album (Tritirachium album) (PRK), and thermophilic Thermus aquaticus (AQN) using multiple-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with continuum electrostatics calculations. The results reveal that although salt bridges are not a crucial factor in determining the overall thermostability of these three proteases, they on average provide the greatest, moderate, and least electrostatic stabilization to AQN, PRK, and VPR, respectively, at the respective organism growth temperatures. Most salt bridges in AQN are effectively stabilizing and thus contribute to maintaining the overall structural stability at 343 K, while nearly half of the salt bridges in VPR interconvert between being stabilizing and being destabilizing, likely aiding in enhancing the local conformational flexibility at 283 K. The individual salt bridges, salt-bridge networks, and calcium ions contribute differentially to local stability and flexibility of these three enzyme structures, depending on their spatial distributions and electrostatic strengths. The shared negatively charged surface potential at the active center of the three enzymes may provide the active-center flexibility necessary for nucleophilic attack and proton transfer. The differences in distributions of the electro-negative, electro-positive, and electro-neutral potentials, particularly over the back surfaces of the three proteases, may modulate/affect not only protein solubility and thermostability but also structural stability and flexibility/rigidity. These results demonstrate that electrostatics contributes to both heat and cold adaptation of subtilisin-like serine proteases through fine-tuning, either globally or locally, the structural stability and conformational flexibility/rigidity, thus providing a foundation for further engineering and mutagenesis studies. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","74","Stability","Amino acids - Chemical bonds - Dissociation - Electrostatics - Enzymes - Molecular dynamics","Comparative studies - Conformational flexibility - Electrostatic stabilization - Molecular dynamics simulations - Negatively charged surfaces - Nucleophilic attack - Protein solubility - Structural stabilities","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 31370715, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013CB127500, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: XT412003, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","We thank anonymous reviewers for their careful reading and constructive comments, which helped us to improve the manuscript.

However, the mechanisms underlying its antioxidant functions in cells are not fully understood. In the present study, the effects of astaxanthin on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant enzyme activity, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), were examined. It was shown that astaxanthin (0.1, 1, and 10 μM) induced ROS production by 9.35%, 14.8%, and 18.06% compared to control, respectively, in HUVECs. In addition, astaxanthin increased the mRNA levels of phase II enzymes HO-1 and also promoted GSH-Px enzyme activity. Furthermore, we observed ERK phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Nrf-2, and activation of antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity upon astaxanthin treatment. Knockdown of Nrf-2 by small interfering RNA inhibited HO-1 mRNA expression by 60%, indicating that the Nrf-2/ARE signaling pathway is activated by astaxanthin. Our results suggest that astaxanthin activates the Nrf-2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway by generating small amounts of ROS. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","39","Endothelial cells","Antioxidants - Cytology - Enzyme activity - Nucleic acids","Antioxidant response elements - Astaxanthin - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells - Mitogen activated protein kinase - Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway - Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - Reactive oxygen species","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 201505033-2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018KY726, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018KY710, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017C110026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017C10020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 151, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016C02055-6B, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CARS-50, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Agriculture Research System of China; Number: LY18C190004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; ","*Tel: +86-574-87609574.

The influence of preparation conditions on the formation of α-Bi2O3photocatalyst was investigated, and the effect of catalyst dosage and pH value on the EE2 removal rate was also investigated. The synthesized porous platelet-shaped α-Bi2O3photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and 97.8% of EE2 was removed after 75 min of visible light irradiation using α-Bi2O3as photocatalyst. The reaction rate constant over the porous platelet-shaped α-Bi2O3photocatalyst was 11.6 and 11.4 times of that of traditional α-Bi2O3and N-TiO2, respectively. The possible photocatalytic mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the theoretical calculation and the experimental results.
