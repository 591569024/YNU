Accurate and timely acquisition of spatial distribution information of plastic greenhouse is of great significance to agricultural production and soil management. The use of plastic greenhouse has changed the structure of soil, thus changing the surface spectral characteristics of the soil. Because of the particularity of the plastic film material, the reflection spectrum has strong directionality and uncertainty, so it is difficult to identify plastic greenhouse accurately only depending on the reflectance spectrum characteristics of ground objects. In this paper, Kunming City, Yunnan Province is taken as the research area, using GF-2 image as a single data source, the multi-scale segmentation method is used to obtain the image object efficiently and accurately. According to the detailed spatial information of plastic greenhouse, the applicability of three image object-based texture extraction algorithms, namely GLCM(gray-level co-occurrence matrix), LBP(local binary pattern) and PSI(pixel shape index) for plastic greenhouse identification is analysed and tested. In addition, different texture features are combined with spectral features and NDVI index to form different classification schemes, to explore which one would be the best combination of texture features for identification of plastic greenhouses. In order to explore the robustness of the method, different texture feature combination schemes are applied in the study areas. The results of SVM (support vector machine) classifier are evaluated by confusion matrix. The results show that the overall combination schemes of the two research areas with different landscape patterns have the same trend. The combination of spectral features and NDVI index can accurately identify the scattered waters in each of the two study areas. For plastic greenhouses and impervious surfaces with similar reflectance spectra, adding texture features can make up for limitation of spectral characteristics and improve the overall accuracy. The phenomena of homologous or homologous spectra in spectral features of high spatial resolution image can effectively improve the discrimination between plastic greenhouse and impervious surface. Texture features can significantly improve the identification accuracy of plastic greenhouse following the object-based image classification frame. In the classification scheme of plastic greenhouses with different spatial distribution structures, the LBP (local binary pattern) texture algorithm has the best recognition accuracy, the overall accuracy of study area A is 96.85%, Kappa coefficient is 0.95, and that of study area B is 95.58% and 0.94. Landscape fragment analysis (landscape fragmentation index area mean index, aggregation indices) of the two different study areas showed that the plastic greenhouses in study area A are more fragmented than study area B (area mean indices are 3.39 hm² and 1.37 hm², aggregation indices are 80.64 and 72.98 for plastic greenhouses in study area A and B, respectively). The results of fragmentation are consistent with those of classification, and the accuracy of landscape classification with more space fragments is lower (the highest overall classification accuracy for study area A and B are 98.13% and 96.13%, respectively, the PA(producer accuracy) and UA(user accuracy) are 96.47% and 97.93% for study area A, and 90.67%, 99.68% for study area B). The results show that texture features based on image objects can improve the recognition accuracy of small-scale plastic greenhouse. This is of great significance to the accurate mapping of the distribution of plastic greenhouses. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Hence, it is very important and necessary to settle the air and water instability of 2D materials. 2D heterostructures, assembly combined with bare 2D materials, which have shown outstanding properties due to their synergistic effect. In this work, the bare BP and Ti3C2 were prepared and then combined into a 2D BP/Ti3C2 heterostructure. The stabilities of bare BP, Ti3C2 and BP/Ti3C2 heterostructure were evaluated by the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra, XPS and optical microscopy. To our surprise, the stability of the 2D BP/Ti3C2 heterostructure was superior to that of the bare BP and Ti3C2. The reason why 2D BP/Ti3C2 heterostructure has excellent stability was that it formed P-O-Ti bonds between BP and Ti3C2. Because of its excellent air and water stability, the 2D BP/Ti3C2 heterostructure can be used in many fields such as photocatalytic, field-effect transistor and energy storage. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","56","Titanium compounds","Chemical stability - Energy storage - Field effect transistors","Application prospect - Exposed to - Photo-catalytic - Synergistic effect - Two Dimensional (2 D) - Ultraviolet-visible spectra - Water stability","525.7 Energy Storage - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 801 Chemistry",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Hence, a new magnetic adsorbent (Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4) was synthesized by modifying nickel-iron oxide nanoparticles with tannic to selectively adsorb Pb(II) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity of Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 for Pb(II) was investigated by batch experiment. The effects of pH, time, initial concentration and temperature on the sorption capacity were studied. The regenerated experiments and adsorption mechanisms have been also discussed. pH4 is the best condition for the adsorption experiment. The adsorption reaches equilibrium in 200 min and the maximum adsorption capacity is 139.8 mg/g. After five repetitive experiments, the adsorption capacity was reduced only from 70% to 61.5%. In addition, the entire adsorption process is based on monolayer chemisorptions because it conforms to the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. The thermodynamic data revealed that the adsorption is a spontaneous endothermic process. After 5 cycles, Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 still maintained a good adsorption capacity. Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 was successfully applied for selective adsorption of Pb(II) from wastewater with various metal ions. The uptake of Pb(II) by Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 mainly followed ion exchange and chelation mechanism. Therefore, Tannic-Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 is a perfectly valid and useful adsorbent for the elimination of Pb(II) pollution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","46","Lead compounds","Adsorbents - Adsorption - Flavonoids - Ion exchange - Iron oxides - Mechanisms - Metal ions - Metal nanoparticles - Metals - Models - Monolayers - Nanomagnetics - Nickel oxide - Pollution - Synthesis (chemical) - Wastewater","Adsorption capacities - Adsorption experiment - Adsorption mechanism - Endothermic process - Initial concentration - Magnetic - Pseudo second order - Selective adsorption","452.3 Industrial Wastes - 531.1 Metallurgy - 601.3 Mechanisms - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 51664037, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51704137 , 51664037 and U1702252 ).

It is shown that the positive feedback formed between p53 and the activity of Mdm2 in the cytoplasm can cause a slight decrease in the amplitude of the p53 oscillation. The length of the time delay plays an important role in determining the amplitude and period of the oscillation and can significantly extend the parameter range for the system to demonstrate oscillatory behaviour.

Understanding urban expansion at a watershed scale including cities of different sizes is important for improving our current knowledge of the urban extent and its impact on the hydrological cycle, water management, surface energy balances, and biodiversity. Impervious surface area (ISA) can be used as a synthesized quantifiable index to reflect the intensity of natural ecosystems changing into urban ecosystems. It is important to understand ISA patterns and characteristics, which requires long-term impervious surface data at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Previous methods of ISA estimation mainly focused on the spectral differences between ISA and other land covers, and most studies were inclined to use one or a few images without fully considering the long time series of the temporal domain of the reflective data on remote-sensing images. This assessed the Dianchi Lake watershed as a case study area to illustrate ISA change characteristics in the context of natural and cultural conditions. Firstly, more than two hundred Landsat images (from 1988 to 2017) were downloaded through the United States Geological Survey (USGS) online portal. Secondly, the improved normalized difference build-up index (INDBI) and linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) algorithm were combined to apply the method to a series of ISA maps of the Dianchi Lake watershed at an annual resolution. Thirdly, ISA extent characteristics of the Dianchi Lake watershed were analysed from trend and pattern aspects. The results show that the proposed method was highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change, with an extracted ISA accuracy of 92.51%, based on a sample of independent validation points. The Dianchi Lake watershed has begun to adopt ‘Rashly Advancing’ and ‘Great Leap Forward’ strategies of urbanization. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","32","Time series analysis","Biodiversity - Ecosystems - Lakes - Remote sensing - Water management - Watersheds","Hydrological cycles - Impervious surface area - Linear spectral mixture analysis - Normalized differences - Remote sensing images - Spatial and temporal resolutions - Spectral differences - United states geological surveys",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National High-tech Research and Development Program; Number: 41761084, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41761084], The National High Technology Research and Development Program from China [2012AA121402], and Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China [2016FD020]",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Under low magnetic fields, the consecutive occurrences of a spin-reorientation transition (SRT)and a magnetoelastic transition from ferrimagnetic (FRI)state to antiferromagnetic (AFM)state appear in c-axis, while these two transitions occur separately in a-axis. Such behavior can be ascribed to the asynchronous spin reorientation, which is resulted from the competition between the Zeeman energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. More interestingly, the anisotropic magnetostrictions associated with the field-induced metamagnetic magnetoelastic transition have been observed. In the process of cooling, the maximum reversible values of ∼0.230% and ∼−0.125% are obtained at 165 K along c- and a-axes, respectively, for the application of cyclic magnetic fields up to 30 kOe. These values are consistent with those estimated by the difference in thermal expansion curves near the transition region. Moreover, it can be also found that the metamagnetic magnetoelastic transition shows either a narrow hysteresis (∼6 K)and a strong sensitivity to the magnetic field (∼−0.5 K/kOe). Therefore, the high reversible magnetostriction is spread over a wide temperature range for the studied sample.

The challenge is due to fewer variations in rubber defoliation of rubber canopy. We examined the relationship between colour indices calculated from digital camera images and gross primary production (GPP) obtained from daily flux tower observations of carbon dioxide over two years in a rubber plantation and used these colour indices to model GPP. According to the results, (1) the strength of green (Sgreen), Hue and GPP exhibited clear seasonal patterns in the rubber plantation, and the relationship between the camera-based indices and GPP appeared to have distinct characteristics at different phenological stages; (2) the peak GPP from the flux tower measurements lagged behind the peak in the colour indices calculated from digital camera imagery; (3) GPP was strongly correlated with Sgreen derived from camera imagery in the rubber plantation, especially in the leaf expansion period; and (4) the GPP simulated by colour indices (Sgreen and Hue) was underestimated, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) was the best parameter for modelling GPP in normal years.

The pharmaceutical wastewater was characterized by a high organic concentration (total organic carbon (TOC) of 13,475 mg/L) and high acute toxicity (100% inhibition of the luminescent bacterial Vibrio fischeri). After 6 h treatment, ∼23% and 43% of TOC could be removed from the pharmaceutical wastewater by individual ozonation and the 3D electrolysis process using granular activated carbon (GAC) as the particle electrodes, respectively. However, the acute toxicity of the wastewater was hardly reduced by the two individual processes. In comparison, by sparging the ozone generator effluent (oxygen and ozone gas mixture) in the three-dimensional electrode reactor, the 3D/O3 process considerably enhanced TOC abatement to ∼71% and reduced the inhibition of the luminescent bacterial to [rad]OH) production in the 3D/O3 process via several reaction mechanisms, e.g., the reaction of sparged O3 with in situ generated H2O2, the electrochemical reduction of O3, and GAC catalyzed O3 decomposition, which in turn enhanced the oxidation of organics in the bulk and those adsorbed onto the GAC particle electrodes. The results of this study indicate that there exists a synergistic effect between 3D electrochemical process and ozonation for the degradation of toxic organics in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

The rapid economic growth in South Asia has contributed additional stress on the atmospheric environment in the surrounding regions. Earlier ice core chemical studies revealed a strong atmospheric transport to the Himalayan region from South Asia through the Indian summer monsoon. Continuous observation of atmosphere chemistry is not yet available, while ice core chemical record from high mountain regions can serve as an alternative proxy. So far, the influence of these transports on the southern Tibetan Plateau has not been adequately evaluated as only a few glaciochemical records are rebuilt. Here, we present a chemical record from a shallow ice core (with depth of 21.4 m), which was retrieved from the Qiangyong Glacier in the rain-shadow area of the Himalayas drilled in 2009and dated back to the past 23 years of 1987–2009. The primary objective was to retrieve glaciochemical record and establish possible sources of soluble components, in particular those of NH4+. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the eight major ions series (Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, NH4+, K+, Cl−, NO3−, SO42−) from this core reveals that NH4+ is loaded primarily separately on EOF3, likely suggesting a specific source out of the other ion signals. Both a back-trajectory model and the correlation analysis between NH4+ and SO42− indicate the anthropogenic origin from South Asia. Although earlier ice core records showed a curbed increasing trend in NH4+, our new data reveals that the increasing trend continued after 1980 and experienced a rapid increase after 2000. This trend is in accordance with the increasing population and agriculture activities in South Asia, corresponding with increasing anthropogenic emission. Spatial comparison of the Qiangyong ice core record with existing NH4+ records from other ice cores in the Tibetan Plateau show that concentrations of NH4+ are regionally increasing. However, the relatively small rise in Qiangyong record is probably in association with the effective transportation barrier of the Himalayas. This study advances the knowledge of atmospheric environmental change in the northern Himalayas and the air mass transport of anthropogenic pollutants from South Asia to the southern Tibetan Plateau via the summer Indian monsoon. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","73","Ice","Atmospheric chemistry - Atmospheric movements - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Climate change - Economics - Forestry - Orthogonal functions","Ammonium - Glaciochemical records - Ice core - South Asia - Tibetan Plateau","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 921 Mathematics - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 41530748, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41771043, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was partially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41530748, 41771043).

The stability of Cu-EG nanofluids for different ultrasonic times (ranging from 0 to 75 min) is tested. The effect of temperature on viscosity is also investigated for an optimum ultrasonic time. However, effects of ultrasonic time, size of aggregates and temperature on viscosity variation have not yet been studied in detail. The results show that, with the increase in ultrasonic time, the viscosity of Cu-ethylene glycol (EG) nanofluids firstly decreases up to an optimum time, after which, it increases gradually. The viscosity always decreases with the increase in temperature. Furthermore, higher mass fraction results in shorter ultrasonic time. An optimum ultrasonic time at which the viscosity is the lowest is determined. With the increase in ultrasonic time and temperature, the Brownian motion intensifies and big clusters (aggregates of nanoparticles) are broken up. Smaller clusters cause low flow resistance in nanofluids, thereby resulting in low viscosity. However, excess ultrasonic energy coalesces them to again form larger clusters due to high surface energy. Finally, a regression correlation for viscosity as a function of temperature and mass fraction is presented based on the experimental data. © 2018","39","Nanofluidics","Aggregates - Brownian movement - Convergence of numerical methods - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Nanoparticles - Polyols - Viscosity","Cu nano-particles - Effect of temperature - High surface energy - Mass fraction - Nanofluids - Solid concentrations - Ultrasonic energy - Viscosity variations","406 Highway Engineering - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: No: 2016YFB0600201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD035, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51666006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This project is financially supported by the Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (Grant No: 2016FD035 ), the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No: 2016YFB0600201 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 51666006 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Energy-saving and emission-reduction policies have been proposed in the government's Five-Year Plans (FYPs) to achieve sustainable development. Yunnan (YN) province, which is in its economic infancy, is facing industrial structure adjustment and is a typical case of severe environmental degradation. In this study, a decoupling analysis was conducted to explore the performances of economic growth and environmental pressure during the period from 2006 to 2016. The author of this paper made an innovative use of the pollutant discharge fee (PDF) as the measure of environmental pressure and Gross domestic product (GDP) as the measure of economic growth. The trend analysis and decoupling analysis revealed that although YN has already transformed from a weak decoupling to a strong decoupling state in the long term, stable and strong decoupling cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there was consistency between the decoupling conditions and the FYP cycle, all of which indicated that there was a shift from the target emissions to non-target emissions during the 11th (2006–2010) and 12th (2011–2015) FYPs. Thus, a single index for evaluating pollutant emissions cannot be adopted effectively to achieve adequate pollutant emission reduction. In addition, three industrial structures were considered in the decoupling analysis, which indicated that the tertiary industry will be a new key area for emission reduction, and the emissions of secondary industries have also been reduced. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","45","Industrial economics","Emission control - Energy conservation - Sustainable development","Decoupling analysis - Emission reduction - Gross domestic products - Industrial structures - Pollutant discharges","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 911.2 Industrial Economics","Number: 2016FD059, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: KKSY201508012, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: KKSY201408044, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 20172ZX160, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2015Z118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 71463034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71263030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51504217, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51464044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71463034 , Project No. 71263030 , Project No. 51464044 , Project No. 51504217 ), the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (Project No. 2015Z118 , Project No. 20172ZX160 ), the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (Project No. 2016FD059 ), and Kunming University of Science and Technology (Project No. KKSY201408044 , Project No. KKSY201508012 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Understanding the water-quality trend and characteristics is the basis of area protection for Fuxian Lake. This study combines of the Mann-Kendall, Mann-Kendall-Sneyers, water pollution index (WPI), the trophic state index and time series analysis to detect and characterize the water quality with a set of indicators: transparency (SD), permanganate index (IMn), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and chlorophyll-a (Chl.a). Then, the characteristics are discussed on the scales of long-period, sections divided by the change point, and monthly data. Results show that the water quality of Fuxian Lake is at a good level but decreases consistently. Especially, the increasing trends of IMn, BOD5, and Chl.a pass the confidence limit of the Z value of 2.56. The year of 2007 was designated as the change point. The characteristics of pollution and typical components vary in the long-period series, between the two sections divided by the change point, and in the monthly data. In the long period, the TN and TP are typical pollution components. However, the IMn, BOD5, and Chl.a are typical components as the large changes of a 99.1% and 89.5% increase after the change point with respect to the former values, respectively. On the scale of monthly data of a typical year, the pollution grade and components varies within the years. The multidimensional synthesis methodology established by employing evaluation index systems from the aspects of pollution level, multi-attributes and the trophic state status could also be applied to detect and characterize the water quality of other water bodies.

However, little is known about their soil hydrological functioning associated with infiltration and water flow behaviour which affects surface runoff, soil erosion, and groundwater recharge. In order to clarify whether the intercrop can promote soil water infiltrability and water movement in rubber-based agroforestry system, 66 field infiltration and 2 dye tracer experiments were performed in this study on undisturbed soil in a rubber-tea agroforestry system in Xishuangbanna, SW China. The results showed that the field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) exhibited a high spatial heterogeneity. The Ks, initial infiltration rate (IIR), and actual steady-state infiltration rate (Is) were significantly higher in the tea tree planting zone (TT) than in the rubber tree planting zone (RT). The Ks decreased with distance from the trunks of tea trees, and the Ks between rubber trees in a row was lower than that between rubber rows. Along with improved soil physical properties, increased root and faunal activities, and more inhomogeneous cracks and stones, there was higher soil water infiltrability and more preferential flow in the TT than in the RT. Therefore, tea shrubs in rubber agroforestry systems may function as water harvesters, contributing to deeper drainage and recharge. In contrast, the rubber trees function as water consumers, causing soil desiccation and water scarcity. Differences in the soil hydraulic properties among different zones in a rubber-tea agroforestry system can lead to the spatial redistribution of surface and belowground water, increasing water availability for various plants with different root systems. Better infiltration and increased preferential flow beneath tea trees potentially reduce runoff generation and erosion risk, promote groundwater recharge, and increase water storage that may counteract the interception and transpiration losses from intercrops and rubber trees, thereby contributing to the management of water resources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","75","Infiltration","Ecosystems - Erosion - Groundwater flow - Groundwater resources - Land use - Recharging (underground waters) - Reforestation - Rubber - Runoff - Soil conservation - Soil moisture - Water conservation - Water management - Water supply","Agroforestry system - Ground water recharge - Preferential flows - Saturated soil hydraulic conductivities - Soil hydraulic properties - Soil physical property - Steady-state infiltration - Watershed management","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 444 Water Resources - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 818.1 Natural Rubber","Number: 2014HB042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018430, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2018FB076, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31570622, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41701029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We deeply appreciate two anonymous reviewers for providing constructive comments towards the manuscript.

The concentration-discharge (C-Q) dynamics at short time-scales could be useful to disentangle the impacts of agricultural activities because it can provide more information about the interaction between N export and input. In this study, total dissolved N (TDN) concentrations/fluxes-discharge dynamics across different time-scales (annual, daily and hourly) were used to investigate the potential influences of agricultural activities and the interaction with hydrologic variables. At the long-term scale, streamflow and instream TDN concentrations exhibited the same inter-annual variations. At daily scale, higher temporal variations of streamflow (compared to instream TDN concentrations) occurred during stormflow-dominated periods. It highlighted the importance that stormflow may have substantial impact over N concentration changes over time. At the smaller time scale, direct influence of fertilizer application on watershed N export was unraveled by the difference in stream TDN concentrations and export fluxes between the early growing period (with more fertilizer application) and the later period (with less). In addition, the differences may increase with increasing flow conditions, which indicated that the impact of agricultural activities could be affected by hydrologic variables.

The main feature structures of the microreactor include inlet, droplet sieve plate, mixing channel, mixed liquid gathering chamber and mixed liquid outlet. The microreactor was used for the extraction and separation of In3+ and Fe3+ from sulfuric acid solution under different initial conditions. The results showed that the extraction rate of In3+ reduced at first and then rose with the increase of the contact time of two phases.

Based on the cogeneration of high-value nitrogen products from biomass, biomass nitrogen-enriched pyrolysis was performed in a fixed bed with different sources and contents of ammonia. The yields, composition and characteristics of the products were investigated. Moreover, the formation mechanism of N-containing species was explored in depth for the pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis with HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts via elemental analysis, XPS, FTIR and BET. The results showed that ammonia impregnation could promote a Maillard reaction, reduce the content of small aldehydes and ketones, and produce a nitrogen-enriched bio-oil. The contents of N-containing species and phenolic substances in the pyrolysis oil of biomass impregnated with 10% urea reached 15.66% and 56.69%, respectively. Moreover, the nitrogen on the coke surface after pretreatment was mainly composed of C[dbnd]N, C[sbnd]N and N[sbnd]COO functional groups. The bio-char generated abundant pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N oxides. The presence of urea introduced many alkaline N-containing functional groups on the surface of the bio-char and promoted the transformation of nitrogen from amides and imides to heterocyclic nitrogen with higher thermal stability. Furthermore, Zn was an excellent catalyst for the Maillard reaction, and the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst had a higher selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons (96.98% for biomass and 86.48% for urea/biomass) and N-containing heterocyclic compounds, such as indoles (6.16% for biomass and 13.51% for urea/biomass).

The re-caching of seeds by rodents is considered a mechanism of long-distance seed dispersal. The effect of re-caching on dispersal distance is well studied. However, how re-caching by rodents affects seedling establishment remains unclear. To assess the role of re-caching by rodents on seedling establishment, we tracked a large number of seeds and investigated the seed dispersal and seedling establishment of two large-seeded tree species (Scleropyrum wallichianum and Garcinia xanthochymus) in a tropical forest. We found that rodents scatter hoarded 48.9–71.3% of the released seeds, and a total of 23.8–36.6% of the initial caches of both species experienced re-caching up to 2 or 3 times. Re-caching was correlated with farther dispersal and a higher probability of seedling establishment for both species. In addition, re-caching contributed to medium and long-distance seed dispersal, with 17.2% and 18.5% of seedlings located >50 m from parent trees for G. xanthochymus and S. wallichianum, respectively, and 3.4% of seedlings of G. xanthochymus located >100 m from parent trees.

A numerical method for performing reliability analysis of rock slope is proposed by combining the plastic limit analysis theory, rigid finite element discretization, mathematical programming theory and Monte Carlo method. The rock slope is discretized into rock blocks and interfaces using rigid finite elements to establish static admissible stress fields and kinematically admissible velocity fields for the rock slope. Additionally, stochastic programming models for performing reliability analysis of rock slopes are established according to the lower and upper bound theorems by setting the shear strength parameters of the interfaces to random variables. A numerical solution strategy is then proposed for stochastic programming models based on the Monte Carlo method at the same time.

However, because tunnel structure differs from building structure significantly, there are some difficulties in establishing an elaborate three-dimensional model of tunnel structure using BIM software such as Revit, and the model is difficult to be reused. To address this problem, this work first proposes a BIM model decomposition scheme for mountain tunnel structure, which is decomposed into basic components and divided into basic units along the axis. The unit length determination principle was given according to the characteristics of the components, and according to whether this model could be reused, the basic units were divided into standard and special units. Second, the model was divided into three levels of detail (LOD100, LOD200, LOD300) to meet the needs of different design stages. The multiscale parametric modeling method of standard units was proposed to provide a basis for tunnel structure modeling. It laid the foundation for improving the efficiency of BIM model visualization management. Finally, this work proposes an adaptive splicing method for the basic units of the model. According to the mileage of the tunnel axis and its corresponding three-dimensional coordinates and design section type, the models of standard units for different lengths and special units are automatically spliced according to the discretized axis, thus forming a complete tunnel model. Based on the Laoying Tunnel of Baolu Expressway in Yunnan Province, this study uses Revit to establish the parametric models of standard units and the special units of the tunnel structure. Through the Unity3D software and the splicing program, the adaptive splicing and multiscale loading of the model units were realized, and the complete BIM model of Laoying Tunnel was formed. The multiscale parametric modeling and adaptive splicing method improves the reusability and modeling efficiency of the 3D model of the tunnel structure, and provides a reference for the application of BIM technology in mountain tunnel engineering. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The Lagrangian duality technique has been widely adopted to solve the cross-layer optimization problem, but it is slowly convergent and sensitive to the iterative step size, especially for large networks. In this paper, a joint congestion control and power allocation second-order algorithm (JCCPA) is proposed, in which the joint optimization problem is modeled as a network utility maximization (NUM) framework, and the primal-dual interior-point method is used to solve the NUM problem. The JCCPA updates the primal variables and dual variables simultaneously according to their Newton directions; as a result,resulting in a faster convergence speed is reached. Moreover, the matrix-splitting technology is utilized to decompose the computation of the Hessian matrix and its inverse into different nodes and links so that the distributed update of source rate and node power can be implemented. The simulation results demonstrate that the JCCPA not only significantly improves energy efficiency but also has a faster convergence speed and is insensitive to step size. © 2019 IEEE.","16","Energy efficiency","Ad hoc networks - Congestion control (communication) - Iterative methods - Matrix algebra - Optimization - Problem solving - Resource allocation","Cross layer optimization - Energy energy Efficiencyefficiency - Fast convergence - Network utility maximizations (NUM) - Power allocations - Primal-dual interior point methods - Resource allocation algorithms - Wireless multi-hop","525.2 Energy Conservation - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics","Number: 61671192, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: LY19F010011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61671192, in part by the Public Welfare Plan Project of Zhejiang Province under Grant LGG19F020014, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grants LY19F010011, and in part by the General Science Foundation of Zhejiang Educational Committee under Grant Y201533647.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based health service system, labeling a large number of medical data requires high cost and relevant domain knowledge. Therefore, how to use a small number of labeled medical data reasonably to build an efficient and high-quality clinical decision support model in the IoT-based platform has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach in association with generative adversarial networks (GANs) for supporting clinical decision making in the IoT-based health service system. In our approach, GAN is adopted to not only increase the number of labeled data but also to compensate the imbalanced labeled classes with additional artificial data in order to improve the semi-supervised learning performance.

Specially, the physiochemical characteristics of the NixCoy@C/ZrO2 particles have been analyzed, which verified the presence of Ni–Co alloy and its high homogeneity and dispersity.

It has been shown in many years of practice that the forecasting method is too simple and the timeliness of the analysis is not ideal. In this paper, the improved EW_CUSUM algorithm came into being. First, calculate the amount of expected data under different baseline windows according to the amount of historical data generated. Then, calculate the baseline level based on the expected data amount. Finally, add the prediction statistics under two baselines. The required forecasting statistics will be helpful to figure out the high incidence of the situations. This paper validates the effectiveness of this method in commodity sales forecasting by using this method. This method has successfully improved the ability of forecasting events, advanced the time of the forecast and enhanced the timeliness of forecasting. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","16","Forecasting","Intelligent mechatronics - Robotics - Sales","Baseline levels - CUSUM algorithms - Early prediction - Forecasting methods - Historical data - Model-based OPC - Sales forecasting - Timeliness","731.5 Robotics - 731.7 Mechatronix",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, numerical simulation of a three-dimensional bubbling fluidized gasifier is carried out via the multiphase particle-in-cell approach to explore the effect of particle size distribution (PSD) on the gas yield of biomass gasification process. The impacts of PSD width on the gas production, the mole fraction of gas species combined with the gas temperature are investigated. The results show that enlarging the PSD width increases the total gas yield, the mole concentration of combustible gases (CH4, CO and H2) and also the carbon conversion efficiency, demonstrating the promoting effect of PSD width on improving the gasification performance. Regarding the axial distribution, a large mole fraction of combustible gases can be observed for the system with large PSD width. Large mole fractions of combustible gases and O2 are mainly distributed in the dilute region and the dense region, respectively. The results obtained provide new insights regarding the effect of particle size distribution of the bed material on the gasification performance of the bubbling fluidized gasifier, which is useful for the design and operation of this apparatus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","50","Fluidized beds","Biomass - Bubble formation - Computer simulation - Fluidization - Fossil fuels - Gases - Gasification - Light transmission - Numerical models - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Polymer blends - Size distribution","Axial distribution - Biomass Gasification - Bubbling fluidized bed - Design and operations - Energy dependence - Particle in cell - Promoting effect - Renewable resource","631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 817.1 Polymer Products - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science","Number: U1602272, Acronym: NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: 51966007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan joint fund (Grant No. U1602272 )&nbsp;and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51966007 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to predict the TWSA derived from GRACE. We designed a case study in six regions in China (North China Plain (NCP), Southwest China (SWC), Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), Tianshan Mountains Region (TSMR), Heihe River Basin (HRB), and Lishui and Wenzhou area (LSWZ)) using GRACE RL06 data from January 2003 to August 2016 for inversion, which were compared with Center for Space Research (CSR), Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam-German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)’s Mascon (Mass Concentration) RL05, and JPL’s Mascon RL06. We evaluated the accuracy of SSA prediction on different temporal scales based on the correlation coefficient (R), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), which were compared with that of an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were predicted using SSA, which was verified using Mascon RL06, the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and GRACE-FO results. The results show that: (1) TWSA derived from GRACE agreed well with Mascon in most regions, with the highest consistency with Mascon RL06 and (2) prediction accuracy of GRACE in TRHR and SWC was higher. SSA reconstruction improved R, NSE, and RMSE compared with those of ARMA. The R values for predicting TWS in the six regions using the SSA method were 0.34–0.98, which was better than those for ARMA (0.26–0.97), and the RMSE values were 0.03–5.55 cm, which were better than the 2.29–5.11 cm RMSE for ARMA as a whole. (3) The SSA method produced better predictions for obvious periodic and trending characteristics in the TWSA in most regions, whereas the detailed signal could not be effectively predicted. (4) The predicted TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were basically consistent with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) results, and the predicted TWSA during June 2018 to May 2019 agreed well with GRACE-FO results. The research method in this paper provides a reference for bridging the gap in the TWSA between GRACE and GRACE-FO. © 2019 by the authors.

Scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction results showed that the products were amorphous SiO2 nanowires with diameters of 20∼100 nm and lengths of several tens of micrometers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the SiO2 nanowires retained small amounts of MgO and CaO from the silicate glass. The result of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the nanowires exhibited a strong, sharp photoluminescence (PL) emission peak, centered at 426 nm.

The deposited naphthalene particles migrating along with the current gas flow will inevitably result in pipe blockage or damage to devices. In order to study the migration law of the deposited naphthalene particles in gas line pipes, we took the urban gas pipeline in Kunming as an example, adopted the RSM turbulence model and the DPM model of the Fluent software to simulate and analyze the migration law of the deposited naphthalene particles in horizontal straight pipes, horizontal bend pipes and tee pipes. And the influence of the deposited naphthalene particle size, inlet velocity, temperature and pressure on the migration of deposited naphthalene particles under different pipe diameters, curvature ratios and pipe diameter ratios were analyzed respectively. The results show that: (1) The migration rates of deposited naphthalene particles in the above three types of pipes are negatively correlated with the size of the deposited naphthalene particles, and are positively correlated with pressure and inlet velocity; (2) With the increase of temperature, the migration rate of naphthalene particles in the above three types of pipes decreases first and then increases; (3) The migration rate of naphthalene particles deposited in gas line pipes is most affected by the inlet velocity of gas flow, then by temperature and least by pressure. (4) The migration rate of naphthalene particles is positively correlated with the ratio of horizontal straight pipe diameter and tee pipe diameter, and negatively correlated with the ratio of horizontal bend pipe diameter.

In this work, Zn-doped γ-Al2O3 supported Au nanoparticles was demonstrated as highly active and selective heterogeneous catalyst for a series of imine productions with good to excellent yields, from alcohols and amines via direct oxidative coupling under air atmosphere without extra base additives. Various physicochemical techniques, including ICP-MS, XRD, N2 physisorption, TEM, XPS and CO2-/NH3-TPD, were used to study the properties of the catalysts. Well-dispersed Au0 nanoparticles with a mean size of ca. 2.9 nm were found highly effective in activating alcohols in the presence of reactive amines. The amount of Zn2+ dopant and the calcination temperature of support during catalyst preparation showed crucial impact on tuning the intrinsic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (i.e., the rate-determining step for the model reaction), which was disclosed to be related with the active surface oxygen species and the acidic-basic property of support. The 0.4% Au/Zn0.02Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 400 °C exhibited the highest TOF (39.1 h−1) at 60 °C based on a >99% yield to benzylideneaniline among all the ever-reported Au-based catalysts.

It has sparse mineralization, complicated magmatic intrusions, no central alteration zonation and no typical ore-related porphyry. Therefore, 'where is the magmatic-hydrothermal-mineralized center of Bairong-Bairongxi∗ is becoming the key of further studies. To address this issue, based on detailed geological survey and drills records, combined with the observation of microscope, zircon U-Pb dating and molybdenite Re-()s dating analysis, we concluded the following points: (1 ) The Bairong-Bairongxi is not two separated ore districts but belongs to an united porphyry mineralization system; (2) The magmatic sequences include biotite monzonitic granite, monzonitic granite porphyry ( 13. 9 ±0. 2Ma) , granodiorite porphyry ( 13. 8 ±0. 2Ma) , dacite porphyry ( 12. 6 ±0. 4Ma) and lamprophyre (11. 1 ±0. 2Ma); (3) The Re-Os age of molybdenite is from 13. 35 ±0. 19Ma to 13. 82 ±0. 20Ma; (4) The magmatic-hydrothermal-mineralized center is in its central regions; (5) Most of drillings are located in the argillic alteration zone but deep drillings revealed medium-high temperature veinlets, indicating the alteration has its origin in the deep. As mentioned above, Bairong-Bairongxi is in the top of a Cu-Mo porphyry system with clear magmatic-hydrothermal-mineralized center, and has great potential in Cu-Mo mineralization in the deep.

After the discovery that PL centers occupy only specific morphological structures in CsPb2Br5, a two-step highly sensitive and noninvasive optical technique is employed to resolve the controversy. Same-spot Raman-PL as a static property–structure probe reveals that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are contributing to the green emission of CsPb2Br5; pressure-dependent Raman-PL with a diamond anvil cell as a dynamic probe further rules out point defects such as Br vacancies as an alternative mechanism. Optical absorption under hydrostatic pressure shows that the bandgap of CsPb2Br5 is 0.3–0.4 eV higher than previously reported values and remains nearly constant with pressure up to 2 GPa in good agreement with full-fledged density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using ion exchange of Br with Cl and I, it is further proved that CsPbBr3−x Xx (X = Cl or I) is responsible for the strong visible PL in CsPb2Br5−x Xx. This experimental approach is applicable to all PL-active materials to distinguish intrinsic defects from extrinsic nanocrystals, and the findings pave the way for new design and development of highly efficient optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halides. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, ray-tracing analysis is time-consuming especially as one investigates effects of the CPC's geometry on the performance of CPC based solar systems. In this article, an attempt is first made to develop a mathematical procedure to predict the optical efficiency of CPCs with a tubular absorber. Results obtained based on one-, two-, three- and four-reflections models are compared to those from ray-tracing analysis. Analysis shows that multiple-reflections commonly occur for the radiation incident on reflectors near the aperture at small angles, and multiple-reflections after the third reflection usually occur on cusped reflectors near the bottom of tubular absorbers. Results show that a considerable fraction of incident radiation arrives on the tube after more than two reflections, but the fraction of incident radiation that arrives on the tube after more than four reflections is considerably small. Hence, the one-reflection model, where the incident radiation that arrives on the tube after more than one reflection is simply regarded as the one that arrives after one reflection, can't reasonably predict the optical performance of CPCs except for those with a very high reflectivity. It is found that three-reflections models, where the radiation arriving on the tube after more than three reflections is regarded as the one that arrives after three reflections, can accurately predict the optical performance of CPCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","27","Incident solar radiation","Efficiency - Forecasting - Ray tracing - Reflection - Solar concentrators","CPC with a tubular absorber - High reflectivity - Incident radiation - Mathematical procedures - Multiple reflections - Optical efficiency - Optical performance - Reflection Models","657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is in partial fulfillment of the funded research program 51466016, financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China .",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Brain-image and tissue-section analyses indicated an altered pattern of neural-cell differentiation, resulting in a delayed neuronal maturation and neural-fiber myelination of the transgenic monkeys, similar to the known evolutionary change of developmental delay (neoteny) in humans. Further brain-transcriptome and tissue-section analyses of major developmental stages showed a marked human-like expression delay of neuron differentiation and synaptic-signaling genes, providing a molecular explanation for the observed brain-developmental delay of the transgenic monkeys. More importantly, the transgenic monkeys exhibited better short-term memory and shorter reaction time compared with the wild-type controls in the delayed-matching-to-sample task.

The anti-adsorption characteristics of PCs have important design reference significance, and it is closely related to the composition and structure of PCs. The UV spectrophotometry is a common method for the detection of adsorption quantity, but there are still many uncertainties in the PCs test. So, UV spectrophotometry and derivative spectrometry were used to quantitatively analyze the adsorption capacity of tuff powder on PCs with different side chain lengths, and the experimental parameters were analyzed and optimized. The results show that there is no obvious ultraviolet characteristic peak in the absorption spectrum of PCs. When test solution concentration is increased and its pH value is lowered, the pseudo peak can be seen in the wavelength range of 190~200 nm, which is confirmed by the spectral test of acetic acid analysis reagent. After the derivative treatmentof the PCs spectral data, the characteristic peak of PCs can be obtained. There is a good linear relationship between the test solution absorbance and its concentration under this characteristic peak, and the correlation coefficient r is greater than 0.99. Further, the accuracy of UV absorption spectroscopy is demonstrated, compared with the TOC method. There is a good linear relationship between the above two methods, and the correlation coefficient r is 0.997, which indicates that second derivative UV spectrum can provide a simple, fast, accurate, inexpensive and non-developing agent quantitative test method for PCs adsorption analysis; The adsorption of the PCs by the tuff rock powder decreases as the length of its side chain decreases.

The products synthesized at different temperatures were investigated by XRD, TEM, XPS, TG-DSC and UV–Vis. The results showed that carbon-coated TinO2n-1 powders were obtained within a few seconds in argon atmosphere, while the resistivity and BET surface area of TinO2n-1@C are 0.02–0.206 Ω cm and 4.62–14.6 m2 g−1, respectively. Notably, the carbon shell thickness varied from 2 nm to 11 nm and the average particle size of the Magnéli phase core ranged from 30 nm to 100 nm with an increase in reduction temperature.

In this regard, we use SIFT feature matching method to find the corresponding feature points on the front and back frame targets, and get the mean value according to the distance and angle changes of all matching points as the basis of adjusting the bounding box. However, this method has a higher requirement for the accuracy of feature matching, otherwise, once there are some large deviations in the matching results, it will have a great impact on the final adjustment. In order to ensure reliability, besides improving the matching accuracy, a large number of accurate results are needed to calculate as well.

However, estimating the guidance channel is very difficult, and often fails when a texture has unpronounced features. In this paper, we propose a novel texture synthesis method, based on non-local operators, which captures the long-range structure of a texture without the additional guidance channel. The synthesized texture is generated by minimizing non-local texture energy through an expectation-maximization like optimization algorithm. A statistical constraint based on the Wasserstein distance is also proposed to ensure that the synthesized texture preserves the global statistics of the exemplar texture.

A large amount of intelligent terminals occupy the radio spectrum, resulting in the reduction of radio spectrum resources. Cognitive radio, which requires rapid and exact spectrum sensing, is considered the most effective method to resolve this problem. This paper applies bistable stochastic resonance to polarization antenna spectrum sensing. To adhere to its requirements, frequency re-scaling is adopted to degrade high frequency to low frequency. Differential computing is used to wipe the direction current component from the output signal. Three algorithms including differential energy detection, generalized likelihood ratio test, generalized Hadamard ratio test, are then employed for spectrum sensing. The simulation experiment compares the three algorithms above in various channel conditions including additional white Gaussian noise, Rayleigh-fading, and partial polarized noise. The results indicate that bistable stochastic resonance can drastically enhance detection probability in low signal-to-noise-ratio, and partial polarized noise degenerates the accuracy of spectrum sensing. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","22","Cognitive radio","Antennas - Circuit resonance - Gaussian noise (electronic) - Magnetic resonance - Polarization - Radio systems - Rayleigh fading - Signal to noise ratio - Stochastic systems - Telecommunication industry","Bistable stochastic resonance - Detection probabilities - Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test - Low signal-to-noise ratio - Polarized antennas - Spectrum sensing - Telecommunications industry - Wireless communications","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1 Electric Networks - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 961 Systems Science","Number: C6165903, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61701432, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by Youth project of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61701432; the Spectrum Sensing and Borderlands Security Key Laboratory of Universities in Yunnan under Grant C6165903.

Thermal instabilities give rise to condensations in the solar corona, and are the most probable scenario for coronal rain and prominence formation. We revisit the original theoretical treatment done by Field (1965, ApJ, 142, 531) in a homogeneous plasma with heat-loss effects and combine this with state-of-the-art numerical simulations to verify growth-rate predictions and address the long-term non-linear regime. We especially investigate interaction between multiple magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes and how they in turn trigger thermal mode development. Aims. We assess how well the numerical MHD simulations retrieve the analytically predicted growth rates. We complete the original theory with quantifications of the eigenfunctions, calculated to consistently excite each wave mode. Thermal growth rates are fitted also in the non-linear regime of multiple wave-wave interaction setups, at the onset of thermal instability formation. Methods. We performed 2D numerical MHD simulations, including an additional (radiative) heat-loss term and a constant heating term to the energy equation. We mainly focus on the thermal (i.e. entropy) and slow MHD wave modes and use the wave amplitude as a function of time to make a comparison to predicted growth rates. Results. It is shown that the numerical MHD simulations retrieve analytically predicted growth rates for all modes, of thermal and slow or fast MHD type. In typical coronal conditions, the latter are damped due to radiative losses, but their interaction can cause slowly changing equilibrium conditions which ultimately trigger thermal mode development. Even in these non-linear wave-wave interaction setups, the growth rate of the thermal instability agrees with the exponential profile predicted by linear theory. The non-linear evolutions show systematic field-guided motions of condensations with fairly complex morphologies, resulting from thermal modes excited through damped slow MHD waves. These results are of direct interest to the study of solar coronal rain and prominence fine structure. Our wave-wave interaction setups are relevant for coronal loop sections which are known to host slow wave modes, and hence provide a new route to explain the sudden onset of coronal condensation. © ESO 2019.","55","Magnetohydrodynamics","Condensation - Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Heat losses - Magnetoplasma - Numerical models - Plasma stability - Rain - Stability - Thermodynamic stability - Waves","Equilibrium conditions - Magnetohydrodynamic waves - Prominences - Sun : corona - Sun: filaments - Sun: oscillations - Theoretical treatments - Wave-wave interactions","443.3 Precipitation - 615.3 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Power Generation - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 932.3 Plasma Physics","","This research was supported by KU Leuven Project No. GOA/2015-14.

It is mainly treated by chemotherapy drugs. However, the lack of targeted performance of drug has always been one of the important reasons for limiting application in clinical. In this study, negatively charged sialic acid (SA)–modified PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared under the guidance of cationic chitosan, and the anti-tumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded to obtain DOX/SC-PLGA NP (195.9 ± 2.3 nm). In the drug release experiment, it was revealed that the drug-loaded nanoparticles can be destroyed under acidic conditions to rapidly release the drug due to the charge reversal. In in vitro flow cytometry experiments, SA-modified NP not only can promote more uptake by CD22-positive Raji cells but also can promote upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, thereby promoting tumor cell apoptosis. The MTT assay also confirmed that DOX/SC-PLGA NP can effectively reduce the cell viability of Raji cells and JeKo-1 cells. In the NHL model of Raji cell transplantation tumor mice, DOX/SC-PLGA NP not only shows superior tumor targeting ability but also reduces the enrichment of DOX in the lungs and kidneys, and reduces the myelosuppressive effect of DOX. In the observation of efficacy, it was found that DOX/SC-PLGA NP significantly reduced the tumor volume of NHL. The linear relationship between tumor drug concentration and tumor volume also shows that SC-PLGA NP can better aggregate and exert therapeutic effects in NHL. The above results indicate that SA, as a ligand for CD22, can be used as a good nanomedicine targeting unit for the treatment of NHL models with high CD22 expression.

Photovoltaic modules are generally installed on the roofs or facades of buildings and cannot be monitored by conventional methods. This work presents a new online technique for analysing the current-voltage characteristics of photovoltaic modules installed on the facades of building-integrated photovoltaic systems. The proposed method, which is based on the modified double-diode model, can extract six physical parameters of the photovoltaic module that rely on the current and voltage at the short-circuit and open-circuit points and at the maximum power point. Unlike the approaches from existing studies, the method proposed in this paper requires only the current at the maximum power point. By measuring the solar irradiance, wind speed and average temperature of the photovoltaic module, the current and voltage at the short-circuit and open-circuit points can be calculated. To study the accuracy of the proposed models, the absolute error and root mean square error of individual photovoltaic modules are examined. The results indicate that the minimum absolute error of the current appears near the maximum power point. Moreover, the proposed simulation of the current-voltage characteristic curves achieves a lower root mean square error value and exhibits a better ability to represent the current-voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic modules. In addition, methods are used to extract the six parameters of the photovoltaic module, which operates in the building-integrated photovoltaic system. The experimental results show that the prediction of the current-voltage characteristic curves achieves the lowest root mean square error values at the short-circuit and open-circuit points and at the maximum power point. Furthermore, regardless of whether operating in the building-integrated photovoltaic system, the six parameters of the photovoltaic modules with the same initial characteristics extracted via the proposed methods have similar numerical ranges under standard test conditions. Based on these conclusions, the six parameters based on the modified double-diode model are useful and practical for the simulation and evaluation of the current-voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic module in the building-integrated photovoltaic system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","44","Current voltage characteristics","Building materials - Buildings - Diodes - Errors - Extraction - Mean square error - Numerical methods - Online systems - Photovoltaic cells - Solar power generation - Wind","Building integrated photovoltaic system - Diode modeling - Online extraction - Photovoltaic modules - Physical parameters","402 Buildings and Towers - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 615.2 Solar Power - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017FB089, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51867022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The present study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51867022 ) and the Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (No. 2017FB089 ).
