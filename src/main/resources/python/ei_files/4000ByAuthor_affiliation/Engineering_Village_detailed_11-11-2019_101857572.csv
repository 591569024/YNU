In this work, ultrasound and microwave were used to synthesize copper-activated carbon (Cu-AC). The results indicated that Cu-AC exhibited much higher adsorption capacity than regenerated-activated carbon (R-AC) due to its large surface area and developed pore structure. The Cu-AC was employed as photocatalyst for degradation of methylene orange (MO) and cango red (CR) solution under UV light and visible light irradiation. The removal efficiency of CR solution was higher under UV light irradiation. The adsorption behaviors of Cu-AC and R-AC to MO were also investigated. The effects of different parameters such as pH, initial concentration and contact time on adsorption behaviors were performed in batch models. The results indicated that using Cu-AC to remove organic dyes was a cost-efficient way, which can realize the comprehensive utilization of waste resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","62","Activated carbon treatment","Activated carbon - Adsorption - Copper - Copper alloys - Ionic liquids - Irradiation - Light - Photocatalysts - Photodegradation - Stripping (dyes) - Ultrasonics - Wastewater treatment","Adsorption mechanism - Comprehensive utilizations - Dye wastewater treatments - Initial concentration - Microwave assisted synthesis - Photocatalytic activities - Spent activated carbon - Visible-light irradiation","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 544.1 Copper - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 741.1 Light/Optics - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 201608740012, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 51504119, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015YB004, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","The authors greatly acknowledge the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51504119 ), China Scholarship Council (No. 201608740012 ), Extracurricular Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2015YB004 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this approach, more efficient algorithms of path generation, incorporated with the FTS, are designed. Catering for the characteristic of the FJSP-OP that not all operations of all jobs need to be processed, we introduce a new type of pheromone, i.e., pheromone on nodes, which reinforces the learning search experience of a single node. To improve performance, the pheromone update strategy and the search strategy are modified.

In this study, we investigated the spatial (10 sites) and temporal (June, August and October) variations in: 1) their biomass based on chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, 2) their toxic genotype based on gene copy ratio of mcyJ to cpcBA, and 3) their cpcBA genotype composition of Microcystis during cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu. While spatial-temporal variations were found in chl-a and mcyJ/cpcBA ratio, only spatial variation was observed in cpcBA genotype composition. Samples from northwestern part had a higher chl-a, but mcyJ/cpcBA ratio didn't vary among the sites. High chl-a was observed in August, while mcyJ/cpcBA ratio and genotypic richness increased with time. The spatial variations in chl-a and mcyJ/cpcBA ratio and temporal variation in cpcBA genotype were correlated negatively with dissolved N and positively with dissolved P. Spatial distribution of Microcystis biomass was positively correlated with nitrite and P excluding October, but no correlation was found for spatial distribution of mcyJ/cpcBA ratio and cpcBA genotype. Spatial distribution of toxic and cpcBA genotypes may result from horizontal transport of Microcystis colonies, while spatial variation in Microcystis biomass was probably controlled by both nutrient-mediated growth and horizontal transport of Microcystis. The temporal variation in Microcystis biomass, toxic genotype and cpcBA genotype composition were related to nutrient levels, but cause-and-effect relationships require further study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","49","Spatial distribution","Biomass - Chlorophyll - Lakes - Nutrients","Chlorophyll a - cpcBA genotype - Horizontal transport - mcyJ/cpcBA ratio - Microcystis - Nutrient levels","804.1 Organic Compounds - 921 Mathematics","Number: 2014M551554, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2017T100350, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 973Program, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2008CB418004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31270447, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41461096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31270447 and 41461096 ), the National Basic Research Program of China (973Program, 2008CB418004 ) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2014M551554 and 2017T100350 ).

Because the slice of ambiguity function main ridge of signal can be used to descript the ambiguity energy distribution information of signal, a feature extraction method of the ambiguity function main ridge slice based on graphics contours is proposed. The proposed method can extract two novel features, i.e., cumulated angle and unit cumulative length, which describe the intensity of change and the inherent characteristics of graphics contour, respectively. The experimental results of fuzzy C-means clustering show that the sorting success rate of six types of radar signals, such as normal signal, chirp signal, binary phase shift keying, quaternary phase shift keying, M pseudo-random series, and binary frequency shift keying, is 100% when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is no less than 12 dB; and the average success rate of signal sorting is up to 93.5% even if SNR is as low as 0 dB. When SNR changes from 0 dB to 20 dB, the average success rate of signal sorting can reach to 98.9%.

Based on the analysis, a new onset criterion of BOB summer monsoon(BOBSM) is defined by using regionally averaged zonal wind at 850 hPa (U850) and 200 hPa (U200) over Eastern BOB (5°N-15°N, 90°E-97.5°E). When U850 and U200 get to the criterion of U850>3 m•s-1 and U200-1 and persist for five days, we define the first day as the BOBSM onset date. The criterion definition has clear synoptic significance which can reflect the stably persist variation of low-level southwest wind and the establishment of high-level southern Asian high (SAH) over the Tibetan plateau. On the basis of BOBSM onset date obstained using above criteria, the interannual characteristics of BOBSM onset and precusory singal of tropical ocean are further analyzed. The results showed that the averaged date of BOBSM onset for 1981-2010 is 10th May. BOBSM onset indicate significant interannual fluctuations with onset as early as 1999 (11th April) and the latest in 1968 (1st June). The decadal change of onset date display the trend from the late outbreak to early onset. The BOBSM onset is close related to upper and lower atmospheric circulation. In BOBSM onset early (late) years, 850 hPa cross equatorial flow and westerly anomalies over tropical Indian Ocean strengthen (weaken), and 200 hPa SAH over Tibaten plateau establish early (late). The SST in the preceding winter over the Western Pacific has a good indicative sense to BOBSM onset. The monsoon onset is early (late) while SST is cold (warm). The possible impact way is to change the zonal vertical circulation and its anomalous circulation in the tropical India Ocean and the Pacific Ocean by the change of heat source, and then affect the monsoon onset early or later. © 2018, Science Press.

Alkaline-catalyzed saponification and enzyme-catalyzed enzymolysis are the most commonly used de-esterification methods. However, information on the efficiency and isomerization during de-esterification of natural astaxanthin esters by these two methods remains scarce. Therefore, we conducted two HPLC-based experiments to determine which method is better for hydrolyzing astaxanthin esters. Results: To assess the effect of enzymolysis (0.67 U/mL cholesterol esterase, at 37°C) and saponification (0.021 M NaOH, at 5°C) conditions on free astaxanthin recovery and destruction or structural transformation of astaxanthin, we varied the total treatment time across a range of 195 min. The results showed that enzymolysis and saponification were complete in 60 min and 90 min, respectively. After complete hydrolysis, the maximum free astaxanthin recovery obtained by enzymolysis was 42.6% more than that obtained by saponification. The identification of by-products, semi-astacene and astacene, during the process of saponification also indicated that a more severe degradation of astaxanthin occurred during saponification. Moreover, the composition of astaxanthin isomers during saponification was similar to that of the isomers during enzymolysis between 30 min and 75 min (all-trans:9-cis:13-cis = 21:3:1, approximately) but dramatically changed after 90 min, whereas the composition in the enzymolysis treatment remained relatively stable throughout. Conclusion: Compared with saponification, enzymolysis with cholesterol esterase was recommended as a more accurate method for de-esterification of natural astaxanthin esters for further qualitative and quantitative HPLC analysis. © 2018","36","Esters","Catalysis - Cholesterol - Efficiency - Enzymes - Esterification - Fatty acids - Hydrolysis - Isomerization - Isomers - Saponification - Sodium hydroxide","Astacene - Astaxanthin - Carotenoid - Cholesterol esterase - Enzymolysis - Semi-astacene","802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: 31,572,639, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31,572,639 ].","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is shown that the negative temperature changes significantly affect the dynamic mechanical properties and the fractal characteristics of red sandstone. The dynamic strength of red sandstone first increases and then decreases with the temperature reduction (from 25 to -40 ), shaped like a '' glyph, however, the peak strain shows a trend of first decreases and then increases, the test results are very different from the static load test results of frozen rock.

With the observation and analysis of red sandstone fracture morphology, the final fracture of red sandstone at low temperature is found in clay cement or its boundary with mineral particles, red sandstone fracture morphology is relatively complicated under the condition of normal temperature, it is difficult to see the regularity, however, after introducing the low temperature gradient, the fracture morphology of the clay cement and mineral particles gradually show the regularity.

This Z-scheme photocatalytic reduction mechanism of Au@g-C3N4/SnS performs valuable functions in the reaction, leading to CH4 generation much earlier and higher concentration than that of Au@g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the unique yolk-shell structure can make the light bounce back and forth in the cavity and thus enhances the availability ratio of light.

Hence, this novel material exhibits a distinguished reduction performance for CO2 reduction under visible light. The highest yields of CH4 (3.8 μmol g-1), CH3OH (5.3 μmol g-1), and CO (17.1 μmol g-1) can be obtained for the sample of Au@g-C3N4/SnS (SnS 41.5%), which is higher than other latest reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction including coupled with semiconductors and noble metal cocatalysts.

A 70-m-wide syenite porphyry and molybdenite-pyrite vein with high Cu-Mo abnormal pyritization was firstly discovered in the deep part of the deposits (3# vein of 2073 level). It is believed that obvious alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Mo superimposed mineralization occurs at depth of the deposit. This study conducted Re-Os isotopic analysis for molybdenite-pyrite samples from molybdenite-pyrite veins, pyrite-galena veins and high Cu-Mo syenite porphyry from deep adits in the Laojiezi Pb-Ag deposits. An isochron age of 33.71± 0.29Ma and a weighted average age of 33.99±0.22Ma were obtained for molybdenite, indicating that the mineralization of the Pb-Ag polymetallic deposit took place in Oligocene, which is consistent with the diagenetic age of the syenite porphyry. The initial Os value of 0.3049~1.5549 and the γOs value of 140.5~1126 suggest that the metallogenic material was derived from partial melting of the crust-mantle transition layer. The metallogenic age of the Laojiezi porphyry Pb-Ag polymetallic deposit is roughly the same as that (30~40 Ma) of regional alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic hydrothermal polymetallic deposits. It shows that, after the collision between the India plate and Eurasia plate, the change of tectonic stress field resulted in large-scale strike-slip faulting system, which induced partial melting of crust-mantle transition zone within the stable cratons, forming alkali-rich intrusive rocks and metallogenic fluids, and the fluid formed alkali-rich porphyry and magmatic-hydrothermal polymetallic deposits along the weak structures. © 2018, Science Press.

A ratio-based approach using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ID LC-MS/MS) with indirect multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of the derivative tag was developed to simultaneously quantify endo-/exogenous plasma glucose. Using diluted D-[13C6] glucose as tracer of exogenous glucose,12C6/13C6glucoses were first derivatized and then data were acquired in MRM mode. The metabolism of exogenous glucose can be tracked and the concentration ratio of endo/exo-genous glucose can be measured by calculating the endo-/exo-genous glucose concentrations from peak area ratio of specific daughter ions. Joint application of selective derivatization and MRM analysis not only improves the sensitivity but also minimizes the interference from the background of plasma, which warrants the accuracy and reproducibility. Good agreement between the theoretical and calculated concentration ratios was obtained with a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9969 in the range of D-glucose from 0.5 to 20.0 mM, which covers the healthy and diabetic physiological scenarios. Satisfactory reproducibility was obtained by evaluation of the intra- and inter-day precisions with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 5.16%, and relative recoveries of 85.96 to 95.92% were obtained at low, medium, and high concentration, respectively. The method was successfully applied to simultaneous determination of the endo-/exogenous glucose concentration in plasma of non-diabetic and type II diabetic cynomolgus monkeys.

Results showed that the moisture contents (MC) of 16-day DS biodrying with AS (Trial A), SCG (Trial B) and SD (Trial C) decreased from 70.14 wt%, 68.25 wt% and 71.63 wt% to 59.12 wt%, 41.35 wt% and 57.69 wt%, respectively. In case of Trial B, the MC rapidly decreased to 46.16 wt% with the highest water removal (70.87%) within 8 days because of the longest high-temperature period (5.8 days). Further studies indicated that the abundant biodegradable volatile solids (BVS) and high dissolved organic matter (DOM) contents in SCG were the main driving forces for water removal. According to pyrosequencing data, Firmicutes, most of which were recognized as thermophiles, was rapidly enriched on Day 8 and became the dominant phylum in Trial B. Four thermophilic genera, Bacillus, Ureibacillus, Geobacillus and Thermobifida, which can produce thermostable hydrolytic extracellular enzymes, were the most abundant in Trial B, indicating that these thermophilic bacteria evolved during the long high-temperature period enhanced the biodegradation of BVS in SCG. The 8-day biodried product of Trial B was demonstrated to be an excellent solid fuel with low heating value (LHV) of 9284 kJ kg−1, which was 2.1 and 1.8 times those of biodried products with AS and SD, respectively.

The highest substituent content of 2.304mmol/g was achieved when the grafting temperature was 100, the time was 3h, the mass ratio of MAH to CSF was 5:1, and the dosage of dibenzoyl peroxide (BPO) was 7.5%. The morphological distribution and microstructure of the cellulose superfine fibers and the modified cellulose superfine fibers were observed by SEM. The content of substituent in the modified cellulose superfine fibers (MAH-CSF) was quantitatively measured by acid-base titration. The FT-IR analysis was used to confirm that maleic anhydride had been grafted onto cellulose superfine fibers successfully. From the XRD and DSC spectra, it was found that the crystalline form of MAH-CSF did not change, but its crystallinity decreased. Meanwhile, maleic anhydride modification could improve the thermal stability of the cellulose superfine fibers. The adsorption performance of CSF and MAH-CSF for methylene blue were discussed. The adsorption capacity of the cellulose superfine fibers increased from 210mg/g to 306mg/g after modified by maleic anhydride, which indicated that carboxyl could greatly increase the adsorption capacity of cellulose superfine fibers. At low pH, the competitive-dyeing interaction of H+ and methylene blue decreased their adsorption capacities. The adsorption capacitys increased rapidly by deprotonating the adsorbents. The increasing trend of the adsorption capacity diminished when pH was greater than 5.5. The electrostatic force between MAH-CSF and methylene blue enhanced the adsorption property, and the adsorption process was more suitable to be described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Under ultrasonic wave, the adsorption rate of the adsorbents after regenerated five times was>89%, indicating a good regeneration ability of the adsorbent. © 2018, Chemical Industry Press.

Treatment with the proposed electrocatalytic internal micro-electrolysis (ECIME) which cooperates the characteristics of electrochemical and internal micro-electrolysis (IME) is an effective approach to remove alkyl xanthates from wastewater. Therefore, the degradation characteristics, reaction mechanism and pathways of this pollutant toward the remediation technology must be considered deeply. In this work, butyl xanthate (BX) was used as the template of pollutant, electrochemical characterization and spectroscopy analysis methods was conducted to explode this key point. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) indicates that BX can be generated redox reaction directly at the carbon microelectrode and degraded in anode and cathode chamber of the electrolysis cell. The effects of repolarization particle electrode and IME reduce the dependence of BX decomposition on low pH and can realize high degradation efficient in the neutral or alkaline conditions. The dominant degradation mechanism of BX in ECIME system is the electrocatalytic redox directly and mineralization by •OH indirectly which generates in situ. The main pathways of BX in ECIME system are followed by BX, dixanthogen→N-butyl alcohol or diisobutyl carbonate, CS2→organic acid, H2CO3→H2O, CO2, SO42-.

However, formal mixed-criticality models have traditionally been characterized by two impractical assumptions: once any high-criticality task overruns, all low-criticality tasks are suspended and all other high-criticality tasks are assumed to exhibit high-criticality behaviors at the same time. In this paper, we propose a more realistic mixed-criticality model, called the flexible mixed-criticality (FMC) model, in which these two issues are addressed in a combined manner. In this new model, only the overrun task itself is assumed to exhibit high-criticality behavior, while other high-criticality tasks remain in the same mode as before. The guaranteed service levels of low-criticality tasks are gracefully degraded with the overruns of high-criticality tasks. We derive a utilization-based technique to analyze the schedulability of this new mixed-criticality model under EDF-VD scheduling. During run time, the proposed test condition serves an important criterion for dynamic service level tuning, by means of which the maximum available execution budget for low-criticality tasks can be directly determined with minimal overhead while guaranteeing mixed-criticality schedulability. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the FMC scheme compared with state-of-The-Art techniques. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","27","Real time systems","Budget control - Criticality (nuclear fission) - Electronic mail - Embedded systems - Interactive computer systems - Scheduling - Tuning","Computational model - Guaranteed service - Mixed criticalities - Mixed-criticality systems - Optimal scheduling - Processor scheduling - Resource efficiencies - State-of-the-art techniques","621 Nuclear Reactors - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 912.2 Management","Number: 61532007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61702085, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61702085 and 61532007)",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

One of Kepler's greatest heritages has been the confirmation and characterization of hundreds of multi-planet systems via transit timing variations (TTVs). However, there are many interesting candidate systems displaying TTVs on such long timescales that the existing Kepler observations are of insufficient length to confirm and characterize them by means of this technique. To continue with Kepler's unique work, we have organized the 'Kepler Object of Interest Network' (KOINet), a multi-site network formed of several telescopes located throughout America, Europe, and Asia. The goals of KOINet are to complete the TTV curves of systems where Kepler did not cover the interaction timescales well, to dynamically prove that some candidates are true planets (or not), to dynamically measure the masses and bulk densities of some planets, to find evidence for non-transiting planets in some of the systems, to extend Kepler's baseline adding new data with the main purpose of improving current models of TTVs, and to build a platform that can observe almost anywhere on the northern hemisphere, at almost any time. KOINet has been operational since March 2014. Here we show some promising first results obtained from analyzing seven primary transits of KOI-0410.01, KOI-0525.01, KOI-0760.01, and KOI-0902.01, in addition to the Kepler data acquired during the first and second observing seasons of KOINet. While carefully choosing the targets we set demanding constraints on timing precision (at least 1 min) and photometric precision (as good as one part per thousand) that were achieved by means of our observing strategies and data analysis techniques. For KOI-0410.01, new transit data revealed a turnover of its TTVs. We carried out an in-depth study of the system, which is identified in the NASA Data Validation Report as a false positive. Among others, we investigated a gravitationally bound hierarchical triple star system and a planet-star system. While the simultaneous transit fitting of ground- andspace-based data allowed for a planet solution, we could not fully reject the three-star scenario. New data, already scheduled in the upcoming 2018 observing season, will set tighter constraints on the nature of the system. © ESO 2018.","84","Satellites","Curve fitting - Data handling - Extrasolar planets - Information analysis - NASA - Photometry - Stars - Timing circuits","Data analysis techniques - Instrumentation: photometers - Methods:data analysis - Northern Hemispheres - Photometric precision - Planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stabilities - Space-based observations - Techniques: photometric","655.2 Satellites - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: California Institute of Technology; ","The Stellar Astrophysics Centre is provided by The Danish National Research Foundation (Grant DNRF106).

In this study, we investigated whether the nuclear factor erythroid-like 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway, which regulates antioxidant transcriptional regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis, is involved in this process. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase-3/-9 activities were evaluated in HUVECs by JC-1 staining and colorimetric activity assay, and a DCFH-DA fluorescent probe assay was used to quantitate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The effects of MC-LR, EGCG, NF2, and HO-1 on HUVEC apoptosis were explored by western blotting and small interfering RNA (siRNA) analyses. MC-LR treatment downregulated HUVEC mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased levels of cytochrome c release and activated caspase-3/-9, ROS generation, consequently inducing HUVEC apoptosis. EGCG treatment attenuated MC-LR-mediated HUVEC oxidative stress and mitochondria-related apoptosis. EGCG induced NRF2/HO-1 expression and activation in MC-LR treated HUVECs, while downregulation of NRF2/HO-1 by specific siRNAs revealed that NRF2/HO-1 signaling was involved in EGCG attenuation of MC-LR-induced HUVEC apoptosis. Our findings indicate that EGCG treatment protects against MC-LR-mediated HUVEC apoptosis via activation of NRF2/HO-1 signaling. EGCG can ameliorate MC-LR-induced apoptosis of HUVECs through inhibition of ROS-mediated mitochondrial injury and activation of NRF2/HO-1 signaling. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","36","Endothelial cells","Cell death - Cell membranes - Chemical activation - Magnesium printing plates - Mitochondria - Oxidative stress - RNA - Toxic materials","Epigallocatechin-3-gallate - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells - Microcystin-LR - Mitochondrial membrane potential - NRF2 - Reactive oxygen species - Small interfering rna (siRNA) - Transcriptional regulation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 745.1.1 Printing Equipment - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: 2017ZX07201003-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81401870, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: PCRRY16001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was supported by State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse Foundation [NO.

Safety factor, slip surface and scope of width 900 m and height 450 m are suggested by Janbu-simplified method based on slide. Safety factors and deformations of seven kinds of seismic working conditions such as horizontal acceleration being 0.00g, 0.10g, 0.15g, 0.20g, 0.25g, 0.30g and 0.35g are respectively computed by strength reduction method of finite elements on basis of Phase2D using quasi-static method, simulated object being model test. After curves of safety factor or defromation and horizontal acceleration of different seismic load conditions are compared with each other. The results show that: (1) Safety factor near to 1.0, the deviation is least, otherwise the deviation and discreteness increase, which is caused by disunity of limit condition defined by the two methods. Critical horizontal acceleration done by safety factor is 0.20g. (2) Fail mode presented by shear strain is bridge pier being tensile-shear fail, sliding in T2 tuff stratum and horizontally sheared out in front. Sensitivity order of deformation response in slope is horizontal displacement more sensitive than vertical displacement than shear strain. Limit value done by deformation evolution is 0.15g-0.20g, corresponding horizontal displacement being 10.2 mm. These are all proved by model test. (3) Finally, the critical horizontal acceleration of Huaping bedding slope comprehensively being 0.2g, safety factors of exceedance probability being 10% for 50 years and that of exceedance probability being 2% for 100 years are respectively 1.2 and 1.1. Huaping slope is safe under current seismic fortification criterion. In practice, safety factor considered material strength reserve is often selected as evaluating indicator of slope stability; but a strong operability and warning displacement considered deformation mechanism is selected for engineering safety monitoring. So, slope stability needed to be estimated by safety factor combined with critical displacement. © 2018, Science Press.

Accordingly, 1354 accidents that occurred on the Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway within the northern part of the Guangdong Province in a three-year period were evaluated. Three types of segmentation methods were used to divide the study section: fixed-length, homogeneous horizontal radius, and homogeneous longitudinal grade. Thirteen independent variables were selected from the road geometry and environmental conditions. Further, an accident frequency prediction-model was established using negative binomial (NB) and nonlinear negative binomial (NNB) regression models to explore the significant influencing factors. Elastic analysis was used to determine the degree of influence of the independent variables. The results indicate that the accident frequency prediction model based on the NNB regression model is better than that of the NB regression model for the fixed-length, homogeneous horizontal radius, and homogeneous longitudinal grade segmentation methods. Additionally, homogeneous longitudinal grade segmentation methods are better than the fixed-length and homogeneous horizontal radius methods for studying mountain expressways. From the correlation of significant variables, it was found that the length of section, change value of slope of adjacent sections, combination of curves and slopes, curvature, existence of tunnel sections, and whether the sections are susceptible to freezing and fog are the significant factors of the nonlinear model. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Nonetheless, its millennial slip rate and earthquake recurrence behavior are poorly constrained. Analysis of 5- and 30-m-resolution topography reveals right-lateral offsets that range from 60 m to 24 km along its “mid-valley” trace but none along its “range-front” trace. This strongly implies that the range-front fault has experienced very little lateral slip for millions of years, even though it is the geologically more significant fault. Stratigraphic and geomorphologic investigation of the mid-valley fault within a small channel near Gasa yields a 14C-based slip rate of 1.1 ± 0.4 mm/year, averaged over the last 30,000–50,000 years. Three-dimensional paleoseismic excavation of colluvial wedges produced by collapse of shutter ridges into the channel shows that sudden dextral ruptures of the fault have occurred every 6,000 ± 1,000 years over the past 30,000 years. Two and possibly three large surface ruptures occurred in the past 13,500 years, and two previous ones occurred at 18,500 and 24,500 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). The oldest one in the section likely occurred at or a few 1,000 years before 29,800 ± 2,000 cal yr BP. The 3-D extent of the colluvial wedges implies dextral offsets of ≥4.5 m, amounts that are consistent with the slip rate and recurrence interval. The evidence for low slip rate and rare large seismic events is consistent with the lack of large historical earthquakes along the fault and the low Global Positioning System (GPS)-derived slip rate, but is much lower than widely cited geological slip rates. ©2018.

The molecular processes controlling the endosomal positioning utilize several large protein complexes, one of which contains the small GTPase Rab7, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and oxysterol-binding protein–related protein 1 (ORP1L). Rab7 is known to interact with RILP through a canonical binding site termed the effector-interacting switch region, but it is not clear how Rab7 interacts with ORP1L, limiting our understanding of the overall process. Here, we report structural and biochemical investigation of the Rab7-ORP1L interaction. We found that, contrary to prior studies, the interaction between Rab7 and the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARDN) of ORP1L is independent of Rab7’s GTP- or GDP-binding state. Moreover, we show that Rab7 interacts with ORP1L ARDN via a unique region consisting of helix3 (3) and 310-helix 2 (2). This architecture leaves the canonical effector-interacting switch regions available for RILP binding and thus allows formation of the ORP1L-Rab7-RILP tripartite complex. Mutational disruption of the interacting interface between ORP1L and Rab7 compromised the ability of ORP1L-Rab7-RILP to regulate the late endosome positioning. Collectively, our results again manifested the versatility in the interaction between GTPase and its effector. © 2018 Ma et al.","35","Process control","Binding sites - Proteins","Ankyrin-repeat domain - Complex formations - Intracellular trafficking - Molecular process - Overall process - Oxysterol binding protein - Protein complexes - Signaling transduction","801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 31000331, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 31530015, 31470744 , and 31000331.

The presence of homogeneously mixed Zn and Lu, in the form of ZnO and Lu2O3, and dense micropores is confirmed by SEM and XPS.

The as-prepared Zn–Lu ASC exhibited excellent antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

The accuracy and quality of two widely used datasets, the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets to force the SWAT model (CMADS), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP), were evaluated in this paper. The accuracy of daily precipitation, max/min temperature, relative humidity and wind speed from CMADS and CFSR are firstly evaluated by comparing them with results obtained from 131 meteorological stations in the TP. Statistical results show that most elements of CMADS are superior to those of CFSR. The average correlation coefficient (R) between the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature of CMADS and CFSR ranged from 0.93 to 0.97. The root mean square error (RMSE) for CMADS and CFSR ranged from 3.16 to 3.18 °C, and ranged from 5.19 vC to 8.14 °C respectively. The average R of precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed for CMADS are 0.46; 0.88 and 0.64 respectively, while they are 0.43, 0.52, and 0.37 for CFSR. Gridded observation data is obtained using the professional interpolation software, ANUSPLIN.

Traditional methods for PARM focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing the types of identifiable activity subjects complete and improving recognition accuracy and system robustness by means of novel body-worn sensors or advanced learning algorithms. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to open and connected uncontrolled environments by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps. Little is currently known about whether traditional PARM technologies can tackle the new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand the use of IoT technologies in PARM studies, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a typical IoT layer-based perspective. It will firstly summarize the state-of-the-art in traditional PARM methodologies as used in the healthcare domain, including sensory, feature extraction and recognition techniques. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of PARM studies in the IoT environments, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them. Finally, this paper consider some of the successful case studies in the area and look at the possible future industrial applications of PARM in smart healthcare. © 2018","151","Internet of things","Cost effectiveness - Health care - Pattern recognition - Wearable sensors","Controlled environment - Enabling technologies - Feature extraction and recognition - Internet of thing (IOT) - Physical activity - Physical activity monitoring - Rehabilitation programs - Systematic Review","461.7 Health Care - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

First, chlorosilane residue was subjected to alcoholysis with n-propanol to synthesize tetrapropoxysilane (TPOS), followed by the synthesis of MSNs using TPOS as silicon source. Alcoholysis experiment was designed and optimized using orthogonal experimental method. In addition, effects of four factors (i.e., molar ratio of n-propanol to chlorosilane residue; feed rate of n-propanol; reaction temperature; and molar ratio of n-hexane to chlorosilane residue) on the yield of TPOS were investigated. The optimum alcoholysis conditions were determined. Yield of TPOS was 56% under the optimum alcoholysis conditions. Results obtained from single factor analysis of variance revealed that molar ratio of n-propanol to chlorosilane residue was the most significant factor affecting TPOS yield. Next, a series of spherical MSNs with dendritic structure and irregular mesoporous/microporous silica nanoparticles with non-dendritic structure were successfully synthesized via precise regulation of various experimental parameters in emulsion systems. In this regard, the adjustment of n-hexanol/1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) molar ratio or n-octane/n-hexanol/TIPB molar ratio was found to be effective for achieving controllable regulation of morphology (spherical or irregular); structure (dendritic or non-dendritic); pore size (mesoporous (4.6–9.2 nm) or microporous (1.6–1.7 nm)); and particle diameter (60–134 nm) of silica nanoparticles. However, the adjustment of n-octane/TIPB molar ratio marginally affected spherical morphology, dendritic structure, and pore size (4.0–4.6 nm) of synthesized MSNs, with considerable effect on particle diameter (61–151 nm).

In terms of foreign trade pattern, Yunnan's foreign trade mainly consists of general trade and small border trade.

In this paper, we theoretically studied the electronic and magnetic properties of arsenene functionalized by 3D transition-metal (TM) atoms (TM@As). Although pristine arsenene is a nonmagnetic material, the dilute magnetism can be produced upon TM atoms chemisorption, where the magnetism mainly originates from TM adatoms. We find that the magnetic properties can be tuned by a moderate external strain. The chemisorption of 3D TM atoms also enriches the electronic properties of arsenene, such as metallic, half-metallic, and semiconducting features. Interestingly, we can classify the semiconducting feature into three types according to the band-gap contribution of spin channels. On the other hand, the chemisorption properties can be modified by introducing monovacancy defect in arsenene.

The envelope analysis or high-frequency resonance technique is an effective tool for the incipient fault detection of REBs. The newly developed envelope order tracking, an improved version of the envelope analysis, can be well performed even in a varying-speed condition. However, the envelope order tracking can be invalid for multi-impulsive sources. To address this issue, a scheme for the weak feature extraction of faulty REBs has been proposed in this paper by combining the envelope order tracking and the constrained independent component analysis (cICA). In the proposed scheme, the envelope order tracking approach is utilized to obtain the envelopes of sensor observed mixtures at different positions. Then, the envelopes are turned from the time domain into the angle domain by the constant-angle increments resampling scheme in the computed order tracking (COT). Subsequently, the cICA method is employed to extract the interesting envelope independent components (ICs) by a reference signal, which is constructed according to the prior-known feature frequency of the bearing. As a result, the faults related features can be clearly exposed in the spectra of the obtained interesting envelope ICs. Simulations and experimental results support the proposed method positively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","23","Roller bearings","Extraction - Fault detection - Feature extraction - Independent component analysis - Integrated circuits - Spectrum analysis - Time domain analysis - Vibration analysis","Constrained independent component analysis - Constrained independent component analysis (cICA) - Envelope analysis - Fault feature extractions - High frequency resonance techniques - Incipient fault detection - Order tracking - Rolling Element Bearing",,"Number: 51365023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The Project sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51365023).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the process, light curves of the satellite and space debris are successfully measured. In 2017, a space-debris laser ranging system with a four-element SNSPD is developed by Yunnan Observatories in China. During the ranging experiments, the detector works in a freely detecting state. It can detect photons not only of the laser echo, but also of the sunlight reflected by the target. After separating the data triggered by background light from the whole detected data set, the light curves of satellites, including Topex and several types of debris, are acquired. The apparent rotation rate of the satellite Topex is determined by analyzing the light curves by Fourier transform and phase dispersion minimization.

However, the NCA cathode still has the following disadvantages such as harsh synthesis conditions, cation mixing and poor thermal stability. A spherical fluorine modified gradient NCA is successfully prepared by a simple solid phase method. The F-modification NCA has a good spherical shape which shows a gradient distribution with high surface F and Al contents, and high nickel content in the core. XRD results reveal that F-modification NCA sample has well-ordered layer structure. However, there is a slight decrease in the cell parameters and interlayer spacing with the F doping into the NCA crystal lattice, due to the small F− radius and the largest electronegativity. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis reveals that fluorine ions are successfully substituted in the lattice. The cycling stability of the F-modification NCA samples are enhanced, especially at high rates. At 2C rate, the initial discharge specific capacity is 142.34 mAh g−1, and compared with that of 107.73 mAh g−1after 200 cycles, the capacity losses only 24%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further indicates that F-modification could help inhibit the increasing of polarization and change the kinetics of NCA cathode. © 2018 The Electrochemical Society.","50","Lithium-ion batteries","Aluminum compounds - Cathodes - Chemical bonds - Crystallography - Doping (additives) - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Electronegativity - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Fluorine - Lithium compounds - Nickel - Nickel compounds - Spheres - Synthesis (chemical)","Cath-ode materials - Cycling performance - Discharge capacities - Discharge specific capacity - Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy - Gradient distributions - Interlayer spacings - Synthesis conditions","548.1 Nickel - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51474191, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017FD144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51764048, 51474191); and the Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (2017FD144).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The irreversible axial and radial strains were computed to characterize the development of the damage state, and three characteristic stages were detected according to the average gain rate. The evolution of the apparent deformation parameters with the deviator stress level was investigated to determine the linear elastic stage, but no substantial progress was achieved. In addition, two typical approaches (transitional region and same gradient region of hysteresis) were also found to be unsuitable for determining the elastic parameters to complete the cyclic loading test. Therefore, a secant approach was proposed based on volumetric strain to identify the lower bound of the nominal linear elastic stage with the upper bound established by linear regression. The results indicated that both elastic parameters and stress thresholds showed positive correlations with confinement. With the accumulation of the damage state, the peak stress and crack initiation threshold decreased, crack damage threshold and elastic parameters first increased and then decreased, and the crack closure threshold showed a tendency to decrease–increase–decrease. In addition, the strain softening stage showed a higher slope and minor stress drop value under larger confinement, and a transition from plastic compaction to plastic dilatancy was also detected. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","67","Damage detection","Crack closure - Cyclic loads - Deformation - Elasticity - Granite - Plasma confinement - Strain","Crack damage thresholds - Damage - Deformation parameter - Deviator stress levels - Linear elastic stages - Monotonic and cyclic loading - Monotonic loading - Strength","408.1 Structural Design, General - 932.3 Plasma Physics - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Such a system usually consists of four wide-angle or fish-eye cameras that mounted around the vehicle, and a bird-eye view is synthesized from images of these cameras. Commonly there are two fundamental problems for the surround view synthesis, geometric alignment and image synthesis. Geometric alignment performs fish-eye calibration and computes the image perspective transformation between the bird-eye view and images from the surrounding cameras. Image synthesis technique dedicates to seamless stitch between adjacent views and color balancing. In this paper, we propose a flexible central-around coordinate mapping (CACM) model for vehicle surround view synthesis. The CACM model calculates perspective transformation between a top-view central camera coordinate and the around camera coordinates by a marker point based method. With the transformation matrices, we could generate the pixel point mapping relationship between the bird-eye view and images of the surrounding cameras. After geometric alignment, an image fusion method based on distance weighting is adopted for seamless stitch, and an effective overlapping region brightness optimization method is proposed for color balancing. Both the seamless stitch and color balancing can be easily operated by using two types of weight coefficient under the framework of the CACM model. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches could provide a high-performance surround view camera system. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","25","Cameras","Alignment - Birds - Color - Geometry - Image fusion - Image processing - Linear transformations - Mapping - Mathematical transformations - Vehicles","Camera systems - Coordinate mapping - Fish-eye cameras - Image fusion methods - Mapping relationships - Perspective transformation - Transformation matrices - Weight coefficients",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this work, nitrogen-doped active carbon (NAC) is obtained through plasma treatment and amorphous MoSx/NAC hybrid catalyst films are electrodeposited on carbon fiber papers (CFP) which are employed as porous three-dimensional electrodes with low resistivity. The incorporation of NAC increases the electrochemically active surface area, enhances the electron transport, and facilitates the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the functionality durability benefits from synergistic effect between a-MoSx and NAC.

Additionally, contaminating light from both binary companions and unassociated stars can significantly bias the results of planet characterisation studies, but can be corrected for if the properties of the contaminating star are known. Aims. We search for binary companions to known transiting exoplanet host stars, in order to determine the multiplicity properties of hot Jupiter host stars. We also search for and characterise unassociated stars along the line of sight, allowing photometric and spectroscopic observations of the planetary system to be corrected for contaminating light. Methods. We analyse lucky imaging observations of 97 Southern hemisphere exoplanet host stars, using the Two Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54 m telescope. For each detected companion star, we determine flux ratios relative to the planet host star in two passbands, and measure the relative position of the companion. The probability of each companion being physically associated was determined using our two-colour photometry. Results. A catalogue of close companion stars is presented, including flux ratios, position measurements, and estimated companion star temperature. For companions that are potential binary companions, we review archival and catalogue data for further evidence. For WASP-77AB and WASP-85AB, we combine our data with historical measurements to determine the binary orbits, showing them to be moderately eccentric and inclined to the line of sight (and hence planetary orbital axis). Combining our survey with the similar Friends of Hot Jupiters survey, we conclude that known hot Jupiter host stars show a deficit of high mass stellar companions compared to the field star population; however, this may be a result of the biases in detection and target selection by ground-based surveys. ©ESO 2018.","113","Stars","Extrasolar planets - Orbits - Photometry - Satellites - Surveys","Formation -Techniques - High angular resolutions - High-resolution imaging - Historical measurements - Planets and satellites - Relative positions - Southern Hemisphere - Visual","655.2 Satellites - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, there has been lack of NO data from Tibetans living at low altitude and lowlander immigrants living at high altitude, which is crucial to test this hypothesis. Here, through cross-altitude (1990-5018 m) and cross-population (Tibetans and Han Chinese) analyses of serum NO metabolites (NOx) of 2086 individuals, we demonstrate that although Tibetans have a higher serum NOx level compared to lowlanders, Han Chinese immigrants living at high altitude show an even higher level than Tibetans. Consequently, our data contradict the previous proposal of increased NO signaling as the unique adaptive strategy in Tibetans. Instead, Tibetans have a relatively lower circulating NOx level at high altitude.This observation is further supported by data from the hypoxic experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and gene knockout mice. No difference is detected between Tibetans and Han Chinese for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the key enzyme for circulating NO synthesis, suggesting that eNOS itself is unlikely to be the cause. We show that other NO synthesis-related genes (e.g. GCH1) carry Tibetan-enriched mutations significantly associated with the level of circulating NOx in Tibetans. Furthermore, gene network analysis revealed that the downregulation and upregulation of NOx is possibly achieved through distinct pathways. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the physiological and genetic mechanisms of the evolutionary adaptation of Tibetans to high-altitude hypoxia. © The Author(s) 2018.","52","Nitric oxide","Body fluids - Endothelial cells - Genes - Mammals - Nitrogen oxides","Adaptation - Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) - Evolutionary adaptation - GCH1 - Genetic mechanism - High altitude - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells - Tibetans","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2012CB518202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: GREKF14-09, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution; Number: XDB13010000, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: XDA20040102, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31501013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31460287, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31671329, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31660308, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31371269, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91631306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31360032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by grants from the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB13010000 to BS and XDA20040102 to XQ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91631306 to BS, 31671329 and 31371269 to XQ, 31460287 and 31660308 to Ouzhuluobu, 31501013 to HZ and 31360032 to CC), the National 973 program (2012CB518202 to TW), the State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution (GREKF14-09), the West Light Doctoral Program (to XZ) and the Zhufeng Scholar Program of Tibetan University.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This important yet difficult intelligent video analysis problem remains a vigorous area of research due to demands for performance improvements. Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Handcrafted features, such as color and texture histograms, are frequently used for person re-identification, but most handcrafted features are limited by not being directly applicable to practical problems. Deep learning methods have obtained the state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of applications, including image annotation, face recognition, and speech recognition. However, deep learning features are heavily dependent on large-scale labeling of samples. In this paper, by utilizing the Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) metric learning, we propose a novel scheme called deep multi-view feature learning (DMVFL), which exploits the collaboration between handcrafted and deep learning features in a simple but effective way. Furthermore, we prove that the XQDA is a robust algorithm. Extensive experiments on two challenging person re-identification data sets (VIPeR and GRID) demonstrate that DMVFL improves on current state-of-the-art methods. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","67","Deep learning","Electronic mail - Face recognition - Feature extraction - Learning systems - Measurement - Robustness (control systems) - Speech recognition","Collaboration - Image color analysis - Intelligent Video Analysis - Multi-views - Person re identifications",,"Number: 2016FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61572486, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nvidia; ","Manuscript received December 29, 2016; revised March 25, 2017 and June 10, 2017; accepted July 10, 2017.

Binary population synthesis predicts the existence of subdwarf B stars (sdBs) with neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) companions. Several works have been dedicated to finding such systems, but none has been confirmed yet. Theoretically, the formation of sdBs with white dwarf (WD) and main sequence (MS) companions has been well investigated, while those with NS or BH companions remain to be explored further. Aims. We systematically investigate the formation of sdB+NS binaries from binary evolution and aim to obtain some clues for a search for such systems. Methods. We started from a series of MS+NS systems and determined the parameter spaces for producing sdB+NS binaries from the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) channel and from the common envelope (CE) ejection channel. The parameters for sdB+NS binaries were obtained from detailed binary evolution calculation with the code called modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics (MESA), and the CE parameters were given by the standard energy budget for CE evolution. The MS star had an initial mass ranging from 0.8 to 5 Mo. Various NS accretion efficiencies and NS masses were examined to investigate the effects they have. We show the characteristics of the produced sdB+NS systems, such as the mass of components, orbital period, the semi-Amplitude of the radial velocity (K), and the spin of the NS component. Results. sdB+NS binaries can be produced either from stable RLOF or from CE ejection. In the stable RLOF channel, sdBs can be formed when the donor starts mass transfer close to the tip of the giant branch if the donor has an initial mass ≤2:0 Mo. For more massive donors, sdBs can be formed when the donor starts mass transfer during the Hertzsprung gap or near the end of the MS. The orbital period of sdB+NS binaries produced in this way ranges from several days to more than 1000 days and moves toward the short-period (∼hr) side with increasing initial MS mass. The highest K is about 150 km s-1 for an MS star of initially 5 Mo. However, the sdB+NS systems that result from CE ejection have very short orbital periods and then high values of K (up to 800 km s-1). Such systems are born in very young populations (younger than 0.3 Gyr) and are potential gravitational wave sources that might be resolved by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) in the future. Gravitational wave radiation may again bring them into contact on a timescale of only ∼Myr. As a consequence, they are rare and hard to discover. The pulsar signal is likely a feature of sdB+NS systems caused by stable RLOF, and some NS components in sdB binaries may be millisecond pulsars. Various NS accretion efficiencies and NS masses change some properties of sdB+NS binaries, but not our general results. © ESO 2018.","70","White dwarfs","Antennas - Astrophysics - Budget control - Gravitational effects - Gravity waves - Interferometers - Laser interferometry - Mass transfer - Neutrons - Pulsars","Binaries: general - Laser interferometer space antenna - Millisecond pulsars - Population synthesis - Stars: formation - Stars: neutrons - Stellar astrophysics - Subdwarfs","641.3 Mass Transfer - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 931.5 Gravitation, Relativity and String Theory - 941.3 Optical Instruments - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: 2013HA005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 11733008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements.

After 20 days’ degradation in PBS, the drug-loaded fiber meshes still kept their stability with about 10% decrease in tensile strength. In vitro release experiments showed a sustained and steady naringin releasing profile with little initial burst releasing. Compared to the mats without naringin, the fiber mats loaded with naringin showed the most pronounced enhancement of cell growth when MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the fiber mats.

Pathogens are genetically adapted to aggressively colonize and proliferate in host plants to cause disease. However, disease outbreaks occur only under permissive environmental conditions. The interplay between host, pathogen and environment is famously known as the ‘disease triangle’. Among the environmental factors, rainfall events, which often create a period of high atmospheric humidity, have repeatedly been shown to promote disease outbreaks in plants, suggesting that the availability of water is crucial for pathogenesis. During pathogen infection, water-soaking spots are frequently observed on infected leaves as an early symptom of disease. Recent studies have shown that pathogenic bacteria dedicate specialized virulence proteins to create an aqueous habitat inside the leaf apoplast under high humidity. Water availability in the apoplastic environment, and probably other associated changes, can determine the success of potentially pathogenic microbes. These new findings reinforce the notion that the fight over water may be a major battleground between plants and pathogens.

By single factor investigation and response surface methodology optimization, it was found that the liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction time, and extraction temperature were the main factors which affected the extraction yield of LMP. The optimum extraction process was obtained by Box–Behnken design combined with response surface methodology. It was found that, at the condition of liquid-to-solid ratio of 30:1; extraction time of 2.3 hr; and extraction temperature of 90°C, the yield of the LMP could reach 46.56%. Furthermore, by oral administration of LMP, the cyclophosphamide-induced mice showed the proliferation of lymphocyte and the phagocytic capacity of macrophages’ enhancements. The number of white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelets in the peripheral blood were up-regulated; the spleen total superoxide dismutase, Catalase, and Glutathione-peroxidase activities were enhanced, while the Serum malondialdehyde and Triacylglycerols content was reduced. Therefore, our work provided an effective way for extraction of LMP and demonstrated the chemo-protective effects of LMP on the animal level. Practical application: Natural polysaccharides from functional food sources are widely accepted for their bioactive activities. As extraction conditions significantly affected the quality and yield of polysaccharides, the effective extraction process for polysaccharides should be systematically investigated.

Due to the inhomogeneity and strong attenuation of plant stems,the ultrasonic propagation paths in them are more complex than those in the homogeneous medium, which makes the primary ultrasonic echo position difficult to detect. An improved Akaike of information criterion (AIC) was proposed to detect the position of the ultrasonic primary echo in plant stems. First of all, the improved algorithm was analyzed and its accuracy was verified by a set of simulated signals. Then, a set of cutting wood samples was taken to the ultrasonic detection in the process of the water absorption. The results showed that ultrasonic primary echo positions dynamically indicated changes of water content in wood. Finally, living sunflowers with different soil moistures were set to the ultrasonic detection from 09:00 to 19:00 in situ. The results showed that the soil moisture and the primary ultrasonic echo position had the positive correlation. Meanwhile, the results showed the ultrasonic detection of sunflower stems with different soil moistures were significantly distinct. When the soil was short of water, the primary echo position and the soil moisture both fluctuated greatly and accordantly, which was consistent with the physiological activities, switching from drought resistance regulation to normal water absorption and transpiration. In contrast, when the soil moisture was filling, the primary echo position and the soil moisture both vitiated slightly. Under this condition, it was found that the soil moisture reached minimum value and the primary echo position reached maximum values in 11:00-12:00, which were consistent with the dropped water content in stems to the minimum caused by the strongest transpiration at that time. Therefore, the primary echo position of plant stems detected by mixed difference AIC can be a feature to the dynamic detection of the growth status of plant stems. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Method 1:equivalent RI(refractive index) method is used to calculate the liquid phase diffusion coefficient by recording the time-dependent change of a specific refractive index layer during diffusion. Method 2:instantaneous diffusion analytical method is used to determine the liquid diffusion coefficient by reading the relationship between image width and diffusion position in an instantaneous diffusion image. The front liquid core of the DLCL serves as a diffusion cell and a main imaging element, and the rear liquid core serves as an aplanatic auxiliary system. The spherical aberration at a particular thin liquid layer can be reduced as needed with a DLCL, and the spherical aberration advantage within a certain range of refractive index can also be reduced. Both methods have the characteristics of high measurement accuracy. The relative errors between the measured results and the literature values of the two methods are less than 1.3% and 3.9%, respectively, indicating that the measurement system is stable and reliable and the measurement results are accurate when the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient is measured with a DLCL. © 2018, China Science Publishing & Media LTD.

In this study, an integrative method was established to rapidly explore the chemical constituents and metabolites of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and the UNIFI™ software combined with multiple data processing approaches. As a result, a total of 40 compounds, including 9 flavonoids and 31 phenolic acids were identified or tentatively characterized, and five compounds were first reported in Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection. Under the same analysis conditions, 70 compounds have been detected in rats, including 25 prototypes and 45 metabolites. This was the first systematic research study on the metabolic profiling of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection. This study provides valuable chemical information for the quality control and research on pharmacology and mechanism of action of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection.
