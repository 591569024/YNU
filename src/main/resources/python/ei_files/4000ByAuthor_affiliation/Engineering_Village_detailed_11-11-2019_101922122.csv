A silver thin film plays a determining role in the lithium insertion/extraction process and is incorporated between amorphous Si thin film layers (a-Si/Ag/a-Si), which results in not only high and stable capability, but also the best rate performance compared to that of other electrodes. For the electrode of a-Si/Ag/a-Si, a critical thickness of the silver layer (30 nm) is found; in this case, it exhibits the highest capacity retention of 70% after 200 cycles at a current density of 65.2 μA cm−2 within the voltage range of 0.01-1.5 V. It is demonstrated that for the a-Si/Ag/a-Si (140/30/140 nm) electrode, enhanced capacity (∼59.1%) is derived from the buffer effect and excellent conductivity of silver layer.

The role of oxygen vacancies, and the relationship between the oxygen species and catalytic properties of CeO2 and Zr-doped and Y-doped ceria-based materials are investigated in detail. Combining the observed catalytic performance with the characterization results, it can be deemed that surface lattice oxygen plays a critical role in methanethiol catalytic conversion over cerium oxides. Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 shows higher catalytic activity for CH3SH decomposition due to the large amount of surface lattice oxygen, readily available oxygen species, and excellent redox properties. Ce0.75Y0.25O2–δ displays better catalytic stability owing to the greater number of oxygen vacancies that would promote bulk lattice oxygen migration to the surface of the catalyst in order to replenish surface lattice oxygen. In addition, the results show that the difference in chemical valence between Ce and the heteroatoms would strongly influence the amount of surface lattice oxygen as well as the mobility of bulk-phase oxygen in these catalysts, thus affecting their activity and stability. © 2018 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences","58","Oxygen vacancies","Catalyst activity - Cerium oxide - Chemical stability - Decomposition - Yttrium compounds - Zirconium compounds","Base catalyst - Catalytic conversion - Catalytic decomposition - Catalytic performance - Catalytic properties - Heteroatoms - Oxygen migration - Surface lattice","801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 21667016, 21267011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1402233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21667016, 21267011, U1402233).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Furthermore, we propose an improved model based on the simple model that computes the attractiveness measure of nodes by applying time series prediction and takes into account of node in-degrees. Networks generated from our models have a nice property that their in-degree distribution follows the power-law, which desirably characterizes an essential property of social networks. This property is derived by applying the mean-field theory [7].

In order to better cognize the preventive and therapeutic role of barley grass for chronic diseases, we carried out the systematic strategies for functional ingredients of barley grass, based on the comprehensive databases, especially the PubMed, Baidu, ISI Web of Science, and CNKI, between 2008 and 2017. Barley grass is rich in functional ingredients, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), flavonoids, saponarin, lutonarin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), K, Ca, Se, tryptophan, chlorophyll, vitamins (A, B1, C, and E), dietary fiber, polysaccharide, alkaloid, metallothioneins, and polyphenols. Barley grass promotes sleep; has antidiabetic effect; regulates blood pressure; enhances immunity; protects liver; has anti-acne/detoxifying and antidepressant effects; improves gastrointestinal function; has anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antigout effects; reduces hyperuricemia; prevents hypoxia, cardiovascular diseases, fatigue, and constipation; alleviates atopic dermatitis; is a calcium supplement; improves cognition; and so on. These results support that barley grass may be one of the best functional foods for preventive chronic diseases and the best raw material of modern diet structure in promoting the development of large health industry and further reveal that GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K-Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan mechanism of barley grass have preventive and therapeutic role for chronic diseases.

The results showed that the three rivers were mesotrophic, lightly eutrophic and moderately eutrophic respectively. From the south to the north, the water temperature and nutrition showed an increasing trend. In two different seasons, the differences in the water temperature and dissolved oxygen were clear. In the dry season, results of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated that the phytoplankton community structures in the Li River and Qiuxiang River were similar. Regardless of the number of species, the cell abundance or the dominance index, Bacillariophyta were found to be dominant. Chlorophyta was dominant in the Danshui River. In the rainy season, Bacillariophyta, Bacillariophyta-Chlorophyta and Chlorophyta-Cyanophyta became the dominant types in the Li River, Qiuxiang River and Danshui River, respectively.

Soil nutrient availability has the capacity to affect plant-soil feedback. Here, we used sanqi (Panax notoginseng), which is severely threatened by NPSF, as a model plant to decipher the overall effects of nitrogen (N) rates on NPSF and the underlying mechanism. We found that a high rate of N at 450 kg N ha−1 (450 N) aggravated the NPSF through the accumulation of pathogens in the soil compared with the optimal 250 N. The increased N rates resulted in a significant increase in the soil electrical conductivity and available nitrogen but a decrease in the soil pH and C/N ratio. GeoChip 5.0 data demonstrated that these changed soil properties caused the soil to undergo stress (acidification, salinization and carbon starvation), as indicated by the enriched soil microbial gene abundances related to stress response and nutrition cycling (N, C and S). Accordingly, increased N rates reduced the richness and diversity of soil fungi and bacteria and eventually caused a shift in soil microbes from a bacterial-dominant community to a fungal-dominant community. In particular, the high 450 N treatment significantly suppressed the abundance of copiotrophic bacteria, including beneficial genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas, thus weakening the antagonistic activity of these bacteria against fungal pathogens. Moreover, 450 N application significantly enriched the abundance of pathogen pathogenicity-related genes. Once sanqi plants were grown in this N-stressed soil, their host-specific fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum significantly accumulated, which aggravated the process of NPSF. This study suggested that over-application of nitrogen is not beneficial for disease management or the reduction of fungicide application in agricultural production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","72","Soils","Agriculture - Bacteria - Bacteriology - Ecosystems - Fungi - Genes - Nitrogen - Pathogens","Agricultural ecosystems - Agricultural productions - GeoChip - MiSeq sequencing - Panax notoginseng - Soil electrical conductivity - Soil microbial community - Sustainable agriculture","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control","Number: SQ2017YFC170021-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFD0201601-5, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016ZF001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015JY02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31660605, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31772404, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( SQ2017YFC170021-02 and 2017YFD0201601-5 ), the Major Programme for Biomedicine of Yunnan Province ( 2016ZF001 ), the Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31660605 and 31772404 ), and the Programme for Outstanding Talent of Yunnan Agricultural University ( 2015JY02 ).

AO/EtBr staining of TCP-1 cells showed that mangiferin treatment (2 and 4 μM) induced cell death. Mangiferin induces apoptosis through the induction of cas-3 and reduced Bcl-2 expression. It was concluded that mangiferin triggered the apoptotic pathways. It also decreased the viability of TPC-1 cells by suppressing the PCNA. © 2018, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","27","Diseases","Cell culture - Cell death - Cell proliferation - Fluorescence microscopy","Apoptotic pathways - Cell viability - Dietary components - Human thyroid - Inhibitory effect - Mangiferin - PCNA - Thyroid cancers",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The comparison results show that our new approximate method can predict the lightning-radiated field peak value over the intermediate range with a satisfactory accuracy within maximum errors of 0.0%, -3.3%, and -8.7% for the earth conductivity of 4 S/m, 0.01 S/m, and 0.001 S/m, respectively.

The characteristics and chelation mechanisms of β-CDX were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the influences of various operating parameters such as pH (lime dosage), the order of the additions, β-CDX dosage, and the initial concentration of Pb(II) on the removal capacity of β-CDX and the characteristics of the products were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the optimal removal effect for Pb(II) was achieved when β-CDX was used rather than using lime alone. In addition, it was more effective to add β-CDX to the working solutions prior to adding the lime than adding β-CDX after the lime. The use of 0.05 g/L of β-CDX was effective for the removal of Pb(II) according to the residual concentration when the initial concentration was 100 mg/L at different pH values. The maximum removal rate of the Pb(II) ions was 98% for all initial concentrations and the products were larger (size = 137.9 μm) and looser (Df = 1.73) at an optimum pH range from 9 to 12.

The numerical model of fracture mechanics was established to calculate the stress intensity factor of flaw tip. Sieve tests were carried out for the fragments of these specimens after compression-shear tests. The fractal theory was introduced to quantify the compression-shear fragmentation characteristics and its correlation with fracture characteristics was investigated. With the increase of the absolute value of flaw inclination, the shear strength of specimens increases first and then decreases, which breaches the trends of the stress intensity factor of flaw tip and the fractal dimension of fragmentation. The failure generated in the specimen can be classified into three modes, namely mode I(sliding along the flaw), mode II(interlocking) and mode III(cutting through the flaw). The specimen failing in mode I, has a largest stress intensity factor of the flaw tip, resulting in a lowest stress strength. The specimen failing in mode II, has a lowest stress intensity factor of the flaw tip, resulting in a largest stress strength. The specimen failing in mode III, has an intermediate stress intensity factor of the flaw tip, resulting in a stress strength between those in modes I and II. The fragment size distribution of fragments under the compression-shear tests exhibits significant fractal property. The fractal dimensions of these fragmentations are in the range of 2.06 to 2.59, which is similar to those in the fault cores There exists negative correlation between the shear strength of specimen and the fractal dimension of fragmentation. The compression-shear fragmentation characteristics of rock mass are closely related to the flaw geometry, stress condition and fracture characteristics. © 2018, Science Press.

The morphologies and compositions of the as-prepared nanocomposites with core-shell structure are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical experiments, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) are performed to investigate the electrocatalytic properties of the Au-Pt NPs loaded carbon black composites (Au-Pt NPs/V) towards methanol oxidation in an alkaline solution. It is found that the reduction time of AA could regulate the thickness and amount of Pt on the Au nanocores, which significantly affect catalytic activity of the Au-Pt NPs/V toward methanol oxidation. Au-Pt NPs/V with optimum reduction time 4 h exhibit 2.3-times higher electrocatalytic activity than that of a commercial catalyst (Pt/carbon black) and an excellent CO tolerance toward methanol oxidation.

However, our understanding of tree species and recovery time on the restoration of biotic and abiotic soil properties remains incomplete. Topsoil (0–15 cm) was collected from plantations of 4 tree species: alder, acacia, pine, and cypress. A chronosequence of restoration was selected to assess the effect of recovery time: vegetation-free postmining land (unrestored control), 5–10 years (young plantation), and 20–25 years (old plantation). The soil physicochemical characteristics and phospholipid fatty acids were analysed. After 20 years of restoration, the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration increased, on average, from 1.4% to 4.7% for alder, cypress, and acacia. However, SOC was similar under pine plantations in unrestored control and at the late stage of restoration. The restoration of soil total nitrogen was faster than the SOC pools for all tree species investigated. Compared with that in the unrestored control, the total microbial biomass increased by 74% after 20–25 years of restoration. A similar increase was observed for bacterial biomass. The studied sites partly exhibited residues of trace elements that exceeded Chinese environmental quality standards (Cd, As, Cu, and Cr). However, only Cu affected the soil community; arbuscular mycorrhizal biomass decreased with an increase in Cu concentration. In conclusion, the recovery time, rather than the tree species, was the main determinant in the alteration of key soil physicochemical parameters in the restoration of phosphate-mining-degraded landscapes, at least during the first 20–25 years.

Furthermore, the corrosion products of different microstructure were identical, and the white products (Fe(OH)2) of welded joint turned into products of rufous (Fe(OH)3). The quantitative information provided by SVET was discussed, and the corrosion degree was measured by some parameters. In comparison with other areas, the corrosion rates of the overheated zone and the base metal were higher. Then, the corrosion resistance of the weld zone with CMT Twin was greatly improved, when compared with that of the base metal. Therefore, Ni has significant influence on corrosion resistance of weld zone.

The evaluation of bridge structure after a certain period of operation has always been the focus of the bridge. Based on the data collected from the health inspection system of a continuous rigid frame bridge on a highway in Yunnan, China, it is found that there is a certain linear relationship between the deformation and stress of the bridge structure. In view of a specific section of the structure, the stress value of this section can be derived according to its deformation value. The coefficient K can be calculated by comparing the estimated value to the actual measured value. According to the range of the K value, the structural state of the bridge can be evaluated to a certain extent. © 2018 The Authors.","6","Deformation",,"Bridge structures - Continuous rigid frame bridges - Deformation and stress - Deformation stress - Inspection system - Linear relationships - Measured values - Structural state",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A corresponding numerical analysis method was established and implemented into the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The accuracy of the proposed model was verified by the numerical simulation of a long-term creep test of simply supported reinforced concrete(RC) beams. The time-varying spatial stress in the box girders and the long-term deflection at the mid-span were analyzed by taking a continuous rigid frame bridge with the main span of 220 m as an example. The results show that the 3D characteristic of shrinkage is the main cause of the excessive tensile stress at the concrete joints of box girders. The 3D characteristics of SC and the nonlinear property of creep need to be comprehensively considered when analyzing the long-term deflection of box girders; otherwise the deflection is significantly underestimated. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

Fullerene derivatives bearing either an alkyl side chain or ethylene glycol (EG) side chains of different lengths are used as the host molecules for molecular doping. It is found that the polar EG side chains can enable better miscibility with the polar dopant than the alkyl side chain, which leads to more than 5-fold enhancement of doping efficiency. Beyond the doping efficiency, another crucial parameter of molecular doping, the molecular order, is readily acquired by simultaneous control of the polarity and the length of the side chain. A polar side chain with an appropriate chain length can contribute to increasing Seebeck coefficients of doped fullerene derivatives more effectively than an alkyl side chain, likely due to the resultant good miscibility and high molecular order. As a result, an optimized power factor of 23.1 μW m-1 K-2 is achieved in the fullerene derivative with a tetraethylene glycol side chain. This represents one of the best n-type organic thermoelectrics. Additionally, EG side chains can improve the air stability of n-doped fullerene derivatives films as compared to an alkyl side chain. Our work sheds light on the design of side-chains in efficient n-type small molecules thermoelectric materials and contributes to the understanding of their thermoelectric properties. © 2018","54","Chains","Chain length - Charge transfer - Efficiency - Electric conductivity - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Fullerenes - Molecules - Polyols - Semiconductor doping - Solubility - Thermoelectric equipment - Thermoelectricity","Fullerene derivative - Molecular ordering - n-Type doping - Simultaneous control - Tetraethylene glycols - Thermo-Electric materials - Thermoelectric properties - Thermoelectrics","602.1 Mechanical Drives - 615.4 Thermoelectric Energy - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: -, Acronym: FOM, Sponsor: Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter; Number: -, Acronym: FOM, Sponsor: Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter; Number: -, Acronym: NWO, Sponsor: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; Number: -, Acronym: NWO, Sponsor: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; ","This work is part of the research programme of the Foundation of Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM), which is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

The lattice Boltzmann method is applied to study the seepage behavior in the macropores of well vegetated slope soil. The results show that the preferential flow is formed in the channel with good longitudinal connectivity, and the flow velocity in the channel is larger than that of other regions. In the closed macropores or these with poor connectivity, the water conductivity is small and the flow velocity almost equals to zero. The flow velocity in the channel increases gradually from the wall of macropores to the center of the channel, and the relationship between flow velocity and distance to the center of channel is approximately quadratic parabola. Along the depth direction, the section with larger macropores porosity has the faster average seepage velocity of Uz. Overall, there is the similar trend for the section macropores porosity and the average seepage velocity, which indicates that the distribution of macropores in the well vegetated slope soil influences significantly on the seepage characteristics along the depth direction. © 2018, Science Press.

In addition, the risk resistance ability is quantitatively measured by the two derived parameters in the model. They control the super-exponential growth of price and describe the log-periodic acceleration of volatility, respectively. Further, we select the Shanghai Zinc (SZ) futures and the Shanghai Aluminum (SA) futures in Shanghai Futures Exchange as the objectives to empirically study their risk resistance ability during the above mentioned periods. Then, some interesting findings are concluded as follows: (1) For the China's metal futures, the bubble risks last longer than the anti-bubble risks before and after the two financial crises. (2) The China's metal futures have risk resistance ability in anti-bubble, but the ability is relatively weaker in bubble before and after the two financial crises. (3) The LPPLS model can efficiently predict and measure the bubble and anti-bubble of the financial products. It also gives us an access to observe the risk resistance ability of financial products by the derived parameters. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","37","Risk assessment","Finance - Metals - Risk analysis","Bubble - Derived parameters - Financial bubble - Financial crisis - Financial products - Log-periodic power law - Resistance analysis - Super-exponential growths","914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922 Statistical Methods","Number: 2016T90864, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2015M570792, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2017FB102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 18YJC790118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 71561026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 71561026 ]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Nos. 2015M570792 , 2016T90864 ]; Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [No. 18YJC790118 ]; and Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province [No. 2017FB102 ].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Based on the decomposed time series and the copula dependence, the Value-at-Risk (VaR), conditional VaR (CoVaR) and delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR) are quantified to analyze the upside and downside risk spillovers from oil market to China stock market in raw, short- and long-run investment horizons before and after the financial crisis. The empirical results show that, first, the recent financial crisis enhances the dependences between the crude oil market and China stock market, and the long-run dependence increases more significantly than that of short-run. For the raw return series, there are symmetric upper and lower tail dependencies in full sample and pre-crisis subsample periods, but an average dependence in post-crisis subsample period. Second, the VaR of China stock market increases heavily around the financial crisis, but the average VaR after the crisis deceases compared to the risk before the crisis. Third, the risk spillovers from crude oil price to China stock market are found in each sample periods. Before the crisis, however, it mainly exists in long-run horizon, while after the crisis, it happens in both short- and long-run horizons. Finally, the risk spillovers from oil price to China stock market display strong asymmetric features, with larger long-term, downside risk spillovers in post-crisis subsample. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","57","Investments","Commerce - Crude oil - Financial markets - Value engineering","China stock markets - Copula - CoVaR - Crude oil market - Mode decomposition","512.1 Petroleum Deposits - 911.5 Value Engineering","Number: 71671145, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71371157, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 16YJA790062, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: 17YJA790015, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: 17XJA790002, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","We would like to show our sincere gratitude to two anonymous reviewers, as well as Professor R.S.J.

However, the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells depends on the real incidence angle instead of the projection incidence angle, thus 2-D models can't reasonably evaluate the photovoltaic performance of CPC-based photovoltaic systems (CPVs). In this work, three-dimensional radiation transfer (3-D model) within CPC-θa/θe, the CPC with a maximum exit angle θe for radiation within its acceptance angle (θa), is investigated by means of vector algebra, solar geometry and imaging principle of plane mirror, and effects of geometry of CPV-θa/θe on its annual electricity generation are studied. Analysis shows that, as compared to similar photovoltaic (PV) panels, the use of CPCs makes the incident angle of solar rays on solar cells increase thus lowers the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of solar cells. Calculations show that, 2-D models can reasonably predict the optical performance of CPVs, but such models always overestimate the photovoltaic performance of CPVs, and even can't predict the variation trend of annual power output of CPV-θa/θe with θe. Results show that, for full CPV-θa/θe with a given θa, the annual power output increases with θe first and then comes to a halt as θe > 83, whereas for truncated CPV-θa/θe with a given geometric concentration (Ct), the annual power output decreases with θe © 2018 by the authors.","35","Solar cells","Concentration (process) - Efficiency - Geometry - Photovoltaic cells - Radiation effects - Solar power generation - Thermoelectric power","Compound parabolic concentrator - Concentrating photovoltaic systems - Photovoltaic performance - Theoretical analysis - Three dimensional radiation","615.2 Solar Power - 702.3 Solar Cells - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921 Mathematics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgments: This work is partial fulfillment of funded program 51466016, financially supported by Nature Science Foundation of China.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results are summarized as follows: (1) Fluid inclusions in Tianbaoshan deposit have medium-low homogenization temperatures and medium salinities, and ore-forming fluids are mainly derived from basin brine, whereas fluid inclusions in Huize deposit represent high-medium homogenization temperatures and medium salinities, and ore-forming fluids are dominantly derived from basin brine, but with evidence for mixing of different fluids. (2) The values of 3He/4He in Tianbaoshan deposit and Huize deposit range from 0.02 to 0.32 Ra (where Ra is the atmospheric value; 3He/4He = 1.4×10-6), indicating that the ore-forming fluids are dominated by continental crust fluids, where as a small but clear mantle helium contribution is present.

We took the highly sensitive region as the regional constraint document in the CLUE-S model to highlight the key areas of ecological protection in the studied area. Based on the comprehensive ecological sensitivity zoning as the driving force factor affecting the land use change in the study area, a land use scenario simulation method was proposed in which the ecological sensitivity was integrated into the land use spatial pattern optimization configuration process and results. With the use of land use data in 2006 and 2016, the land use spatial pattern of 2025 in the two modes of natural development scenarios and land ecological optimization scenarios in Jiangchuan District would be optimized. The simulation results of optimized configuration were analyzed and validated based on ecological sensitivity partition. The results showed that by selecting five secondary indicators of soil erosion intensity, land use type, vegetation coverage, distance from water source and disaster susceptibility, we constructed a watershed ecological sensitivity evaluation index system. Jiangchuan District's ecological sensitivity was mainly moderate or above sensitivity, and the area was 57 111.37 hm2, accounting for 70.91% of the total area of Jiangchuan District. According to the results of ecological sensitivity assessment, Jiangchuan District was divided into highly sensitive, moderately sensitive, mildly sensitive and non-sensitive, and it was divided into ecological protection core area, control development area and suitable development area. In addition, based on the 2006 land use data, and use of the CLUE-S model, the spatial pattern of land use in Jiangchuan District in 2016 was simulated. Compared with the land use data in 2016, the correct raster number of the simulation results accounted for 81.59% of the total number of grids. The Kappa coefficient was 0.779 1, and the CLUE-S model can be used to simulate the spatial pattern of land use in Jiangchuan District in 2025. Moreover, in the two scenarios, the land use pattern of Jiangchuan District in 2025 had both common features and differences. In the two scenarios, the original forest land, farmland, unused land and urban and residential land pattern were effectively protected, but the spatial distribution patterns of newly added forest land and grassland were different. The results of the optimal allocation of land use spatial pattern in Jiangchuan District in 2025 were verified. According to the distribution of major land use types in different sensitive areas in 2025 and the land use status in 2016, the spatial pattern of land use in Scenario 2 was better than natural development scenarios and the status of land use in 2016. The research results showed that the land ecological optimization scenario was more reasonable, which not only could reduce the area of cultivated land, but also consider the needs of ecological protection and urban development. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO2e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO2e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO2e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

The refining effect was experimentally studied using these two methods, and the best parameters were determined. The predictions are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, a new, clean and efficient process for refining crude lead was developed.

Firstly, the fingerprint image was considered as a non-stationary 2D signal and was transformed to Fourier domain by short time Fourier transform analysis. Subsequently, a creative angular and radial estimation method was proposed to calculate the orientation and the frequency images of the fingerprint in Fourier domain after performing root filtering and morphological filtering. Finally, based on the curvature of fingerprint, a Butterworth notch band pass filter and a Gaussian band pass filter were applied to filter the low curvature area and the high curvature area, respectively, which can effectively remove the noise in the singular area and non-singular area while remaining the main frequency pattern. The proposed method was subjectively and objectively compared with approaches in literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is of better performance than the compared methods since it can remove noise, enhance the contrast between ridge and valley of fingerprint and simultaneously preserve the correct ridge direction. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

In this work, pore-forming mechanism of microwave-activated GRM and its effect for the removal of a cationic dye (methylene blue, MB) from aqueous solution were investigated. The results of dielectric properties of GRM and red mud in microwave field reveal that the addition of starch can effectively improve the microwave absorbing properties of the GRM sample. In addition, it is found that microwave-activated GRM adsorbent contains more pores and larger BET surface area than conventional-activated GRM adsorbent. The pore-forming mechanism of GRM by microwave activation is explained by the existence of temperature gradient and good absorbing properties of H2O vapor and starch. The adsorption experiment results show that the MB removal rate of the microwave-activated GRM can reach 82% within 15 min, while the conventional-activated GRM requires 180 min to reach the same MB removal effect when the initial MB concentration is 60 mg L-1. Langmuir model is found to represent the adsorption isotherm of MB on GRM better than Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity at 25 °C is 16.005 mg MB/1 g GRM.

However, the pre-Trained CNN model always has a limited ability to be spatially invariant to the image as the convolutional layers are not invariant to general affine transformations, such as rotation and scale. This scenario will extremely affect the generalization ability of the trained CNNs. In this work, we address this problem by leveraging recent advances in spatial transform network (STN) and XGBoost. Specifically, we propose a framework which consists of an embedded STN and XGBoost for learning the geometric invariance features and discrimination representation of the image data. We firstly establish a CNN embedding a STN to effectively extract the geometric invariance features of input image; then instead of employing the conventional softmax unit as the classifier, we adopt the high-efficient and faster XGBoost as the discrimination representation of the learned features. We conduct a series of experiments based on benchmark dataset Fashion MNIST to verify the effectiveness of our framework. The results demonstrate that our method can not only learn the geometric invariance features of input images, but also have a superior performance for the discriminate representation of the learned features, compared with recent several representative methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","11","Mathematical transformations","Convolution - Discriminators - Geometry - Image classification - Neural networks","Affine transformations - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Discrimination representation - Generalization ability - Geometric invariance - Hierarchical features - Spatial transform - XGBoost","713.3 Modulators, Demodulators, Limiters, Discriminators, Mixers - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The absorption peak is excited by the localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes resonance. In order to reveal the resonant electromagnetic mechanism and research the effects of structural parameters variations on the resonant absorption peak, two sets of simulations were carried out. It was found that with increasing the vertical distance V, the absorption peak is enhanced and a new absorption band is achieved when V=160 nm. In the second simulations, for the increase in horizontal distance H, the absorption peak is also enhanced and another new absorption band is achieved when H=190 nm.

The results demonstrate that electromagnetic stirring and the thermal parameters of directional solidification played different roles in the crystal separation of TiSi2. While the electromagnetic stirring enhanced the migration of TiSi2crystals in the Ti–Si melt and mushy zone, low downward rates (5 μm/s) were beneficial for the growth of TiSi2crystals and reduced the mushy zone area.

When independently participating in spot market bidding, downstream stations with poor regulation, whose power generation is determined by upstream power stations, will face the problem of imbalance between bidding quantity and real quantity, resulting in difficulty of executing the transaction result, and which is detrimental to market stability and water resources utilization. Therefore, a day-ahead market clearing model with multi-operator cascade hydropower stations participating is proposed, in which, the downstream station is a price-taker with no need for declaring the power generation, and its bidding quantity is represented as a linear function about upstream station's bidding quantity. According to hydraulic coupling relationship of upstream and downstream stations, the linear function is embedded into the day-ahead clearing optimal model to realize joint clearing of upstream and downstream stations. The effect of water flow delay between upstream and downstream stations to downstream stations is mainly discussed and considered in the day-ahead market clearing process.

Most of the conventional manifold learning methods are subjected to the choice of parameters. In this paper, we present a Regularized Locality Projection based on Sparsity Discriminant Analysis (RLPSD) method for Feature Extraction (FE) to understand the high-dimensional data such as face images. In RLPSD, firstly, we show the sparse representation of training samples by collaborative representation-based classification (CRC). Secondly, the idea of part optimization based on sparse representation is used to ensure the within-class compactness which combines with the labels of measurements and the weights of sparse presentation can be as small as possible. Finally, whole optimization can be directly obtained without the iteration of local optimization. Meanwhile, the separability information of between-class can be well discriminated by scatter matrix which is similar to Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

We aim to find more eclipsing multiple systems and obtain their parameters, thus increasing our understanding of multiple systems. Methods. The extraneous eclipses on the Kepler binary light curves indicating extraneous bodies were searched. The binary light curves were analyzed using the binary model, and the extraneous eclipses were studied on their periodicity and shape changes. Results. Three binaries with extraneous eclipses on the binary light curves were found and studied based on the Kepler observations. The object KIC 5255552 is an eclipsing triple system with a fast changing inner binary and an outer companion uncovered by three groups of extraneous eclipses of 862.1(±0.1) d period. The KIC 10091110 is suggested to be a double eclipsing binary system with several possible extraordinary coincidences: the two binaries share similar extremely small mass ratios (0.060(13) and 0.0564(18)), similar mean primary densities (0.3264(42) ρoand 0.3019(28) ρo), and, most notably, the ratio of the two binaries' periods is very close to integer 2 (8.5303353/4.2185174 = 2.022). The KIC 11495766 is a probable triple system with a ∼120.73 d period binary and (at least) one non-eclipse companion. Furthermore, very close to it in the celestial sphere, there is a blended background stellar binary of 8.3404432 d period. A first list of 25 eclipsing multiple candidates is presented, with the hope that it will be beneficial for study of eclipsing multiples. © ESO 2018.","37","Astrophysics","Astronomy","Binaries:eclipsing - Binary models - Celestial sphere - Eclipsing binaries - Methods:observational - Multiple systems - Techniques: photometric - Triple system","657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena","Number: KGZD-EW-603, Acronym: SUSE, Sponsor: Sichuan University of Science and Engineering; Number: 2015RC42, Acronym: SUSE, Sponsor: Sichuan University of Science and Engineering; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2012HC011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XDB09010202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 11403056, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11703082, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11325315, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11133007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1631108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Joint Fund of Astronomy; Number: Y5XB071001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements.

This is the first study to investigate the distribution of PAHs in paired samples of maternal blood, placenta tissue, and umbilical cord blood in relation to pregnancy complications. Sixty-four pairs of samples were collected in Kunming, China; 18 were from healthy pregnant women and 46 were from patients with pregnancy complications. The predominant PAHs in these pregnant women were high-molecular-weight (HMW) compounds, mainly from the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of biomass. In the control group, the total amount of HMW compounds (ΣHMWPAHs) was significantly higher in maternal blood than in umbilical cord blood, which suggested that placenta may decrease PAH transfer in healthy pregnant women. However, this phenomenon was not observed for low-molecular-weight PAHs or in the case group. In the control group, Σ16PAH and ΣHMWPAH in the placenta were higher than those in maternal blood and umbilical cord blood; for the case group, a contrasting result was observed. ΣHMWPAHs in the placenta was significantly higher in the control group than in the case group. The same results were observed after the exclusion of the impact of the genotypes of the PAH metabolic enzymes (both phase I and phase II enzymes). Thus, the decreased PAH transfer from mother to fetus may partially result from the accumulation of PAHs inside the placenta. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","33","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Aromatization - Blood - Enzymes - Hydrocarbons - Molecular weight - Obstetrics","Genetic polymorphisms - High molecular weight - Incomplete combustion - Low molecular weight - Placenta function/barrier - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) - Pregnancy complications - Umbilical cord blood","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","","This research was supported by the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (41725016, U1602231 and 41663013), Yunnan International Cooperation project (2017IB004) and Provincial Innovation Team (2017HC008).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

When the color difference between the left and right eyes exceeds a threshold value, named binocular color fusion limit, color rivalry is said to occur. The most important information brought by stereoscopic displays is the depth perception produced by the disparity. As the stereo pair stimuli are presented separately to both eyes with disparities and those two monocular stimuli differ in color but share an iso-luminance polarity, it is possible for stereopsis and color rivalry to coexist. In this paper, we conducted an experiment to measure the color fusion limit for different disparity levels. In particular, it examines how the magnitude and sign of disparity affect the binocular color fusion limit that yields a fused, stable stereoscopic percept. The binocular color fusion limit was measured at five levels of disparities: 0, ±60, ±120 arc minutes for a sample color point which was selected from the 1976 CIE u'v' chromaticity diagram. The experimental results showed that fusion limit for the sample point varied with the level and sign of disparity. It was an interesting result that the fusion limit increased as the disparity decreases at crossed disparity direction (sign -), but there is almost no big change at uncrossed disparity direction (sign +). We found that color fusion was more difficult to achieve at the crossed disparity direction than at the uncrossed disparity direction. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The drug-loaded micelles were obtained with 92.30 ± 3.28% of encapsulation efficiency being higher than that obtained from F127 due to additional cyclodextrin inclusion. Fourier transformation infrared spectrometry and diffraction scanning calorimetry analysis tests demonstrated that honokiol was successfully encapsulated into the conjugate micelles in the amorphous or solid solution state because of their interactions. Meanwhile, in vitro antifungal activity experiment indicated that the MIC90 of drug-loaded micelles was 64 μg/mL, showing the same antifungal activity as pure honokiol although it obviously retarded honokiol’s release. In vivo pharmacokinetic results confirmed that in vivo area under curve and apparent distribution volume of honokiol in drug-loaded micelles were 2- and 1.69-folds higher than that for pure honokiol, with its obvious prolonged mean retention time and half-life period, respectively. The clearance rate of honokiol was also shortened about 2-fold in comparison with pure honokiol when encapsulated into the micelles.

However, high cost and secondary pollution of regeneration for the adsorbent limit the further application in organic wastewater treatment. To address this problem, the adsorbent of MT modified by reversible surfactant [(11-Ferrocenylundecyl) trimethylammonium bromide (FTMA)] (FTMA-MT) was prepared, and the reversible characteristic and the adsorption mechanism of FTMA-MT for phenol as a representative were investigated. Cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrated that FTMA-MT represented a good electrochemically reversible characteristic. Comparison of the oxidation state of FTMA-MT, reductive FTMA-MT manifested prominent adsorption capacity that was higher compared to that of MT modified by traditional surfactants with the similar carbon chain length. The mechanism for the adsorption can be attributed to partition. The adsorption process was spontaneous and conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The desorption from FTMA-MT can be achieved by the electrochemical control switching its reduction state and oxidation state, and the desorption efficiency was up to 65%. Even after five cycles, the adsorption amounts of FTMA-MT for phenol were comparable with those of the traditional surfactants-modified MT. This is the first to report the adsorption behavior for phenol using reversible surfactant-modified MT, and this study also provides an innovative way for regeneration of adsorbents by chemical triggers altering the polarity of surfactant moieties. © 2017","49","Adsorption","Adsorbents - Clay minerals - Cyclic voltammetry - Desorption - Nanocomposites - Organic pollutants - Phenols - Surface active agents - Thermodynamics - Wastewater treatment","Electrochemical control - Modified montmorillonite - Organic wastewater - Organic wastewater treatment - Organo-modified montmorillonites - Pseudo second order kinetics - Regeneration - Reversible adsorption","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 482.2 Minerals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 41761072, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21707058, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21777064, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41761072 ; 21707058 ; 21777064 ).

The results show that spray tip penetration distance of the biodiesel spray droplets increases while the mean diameter decreases with an increase in the atomized air velocity. The axial velocity of the atomized air is significantly reduced within the bubble generated at the nozzle tip and the axial velocity is 0 m/s when the distance between the nozzle tip and bottom of the bubble is 10–12 mm.

In this paper, we use the classification of machine learning to model and analyze the multi-dimensional cloud resource allocation problem and propose two resource allocation prediction algorithms based on linear and logistic regressions. By learning a small-scale training set, the prediction model can guarantee that the social welfare, allocation accuracy, and resource utilization in the feasible solution are very close to those of the optimal allocation solution.

However, there also exist demerits that neglect the effects of the intermediate principal stress and represent a non-smoothness shape in the deviatoric plane. After reviewing the history of the development of the Hoek-Brown criterion briefly, a modified Hoek-Brown criterion was proposed by the combination of a versatile deviatoric function and a meridian function of the original Hoek-Brown criterion. The new deviatoric function, which was proposed by introducing an extra strength parameter α into the one of Matsuoka-Nakai (MN) criterion and behaviors as well as the one proposed by Bigoni and Piccolroaz, is a generalization of deviatoric shapes belonging to several classic strength criteria, i.e. Drucker-Prager (DP), Tresca, Mohr-Coulomb (MC), Lade-Duncan (LD), Matsuoka-Nakai (MN) and Ottosen strength criterion. The procedure for determination of the strength parameters was demonstrated in detail. Comparisons between the derived criterion and true triaxial test data of KTB amphibolite, Westerly granite, Dunham dolomite, Mizuho Trachyte were presented in three-dimensional principal stress space qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall predicted errors were also compared with the ones obtained by the generalized Zhang-Zhu criterion (Z-Z) as well as its modifications (S-D, E-D, H-D), which showed least error for each rock type by the modification in this paper. The effect of the intermediate principal stress was also discussed for these four rock types, confirming that the intermediate principal stress is included in the strength criterion. The derived criterion not only maintains the features in the meridian plane of the original Hoek-Brown criterion, but solves the non-smoothness problem in the deviatoric plane and shows an excellent performance for describing brittle and ductile rock types considered. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","42","Compressive strength","Minerals - Rocks","Convexity - Failure envelope - Intermediate principal stress - Principal stress space - Smoothness - Strength criteria - Three-dimensional strength - Uniaxial compressive strength","482.2 Minerals","Number: Z151100000315014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Outstanding Talent Training Foundation; Number: 51774020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51774020 ) and Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talent in S & T ( Z151100000315014 ).

In this study, dye tracer experiments were conducted in the field to assess the effects of roots with various morphometric features on soil water flow behavior and soil infiltrability. Preferential flow is the dominant type of water flow in the three study sites (Minqin, Dongtai, and Mengla). The presence of roots caused noncapillary porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity to increase by 26% and 252% in the Minqin, 92% and 93% in the Dongtai, and 234% and 96% in the Mengla, respectively, relative to that in in soils without roots. The various morphometric features of roots affect water flow behavior in soil. The fibrous roots of maize induced water to flow and distribute evenly throughout the plough layer of the study site in Minqin. Furrows and ridges in this site exhibited different soil physical and hydrological properties. Furrows could store higher amounts of water than ridges, thereby increasing the likelihood of water absorption by plants. In Dongtai, ponding and surface runoff occurred when water infiltration was inhibited by the mud layer, which exhibited a high soil bulk density value of 1.43 g cm−3and a low saturated hydraulic conductivity value of 1.67 × 10−5cm s−1. These phenomena were not observed in plots the smooth roots of Spartina alterniflora penetrated the mud layer. In this site, preferential flow and lateral flow, which is triggered by the sandy loam layer, are important for water discharge from the beach to the ocean. In Mengla, water flowed evenly on hard soil, which exhibited a high bulk density value of 1.43 g cm−3. The fine roots of rubber could guide water infiltration into deep soil layers (73.54 cm), thereby redistributing water to the root zones of rubber trees. Therefore, our findings indicated that water infiltration behavior, which is crucial for water distribution, is affected by the various morphometric features of roots. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","58","Infiltration","Groundwater flow - Hydraulic conductivity - Rubber - Soil moisture - Water absorption - Water supply systems","Capillary force - Dye tracer - Matrix flow - Preferential flows - Rhizopore","444.2 Groundwater - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 632.1 Hydraulics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 818.1 Natural Rubber","Number: 2014HB042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 135-Program, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017XTBG-F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41701029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31570622, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the Central Laboratory of XTBG for their help.
