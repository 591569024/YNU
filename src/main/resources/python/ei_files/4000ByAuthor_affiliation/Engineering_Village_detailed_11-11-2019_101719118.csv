The supported catalyst showed superior catalytic performance towards the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4 at room temperature. The total rate of hydrogen generation and activation energy were calculated to be 1403 ml H2 gcat −1 min−1 and 49.2 kJ mol−1, respectively, which were comparable to the values of most cobalt-based catalyst reported for hydrogen production from hydrolysis of NaBH4. Additionally, reusability test revealed that the hydrogen in NaBH4 substrate could be completely released within 25 min with a minimum hydrogen generation rate of 832 ml H2 gcat −1 min−1 even after five runs of hydrolytic reaction, implying the as-prepared Co/Fe3O4@C composite could be considered as a promising candidate catalyst for portable hydrogen fuel system such as PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cells). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","68","Hydrogen production","Activation energy - Amorphous carbon - Catalyst supports - Chemical analysis - Cobalt - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Fourier series - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydrolysis - Impregnation - Metal ions - Metal nanoparticles - Nanocatalysts - Nanomagnetics - Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) - Reusability - Scanning electron microscopy - Shells (structures) - Sodium Borohydride - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction","Catalytic performance - Cobalt-based catalysts - Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy - Hydrogen generations - Physical chemical property - TEM (transmission electron microscopy) - Wetness impregnation - Xrd (x ray diffraction)",,"Number: 201508535037, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: MOTIE, Sponsor: Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; Number: -, Acronym: KETEP, Sponsor: Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning; Number: 20174010201160, Acronym: MOTIE, Sponsor: Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; Number: -, Acronym: KETEP, Sponsor: Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning; ","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20174010201160 ), and China Scholarship Council (No. 201508535037 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The projections of two spheres under a paracatadioptric camera are classified into three cases: Intersection, tangency, and separation. Methods for obtaining the principal point are proposed for each case. When the principal point is known, an analysis of the geometric relationship of the two spheres on the unit viewing sphere model shows that their tangent lines at the antipodal points are parallel. Based on this geometric relationship, the vanishing line of the plane containing the projection circle can be determined to yield the imaged circular points and obtain the remaining intrinsic camera parameters. When the principal point is unknown, the intersection points of two groups of parallel projection circles of the two spheres on the unit viewing sphere model combine with their corresponding antipodal points to form a rectangle; hence, the vanishing point in the orthogonal directions can be determined. Finally, the intrinsic camera parameters can be obtained by applying the constraints of the vanishing points in orthogonal directions to the absolute conic. Simulation results and real image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","36","Spheres","Calibration - Computer vision - Video cameras","Circular points - Geometric relationships - Intersection points - Intrinsic camera parameters - Orthogonal directions - Paracatadioptric cameras - Parallel projection - Vanishing point",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the most existing techniques in many cases cannot gain good fusion performance and acceptable complexity simultaneously. In order to improve image fusion efficiency and performance, we propose a lightweight multi-focus image fusion scheme based on Laplacian pyramid transform (LPT) and adaptive pulse coupled neural networks-local spatial frequency (PCNN-LSF), and it only needs to deal with fewer sub-images than common methods. The proposed scheme employs LPT to decompose a source image into the corresponding constituent sub-images. Spatial frequency (SF) is calculated to adjust the linking strength β of PCNN according to the gradient features of the sub-images. Then oscillation frequency graph (OFG) of the sub-images is generated by PCNN model. Local spatial frequency (LSF) of the OFG is calculated as the key step to fuse the sub-images. Incorporating LSF of the OFG into the fusion scheme (LSF of the OFG represents the information of its regional features); it can effectively describe the detailed information of the sub-images. LSF can enhance the features of OFG and makes it easy to extract high quality coefficient of the sub-image. The experiments indicate that the proposed scheme achieves good fusion effect and is more efficient than other commonly used image fusion algorithms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","38","Image fusion","Image enhancement - Image processing - Laplace transforms - Neural networks - Object recognition","Efficiency and performance - Fusion performance - Image fusion algorithms - Laplacian Pyramid - Multifocus image fusion - Oscillation frequency - Pulse coupled neural network - Spatial frequency",,"Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: 61640306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

Here, we propose a novel multivariate time series clustering method using multi-nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) in multi-relational networks. Specifically, a set of multivariate time series is transformed from the time-space domain into a multi-relational network in the topological domain. Then, the multi-relational network is factorized to identify time series clusters. The transformation from the time-space domain to the topological domain benefits from the ability of networks to characterize both the local and global relationships between the nodes, and MNMF incorporates inter-similarity across distinct variates into clustering. Furthermore, to trace the evolutionary trends of clusters, time series is transformed into a dynamic multi-relational network, thereby extending MNMF to dynamic MNMF.

This paper presents a method to perform scene classification under unsupervised clustering environment. A holistic representation of the Spatial Envelope has been proposed to model the scene. One drawback of Spatial Envelope features is that it uses R, G, and B channels separately to extract features for processing. However, individual R, G, and B channels cannot describe color visual information of the image accurately. In this paper, a novel different color channel generated with Fibonacci lattice color quantization indexes is applied to generate Spatial Envelope features to address this drawback. An unsupervised clustering method named as Hyperclique Pattern-KMEANS (HP-KMEANS) is proposed to automatically select constraints for image clustering. Evaluation of the proposed feature extraction algorithm shows promising results for natural scene classification. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","26","Color","Artificial intelligence - Classification (of information) - Cluster analysis - Semantics","Automatic clustering - Clustering - Color quantization - Feature extraction algorithms - Hyperclique pattern - Scene classification - Unsupervised clustering - Unsupervised clustering methods","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 741.1 Light/Optics","Number: 81729003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61563055, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61563055, 81729003).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Arthrobotrys oligospora is a representative nematode-trapping fungus that can produce adhesive networks to capture nematodes. In this study, the roles of two Rab GTPases AoRab-7A and AoRab-2 were characterized by gene knockout in the fungus A. oligospora. The disruption of AoRab-7A hindered the mycelial growth in different media, the conidiation of ΔAoRab-7A transformants was almost abolished, and the transcription of four sporulation-related genes (AbaA, FluG, Hyp1, and VosA) was downregulated compared to the wild-type strain (WT). Furthermore, the tolerance of the ΔAoRab-7A mutants to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and H2O2 was also significantly reduced compared to the WT, and the transcription of several genes related to environmental resistance, such as genes for catalase and trehalose synthase, was downregulated. Similarly, the extracellular proteolytic activity was decreased. Importantly, the ΔAoRab-7A mutants were unable to produce traps and capture nematodes. However, the disruption of gene AoRab-2 only affected the conidiation slightly but non-significantly, while other phenotypic traits were unaffected. Moreover, the gene AoRab-7A was also involved in the autophagy induced by nitrogen deprivation in A. oligospora. Our results revealed for the first time that the Rab GTPases are involved in the regulation of mycelial growth, conidiation, trap formation, stress resistance, and pathogenicity in the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","60","Transcription","Enzyme activity - Fungi - Polymerase chain reaction - Sodium dodecyl sulfate - Sulfur compounds","Arthrobotrys oligospora - Mutant - Phenotypic characteristic - Rab GTPase - Real-time PCR",,"Number: 2016FB044, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Basic Research Programs of Sichuan Province; Number: 2013CB127503, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: U1402265, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 31272093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding information The research described here is jointly supported by the NSFC-Yunnan Joint Fund (U1402265), the National Basic Research Program of China (2013CB127503), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (approved nos. 31272093, 31360019, and 31560025), the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University (to Jinkui Yang), and the General Program of the Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (approval no. 2016FB044).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A series of OFs were established under multiple scales of composite windows by using gradient based method and a coarse OF was estimated by using the weight of each scale determined by a squared gradient consistency.b. The OF was first quantized into two digitized orientation zones and the two-orientation-zone filtering was adapted to the OF blocks based on a filtering mask obtained after eliminating the isolated blocks.In the end a similar three- digitized-orientation-zone filtering were performed to obtain an accurate and smooth OF.To validate the performance,the proposed method was applied to OF computation using the FVC2004 databases.The experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods according to their performance in OF computation.The proposed method can correct spurious ridge structure and meanwhile avoid singularity deviation compared with the previous works. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Traditional word segmentation techniques attempt to discern the word units accurately from texts; however, they are unable to appropriately and efficiently identify all new words. Identification of new words, especially in languages such as Chinese, remains a challenge. In recent years, word embedding methods have used numerical word vectors to retain the semantic and correlated information between words in a corpus. In this article, we propose the word-embedding-based method (WEBM), a novel method that combines word embedding and frequent n-gram string mining for discovering new words from domain corpora. First, we mapped all word units in a domain corpus to a high-dimension word vector space. Second, we used a frequent n-gram word string mining method to identify a set of candidates for new words. We designed a pruning strategy based on the word vectors to quantify the possibility of a word string being a new word, thereby allowing the evaluation of candidates based on the similarity of word units in the same string. In a comparative study, our experimental results revealed that WEBM had a great advantage in detecting new words from massive Chinese corpora. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.",,"Numerical methods","Computational linguistics - Information retrieval - Mining - Natural language processing systems - Semantics - Vector spaces","Comparative studies - High dimensions - New word detections - Pruning strategy - Similarity measurements - Similarity of words - Word embedding - Word segmentation","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2017DS012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: 2018HB, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Major Discipline Academic and Technical Leaders Training Program of Jiangxi Province; Number: 2018XKJC04, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: MCM20170505, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FA034, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 17GLB009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Canon Foundation for Scientific Research; Number: 71671027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71671027, 71572029, 71490723, 71271044, 71402007 and 71772017), the Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation (No. 17GLB009), the Scientific Research Foundation by MOE and CMCC (China Mobile Communications Corporation) (No. MCM20170505), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018XKJC04).

The source shows an inverse Compton dominated spectral energy distribution, which moved from higher to lower frequencies from the high to the low state. The reverberation of emission lines during one outburst event allowed us to constrain the location of production of γ rays very close to the broad-line region, and possibly in the jet-base.

The addition of MWL decreased the 72 h glucose yields of cellulose from 57.1 % to 45.3 %, while FOLs effectively improved the enzymatic digestibility up to 69.5 %, which was 22 % higher than the system without the use of FOLs. The adsorption affinity and binding strength of cellulase with FOLs were lower than that with MWL. After Fenton pretreatment, hydrophilicity of lignins increased due to formation of C−O− and O−C=O bonds. Furthermore, high surface negative charges on FOLs resulted in strong electrostatic repulsion against the negatively charged cellulases. Finally, analysis of FOLs with 13C and 2D-HSQC NMR indicated that the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages and demethoxylation occurred, and that less condensed structures at the Cβ and Cγ positions were observed.

Using solar heat pump system to heat strawberry greenhouse in winter can not only utilize new energy effectively, but also encourage strawberries to be marketed early and increase their yield and quality. Stereoscopic planting in greenhouse can improve the utilization of space. In order to explore the optimal height of the multistoried heating in the greenhouse, and to match the coefficient of performance (COP) values of the solar heat pump system, a stair-heating mode was designed in this paper. Two greenhouses with the same size were built in Yunnan Normal University, with 20 strawberry plants grown in each greenhouse, using the 'Jingzangxiang' strawberry variety as experimental material. One of the greenhouses was heated by solar heat pump system, which consisted of evacuated tube solar collector, heat pump, water tank and stair-heating system, another one was normal greenhouse without heating system. Strawberries were planted in potted substrates, and the strawberry pots were placed on the steps in the solar greenhouse, while the other strawberry pots were placed on the ground in the normal greenhouse. In this experiment, the temperature and humidity in two greenhouses were analyzed. The temperatures in solar greenhouse in sunny and cloudy days were analyzed separately. In the solar greenhouse, the air temperatures were measured at the height of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m above the ground, and the temperature measurements were carried out separately in sunny days and cloudy days. Furthermore, the quality and yield of strawberry were also compared in the solar greenhouse with stair-heating and the normal greenhouse. In addition, the COP values of the solar heat pump system were measured in sunny days and cloudy days. The results showed that the COP value of solar heat pump system was between 3.02-5.15 in winter in the monsoon climate area of the northern subtropical low latitude plateau. When the weather was sunny, the temperature curves at different spatial altitudes were also different because of the influence of solar radiation. The maximum air temperature at 2.0 m in heated greenhouse was as high as 40.4 in sunny days, which exceeded the temperature range required for strawberry growth, and the maximum air temperature at the height of 1.0 and 1.5 m was 31.6 and 34.2 , respectively, which were within the temperature range required for strawberry growth. The highest night-time heating efficiency was located at 1.5 m. When the average ambient temperature was 8.4 in cloudy day, the daily average air temperature ranges of 1.0 and 1.5 m were 14.1 and 16.9 in solar greenhouse. In the case of the same COP value provided by the heating system, the stair- heating characteristics of the solar greenhouse showed that heating at heights of 1.0 m to 1.5 m from the ground could obtain a temperature environment with a daily average air temperature of 15.5 , and the heating effect was good. Strawberry production in solar greenhouse was 1.56 times of that in normal greenhouses. The average soluble solids content of strawberries grown in solar greenhouse was 10.5% which was higher than that in normal greenhouse. Therefore, the yield and quality of strawberries grown in solar greenhouse are higher than those in normal greenhouse. In addition, the yield and quality of strawberry located at the 1.0 m stair was best with the maximum of the single fruit being 32.3 g and the soluble solid content being 12.5%. In general, when 55 water circulating cascade heating system is used, the temperature in the heights of 1.0 m from the ground is more suitable for strawberry growth. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In addition, a novel algorithm of hotspot similarity is designed and implemented to improve the efficiency of summarizing the hotspot data, which is usually performed manually. We mine the data and determine different hotspots using a one-week GPS trajectory dataset collected from 6599 taxis in Kunming.

However, high climate variability and extreme topography pose a challenge. In such regions, rigorous validation is necessary when using SPPs for hydrological applications. We evaluated the accuracy of three recent SPPs over the upper catchment of the Red River Basin, which is a mountain gorge region of southwest China that experiences a subtropical monsoon climate. The SPPs included the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Algorithm (CMORPH), the Bias-corrected product (CMORPH_CRT), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Climate Data Record (PERSIANN_CDR) products. SPPs were compared with gauge rainfall from 1998 to 2010 at multiple temporal (daily, monthly) and spatial scales (grid, basin). The TRMM 3B42 product showed the best consistency with gauge observations, followed by CMORPH_CRT, and then PERSIANN_CDR. All three SPPs performed poorly when detecting the frequency of non-rain and light rain events (25 mm). GR (Génie Rural) hydrological models were used to evaluate the utility of the three SPPs for daily and monthly streamflow simulation. Under Scenario I (gauge-calibrated parameters), CMORPH_CRT presented the best consistency with observed daily (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, or NSE = 0.73) and monthly (NSE = 0.82) streamflow. Under Scenario II (individual-calibrated parameters), SPP-driven simulations yielded satisfactory performances (NSE > 0.63 for daily, NSE > 0.79 for monthly); among them, TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT performed better than PERSIANN_CDR. SPP-forced simulations underestimated high flow (18.1-28.0%) and overestimated low flow (18.9-49.4%). TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH_CRT show potential for use in hydrological applications over poorly gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins of Southwest China, particularly for monthly time intervals suitable for water resource management. © 2018 by the authors.","89","Rain gages","Catchments - Climatology - Neural networks - Rain - Rivers - Runoff - Stream flow - Surface plasmon resonance - Tropics - Water management - Watersheds","CMORPH_CRT - Hydrological simulations - PERSIANN_CDR - Red River basin - TRMM 3B42","407.2 Waterways - 443 Meteorology - 444.1 Surface Water","","The authors would like to acknowledge the TRMM, CMORPH, and PERSIANN research communities for making the data available to international users.

Risk assessments of water function areas at the appropriate scale could provide a useful tool for addressing such accidents. Serious damage is caused to water function areas by water pollution accidents, and an accurate early warning management system for such accidents in water function areas has not been developed. Thus, this study proposes a new method of conducting risk assessments for water pollution accidents in water function areas based on an index system of environmental risk to resolve these problems. Using the analytical hierarchy process and expert scoring, a quantitative index system was constructed using a one-dimensional steady mixed decay model and GIS spatial analysis tools. The method was applied to the water function area of the mainstream in the Taizi River Basin. The results of the risk map show that risk increases along with the direction of flow affected by the upstream industrial point sources. Risk regionalization was performed for water pollution accidents in the water function area of the Taizi River Basin, and five high-risk regions and three moderate-risk regions and three low-risk regions were identified. The results objectively reveal the spatial distribution of the risk of water pollution accidents in the water function area of the Taizi River Basin. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","20","River pollution","Maps - Oil spills - Risk assessment - Rivers - Watersheds","Analytical Hierarchy Process - Aqueous environment - Assessment system - Environmental risks - Management systems - Quantitative indices - Spatial analysis tools - Water pollution accidents","405.3 Surveying - 444.1 Surface Water - 453 Water Pollution - 453.1 Water Pollution Sources - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention","Number: WE0145B592017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YFC0401701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51479219, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2016YFC0401701), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51479219), Program for Innovative Research Team of IWHR for Environmental Impact of Hydraulic Engineering (No. WE0145B592017), Comprehensive Regulation and Control Theory and Its Application in Watershed Water Environment (No.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the immobilized T4 PNK substrate probe with a 5′ terminus hydroxyl was phosphorylated by T4 PNK in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the resulting 5-phosphoryl can be linked with the TiO2 NTs and further conjugated with the phosphate-labeled primer. RCA was initiated by adding circular template, phi29 DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside 5-triphosphate mixture (dNTPs). Biotin-labeled probes are chosen as a signal indicator by strong biotin-streptavidin interaction and the high loading of horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (HRP-SA) for electrochemical signal generation and amplification.

The preparation of CoS2–CuS on cellulose fiber was carried out successfully. The microstructure, surface morphology and the optical properties of the as-synthesized catalyst samples had been considered with the XRD, SEM, UV–Vis spectra and photoluminescence. The chemical states of samples were checked with XPS. The mean crystallite sizes of CuS nanoparticles, CoCu-1 and CoCu-1/CNF are 20.85, 44.0, and 74.14 nm, respectively. The band-gap values was found 2.18, 2.14 and 2.11 eV for CuS nanoparticles, CoCu-1 and CoCu-1/CNF, respectively. The photocatalytic properties of the sample were estimated by the degradation of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin antibiotic with UV-light irradiation. Compared with CuS nanoparticles, CoS2–CuS, the results indicate that the as-prepared CoS2–CuS on cellulose nanocomposites display great photocatalytic properties for the photo-degradation of ciprofloxacin and Ofloxacin. The results demonstrated that the highest amount of degradation (98.11, and 88.0%) of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was occured in pH 5 at 60 min under UV irradiation. The high catalytic activity of the CoS2–CuS on cellulose nanocomposites can be attributed to the core–shell-liked nanostructure and the synergistic effect between the CoS2 and the CuS and also, the presence of cellulose fiber causes the surface area of the photocatalyst was improved. These investigations suggest the potential application of CoS2–CuS on cellulose nanocomposites for water purification.

This paper focuses on the dynamic positioning tracking effect of two kinds of nonlinear filtering algorithm under the three-dimensional planar variable turn model (PVTM); that is, the nonlinear filtering algorithm mainly contains an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a particle filter (PF). Our simulation has been carried out from two aspects; on one hand, the number of particles affects the position tracking precision in the PF algorithm. On the other hand, the location tracking effects of the PF and EKF algorithms have been comparatively analyzed using the same simulation model. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the filtering trajectories of EKF and PF are basically consistent with the real trajectory, but the tracking performance of the PF algorithm is higher than that of the EKF algorithm. Error means of 500 and 100 particles are 2.8736 and 5.3601 m, respectively. The error mean of EKF is 11.2065 m. The seamless positioning system can meet the positioning accuracy, coverage, and real-time performance requirements. The feasibility and superiority of the seamless positioning system have been proved.

Among these local optimizations, the ones with highest adaptability are taken as the global optimizations in each iteration step, and the corresponding local solutions are thus the global solutions. With a reasonable partition of solution space, all the global optimization and all the associated global solutions can be found by using MPABC. This property can not be committed by the ABC, as the ABC is interested in finding the global optimization with one solution in one running time.

Gas-sensing performance of the sensors is investigated by testing their gas response to acetone, which exhibits favorable selectivity, good gas response value, fast response/recovery time, low detection concentration and good long-term stability to acetone. Gas response β was defined as the ratio of Ra/Rg, where Ra and Rg are the resistance values of gas sensor exposed in air and objective gas, respectively. Among all these as-prepared gas sensors, the 0.5% Pt-functionalized TiO2 based gas sensor shows the highest gas response value of 29.51–200 ppm acetone at 300 °C, and the gas response value is 5.2 times higher than that (5.67) of pure TiO2 based gas sensor. It also has excellent selectivity to acetone when comparing with toluene, n-butanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. The large specific surface area (168.101 m2 g−1) provides enough contacting interface between gas and the as-prepared materials, then the gas molecules could be broken into CO2 and H2O by the active adsorbed oxygen species.

Subsequently, the PS/C16mimCl/Pd beads were used as a macroporous templating agent and C16mimCl was used as a mesoporous templating agent to prepare Pd-loaded hierarchical porous silica. A systematic study was carried out addressing the influence of the amount of C16mimCl and the mass ratios of m(Pd)/m(PS) on the PS/C16mimCl/Pd beads and the Pd-loaded hierarchical porous structures. The samples were characterized by electrophoresis experiments, SEM, TEM, small-angle XRD, and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. It was found that the coverage of citrate-coated Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) onto the PS beads can be simply tailored by changing the amount of C16mimCl and the mass ratios of m(Pd)/m(PS). The resultant Pd-loaded hierarchical porous silica possessed a 3D ordered macroporous skeleton with a specific surface area of up to 967 m2 g-1, ordered mesoporous silica walls (SBA-3 type) and well-dispersed Pd NPs anchored on the inner walls of the spherical macroporous hollow.

It is found that after inserting a thin IL, the saturated magnetic damping factor αs drops considerably due to the reduced spin pumping effect. By fitting the curves of αs versus IL thickness, spin diffusion lengths of Ta and Ru are determined to be 3.07 and 3.59 nm, respectively. Interestingly, for the CoFeB samples with different capping layers of Pt, Ta/Pt, or Ru/Pt, the αs values exhibit an identical non-monotonic variation tendency as annealing temperature (Ta) increases. It first rises to a maximum at Ta ∼ 100 °C and then decreases, reaching a minimum value (αs = 0.021-0.011) at Ta ∼ 300 °C. After that, αs starts to increase again. Such a complicated variation behavior is attributed to two-magnon scattering contribution, which originates from the change in the CoFeB surface roughness and interfacial atomic intermixing induced by thermal annealing. This study provides a deep understanding and effective control of magnetic damping for practical design of high performance spintronic devices. © 2018 Author(s).","43","Magnetic after effect","Annealing - Cobalt compounds - Curve fitting - Damping - Film preparation - Iron compounds - Magnetic devices - Magnetic multilayers - Modulation - Optical Kerr effect - Optical multilayers - Platinum compounds - Surface roughness - Tantalum - Tantalum compounds","Atomic intermixing - Interlayer modulation - Non-monotonic variation - Spin-diffusion length - Spin-pumping effects - Spintronic device - Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effects - Two-magnon scattering","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 11674095, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11874120, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51671057, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51771169, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB921104) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51671057, 11874120, 51771169, and 11674095).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems 1-2 cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance. © 2018 by the authors.","85","Forestry","Climate change - Dynamics - Hurricanes - Population dynamics - Population statistics - Storms - Tropics","Barro colorado islands - Forest demography - Functional traits - Fushan - Luquillo - Palanan - Tree growth - Tree mortality - Wind disturbance","443 Meteorology - 971 Social Sciences","Number: BSR-8811902, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-0080538, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-0218039, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-0620910, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-1516066, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-9411973, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DEB-9705814, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; ","Funding to support these FDPs has been provided by the US National Science Foundation (BSR-8811902, DEB-9411973, DEB-9705814, DEB-0080538, DEB-0218039, DEB-0620910, and DEB-1516066), the John D., and Catherine T.

Compressive strength and flexural strength of the mortar specimens were tested at room temperature and after exposure to 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, 800 °C, 1000 °C and 1200 °C, respectively. Paste specimens were further prepared to measure their chemical and physical changes with temperature by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravity (TG)/differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/SEM-energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) techniques. The results show that the strength of PC mortars containing copper slag increased within 200 °C, but after that their strength declined continuously. While the strength of alkali activated copper slag mortars increased dramatically both within 200 °C and after 800 °C.

For alkali activated copper slag, after 600 °C, Fe2O3was formed as a result of the oxidation of Fe2SiO4and/or the decomposition of Fe(OH)3/Fe(OH)2. With the further increase of temperature, Fe2O3could have melted in a Na-rich environment. The melted matters could sufficiently flow through the pores and cracks in the matrix. When the matters cooled down, they could fill in the pores and cracks and then make the matrix much dense to provide high strength. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","31","Slags","Compressive strength - Copper - Cracks - Hematite - Hydration - Melting - Mortar - Portland cement - Scanning electron microscopy - Silicon compounds - Sodium hydroxide - X ray diffraction","Alkali activated - Copper slag - Dispersive spectrometers - Elevated temperature - High temperature - Hydration products - NaOH concentration - Strength","412.1 Cement - 414.3 Mortar (Before 1993, use code 412) - 482.2 Minerals - 544.1 Copper - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: 11562010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51502121, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 51502121 and 11562010 ), which is gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Firstly, both IR and VIS images are decomposed with a two-scale average filter to generate the base layers and detail layers. Second, phase congruency (PC) with guided filtering fusion rule is applied to base layer and the larger Sum Modified Laplacian (SML) with guided filtering fusion rule is applied to detail layer. Finally, the resultant image is reconstructed by adding the base and detail layers.

A smoothing effect was produced when using OK technique in mapping of PM2.5, however relatively discrete and fluctuant map was obtained by the SGS. Their results of spatial distribution show that east and west regions have higher PM2.5 concentration, middle regions have lower concentration in China. Based on the SGS realization, the probability that PM2.5 concentration at single location was higher than the defined threshold (10μg/m3) was big for the whole study area. The minimum value was 0.77. When the defined threshold changed to 35 μg/m3, the extent of higher probability was shrunk, the bigger value (0.8-1) existed in Xinjiang and North China. The probability which PM2.5 concentrations were higher than the defined threshold in several locations at the same time was also called joint probability. Given the critical probabilities (pm=1 and> 0.98), joint probability of PM2.5 in area a being higher than 10μg/m3 respectively is 0.85 and 0.5; while joint probability of PM2.5in area a being higher than 35μg/m3 respectively is 0. 65 and 0.14.

At room temperature, these alloys present various crystal structures, and the unit cell volume enlarges with increase of Fe content in both austenite and martensite. Multiple magneto-structural transformations were observed in the parent alloy (x = 0). In the process of cooling, it undergoes martensitic transformation (MT) from L21-type paramagnetic austenite to L10-type ferromagnetic martensite, accompanying an intermartensitic transformation (IMT, 7M → L10). By establishing a detailed phase diagram, we found that both MT and IMT shift to lower temperature simultaneously, while the ferromagnetic (FM) transition of austenite moves to higher temperature as Fe increases. With the further increase of Fe content beyond a critical value, both the IMT and the FM transitions split off from MT, and the former follows with the transforming sequence of 7M → 5M. Based on the experimental data, some key magnetic parameters have been obtained in this system. The calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant () of martensite quickly increases as Fe increases, and then it almost reaches a saturated value (∼5.5 × 105J m-3) for the alloys with x > 3. However, the spontaneous magnetic moment () attains a peak value of about 4.2 μB/f.u. in the alloy with x = 4, which is not consistent with the linear increasing of effective magnetic moment (). Further magnetic measurements with hydrostatic pressure indicate that such a discrepancy could be ascribed to the competition between the magnetic exchange interaction and the volume change of unit cell governed by the dopant Fe content. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","47","Iron","Austenite - Crystal structure - Ferromagnetic materials - Ferromagnetism - Gallium alloys - Hydrostatic pressure - Magnetic moments - Magnetic properties - Magnetocrystalline anisotropy - Manganese alloys - Martensite - Martensitic transformations - Phase diagrams","Effective magnetic moments - Ferromagnetic martensite - Ferromagnetic transitions - Heusler alloys - Intermartensitic transformations - Magnetic exchange interactions - Magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant - Structural transformation","531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 545.1 Iron - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: TD201301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Jimei University; Number: 2016FD078, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FB013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 11404186, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51371111, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51661029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51661029, 51371111, and 11404186), Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2016FB013 and 2016FD078), and the Innovative Research Team of Qujing Normal University (No. TD201301).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to assess the present sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin and suggest improvement options, this study builds an emergy-based framework, in which the whole basin system comprises five sub-systems divided according to local economic structure and lake functions, including Erhai Lake sub-system, Fishery sub-system, Agricultural sub-system, Industrial sub-system and Household sub-system. Moreover, emergy performances of lake water consumption are analyzed considering the vital role of lake water in the basin development. The results of emergy-based indicators, e.g. EYR (1.31), ELR (60.98), ESI (2.15E-02) and support area SA(r)(1.56E+05 km2, about 60 times the actually available area), reveal that the whole basin is far away from sustainable development. The key factor is the strong reliance on nonrenewable resources, especially in the form of purchased resources (76.48% of total emergy used). In particular, cement industry and transportation equipment industry within the industrial sub-system, as well as massive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide in the agricultural sub-system, are the main contributors to the overall emergy inputs. e Regarding to water consumption, agriculture is the dominant sector by volume, but with a low use efficiency, while industrial water use has the largest environmental impact due to its high water quality requirement. Policy insights for improving the overall sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin are proposed, including adjusting industrial structure and promoting circular economy, facilitating green agriculture, improving water efficiency and increasing renewable energy use. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","68","Industrial economics","Agriculture - Cement industry - Chemical equipment - Energy utilization - Environmental impact - Fertilizers - Lakes - Sustainable development - Water quality - Water supply","Emergy - Erhai lake basins - Industrial structures - Non-renewable resource - Sustainability evaluations - Sustainable performance - Transportation equipments - Water consumption","412.1 Cement - 445.2 Water Analysis - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 911.2 Industrial Economics","Number: -, Acronym: SAFEA, Sponsor: State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs; Number: 17XD1401800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BNU, Sponsor: Beijing Normal University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 16JCCS04, Acronym: SJTU, Sponsor: Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Number: 71325006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71704104, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71690241, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71690241 , 71325006 , 71704104 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University ( 16JCCS04 ), the Shanghai Municipal Government ( 17XD1401800 ), the Mitchell Bruce Academician Work Station sponsored by both Yunnan Province and Dali Prefecture , and Yunnan Provincial Research Academy of Environmental Science .

The influences of the solvent product on the structure, morphology and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy and charge-discharge tests. It was found that as the precursor concentration increased from 0.15 M to 0.90 M, the morphology of the LiFePO4particles changed from spindle-shape to plate-type and then to a hierarchical club-shaped structure, and the predominantly exposed facet of all LiFePO4samples was (100). The shape of LiFePO4particles remained as nanoplates while synthesized at different reaction temperatures and time with a precursor concentration of 0.30 M. This in turn confirms that the precursor concentration plays an important role in controlling the morphology of LiFePO4particles. To illustrate the phenomenon caused by variations in the concentration, a possible morphological transformation mechanism was demonstrated. With the optimal precursor concentration of 0.3 M, the obtained LiFePO4shows square nanoplates with uniform particle size and carbon coating, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance: a discharge capacity of 157.3 mAh/g at 1 C with 95% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and a high-rate capacity of 140.8 mAh/g at 10 C.

It also addressed the shortcomings of the uniform arrival assumption in previous research. In addition, to predict the queue length of multiple lanes at the same time, we integrated the prediction of the traffic volume proportions in each lane using the Kalman filter.

In this paper, a violent gas explosion that occurred inside a highway tunnel in the city of Chengdu, China, is studied through numerical simulations. The evaluated energy of the gas explosion was equivalent to 2428.9 kg of TNT. A fully coupled numerical model consisting of five parts is established with dimensions consistent with the real prototype dimensions and by considering fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effects. Then, a detailed modelling process is presented and validated through a comparison with empirical formulas. This paper investigates the strength and propagation characteristics of a blast shock wave inside the tunnel, and both the effective stresses and dynamic responses of the lining are analysed under the blast impact loading. The damage mechanism is studied, and the evolution of the lining damage is reproduced, the results of which show good agreement with the actual conditions. Moreover, in terms of the responses and damage of the lining, the fully coupled blast loading model has obvious advantages in comparison with the simplified blast loading model. Furthermore, the damage assessment of the lining conducted using the single degree of freedom (SDOF) method agrees well with the results of the numerical simulation and site investigations. The comprehensive numerical simulation technique used in the present paper and its results could represent valuable references for future research on violent explosions within tunnels or very large underground structures and provide relevant information for the blast-resistant design of such structures. © 2018 Zhipeng Li et al.","43","Damage detection","Blast resistance - Degrees of freedom (mechanics) - Dynamic response - Fluid structure interaction - Linings - Losses - Numerical methods - Numerical models - Shock waves - Underground explosions - Underground structures","Blast-resistant design - Damage assessments - Empirical formulas - Internal explosion - Numerical investigations - Propagation characteristics - Single degree of freedom methods - Site investigations","408.1 Structural Design, General - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.1 Mechanics - 951 Materials Science","Number: Z151100000315014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51504016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","*e authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Scientific and Technical Beijing Hundred Leading Talent Training Project (Z151100000315014), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51504016 and 51674015), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. FRF-BD-17-007A) to perform this research.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We relocate 2076 earthquakes (approximately 73.6% of the total) with an average horizontal accuracy of approximately 150 m and a depth uncertainty of approximately 700 m. The Ms 6.6 mainshock epicenter originated at 23.378°N, 100.475°E at a depth of 15.38 km. The Jinggu earthquake sequence exhibited a linearly concentrated distribution in the northwest–southeast direction with obvious segmentation features and, thus, it can be divided into four branches spatially and two stages temporally. The aftershocks first appeared around the Ms 6.6 mainshock and then extended on either side of the mainshock along the NW–SE direction (the NW branch). The earthquake rupture direction experienced a slight clockwise deflection at the NW end and rotated clockwise by approximately 90° toward the SW (the NE branch) at the SE end. Then, the rupture propagated a short distance along the SW direction and rotated counterclockwise by approximately 90° into an SSE direction (the NNW branch). There is a small angle between the NW and NNW branches. The depths of the whole sequence with vertical dip angles were shallower toward the NW and deeper with two seismogenic layers toward the SE. According to the distributions of the earthquakes and nearby fractures, it is highly possible that the Jinggu earthquake sequence occurred along a hidden fracture section of the Wuliangshan fault in the NW direction.

Undrained pore pressure behavior of soft marine clay subjected to long-term low cyclic loading is of considerable importance for the proper design and maintenance planning of foundations of near- and off-shore structures. In this paper, a new hyperbolic model is proposed to predict the development of undrained pore pressure. This model is verified by experimental data from literature. Compared with the existing models, the proposed model has better capability and performance. With use of the proposed model, a hyperbolic relationship between cumulative plastic strain and pore pressure was derived and verified by experimental data. Finally, the effects of cyclic stress ratio, confining pressure and loading frequency on pore pressure are investigated.

The results indicated that the different PL enhancement factors of tellurite glasses single-doped with Eu3+and Dy3+were obtained by adjusting the overlapping relationship between excitation or emission wavelength and the LSPR of Ag NPs. When the excitation wavelength is overlapped with the LSPR of Ag NPs, the larger enhancement factor was obtained in the Eu3+doped tellurite glasses due to the excitation field enhancement. When the emission wavelength is overlapped with the LSPR of Ag NPs, the selective enhancement of 485 nm emission of Dy3+is obtained due to the radiative decays rate increasing besides the excitation field enhancement. The energy transfer enhancement from Dy3+to Eu3+caused by the LSPR of Ag NPs was observed in the Dy3+and Eu3+co-doped glasses.

Abundant magmatic rocks were induced by the oceanic subdution and closure. The most spectacular result was indicated by the gaint NS trending Lincang granitic pluton exposed alongside the eastern margin of the suture, which provided us good oppotunity for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Tethys. In this paper, the whole rock element geochemistry, zircon U-Pb chronology and Hf isotopic compositions were studied in the granites that were exposed in the Lincang area in the central part of Lincang rock basement. The zircon206Pb/238U weighted average age of the experimental samples is 215. 5 ± 0. 4Ma (MSWD = 2. 8, n = 23), indicating that the magmatic rocks intruded in the Late Triassic. Granites belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series with lithology of granodiorite and monzogranite. The high aluminum saturation index (A/CNK = 1. 09 ~ 1. 17) and the number of corundum molecules (> 1%) with aluminum feature. Samples were enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE/HREE = 6. 29 ~ 17. 01, (La/Yb)N = 6. 36 ~ 33. 5), large ion lithophile and depleted Nb, Ta and other high field strength elements. The Hf isotopes of zircons are concentrated, the values of ΕHf(t) are negative (- 15. 9 ~ -9.08), Hf crustal age is older (1. 6 ~ 1. 9Ga), the whole rock Zr saturation temperature (734 ~779°C) indicated part of Lincang granite main crust base melting products, no significant mantle material added. S-type granite source area includes two types of meta-pelite and meta-greywacke, the study of Lincang granite source area is mainly meta-greywacke. Significant Eu negative anomalies (δEu =0. 19 ~0. 58) and lower dissimilarity index (DI =73 ~82), indicating the presence of plagioclase and hornblende residues in the source area. The paper further summarizes and analyzes the geochemistry and isotope data of the predecessors. The results show that the genetic types of the granites in the Lincang rock basement are complex and changeable. From Late Permian to Late Triassic (260 ~200Ma), the paleo-Tethys Ocean evolves successively from subduction to closure, and successively evolves various types of granites such as S-type, I-type and A-type. Based on the geological features of high-pressure metamorphic rocks and bimodal volcanic rocks parallel to the two sides of Lincang rock basement, it is considered that the main body of Lincang granite was formed in the syn-orogenic collision (250 ~ 237Ma) and post-orogenic collision (235 ~ 203Ma), there were also a few magmatic rocks (~ 252Ma) associated with subduction of oceanic basins in the early stage. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

However, the achievable levels of conductivity of these cellulose composites are generally low due to the intrinsically nonconductive properties of cellulose. In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were applied for preparation of a carbon fibers/expanded graphite (CF/EG) dispersion which was coated on cellulose paper to prepare highly conductive cellulose composites. Such composite materials were characterized based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observation, FT-IR, XPS, and XRD and by determining the zeta potential, particle size, contact angle, and rheological behavior. It was found that the addition of CNC resulted in a significant improvement in the stability of the CF/EG dispersion. These results were explained by the following facts: (1) CNC improved the surface charge of the CF and EG due to the presence of negatively charged groups on the CNC surface, and (2) CNC increased the wettability of the CF and EG due to large availability of hydroxyl groups from CNC.

And the specification value is also given to make a comparison with the values obtained from the three methods. Results show that the stability coefficient given by specification method is comparatively small because this method neglects the clamping effect of rock to anchor. The value of safety coefficient calculated by this method is only 2.60. And stress integration method takes the stress field corresponding to the design load as the calculation stress, in which case the clamping effect is out of action. Therefore, the coefficients calculated by this method are close to the value of specification method. The safety factor calculated by this method is 2.64 when the failure mode of tunnel-type anchorage is interface failure. And the value is 2.88 while the failure mode is rock failure. In addition, the safety coefficient obtained from both plastic area-load curve and displacement load curve methods are 6.50, the biggest value of all methods. Because the rock and anchor contact each other closely and the clamping effect works effectively under the maximum permitted load. Last but not least, the uplift safety coefficient of tunnel-type anchorage with the clamping effect into consideration can be calculated when the bearing force of interface can be calculated by the ultimate lateral resistance. © 2018, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press.

Accordingly, when PDIV and endurance tests are carried out, close attention should be paid on these influences to evaluate the insulation system performance of inverter-fed motors objectively. It was well-known that higher environmental temperature will give rise to lower PDIV and shorter lifetimes at both sinusoidal and repetitive impulsive voltages. There is little evidence, however, on the effects of relative humidity (RH) on PD and lifetime statistical features (especially under impulsive voltage with short on-time). Therefore, this paper aims to report our preliminary results of the tests carried on twisted wires under repetitive impulsive voltages with short voltage duration at four RH (i.e. 30%, 50%, 70% and 90%). Experimental results show that higher humidity can influence PD features and insulation endurance significantly.

A maximum current efficiency (ηc) and external quantum efficiency (ηext) of 19.3 cd A-1and 9.3% or 12 cd A-1and 3.6% are achieved in light blue TADF OLEDs by using 5CzOXD as a doped or non-doped emitter, respectively. A moderately high triplet energy level of 2.58 eV guarantees the application of 5CzOXD as an efficient organic host material for green and yellow TADF OLEDs, with maximum ηextas high as 16.2 and 17.1%, respectively. In addition, a two-color WOLED with the extremely simple device architecture of ITO/MoO3(8 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/5CzOXD:4CzPNPh (0.6 wt%, 10 nm)/BmPyPB (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al is subsequently fabricated, which shows maximum ηcand ηextof 21.5 cd A-1and 7.2%, respectively, with CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.44). This simple strategy provides a bright future for constructing low-cost efficient vacuum-deposited WOLEDs based on all organic TADF materials for solid state lighting. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","36","Quantum efficiency","Doping (additives) - Fluorescence - Hybrid materials - Light - Optoelectronic devices - Organic light emitting diodes (OLED) - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Vacuum applications","Ambient conditions - Device architectures - External quantum efficiency - High triplet energies - Single emissive layers - Solid state lighting - Thermally activated delayed fluorescences - White organic light emitting diodes","633.1 Vacuum Applications - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics","Number: 201436, Acronym: FANEDD, Sponsor: Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of the People's Republic of China; Number: 61474062, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XYDXX-026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Government of Jiangsu Province; Number: BK20160042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Government of Jiangsu Province; ","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61474062), Funding from Jiangsu Province (BK20160042, XYDXX-026) and the Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China FANEDD (201436) for financial support.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Therefore, the peak load is several times more than the average load. A Micro Energy Network Integrated with Renewables (MENR) system is considered as a potential solution to mitigate this problem. To design an appropriate MENR system, a multi-objective energy quality management (EQM) method based on the Genetic Algorithm is proposed. Here, EQM aims at reducing the primary energy consumption and optimizing the energy shares of various renewables in a MENR system. In addition to minimizing life-cycle costs and maximizing the exergy efficiency of a MENR system, the issue of system reliability is addressed. Then, a case study is presented, where the EQM method is applied to a TA located in Dali, China. Three possible reference MENR scenarios are analyzed. After confirming the reference scenarios, advanced MENR scenarios with improved system reliability are discussed. The rest of the work is dedicated to investigating the effects of various energy storage systems (ESSs) parameters and the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on MENR scenarios. The results suggest that there are significant differences between various MENR scenarios depending on the number of EVs and the investment reduction of ESSs. © 2018 by the authors.","25","Energy management systems","Data storage equipment - Electric vehicles - Energy storage - Energy utilization - Genetic algorithms - Investments - Life cycle - Reliability","Electric Vehicles (EVs) - Energy storage systems - Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) - Exergy efficiencies - Primary energy consumption - Renewables - System reliability - Tourist areas","525.3 Energy Utilization - 525.7 Energy Storage - 706 Electric Transmission and Distribution - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques","Number: K-YN2014-179, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the Yunnan Power Grid under Grant No. K-YN2014-179.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The framework was based on Numerical Source Apportionment powered by 3-dimensional water quality model, which then quantified the causality of water quality improvement and load reduction. The proposed framework was applied to support short-term decision making of Lake Yilong, a eutrophic lake. Results showed that Chenghe sub-watershed and Chengbeihe sub-watershed were important pollution source no matter considering which monitoring station and under which water diversion scenario. In addition, comprehensive pollution control should be considered to ensure that Huzhong monitoring station or Hudong monitoring station meet water quality standards. However, considerable load reduction cannot guarantee water quality if there was no water diversion. Water quality of three monitoring stations would be improved a lot under 20 and 30 million m3 annual water diversion scenario.

The Cu2O backbone supports the growth of an ultrathin Mn(OH)2 nanoflake shell, leading to a relatively large surface area (65.8 m2 g-1) for sufficient utilization of active materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements (GCD), as well as cycling stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to examine the electrochemical performances of the Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 core-shell structure. Applied as a supercapacitor electrode, the Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 composite delivers a high specific capacitance of 540.9 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an energy density of 6.4-18.2 Wh kg-1. After conducting 3000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1, the capacitance retention of 71.5% was achieved. The unique core-shell structure of the Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 composite favours the effective transport of electrolytes and shortens the ion diffusion path. In addition, the synergetic effects from both Cu2O and Mn(OH)2 significantly enhance the electrochemical performances. Our findings suggest that this Cu2O@Mn(OH)2 core-shell is very promising for next generation high-performance supercapacitors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","39","Manganese compounds","Capacitance - Copper oxides - Cyclic voltammetry - Electric discharges - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Shells (structures) - Supercapacitor","Capacitance retention - Core shell structure - Electrochemical performance - Galvanostatic charge discharges - Hierarchical structures - High specific capacitances - Large surface area - Supercapacitor electrodes","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 11564042, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is nancially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 11564042).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Meanwhile, the tensile strength of the alloy wires were enhanced greatly with increasing drawing strains owing to the remarkable fiber reinforcement effect, whereas the elongation and electrical conductivity decreased slowly. With the increase of drawing strains, columnar grains and eutectic phases were drawn into dense microcomposite structure, and the volume fraction of texture in Cu and Ag phases increased in the three experimental alloys; while, the growth rate of texture in Ag phases was lower than that in Cu phases, which is one of the main reasons for the excellent ductility of the alloys.
