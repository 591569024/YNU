Cellouronic acid sodium (CAS) is a water-soluble cellulose derivative produced by a selective oxidation of cellulose, but its modification of functional hydrogels was less documented. Based on a sequential synthesis method, the copolymer network was firstly synthesized with acrylamide (AM) and diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DAC) as comonomers, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MABM) as crosslin-ker. Then, linear polymer CAS obtained from bagasse pith, has been introduced into cross-linked poly(AM-co-DAC) to form thermo-sensitive semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs). The chemical composition and morphology of hydrogel were characterized by FT-IR, XPS and SEM. The effects of CAS dosage, initiator charge and medium property on gel's swelling ability at various temperatures were also investigated. The results showed that the prepared CAS-based gels exhibited a high water-absorbency and temperature-tunable swelling property. The swelling degree enhanced with increasing ambient temperature. Both swelling ability and its thermo-sensitivity largely depended on the chemical structure of the semi-IPNs and the solvent property. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

Improving biosensors would enable the detection of various low-abundance disease biomarkers. Efficient immobilization of probes/receptors on the sensing surface is one of the efficient ways to enhance detection. Herein, we introduced the pre-alkaline sensing surface with amine functionalization for capturing gold nanoparticle (GNP) conjugated to human blood clotting factor IX (FIX), and we demonstrated the excellent performance of the strategy. We have chosen the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the interdigitated electrode (IDE), which are widely used, to demonstrate our method. The optimal amount for silanization has been found to be 2.5%, and 15-nm-sized GNPs are ideal and characterized. The limit of FIX detection was attained with ELISA at 100 pM with the premixed GNPs and FIX, which shows 60-fold improvement in sensitivity without biofouling, as compared to the conventional ELISA. Further, FIX was detected with higher specificity in human serum at a 1:1280 dilution, which is equivalent to 120 pM FIX. These results were complemented by the analysis on IDE, where improved detection at 25 pM was achieved, and FIX was detected in human serum at the dilution of 1:640. These optimized surfaces are useful for improving the detection of different diseases on varied sensing surfaces. © 2019, The Author(s).","39","Gold nanoparticles","Blood - Diagnosis - Electrodes - Enzyme electrodes - Integrodifferential equations - Metal nanoparticles - Patient treatment","Blood clotting - ELISA - Factor ix - Human serum - Inter-digitated electrodes - Silanizations","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 761 Nanotechnology - 921.2 Calculus","","We would like to thank Servier Medical Art.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Traditional speckle tracking (TST) estimates the displacements of image blocks between adjacent frame images to measure the BFVP. However, quantized errors caused by the transformation from image pixels to physical distances negatively impact on the accuracy of the BFVP measurement. In the present study, an improved speckle tracking (IST) is proposed to adaptively determine the frame intervals between two frame images based on the correlation of speckles. Firstly, the maximum normalized correlation coefficients (MNCCs) are calculated by finding the matches of the kernel blocks in subsequent comparison frame images (CFIs) after the reference frame image (RFI). Then, the largest frame interval with the MNCC greater than 0.6, is chosen to determine the velocity of the kernel block. In the experiments, the ultrasound transducer is used to scan a vessel-mimicking phantom with the peak velocities of 0.1 m/s and 0.2 m/s, respectively. The echo signals are off-line processed to yield B-mode images. The normalized root mean square errors of the TST-based results are 23.06±3.36 % and 19.92±3.08 %, and reduced to 8.36±1.86 % and 7.76±1.90 % by the IST method for the two different peak velocities. In conclusion, the IST method can improve the measurement accuracy of the BFVP, from which accurate diagnosis information could be hopefully acquired in clinics. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this paper, a novel algorithm for faulty line selection method is proposed, combining fusion criteria of the characteristic frequency band and mathematical morphological spectrum. The algorithm uses zero mode currents to extract the characteristic frequency band, and the currents in the characteristic band are utilized for morphological spectrum operation, using morphological spectrum to characterize phase and amplitude differences of the currents in the characteristic band. A large number of data show that, on one hand, characteristic band of zero mode currents can effectively eliminate signal interference, so as to reflect differences of transient currents between faulty line and healthy line; on the other hand, because the analysis of signal morphology is performed under multi scale, morphological spectrum based line selection method has stronger anti-interference ability and higher reliability. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

At last, mean shift algorithm was used to carry out several sampling calculations of sample points in each subset, and analyzed whether the clustering convergence results were the same. This strategy improves the detection speed and accuracy of the target by reducing the sampling times of all sample points of the marked results.

Based on the Item-based system filtering recommendation algorithm, this paper proposes a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm that implements long tail recommendation by using the item rating probability matrix and item rating reliability. Compared with the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm, the experimental result based on MovieLens 1M dataset shows that the proposed algorithm can deal with the data sparsity problem better, and is better for producing recommendation for the long tail products effect, and furthermore, it shows stability to a certain extent in producing recommendations under different situations of data sparseness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","25","Collaborative filtering","Recommender systems - Signal filtering and prediction","Collaborative filtering algorithms - Collaborative filtering recommendations - Data sparseness - Data sparsity problems - Item-based - Movielens - Probability matrixes - Recommendation algorithms","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Number: 71462036, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Program of China [71462036].","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The experimental results obtained show that the heterojunction photoanode can extend the spectrum of visible light absorption and effectively increase the photocurrent density. The superior characteristics are attributed to the heterojunction which decreases the interface recombination at the NiFe-LDH/BiVO4 junction and allows favorable Helmholtz layer potential drop.

Therefore, the influences of temperature on the dielectric constant (′), loss factor (′′), loss tangent (tanδd) and penetration depth (DP) of steelmaking dust at frequencies of 1064 MHz and 2423 MHz were measured. Three steelmaking dust samples were studied. The effects of temperature on the dielectric properties of the samples were insignificant at temperatures below 600 °C. However, above this temperature, a rapid rise in the values of the dielectric properties of the samples was observed. Comparing the thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) results and mass spectra (MS) of the dusts with their dielectric properties revealed that the changes in the dielectric values of the dusts were associated with the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate and the release of CO/CO2 gases. Furthermore, the increase in the electrical conductivity of the samples at high temperature resulted in increased dielectric values. The behavior of the loss tangent of the samples with increasing temperature coincided with the behavior of the loss factor. The penetration depth decreased with an increase in temperature at both frequencies, while an increase in the dielectric properties caused a significant decrease in the penetration depth. The results indicated that steelmaking dusts have good microwave absorbing properties owing to their carbon and iron oxide contents. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","35","Temperature","Calcium carbonate - Decomposition - Dielectric properties of gases - Differential scanning calorimetry - Dust - Iron oxides - Mass spectrometry - Steelmaking - Thermogravimetric analysis","Dielectric values - Effects of temperature - Electrical conductivity - High temperature - Increasing temperatures - Microwave absorbing properties - Microwave absorption properties - Steelmaking dust","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 545.3 Steel - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 944.6 Temperature Measurements",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We reported an atomic Co and Pt co-trapped carbon catalyst, which exhibits a ultrahigh activity for HER in the wide range of pH (η10=27 and 50 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively) with ultralow metal loadings (1.72 and 0.16 wt % for Co and Pt, respectively), which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C.

At a certain pull-down rate (e.g., 5 μm/s), with the increasing thickness of the Si-rich layer, the temperature gradient, growth rate, and Si content all decreased. In presence of a magnetic field, the solidification direction produced an electromagnetic force, which acted on the tip of the dendrite and changed the shape of the separation interface.

The oxygen isotope composition of phosphate (δ18OP) in soil is mainly controlled by P source, temperature, the δ18OW of soil water, and biological processes and has been used as a unique tracer for the sources and interconversion of P pools within soil. Understanding if and how the diurnal variation of the environmental factors affects the δ18OP of soil P pools is thus indispensable to elucidating the biogeochemical cycling of different P pools and to a better use of soil δ18OP as a tracer. Soil samples from the same location with different moisture contents were collected every 3 or 12 h for 7 days for the measurement of the content and oxygen isotope composition of soil water and P pools. The results show that soil temperature, moisture and the δ18OW of soil water had clear diurnal variations, with δ18OW decreasing with increasing soil moisture. However, both the content and δ18OP of different soil P pools did not show a significant diurnal variation. These characteristics indicate that short-term diurnal changes in environmental conditions and biological activities have little effect on the content and δ18OP of soil P pools. Therefore, the diurnal sampling time has no effect on the content and δ18OP of soil P pools. However, the equilibrium δ18OP value represents the complete exchange of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water. Comparisons of the measured values with the equilibrium value could decipher the degree of P recycling by organisms.

The method mainly uses structure from motion (SFM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) technology. First, the image sequence is feature matched using the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm for images captured by ordinary cameras. The random sampling and consensus algorithm is used to remove the false matching point generated by the nearest neighbor. Next, using the SFM method, the camera matrix and three-dimensional point coordinates are solved iteratively, and the nonlinear optimization is realized by bundle adjustment to distribute the errors evenly and improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, based on the patch-based multi-view stereo algorithm, the sparse point cloud generated by SFM is used as the seed patch to diffuse under local photometric uniformity and global visibility constraints to reconstruct the dense point cloud and establish the 3D model. To verify the reliability of the experimental methods, this paper takes the red soil erosion slope in Chenggong District of Kunming, Yunnan, China as the experimental object and realizes the rapid reconstruction of the three-dimensional model of the erosion gully on the slope. Multiple groups of adjacent eroded gully images are taken to verify the model, which involves method and accuracy of model. The results show that the modeling method has a good effect on soil modeling. The error from the control points is small and the relative accuracy is as high as 94.20%, 98.01%, etc. As a result, the control points can provide a reference for corrosion monitoring research for its reliable results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","20","Three dimensional computer graphics","Cameras - Erosion - Image reconstruction - Image segmentation - Iterative methods - Landforms - Nonlinear programming - Soils - Steel structures - Stereo image processing","Multi-view stereo - Point cloud - Slope erosion - Structure from motion - Three-dimensional reconstruction",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Therefore, identifying their regulation mechanisms is essential for the diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. There have been a large number of researches which use gene expression profiles to resolve this problem. However, the current methods have their own limitations. Some of them only identify the correlation of miRNA and mRNA expression levels instead of the causal or regulatory relationships while others infer the causality but with a high computational complexity. To overcome these issues, in this study, we propose a method to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer using the invariant causal prediction. The key idea of invariant causal prediction is that the cause miRNAs of their target mRNAs are the ones which have persistent causal relationships with the target mRNAs across different environments. Results: In this research, we aim to find miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Thus, first of all, we apply the Pam50 method to categorize BRCA samples into different «environment» groups based on different cancer subtypes. Then we use the invariant causal prediction method to find miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships across subtypes. We validate the results with the miRNA-transfected experimental data and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also integrate this new method with the Pearson correlation analysis method and Lasso in an ensemble method to take the advantages of these methods. We then validate the results of the ensemble method with the experimentally confirmed data and the ensemble method shows the best performance, even comparing to the proposed causal method. Conclusions: This research found miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Further functional enrichment analysis shows that miRNAs involved in the regulatory relationships predicated by the proposed methods tend to synergistically regulate target genes, indicating the usefulness of these methods, and the identified miRNA targets could be used in the design of wet-lab experiments to discover the causes of breast cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).","41","RNA","Correlation methods - Diagnosis - Diseases - Forecasting - Transcription","Causality - Inference methods - MicroRNAs - mRNA - Regulatory relationships","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The PCC retention was increased significantly in the sheets, and the physical properties were improved obviously as well. The results showed that the PCC retention in RTS increased from 32.71% to 44.74% with the CNFC addition of 7 wt% (of oven dried PCC) when the initial dosage of PCC was 30 wt% (of oven dried pulp). The tensile strength of sheets increased from 11.92 N⋅m/g to 12.25 N⋅m/g, indicating that CNFC can play an important role in improving the physical properties of RTS. Also, the air permeability and softness could be improved greatly from 4.90 μm/pa·s to 5.64 μm/pa·s and from 114.99 to 83.33 respectively.

In this paper, a series of transition metal alloy nanoparticles embedded hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as FexCoy@PCNSs) have been successfully designed and synthesized. After optimizing the metallic contents in FexCoy alloy, Fe3Co7@PCNSs displays superior water electrolysis performances compared to other control samples and previously reported non-noble metal catalysts. This advance is mainly due to the synergistic effect of increased carbon edges exposure, abundant accessible active sites, and improved electron/mass transport capability of 3D hierarchically porous architecture. More importantly, when Fe3Co7@PCNSs is applied as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode cell for carrying out the overall water splitting process, it just needs the corresponding cell voltages of 1.667 and 1.707 V to attain the 10 and 20 mA cm−2 current densities respectively. The synthesis of Fe3Co7@PCNSs confirms the importance of Fe and Co elements in designing catalyst structures.

Although numerous algorithms have been proposed, it is still challenging especially when the labeled information is few. Manifold regularization can take advantage of labeled and unlabeled information and achieve promising performance in a unified metric learning framework. In this paper, we propose Hessian regularized distance metric learning for people re-identification. Particularly, the second-order Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. Hence Hessian regularization allows us to preserve the geometry of the intrinsic data probability distribution better and then promotes the performance when there is few labeled information. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular VIPeR dataset, CUHK Campus dataset and CUHK03 dataset. The encouraging results suggest that manifold regularization can boost distance metric learning and the proposed Hessian regularized distance metric learning algorithm outperforms the traditional manifold regularized distance metric learning algorithms including graph Laplacian regularization algorithm. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","37","Learning algorithms","Probability distributions","Distance Metric Learning - Geodesic distances - Graph Laplacian - Hessian energy - Manifold regularizations - Metric learning - People re identifications - Person re identifications","922.1 Probability Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Xiaojiang Valley is a place where debris flow often breakout in China. Due to the frequent occurrence of debris flow, many debris flow fans have been formed in the valley. In this paper, we use the methods of visual interpretation by using GF2 images and field investigation to find that there are a total of 196 debris flow fans in the Xiaojiang River Valley. The GIS technology is used to analyze the area, spatial distribution, slope and plane shape of these debris flow fans. The results show that the debris flow fans in the study area are mainly medium-size and large-size debris flow fans, and the total area of 196 debris flow fans is 65.709km2; In terms of spatial plane distribution characteristics, 64% of the debris flow fans are distributed along the main river and the branch Kuaihe River of Xiaojiang River; In terms of elevation and percentage slope characteristics, debris flow fans are the most widely distributed in the areas which the elevation between 1000m-1500m or the percentage slope between 15%-30%; In terms of morphological characteristics, the length-width ratio of debris flow fans in the range of 0.5-1.0 is the most. © 2019 IEEE.","13","Debris","Advanced Analytics - Axial flow - Big data - Cloud computing - Image enhancement - Landforms - Remote sensing - Rivers - Spatial distribution","Comprehensive analysis - Continuous improvements - Debris flow fan - Distribution characteristics - Morphological characteristic - Remote sensing interpretation - stacking characteristics - Xiaojiang Valley","481.1 Geology - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

C2H and N2H+ were chosen to study the chemical evolutionary states of PGCCs. Among 121 observed molecular cores associated with PGCCs, 71 and 58 are detected with C2H N = 1 - 0 and N2H+ J = 1 - 0, respectively. The detected lines of most sources can be fitted with a single component with compatible VLSR and line widths, which confirms that these PGCC cores are very cold (with gas temperatures 9-21 K) and quiescent while still dominanted by turbulence. The ratio between the column densities of C2H and N2H+ (N(C2H)/N(N2H+)) is found to be a good tracer for the evolutionary states of PGCC cores. Gas-grain chemical model can reproduce the decreasing trend of N(C2H)/N(N2H+) as a function of time. The cores with the lowest abundances of N2H+ (X[N2H+] -10) are the youngest, and have nearly constant abundances of C2H. In evolved cores with X[N2H+] ~10-9, abundances of C2H drop quickly as the exhaustion of carbon atoms. Although these PGCC cores are in different evolutionary states, they are all quite young (5 yr) with N(C2H) > N(N2H+). Mapping observations are carried out toward 20 PGCC cores. The PGCC cores in Cepheus have lower N(C2H)/N(N2H+) and larger line widths compared with those in Taurus. This implies that PGCC cores in Taurus are less chemically evolved than those in Cepheus. © ESO 2019.","85","Astrophysics","Astronomy","ISM : clouds - ISM: abundance - ISM: Kinematics and dynamics - ISM: molecules - Stars: formation","657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena","Number: 2012CB821800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Major State Basic Research Development Program of China; Number: 2017YFA0402600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China; Number: 11373009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015HA030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","Acknowledgements.

Pressure-relief technologies are employed popularly as effective approaches of treating the induced failures, but there is a lack of study on their mechanisms in terms of the relief effect and distribution of the plastic zone. This paper proposes a pressure-relief method of grooving relief slots in the roof and floor of a circular opening considering the non-uniform stress distribution around a circular opening under anisotropic far-field stress. A conformal mapping method and complex variable theory are adopted to obtain a closed-form solution for released openings, stress ratios of the unreleased to released openings are used to describe the release effect, and effects of the lateral pressure coefficient and slot depth are discussed. Additionally, a negative exponential relation between the maximum stress ratio and the rock depth is found. On the basis of the elastic solution, this paper presents an approach of finding the distribution of the plastic zone around a non-circular opening for an anisotropic in situ stress state using the Mohr–Coulomb criterion, and investigates the release effect on the plastic zone for different lateral pressure coefficients and slot depths. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","27","Stress relief","Anisotropy - Conformal mapping - Pressure effects - Rock bursts - Stresses","Complex variable theory - Coulomb criterion - Lateral pressure coefficient - Plastic zones - Pressure relief - Slot depth","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: Z151100000315014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Outstanding Talent Training Foundation; ","Financial support from the Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talent in S & T ( Z151100000315014 ) is gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Unfortunately, in metallurgical field, including vacuum metallurgy, the symmetric systems only account for a small part of liquid alloys, while the asymmetric systems take up a majority proportion. To overcome this application limitation of the Wilson model and MIVM in vacuum metallurgy, the modified molecular interaction volume model (M-MIVM) was applied. In contrast with Wilson model and MIVM, the M-MIVM exhibited remarkable superiority in data fitting of activity coefficient of binary asymmetric systems, which effectively increased the accuracy of predicting the activities of the multicomponent systems containing corresponding binary asymmetric systems. Therefore, M-MIVM made possible a more accurate vapor-liquid phase equilibrium diagram of asymmetric systems. In addition, since M-MIVM is a modification of the MIVM, it retains MIVM's capabilities to predict separation coefficient and calculate vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of symmetric systems under quasi-vacuum condition. These identified advantages made M-MIVM, when compared with existing models, to have better accuracy and wider scope of application in vacuum metallurgy. © 2019","24","Binary alloys","Copper alloys - Distillation - Lead alloys - Liquids - Metallurgy - Metals - Molecular interactions - Molecular structure - Phase equilibria - Silver alloys - Tin alloys","MIVM - Molecular interaction volume model - Multi-component systems - Scope of application - Separation coefficients - Thermodynamic model - Vacuum distillation - Vapor-liquid phase equilibrium","531.1 Metallurgy - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 51464022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No. 51464022).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the initial stage of the fault, the transient information of the distribution network is rich, and the sequential overlapping derivative (SOD) transform can reflect the transient characteristic of the zero-sequence current. Therefore, the single-phase-to-ground fault line selection method based on SOD transform correlation analysis is proposed. And combined with the zero-sequence voltage gradient summation as the starting criterion, the sensitivity and rapidity of the fault line selection are improved. The information of the transient zero-sequence current in the 0~2.5 kHz band is extracted by wavelet transform and SOD transform is conducted. After the SOD transform, the similarity between the healthy lines is improved and the difference between the fault line and healthy lines is increased. Therefore, the correlation analysis of the results of the SOD transform is performed to form a fault line discrimination matrix. If the fault line discriminant matrix is all '1', it is judged that the bus is faulty, otherwise, the line corresponding to '-1' is the fault line. The simulation shows that the method is almost independent of the initial phase angle, transition resistance and fault location, and the line selection result is accurate and reliable. © 2019 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","23","Electric grounding","Correlation methods - Power quality - Wavelet transforms","Fault line selection - Free oscillation frequencies - Resonant Grounding System - Single phase to ground faults - Transient characteristic - Transient information - Transition resistance - Zero sequence voltage","706.1.2 Electric Power Distribution - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 51667010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51667010).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The information is crucial for scientists and land-use planners, including the limiting conditions of the distribution of certain geological environments within a country, which helps to calibrate the activities and adjust to the environments. This study reports the results of an overlay analysis of engineering-geological zones of the Czech Republic and of landscape elements (Corine). However, the major aim was not the overlay analysis itself, but an analysis of the obtained information from the whole-country perspective. Existing GIS database of engineering-geological zoning maps and CORINE Land Cover for Czech Republic in Arc/INFO GIS format was used to be data source. All data were available as polygons. For data combination, we have used GIS tool Intersection, by which we have combined data from two data layers. Resulting layer and its database were then processed; areal extent and percentage for every class were calculated. The quantification is strategic for researchers, land-use planners, developers, and designers as they may pay better attention to the most widespread engineering-geological environments in a country, and thus possibly eliminate damage arising from identical attention being paid to all geological environments. Each country should pay attention to their geological environments based on spatial distribution, and in relation to the landscape element percentages. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","26","Land use","Engineering geology - Geographic information systems - Maps - Planning","Geological zones - Land Use Planning - Landscape elements - Overlay analysis - Quantification of relations","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 405.3 Surveying - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 912.2 Management","","The authors would like to thank VŠB—Technical University of Ostrava for the support within the project SP2017/22.

Here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole Indus Basin using SRTM and ALOS 30 m elevation data, improved glacier inventory, optimized glacier surface density, and validation through in-situ differential GPS and ICESat data. Our glacier inventory and derived by improving RGI6.0 boundaries and separated into debris cover and debris free parts. The derived surface elevation changes were converted into annual mass balances using separated density assumptions (four criteria) for debris-covered ice (900 ± 60 kg m−3), debris-free ice (below 20° and 25° slopes (850 ± 60 kg m−3) and above 20° and 25° slopes (600 ± 60 kg m−3)), respectively. The resulting mass balance biased between −0.20 and 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) a-1 using an average (850 ± 60 kg m−3) density assumption throughout the Indus Basin. In the western Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the Karakoram. The western (Hunza) and central (Shigar) Karakoram glaciers show negligible mass losses of −0.02 ± 0.12 and −0.01 ± 0.13 m w.e. a−1 in contrast to the relatively more negative mass balance (−0.26 ± 0.21 m w.e. a−1) in the eastern (Shyok) Karakoram.

Accordingly, toluidine blue (TB), one electrochemcial indicator, could enter into the cavity of 2HP5 to fabricate host-guest complex through strong electrostatic interaction and charge-transfer interaction, which significantly enhanced the loading quantity of TB and effectively suppressed the leaking of TB resulting in an ultrasensitive and robust electrochemical response. More importantly, the integration of 2HP5-stabilized AuNPs and Pd-decorated MnO2 nanocomposites (2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2) might usually obtain a novel functional-enhanced materials and lead to new properties and improving the analytical performance and robustness of electrochemical devices. Therefore, we construct a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using TB-2HP5@Au-Pd/MnO2 nanocomposites as the transducing materials for robust and ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a significant biomarker of acute myocardial infarction. As anticipated, this immunosensor had remarkable robustness, sensitivity, stability, specificity, and corresponded linearly to the concentration of cTnI over a wide range from 0.005 to 20 ng mL−1 with a low detection limit of 2 pg mL−1 (S/N = 3).

Transient heat transfer characteristics of piston oil cooling gallery in engine working cycle processes were studied. Influences of the gallery positions on piston temperature fields and piston thermal stress fields were analyzed. The results reveal that the instantaneous heat transfer coefficient of the gallery inner wall is periodically changed with the gallery oil distribution in engine working cycle processes. The piston maximum temperature and the first ring temperature may be significantly reduced when the gallery positions are close to the piston top surfaces and the bottoms of the ring groove. Thus, the gallery positions should be as close as possible to the piston top surfaces and the bottoms of the ring groove within the allowable ranges of structural strength. But, when the gallery is positioned too close to the piston walls, a greater local thermal stress will be generated at the areas of third ring groove and inner cavity top surfaces of the pistons. © 2019, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

The vibration differential equation of the system was established. The complex modal method was used for decoupled transformation to analyze the frequency response characteristics of the translational motion of the structure and the reversal angular displacement of the isolation layer. On this basis, a dynamic overturning analysis method considering the effect of the overturning kinetic energy of the superstructure was put forward, and the dynamic calculation formula of the limit value of height-width limit ratio was derived. By comparing the results of dynamic method and equivalent static analysis, it was concluded that the influence of the turnover kinetic energy of the superstructure on the height-width ratio limit value of the base-isolated high-rise shear wall structure under the condition that the bearing is not subjected to tension should not be ignored; The dynamic capsizing method proposed in this paper is more accurate and safer than the equivalent static method which only considers translational kinetic energy.The deviation between equivalent static method and dynamic method decreases with the increase of seismic intensity, isolation structure period and site predominant period, and increases with the increase of horizontal equivalent damping ratio of isolation layer.Reducing the mass of the superstructure and increasing the total vertical stiffness of the isolation bearing are beneficial to the improvement of the limit value of the ratio of height to width of the base-isolated shear wall structure.As for the analysis of the limit ratio value,the influence of site condition, seismic grouping, structural period and damping ratio should be fully considered. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the potential and the uncertainty for using pioneering trees on glacial deposits/glacier forefields as a proxy record for past glacier fluctuations in the Himalaya-Nyanqentanggula-Hengduan (H2N) area.

However, experimental techniques of PSS are time consuming and expensive, and thus it's very urgent to develop efficient computational approaches for predicting PSS based on sequence information alone. Moreover, the feature matrix of a protein contains two dimensions: the amino-acid residue dimension and the feature vector dimension. Existing deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable performances of PSS prediction, but the methods often utilize the features from the amino-acid dimension. Thus, there is still room to improve computational methods of PSS prediction. Results: We propose a novel deep neural network method, called DeepACLSTM, to predict 8-category PSS from protein sequence features and profile features. Our method efficiently applies asymmetric convolutional neural networks (ACNNs) combined with bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural networks to predict PSS, leveraging the feature vector dimension of the protein feature matrix. In DeepACLSTM, the ACNNs extract the complex local contexts of amino-acids; the BLSTM neural networks capture the long-distance interdependencies between amino-acids. Furthermore, the prediction module predicts the category of each amino-acid residue based on both local contexts and long-distance interdependencies. To evaluate performances of DeepACLSTM, we conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets: CB513, CASP10 and CASP12. Results indicate that the performance of our method is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines on three publicly datasets. Conclusions: Experiments demonstrate that DeepACLSTM is an efficient predication method for predicting 8-category PSS and has the ability to extract more complex sequence-structure relationships between amino-acid residues. Moreover, experiments also indicate the feature vector dimension contains the useful information for improving PSS prediction. © 2019 The Author(s).","43","Deep neural networks","Amino acids - Brain - Complex networks - Computational methods - Convolution - Deep learning - Forecasting - Long short-term memory - Proteins","Computational approach - Convolutional neural network - Experimental techniques - Learning-based methods - Neural network method - Protein secondary structure - Protein secondary-structure prediction - Sequence informations","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2018HC019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018HB096, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Major Discipline Academic and Technical Leaders Training Program of Jiangxi Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61762090, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by Personnel Training Program of Academic and Technical Leaders of Yunnan Province (NO.2018HB096), the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province (NO.2018HC019), National Science Foundation of China (NO. 61762090), Key projects of National Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (NO.2016FA026) and Science Foundation of Educational Department of Yunnan Province.

Previous studies demonstrated the positive impact of mixed planting strategies on crop productivity as a consequence of reduced disease impact. Here we present data from a series of trials involving within-species diversification of potatoes grown under smallholding conditions, showing that the benefits of mixed planting strategies extend beyond increases in yield, production resilience and reductions in disease, to increased soil microbial diversity, improved soil nutrients and reduced evolution in the associated Phytophthora infestans pathogen.

Different from the participation index(PI) which is regarded as a measure of interests in traditional spatial co-location pattern mining, the utility of co-location pattern is considered as the measure of interests in the spatial high utility co-location pattern mining. The purpose of the spatial high utility co-location pattern mining is to compensate for the knowledge omission in traditional co-location pattern mining, and the high utility co-location can reflect the interactions between different spatial features or different spatial instances. It is noteworthy that there are lots of differences between the traditional high utility pattern mining and the spatial high utility co-location pattern mining. Firstly, due to the specificity of different spatial features, it is irrational to measure the utilities of different spatial instances using a unified standard. Second, although the high utility pattern mining technology in traditional databases is very mature, these techniques cannot be directly applied to spatial high utility co-location pattern mining, because the prevalence of spatial co-location patterns, which is completely different from the itemsets in transaction database, is measured by the cluster relations formed by the proximity relationships. So far, the existing methods of the spatial high utility co-location pattern mining can be classified into two classes: spatial features with utilities and spatial instances with utilities. The spatial features with utilities method considers the utilities of different features, which will weaken the value of the features that are highly participated but relatively low-valued in the co-location pattern. The interactions of the features in a co-location pattern are very important to evaluate a co-location, but the method of spatial features with utilities has not considered this important factor. Moreover, this method has also not considered the different utility measure standards of different spatial features, the utilities of spatial features are added directly. In the method of spatial instances with utilities, the utility participation ratio (UPR) is calculated and used to evaluate the features' utility value in a co-location pattern. At the same time, it considers the influences between the different features. However, the method requires that the UPR of all features in a co-location pattern is greater than a specified utility threshold, which leads to some high utility co-location patterns are missed, so the method can not measure the spatial high utility co-location patterns objectively. In summary, the former does not consider the difference of different features' utilities which lead to mine some unreasonable patterns, and the latter considers the influence of different features, but the different influence has not been measured objectively. This paper proposes an efficient method to measure the utility weight ω(fi, c) of different features in a spatial co-location pattern, which can reflect the interaction of features in the co-location pattern more correctly, and define a more reasonable concept of spatial high utility co-location pattern. A basic mining algorithm and two efficient pruning algorithms are designed. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can help users to mine the useful, reasonable and interesting spatial high utility co-location patterns. © 2019, Science Press.

Its accumulation in plants can enter the food chain, thereby causing adverse impacts on human health. Based on studies using Xenopus oocytes, engineered microbes, and model plants, aquaporins play key roles in arsenite (AsIII) passage across the cell membrane. Herein, we summarized the roles of aquaporins in AsIII uptake, transport, and accumulation. The coupling action between polar-localized aquaporins and positive transporters probably explains the efficient As transport mediated by bi-directional channels. The expression of aquaporins is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels via microRNAs. However, in response to As, the proteins can be modified through phosphorylation and be degraded via the ubiquitin 26S proteasome system. Further, a proposed model comprising reactive oxygen species, Ca, Ca-dependent kinases, and transcriptional factors is constructed to reveal the signaling pathways and aquaporins’ responses to As in model plants. We also provided strategies to identify and investigate putative aquaporins in plants. Identification and modification of aquaporins’ residues critical for their substrate selectivity, and optimization of their expression pattern by employing appropriate promoters can be employed to reduce As accumulation in crops. Based on the characteristics of their functions and expression patterns, it is promising to employ aquaporins for genetic-engineering of crops to reduce As content and increase food safety. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","107","Arsenic compounds","Crops - Cytology - Genetic engineering - Glycoproteins - Proteins","arsenite regulation - Bi-directional channels - Crop improvement - Protein modifications - Reactive oxygen species - Signaling pathways - Substrate selectivity - Transcriptional factors","461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

TDZ was helpful for the formation of somatic embryos. Proper auxin combination with cytokinin and proportion of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen can regulate the formation and development of somatic embryos. The rate of somatic embryo germination can be increased by reducing MS inorganic salt concentration.

The empirical results show that, firstly the MF-DCCA suggests that obvious multifractality exists in the cross-correlations among the three hedging assets and Bitcoin is more susceptible to price fluctuations from gold and crude oil markets. Secondly the results from DCC-MVGARCH model indicate that, although significant volatility spillovers are detected among the three assets, the spillover effects from gold and crude oil markets to Bitcoin market are much stronger than other spillovers. Additionally, the dynamic correlations between gold and crude oil markets are almost positive, while those between Bitcoin and gold, and those between Bitcoin and oil markets are nearly negative during the whole sample periods.

Vela X is a middle-aged pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that has been detected in radio, X-ray, and γ-ray bands. The observations indicate that that photon index and flux density of the inner regions of the nebula have obvious changes as the radial distance increases in the X-ray band, and the surface brightness has been discovered to decrease with the increase of radial distance in γ-ray band. Aims. The multi-band photon emission and high energy spatially radiative properties of Vela X are investigated in the framework of a spatially dependent particle transport model. Methods. Electron distribution inside the PWN was described by a spatially dependent particle transport equation and the evolution of the non-thermal photon was described as a photon conservation equation under the assumption of a spherically symmetric system with dynamical evolution. In this model, the dynamical and particle evolution equations were simultaneously solved, and the γ-ray attenuation by the supernova remnant (SNR) photon fields in the PWN were taken into account. Results. The observed spectral energy distributions of Vela X, including X-ray spectra of the inner regions and γ-ray spectra observed at GeV and TeV bands, are well reproduced. The radial variations of the photon index in X-ray band and the surface brightness in the TeV energy range as well as the γ-ray spectra of the inner region and ring extension can also be well reproduced in the framework of our model. The spatial variations of photon indices at GeV and TeV bands are predicted and show that the photon index in GeV band increases with the increase of radial distance while there is only a slight change in the TeV band. Moreover, the modelling results reveal that the γ-ray attenuation by the SNR photon fields is important for modifying very high energy γ-ray spectrum of Vela X. © ESO 2019.","51","Gamma rays","Electromagnetic wave attenuation - Germanium compounds - Heat radiation - Luminance - Particle separators - Photons - Pulsars - Tellurium compounds - Ultraviolet spectroscopy - X rays","Conservation equations - Electron distributions - Gamma-ray attenuation - Ism: individual objects: velum - Particle transport equation - Pulsars: general - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal - Spectral energy distribution","641.2 Heat Transfer - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 932.1 High Energy Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

An accurate estimation and predication of PM2.5 historical levels, and its spatial-temporal variability can assist in strategically improving regional air quality and reducing its harmful effects on population health. This paper targets Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province (BTH), three northeast province of china (TNPC), Yangtze river delta (YRD) and pearl river delta (PRD) as the study areas. Data used in this study include PM2.5 measurements from April 2013 to December 2016, MODIS AOD raster imageries and five meteorological factors from 2000 to 2016. By combining back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and Ε-support vector regression (Ε-SVR), a novel hybrid model was constructed to impute the historical PM2.5 missing values in the long time series from 2000 to 2012, and to predict the concentration of PM2.5 from April 2014 to December 2017. The hybrid model produced results superior to BPANN and Ε-SVR with a higher accuracy, lower error rate, and a stable performance. This model can be applied to the other four regions with consistent results. Results of spatial-temporal analysis indicated that the PM2.5 concentration has increased along with a pollution range expansion in BTH from 2000 to 2010. In addition, the PM2.5 concentration decreased slowly in PRD. The concentration and pollution range of PM2.5 in TNPC and YRD showed a stable trend. In 2012, the four research areas all showed decreased trend, and the pollution range narrowed. From 2013 to 2016, the PM2.5 concentration increased shortly then decreased; in particular, the high pollution areas saw a decrease in PM2.5 concentration, which correlated with control measures adopted by the state during the same time period. The hot spots of PM2.5 were mainly distributed in the inland cities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","50","Spatial variables measurement","Air quality - Backpropagation - Neural networks - Particles (particulate matter) - Pollution control - River pollution","Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) - Fine particulate matter - Hybrid model - Spatial temporal analysis - Support vector regression (SVR)","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 453 Water Pollution - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Thank all the authors for their hard work in the research.

The ferromagnetic state of Zn0.95Na0.025F0.025O revealed an almost monotonic increase with increasing oxygen vacancy concentration below 2.5 mol% doping of Na. Meanwhile, the magnetization showed an inverse trend with increased Na ions, indicating that the oxygen vacancy mediated by Na+ exchange antiferromagnetic state is predominant. It is very interesting that the variation trend of magnetic and gas sensing properties of Zn0.95-xNaxF0.025O nanocrystals mostly conforms to that of the photoluminescence in our experiments. The gas sensing results demonstrate that oxygen vacancy has a significant effect for as gas-sensitive materials rather than nanoparticle/crystallite size in this work.

For comparison, a Pd NPs/Ni composite is also prepared by the GRR method conducted in an aqueous solution. The Pd NPs/Ni obtained from the ethaline-DES is catalytically more active and durable for the methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR) than those of the counterpart derived from conventional aqueous solution and commercial Pd/C under alkaline media. Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the unique solvent environment offered by ethaline plays vital roles in adjusting the reactivity of the active species and their mass transport properties to control over the genesis of the Pd NPs/Ni nanocomposite. The resulting Pd NPs/Ni catalyst possesses a homogeneous dispersion of Pd NPs with a strong Pd (metal)–Ni (support) interaction. This structure enhances the charge transfer between the support and the active phases, and optimizes the adsorption energy of OH− and CO on the surface, leading to superior electrocatalytic performance.

The results revealed that a primary austenite precipitation reaction (L → γ), ternary eutectic reaction (L → γ + M2 (B, C) + M2C), and secondary boron carbide precipitation reaction (γ → M (B, C) and γ → M3 (B, C)) occurred during the solidification process of the steel. These reactions occurred at characteristic temperatures of 1350 °C, 1220 °C, 1100 °C, and 1000 °C, respectively. The precipitation reaction of primary austenite yielded a primary austenite dendrite and a eutectic structure distributed along the grain boundary. The ternary eutectic reaction products were austenite, M2 (B, C) and M2C, which were distributed in the grain boundaries in a manner consistent with interdependence and mixed growth. Similarly, the secondary M3 (B, C) boron carbide, converted from the (Fe, Cr)3C carbide, was precipitated from the austenite matrix. The solidification process consisted of four stages: diffusion of alloying elements, aggregation of alloying elements at grain boundaries, nucleation of M3 (B, C) phases and growth of M3 (B, C) phases.

After curing, the epoxy groups contributed to good thermal stability and gluability of the adhesive. The grafting ratio of ECH decreased by 37.8% as the mass fraction added was increased from 5 to 25%, whereas the viscosity increased sharply by 2889.5% and the solid content increased slowly by 10.5%. Wet shear strength of Pinus massoniana plywood bonded with the bio-based adhesive with an ECH mass fraction of > 10% of the DSF mass was higher than 0.93 MPa, which met the requirements of the Chinese National Standard for plywood for interior/exterior applications. These results support the use of soy flour-based adhesives for plywood and provide data for evaluating their use as sustainable materials for other applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","45","Adhesives","Chlorination - Chlorine compounds - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Plywood - Wood products - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Chinese national standard - Defatted soy flours - Epichlorohydrin - Ferric chloride - Pinus massoniana - Plant cell wall - Quaternary structure - Sustainable materials",,"Number: -, Acronym: OSU, Sponsor: Oregon State University; Number: 2019J01389, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province; Number: 31500477, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31500477) and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2019J01389) for providing financial support for this research.

Then diffusion process is applied to seek a global optimization for image matching based on fused multi-features. The diffusion process can capture the intrinsic manifold structure on a dataset, and thus enhance the overall retrieval performance significantly. Finally, a new search strategy is explored to make the diffusion process work even better when the number of retrieval images is small.

A thorough understanding of the innate immunity, which represents the first line that defends the host against viral infection, of the Chinese tree shrew, is needed. However, the progress is hindered by the lack of a proper cell line for research usage. In this study, we established a cell line that is applicable to the study of tree shrew innate immune responses against viral infections. The Chinese tree shrew primary renal cells (TSPRCs) were immortalized by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LT) transduction, and the immortalized cells were termed TSR6 (tree shrew renal cell #6). TSR6 showed a similar morphology to TSPRCs and expressed the epithelial cell-specific marker cytokeratin 18 (KRT18). In addition, TSR6 could be transfected by transfection reagent and was suitable for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Infection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in TSR6 induced the mRNA expression of tree shrew interferon-β (tIFNB1) and myxovirus resistance protein 1 (tMx1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Here, we perform an in-depth study of the relationship between cloud parameters and meteorological factors over the TP. The spatiotemporal variations in cloud cover and cloud optical thickness over the TP during the daytime from 2003 to 2015 are analysed using the Aqua-MODIS level 2 atmospheric product data MYD06. Results show that the annual average cloud cover over the TP decreases from the southeast to the northwest. The cloud cover of the western TP is highest in spring and lowest in autumn, while the cloud cover of the eastern TP is higher in spring and summer. The cloud covers in most areas of the TP exceed 30% in spring and summer, and the cloud optical thickness in the southeastern TP exceeds 10 in summer, with substantial cloud cover and cloud optical thickness changes. Compared to other seasons, the cooling effect of the near surface cloud net radiative forcing is greater during daytime in summer, which is likely associated with thick cloud optical thickness or large cloud cover. The results of the analysis of relationships among cloud cover, water vapour and air temperature show that positive correlations exist between cloud cover and water vapour, and that significantly negative correlations exist between cloud cover and air temperature over the TP. Combined with the analysis of variation features in the cloud parameters and meteorological factors, we find that water vapour variations during the daytime over the TP lead to cloud cover changes, which affect the air temperature variations over the TP by the cooling effects of clouds, especially in summer. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","63","Atmospheric temperature","Atmospheric radiation - Climate change - Optical properties - Radiometers - Temperature - Water vapor","Air temperature variations - Cloud cover - Cloud optical thickness - Cloud radiative forcing - Spatio-temporal variation - Spatiotemporal distributions - Tibetan Plateau - Water vapour",,"Number: 2018YFA0605401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China; Number: 41661084, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0605401) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41771395, 41701406 and 41661084).

The results of microstructure observation show that the phase components of the as-cast TiB2/ZL111 composites are mainly composed of α-Al, eutectic Si and TiB2. The TiB2 particles are hexagonal or oval in shape, with an average crystalline grain size less than 1 μm, and distribute at the boundary of α-Al grains. The addition of TiB2 can effectively refine the α-Al grains in ZL111 alloy, and change the morphology of eutectic Si form elongated shape to equiaxed shape. T6 heat treatment can further promote the morphological transformation of eutectic Si from equiaxed shape into subglobose shape, and effectively improve the TiB2 agglomeration phenomenon. The results of hardness measurement show that the higher the TiB2 content, the higher the hardness of the TiB2/ZL111 composites in the as-cast state. The hardness of 10wt% TiB2/ZL111 composites (120.13Hv) rises by 24.32%, compared with the hardness of as-cast ZL111 alloy (96.63 Hv). The hardness of ZL111 alloy and TiB2/ZL111 composites can be further improved by taking T6 heat treatment. However, the increase rate of hardness decreases with the increasing of TiB2 content. This is attributed to the fact that TiB2 inhibit the precipitation of Al2Cu during aging process that can result in reducing the aging hardening effect of T6 heat treatment. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

Adding ammonium sulfate, which has a higher solubility in water, was found to significantly promote the partition of parishins in the upper organic polar solvents. Based on the results, a two-phase solvent system composed of butyl alcohol/acetonitrile/near-saturated ammonium sulfate solution/water (1.5:0.5:1.2:1, v/v/v/v) was used for the purification of parishins by high-speed counter-current chromatography.

However, the simple adoption of the motion information from the neighbouring blocks may not achieve the optimal performance as the motion correlation between the pixels and the neighbouring block decreases with their distance increasing. To address this problem, the paper proposes a Euclidean distance-based weighted prediction algorithm as an additional candidate in the merge mode. First, several predicted blocks are generated by motion compensation prediction (MCP) with the motion information from available neighbouring blocks. Second, an additional predicted block is generated by a weighted average of the predicted blocks above, where the weighted coefficient is related to Euclidean distances from the neighbouring candidate to the pixel points in the current block. Finally, the best merge mode is selected by the rate distortion optimization (RDO) among the original merge candidates and the additional candidate. Experimental results show that, on the joint exploration test model 7.0 (JEM 7.0), the proposed algorithm achieves better coding performance than the original merge mode under all configurations including random access (RA), low delay B (LDB), and low delay P (LDP), with a slight coding complexity increase. Especially for the LDP configuration, the proposed method achieves 1.50% bitrate saving on average. © 2019 Hongwei Guo et al.","23","Mergers and acquisitions","Codes (symbols) - Electric distortion - Forecasting - Image coding - Motion compensation - Pixels - Signal distortion","Coding performance - Euclidean distance - Motion correlation - Motion information - Optimal performance - Rate-distortion optimization - Weighted coefficients - Weighted predictions","701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing","Number: 41761079, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 41761079 and in part by the Yunnan Local Colleges Applied Basic Research Project under grant 2018FH001-056.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The K-means algorithm can effectively process large-scale data sets due to simple and efficient iterative calculations. The uncertainty of the k-value affects the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and global coarse-grained search can quickly determine the k-value of the cluster center, while the retrieval efficiency is low. In order to solve the problem of the initial clustering center of the K-means algorithm and the low efficiency of the PSO algorithm, this paper proposes a Spark-based PSO-k-means algorithm, which primarily introduces ethnic cultural text resources into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and then uses Han Language Processing (HanLP) word segmentation. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm generates the word frequency vector. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm performs initial pre-clustering on the data set, obtains the K-means algorithm cluster center k, and then obtains the final classification result through K-means algorithm cluster analysis.
