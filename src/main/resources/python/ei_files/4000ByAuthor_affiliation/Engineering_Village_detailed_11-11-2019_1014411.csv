Urban-related warming, based on daily mean surface air temperature at 2 m (SAT), calculated from the averages of four time records each day (00, 06, 12, and 18 h UTC, T4) and averages of SAT maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) (Txn), was evaluated. Differences in urban-related warming contributions calculated using T4 and Txn were small, whereas annual mean SAT and trends calculated using Txn were respectively and significantly larger and smaller than those calculated using T4 over Guangzhou and Shenzhen, excluding the trends over middle-northern Shenzhen. The differences in annual mean SAT calculated using T4 and Txn are attributed to nonlinear or asymmetric variations with time for the diurnal cycle of SAT. Meanwhile, differences in trends between T4 and Txn are interpreted as a strong trend for Tmin and a weak one for Tmax, which mitigated the trend for Txn. The impacts on the evaluations of urban-related warming contributions calculated from different methods were the largest over the areas classified as urban surfaces in both time periods (U2U), especially during intense urban-surface-expansion periods between 2000 and 2016. The subregional performances in the changes in annual mean SAT, trends, and urban-related warming are attributed to urban-surface-expansion, which induced varied changes in the diurnal cycle due to asymmetric warming during the daytime and nighttime over different subregions. © 2018 by the authors.","28","Atmospheric temperature","Climate models - Weather forecasting","Asymmetric warming - Dynamical downscaling - Surface air temperatures - Trend - Urban-related warming","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties","Number: XDA05090206, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Technology Talent Program; Number: 2011CB952003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018YFA0606004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Number: 41675149, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding: This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China under grant no. 2018YFA0606004; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant no. 41775087, 41675149, and 41530532; the Chinese Academy of Sciences Strategic Priority Program under grant no.

The proposed method extends the Bayesian Lasso by allowing different penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm that combined the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is implemented to simulate the parameters from posterior distributions, mainly including regression coefficients, shrinkage coefficients, parameters in the non-ignorable missing models.

Available photometric data of asteroids are biased due to selection effects, including the relative paucity of analyses of slowly rotating objects. In order to get photometric data of slowly rotating asteroids, an international joint observation project has been carried out since 2015 using Chinese and SARA (Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy) telescopes. In this paper, the photometric data of one of this project targets – (103) Hera were analyzed using the convex inversion method and Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoid model. Combining existing and new photometric data, we re-calculated the shape and spin parameters for (103) Hera. Using a convex shape method, a pair of poles are derived for (103) Hera – (83.0,39.0) and (269.7,56.8) in ecliptic frame. The spin periods corresponding to these poles are very close – 23.74264 h and 23.74267 h respectively. Meanwhile, the same data were analyzed using the Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoid inversion method and a pair of pole solutions – (74.1,39.0) and (263.1,51.0) with a spin period of 23.74262 h and 23.74263 h respectively are derived. Based on the derived shape of (103) Hera, we have fitted the H, G1, G2 phase function using the calibrated data after removing effects of aspheric shape. As a result, we estimated its absolute magnitude H = 8.92 mag with two phase function parameters G1 = 0.13 and G2 = 0.45. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","35","Photometry","Asteroids - Poles","Convex shapes - Ellipsoid - Ellipsoid method - Formation and evolutions - Inversion methods - Lightcurve inversion - Rotating objects - Rotational state",,"Number: -, Acronym: Butler, Sponsor: Butler University; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11073051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11673063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11073051 and 11673063).

These seven extracts showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and reducing power than the other extracts. The silver nanoparticles synthesized using these seven extracts were mostly spherical with high colloidal stability. The cytotoxicity of these seven silver nanoparticle samples on human lung cancer cells (A549) was clearly higher than that of the extracts alone. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity was affected by the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the silver nanoparticles synthesized with Cratoxylum formosum and Mucuna birdwoodiana extracts resulted in apoptotic cell death in A549 cells. The wound healing activity observed by the cell scratch method on mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) suggested that the Lindera strychnifolia extract produced silver nanoparticles with decent activity.

Microfluidic technology has become a very large branch in the MEMS field over the past decade. For aerostatic thrust bearing, the micro-fluidic gas flow in a small-scale gas film between two parallel plates is the subject of many studies. Because of the thin gas in the film, velocity slip occurs at the interface, which causes the gas flow pattern to change in the lubricating film. So, it is important to clarify the mechanism and pressure characteristics in thin firm gas flow. Design/methodology/approach: First, a new assumption and corresponding models for the flow regime were established by theoretical analysis. Second, computational simulations about pressure distribution and velocity were given by a large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). Third, comparison of the results of LAMMPS simulation and direct simulation Monte Carlo calculation were made to verify the reliability of above results. Findings: The gas flow mechanism and corresponding regulations are significantly different from traditional pneumo dynamics, which can be described by Navier–Stokes equations accurately. Combining theatrical study and computational results, the stratification theory of the gas film was verified. The research shows that when the gas flow rate increased, the pressure of the gas film decreased, the thickness of the continuous flow layer increased, the thickness of the thin layer decreased and the layered pressure in the gas film disappeared. In this case, velocity slippage could be ignored. Originality/value: First, this paper established an analytical model of the gas film support and proposed a film stratification theory. The gas film was divided into the near wall layer, the thin layer and the continuous layer, which was proved by the calculation of LAMMPS flow simulation.

When the traditional unbalanced thrust method is used to calculate the safety factor of the seismic downhill slope, all the soil strips use the same seismic acceleration. This treatment does not consider the propagation process of seismic waves in the landslide body. In this paper, the peak acceleration of the seismic center of each soil strip is obtained by numerical simulation, considering the temporal and spatial variation of seismic waves in soil strip, forming an imbalance considering multi-point seismic action thrust method. Based on this, taking the landslide formed by the K92 roadbed excavation of a highway in Yunnan as an example, the unbalanced thrust and safety factor under different seismic intensities are analyzed, and the engineering reinforcement effect is studied. Analysis shows that: sliding surface has obvious sliding section and anti-slip section, and the sliding section is distributed in the soil block with large inclination angle at the trailing edge of the landslide,and the anti-slip section is distributed in the lower part of the landslide; the landslide is in an unstable state after excavation, which is consistent with the scene.After comprehensive measures such as slope reduction, anti-slide pile reinforcement and prestressed anchor cable reinforcement, the landslide meets the requirements of earthquake resistance against IX.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Tafel plots and salt spray resistance were measured to research the anticorrosion performance of the MAO/M16 composite coating. Enhanced corrosion resistance was observed for the MAO/M16 coating compared to the MAO by itself. When the concentration of corrosion inhibitor M16 is at 2 w%, the best anticorrosive properties of the composite coating were obtained. Moreover, the MAO/M16 composite coating showed better corrosion-resistant performance than pure MAO coating and Al alloy substrate in the corrosion environment of 1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH and 3.5 w% NaCl solutions, respectively. The enhancement of corrosion resistance for MAO/M16 composite coating was achieved by a unique synergy between the microarc oxidation layer and the corrosion inhibitor.

The experimental results showed that: Nanofluids at lower concentrations (0.001wt.% to 1wt.%) can obviously enhance the pool boiling heat transfer performance, but signs of deterioration can be observed at higher concentration (2wt.%). The presence of SDBS can obviously enhance the pool boiling heat transfer performance, and with the presence of SDBS, a maximum enhancement ratio of BHTC of 69.88%, and a maximum decrease ratio of super heat of 41.12% can be found in Group NS5 and NS4, respectively. The tube diameter and wall thickness of heating surface are the influential factors for boiling heat transfer coefficient. Besides, we find that Rohsenow formula failed to predict the characteristics of nanofluids. The mechanism study shows that: The decrease of surface tension, which leads to the decrease of bubble departure diameter, and the presence of agglomerates in nanofluids are the reasons for the enhanced pool boiling heat transfer performance. At higher concentration, particle deposition will lead to the decrease of distribution density of the vaporization core, and as a result of that, the boiling heat transfer performance will deteriorate. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","37","Nanofluidics","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Atmospheric pressure - Deterioration - Heat transfer coefficients - Heat transfer performance - Mechanisms","Boiling heat transfer performance - Boiling heat-transfer coefficients - Bubble departure diameter - Mechanism investigation - Nanofluids - Nucleate pool boiling heat transfers - Pool boiling - Pool boiling heat transfer","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 601.3 Mechanisms - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The rate is influenced by other active substances present, particularly dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM in natural surface waters has unstable components which undergo spontaneous photochemical oxidation, biological oxidation, chemical oxidation changes. How these changes influence the biosorption and bio-removal of SEs was the subject of this research. Photo oxidation-induced DOM increased the proportion of the fluorescence in area V, but biological oxidation and chemical oxidation caused fluorescence area V to decrease. All three oxidation processes can reduce the proportions of molecular weight (MW) > 5 kg·mol−1 and increase the proportions of MW −1. Both the electron transfer capacity decreased monotonically with photo oxidation and chemical oxidation ageing, but biological oxidation ageing increased them. 17β-estradiol (E2) was the SEs used in the experiments. In aerobic conditions, fresh river humic acids (RHA) and aged RHA had the stronger mediating effect on the rate of E2 bio-removal under aerobic conditions. Its greater effectiveness was probably related to its binding with E2. Binding, biosorption of E2 and bio-removal of E2 were strongly positively correlated with the elemental C (R > 0.8, p ≤ 0.01) and SUVA254 (R > 0.8, p ≤ 0.01) by correlation matrix. Besides, fresh river fulvic acids (RFA) and aged RFA had the bigger mediating effect on E2 bio-removal under anaerobic conditions, and this imply that changes in aged DOM affected by other electron transfer groups in an anaerobic water environment. In anaerobic conditions, biosorption of E2 and binding action could cluster together with SUVA254, p(v), and 1 kg·mol−1 −1 by redundancy analysis, and but bio-removal of E2 could be well polymerized with EAC, EDC, p(iv), and MW > 5 kg·mol−1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","66","Biological materials","Biogeochemistry - Biosorption - Electron transitions - Fluorescence - Organic acids - Oxidation","Anaerobic conditions - Biological oxidations - Correlation analysis - Dissolved organic matters - Electron transfer capacities - Fulvic acids - Humic acid - Photochemical oxidation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21866017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants number 41761092 , 21866017 and 51878321 ) and Application Fundamental Research Foundation of Yunnan Province , China (Grant number. 2018FA007 ).

The result shows that the partial substitution of Ag with Cu for (Cu1−xAgx)2ZTS4 (CAZTS) thin films not only can obtain the uniform and compact grains with larger size, but also can reduce the amount of CuZn anti-site and Cu vacancies (VCu) and decrease the thickness of MoS2 and voids at the back contact. Therefore, the CAZTS solar cells can attain a higher open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency compared with pure CZTS solar cells, which may be attributed to reducing the recombination at boundary grains and the interface between Mo and absorbers as well as the series resistance (Rs) due to the high-quality grains. However, the different Ag contents of CAZTS absorbers create the different propriety of CAZTS devices.

With an extension in service years, eccentric compression RC members inevitably suffer from performance deterioration, the evolution of its bearing capacity has been one of the most concerned issues in the academic and engineering circles. To study the effect of corrosion damage on the bearing capacity of eccentric compression RC members, this work takes the RC arch bridges as the basic research object, fifteen RC columns with the same section size were designed and fabricated. The corrosion components were obtained based on Faraday's law. The distribution of corrosive cracks, the crack development, the displacements and strains, the bearing capacity and the failure patterns were studied. The strain field evolution law was also revealed based on the digital image correlation technology. The findings show that: (1) with the increase of corrosion rate, the distribution range, width and length of rust expansion cracks show an increasing trend, the compression displacement and deflection increase as the longitudinal and transverse stiffness of RC columns decrease, the bearing capacity decreases, and the maximum decrements of bearing capacity is about 40%; (2) the strain of the corroded columns with small eccentricity still accord with plane section assumption, while there is a failure trend for the plane section assumption with the increase of eccentricity; (3) rust expansion does not change the failure mode of eccentric compression members, the failure of the compression-bending members is due to brittle failure of compression side, corrosion damage changes the initial eccentricity, and small eccentric members may evolve to large eccentric failure; (4) the lateral strain field is chaotic, and the stratification is obvious due to the existence of rust and expansion cracks.

The current study employs low pressure injection molding (LPIM) to manufacture near net shape, porous, tubular NiO-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode supports for anode-supported SOFCs. The study investigates the effects of pre-calcining temperature of the ceramic powder on the microstructure, porosity and electrochemical performance of the cells in detail. Archimedes tests reveal that the porosity of an unreduced NiO-YSZ anode with 900 °C pre-calcined powder reaches a high of 25.9%, approaching the optimal value of 26%. Meanwhile, the anode prepared under this condition possesses more porous and homogeneous microstructures. At 800 °C, with humidified hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as the oxidant, the single cell with 900 °C pre-calcined powder delivers a maximum power density of 671 mW cm−2 while the cell with raw powder, 555 mW cm−2, and the cell with 1000 °C pre-calcined powder, 648 mW cm−2. A four-cell stack is assembled by connecting four single cells in series. The stack could provide a maximum output power of 4.6 W and an open circuit voltage of 3.2 V when fuelled with humidified hydrogen at 800 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","35","Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)","Anodes - Calcination - Ceramic materials - Hydrogen - Injection molding - Microstructure - Nickel oxide - Open circuit voltage - Porosity - Powder metallurgy - Powders - Yttria stabilized zirconia - Yttrium oxide - Zirconia","Anode-support - Calcining temperature - Electrochemical performance - Homogeneous microstructure - Low pressure injection molding - Powder injection molding - Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) - Yttria-stabilized zirconias (YSZ)","702.2 Fuel Cells - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.1 Ceramics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51404120, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKZ3201652004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FD007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014ZT05N200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; ","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC , Grant No. 51764029 , No. 51764030 , No. 51404120 and No. 91745203 ), the Applied Basic Research Plan of Yunnan Province (No. 2015FD007 and No. 2017FD091 ), the Scientific Research Start-up Fund of Kunming University of Science and Technology of Introducing Talents (No. KKZ3201652004 ), the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology and the Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program (No. 2014ZT05N200 ), and the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (No. U1601207 ).

The results show that the overall distribution of construction land is relatively dispersion at four time points, mainly along the northeast-southwest direction, and the distribution in the southwest direction is the most concentrated. Using FLUS model simulate the construction land spatial expansion pattern by 2020 under the scenarios of planning guidance and policy restraint, and analyze the ecological effects of spatial expansion. The simulation results show that the construction land expansion area under the two scenarios is continuously increased, but the degree of expansion is different.

Different types of waste materials from biomass, industrial waste, household waste, and so forth were used as carbon dioxide sorbents with sufficient carbon dioxide capture capacities. Herein, progress on the development of carbon dioxide sorbents produced from waste materials is reviewed and covers key factors, such as the type of waste, preparation method, further modification method, carbon dioxide sorption performance, and kinetics studies. In addition, a new research direction for further study is proposed. It is hoped that this critical review will not merely sum up the major research directions in this field, but also provide significant suggestions for future work. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Pseudotachylite vein was reported to have been observed in the mylonite, in this study we found that pseudotachylite veins occur in all types of rocks. Pseudotachylites are dark in color and occur as dykes or veins in the mylonitic schist, mylonite, migmatite and orebody. Pseudotachylite veins commonly show microlitic structure and embayed structure, and contain cataclastic quartz and feldspar. The structures suggest that the pseudotachylites were mainly frictional melting of coseismic faults accompanied by a small amount of fragmentation. XRD analysis shows that the pseudotachylite consists of minerals including quartz 53.3%, illite 20.5%, kaolinite 17.3%, orthoclase 8.9%. The pseudotachylites are geochemically similar to the country rocks, e.g, high SiO2 (>65.94%), Al2O3 (>15.46%), rich K2O (K2O>Na2O) and lower MgO (2O3T (40Ar/39Ar method), the age of the pseudotachylites. © 2019, Science Press.

In this study, a liquid amino acid fertilizer (LAAF, waste proteins from hydrolysates of animal carcasses) and polyaspartate (PASP) were used as additives to enhance the phytoextraction of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) from contaminated soil. We conducted pot experiments to investigate the phytoextraction capacity of Solanum nigrum, a Cd accumulator, grown on soil highly contaminated with Cd and Pb in the absence (as controls) or presence of PASP and LAAF. Both PASP and LAAF significantly improved plant growth, Cd accumulation, and total Cd and Pb content in S. nigrum shoots and roots. PASP and LAAF application promoted Cd translocation from roots to shoots in S. nigrum and Cd bio-accessibility in rhizosphere soils, but this was not the case for Pb. Both PASP and LAAF increased Cd and Pb phytoextraction by S. nigrum plants, and Cd phytoextraction was more effective in LAAF-assisted S. nigrum than in PASP-assisted S. nigrum. These findings demonstrate that the low cost and ecofriendly features of recycled waste proteins make them good candidates for chelant-enhanced phytoextraction from heavy metal-contaminated soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","67","Soil pollution","Additives - Amino acids - Animals - Biodegradability - Cadmium - Contamination - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid - Fertilizers - Groundwater - Health risks - Plants (botany) - Proteins - Recycling - Soil pollution control - Soils","Heavy metal contaminated soils - Phytoextraction - Polyaspartates - Recycling of wastes - Solanum nigrum","444.2 Groundwater - 452.3 Industrial Wastes - 461.7 Health Care - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.2 Biochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: KYT201802, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 2016YFD0800806, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: S20190002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program; ","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2016YFD0800806 , 2016YFD0800707 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China ( KYT201802 ), and the Special Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training for College Student of NJAU, China ( S20190002 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The high anti-scale and anti-corrosion performance of s-EPS was related to their chelating, adsorption, and biomineralization abilities. s-EPS integrated with metal ions on the SS surface, resulting in formation of a thin but dense biomineralized film, which exhibited lasting corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, s-EPS controlled the kinetic pathway of CaCO3 biomineralized nucleation and crystal growth, which inhibited CaCO3 crystal precipitation.

In this work, we present a facile approach to in situ fabricate highly accessible Ni(OH)2/K-Ti-O composites by hydrothermally treating NiTi foil in 5 M KOH solution. Based on systemic characterizations, the Ni(OH)2 appears nanoflakes, meanwhile the K-Ti-O shows nanowires in shape, which are randomly mixed together. Serving as a binder-free non-enzymatic sensor, the Ni(OH)2/K-Ti-O/NiTi foil electrode exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a high sensitivity of 4278 μA mM−1 cm−2 from 5 μM to 1 mM, and 1522 μA mM−1 cm−2 from 1 mM to 5 mM. Further, the electrode can be demonstrated to have excellent selectivity, fast response, and long-term stability towards the H2O2 detection.

In the second layer, we create the point-to-point neighborhood structure to recover the remaining inliers for image registration. The CADM with scaling, translation and rotation invariance is then designed for dissimilarity evaluation.

Here, the adsorption, aggregation and sedimentation of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) and nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) were investigated in the presence of Elliott Soil humic acid (HAE) and Suwannee River humic acids (HAS). The adsorption amount of HA on TiO2 NMs was inversely proportional to pH of solution. Maximum adsorption amount of HA on the surface of TiO2 NMs follows the order TiO2 NPs + HAE (236.05 mg/g) > TiO2 NTs + HAE (146.05 mg/g) > TiO2 NTs + HAS (70.66 mg/g) > TiO2 NPs + HAS (37.48 mg/g). Stability of TiO2 NPs and TiO2 NTs largely depended on their isoelectric point, morphology and solution pH in the absence of HA. Dispersion of TiO2 NMs was enhanced with solution pH deviated from the isoelectric point of nanomaterials due to electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, tubular structures of TiO2 NTs with higher length-diameter ratio seem to aggregate more easily than dose sphere-like TiO2 NPs. This might be due to their spherical structure enhancing steric repulsion. Notably, the adsorption of HA led to disagglomeration and significant stability of TiO2 NPs and TiO2 NTs due to steric hindrance under varying solution pH. In addition, adsorption time, concentration and sources of HA also influenced suspension/sedimentation behavior of TiO2 NPs and TiO2 NTs, and aromatic-rich HAE stabilized TiO2 NMs suspension more aggressively than aliphatic-rich HAS. © 2019","46","TiO2 nanoparticles","Adsorption - Agglomeration - Biochemistry - Biological materials - Morphology - Nanoparticles - Nanostructured materials - Nanotubes - Organic acids - Oxides - Sedimentation - Suspensions (fluids) - Titanium dioxide - Yarn","Electrostatic repulsion - Environmental behavior - Humic acid - Iso-electric points - Length diameter ratio - Spherical structures - Suwannee river humic acid - Tubular structures","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933 Solid State Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 41673131, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41673131 ).

To promote the development of the biofuel industry, the Chinese central government has set a target that biofuel will account for 15% of transport energy consumption by 2020. The macroeconomic impacts of this policy, however, are unknown. This paper estimates the economic and environmental impacts on Yunnan of meeting this target using a demand-driven input–output model for Jatropha curcas L. biodiesel. The study combines life-cycle analysis and input–output analysis to establish the industrial relationship of the biodiesel sector with other sectors. The results show that meeting the biofuel policy target in 2020 will generate 296,780 thousand job opportunities annually (man-year) and increase household income. Meeting this target will also lower carbon emission by 11.39 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, valued at 2.41 billion Yuan. However, meeting the target will decrease tax revenue by 1.8 billion Yuan and reduce the provincial gross domestic product by 754.95 million Yuan. Thus, the industrialization of J. curcas L. biodiesel can contribute to the development of a green economy and is a positive response to the policies of energy conservation and emission reduction. The promotion of biodiesel production, however, requires a trade-off between economic and environmental targets. © The Author(s) 2018.","42","Industrial economics","Biodiesel - Carbon - Economic and social effects - Emission control - Energy policy - Energy utilization - Global warming - Life cycle - Regional planning","Carbon emission reductions - Economic impacts - Jatropha biodiesels - Life cycle analysis - Output analysis","403.2 Regional Planning and Development - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 523 Liquid Fuels - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 525.6 Energy Policy - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 971 Social Sciences","Number: C176240202015, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 71463065, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71463065) and the project of Yunnan University on the study of energy transition and green economic development (C176240202015).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The pharmacologic verification was consistent with the predicted results.

The highly crystalline tetragonal structure CZTS with Cu-poor, Zn-rich composition was obtained in the two samples. Grain size of the sample T1 was larger than that of sample T2 and some voids appeared in T2 caused by the SnS evaporation during sulfurization. Raman and XPS measurements showed that sample T2 had a small amount secondary phase of ZnS at CZTS/Mo interface, while T1 did not. The CZTS solar cell devices (named D1 and D2) based on the two stacking order were fabricated using CdS buffer layer. The conversion efficiency of 5.22% was obtained from D1, higher than that of 2.53% from D2. The maximum value of external quantum efficiency was 74.6% (D1) and 55.1% (D2) respectively. Accordingly, the device D1 exhibited a higher Voc of 531 mV and Rsh of 698.85 Ωcm2 than that of 481 mV and 286.73 Ωcm2 from the D2, which resulted in the higher fill factor in D1. The effect of the stacking order on conduction band offset (CBO) at CdS/CZTS heterojunction was studied. The typical cliff-like CBO was calculated as 0.22 eV for sample D1 and 0.34 eV for D2. The Cd1-xZnxS were found at the heterojunction in D1 using Zn source layer as the outermost, which made the band alignment smoother.

The optimal values of magnetoresistance (MR) and temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) of LSMO:Agx specimens significantly enhanced as Ag content changed. For LSMO:Agx (x = 0.2), the maximum values of TCR and MR reached 17.54% K−1 (peak TCR temperature Tk = 300.04 K) and 34.58% (peak MR temperature Tm = 303.83 K), shifting temperature to room value (300 K). The optimization of the electrical/magnetic performance of the LSMO:Agx samples were ascribed to the Ag doping, which improved the GBs connectivity in LSMO:Agx. Overall, these results indicated the promise of LSMO:Agx ceramics for broad use to uncooling infrared bolometers or magnetic sensors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","41","Temperature","Bolometers - Ceramic materials - Enhanced magnetoresistance - Grain boundaries - Infrared detectors - Magnetic sensors - Manganites - Perovskite - Rietveld refinement - Sol-gel process - Structural ceramics - Textures","Ag additions - Ag doping - Electrical and magnetic property - Grain size - Optimal values - Perovskite manganites - Polycrystalline - Temperature coefficient of resistivity",,"Number: 20180179, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018M20172230057, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This work was supported by the Nature Science Foundation Committee (Grant No. 11674135 ), the Innovation Training Program for College Students (Grant No. 20180179 ), and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2018M20172230057 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, we systematically measured the soil pore gas Hg0 concentration, air–soil Hg0 exchange flux and associated environmental parameters to elucidate the process factors driving the air–soil Hg0 exchange in the EB forest ecosystem. The observed air–soil Hg0 exchange flux shows evasion during summer and deposition during winter and indicates that the forest floor is a net atmospheric Hg0 source with an annual flux of +6.7 ± 20.5 μg m−2 yr−1. Structural equation modeling infers that temperature is the most important driver causing the air–soil Hg0 exchange, followed by atmospheric Hg0 concentration. Combined with air–foliage exchange data reported in Yuan et al. (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b04865), the EB forest ecosystem emerges as an atmospheric Hg0 sink with a net flux of −20.1 ± 24.1 μg m−2 yr−1. Using data documenting global air–soil Hg0 exchange flux in forest ecosystems, we estimate Hg0 emission from the EB forest floor to be 347 ± 384 Mg yr−1, nearly 2 times greater than that from the boreal/temperate forest floor, highlighting the importance of EB forest ecosystems in the global Hg biogeochemical cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","74","Ecosystems","Biogeochemistry - Floors - Forestry - Soil pollution - Soils - Uncertainty analysis","Biogeochemical cycle - Broadleaf forest - Driving dynamics - Elemental mercury vapor - Environmental parameter - Exchange fluxes - Forest ecosystem - Structural equation modeling","402 Buildings and Towers - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: K.

Most existing algorithms of discovering spatial co-location patterns are based on the candidate-Test model, which is computationally expensive. When the user adjusts the participation index (PI) threshold, these algorithms have to be re-executed from the size 2 co-location patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial instance partition method for mining co-location patterns which called overlap maximal clique partitioning algorithm (OMCP). The OMCP co-location mining algorithm divides instances of an input spatial dataset into a set of overlap maximal cliques. Table instances of all colocation patterns are collected by the overlap maximal cliques. Prevalent co-location patterns are directly calculated without generating the candidate patterns. The OMCP algorithm only needs to execute once to get the PI of all patterns, without reexecuting when the PI threshold is adjusted. Our algorithm is performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the OMCP algorithm improvements in efficiency of co-location pattern mining. © 2019 IEEE.","18","Location","Data mining - Information management","Algorithm improvements - Co-location patterns - Maximal clique - Participation index - Real-world datasets - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining - Table instance","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Effects of silver content (x) on crystal structure, grain size, resistivity and magnetic properties of as-prepared LCAMO specimens were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), elemental mapping and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and standard four-probe method (ρ-T). The data from XPS, XRD and EDS revealed that silver existed as Ag+ ions in the lattice matrix position of LCAMO ceramics. Broad metal-insulator transition temperature (TMI) values ranging from 267.0 K (x = 0) to 302.6 K (x = 0.24) were obtained with LCAMO specimens prepared with variable Ag+ added contents. Peak temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) enhanced from 4.1% K−1 at 263.2 K (for x = 0) to 10.9% K−1 at 278.5 K (for x = 0.18), and reached 7.5% K−1 at room-temperature (295.9 K) for x = 0.24.

The numerical results were used as reference to guide the construction and engineering measures to fulfill the requirements of the dam temperature control criteria. Two working conditions, i.e., without and with water-cooling, were analyzed and compared in detail to demonstrate the simulation of the temperature field and the thermal-induced stress field of the Gongguoqiao RCC dam.

Not only does more than 80% of the information received by humans comes from the visual system, but the human visual system also gives its fast, accurate, and efficient image processing capability. In the current image classification task, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) focus on processing pixels and often ignore the semantic relationships and human brain mechanisms. With the development of image analysis and processing techniques, the information in the image is becoming increasingly complicated. Humans can learn about the characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to classify the images. It is a significant characteristic that sets humans apart from the modern learning-based computer vision algorithms. How to make full use of the semantic relationships in categories and how to apply the knowledge of biological vision to image classification are our main concerns. In this view, we propose the concept of the image knowledge graph (IKG) to incorporate the semantic association and the scene association to fully consider the relations between objects (external and internal). We take full advantage of the reasoning model of the knowledge graph that is closer to the biological visual information-processing model.

Generally, DD (Double Difference) observations are used in GNSS baseline processing. However, in traditional DD data processing methods, DD observations are normally not formed between different GNSS systems or the inter-system DD ambiguities are rather difficult to be resolved due to the different wavelength. As a result, DD observations are normally formed in each system or their inter-system ambiguities are left unresolved, which could not be regarded as the optimal baseline processing methods for multi-GNSS. This paper presents an improved algorithm for multi-GNSS short baseline processing where SD (Single Difference) rather than DD observations are formed between two receivers and this method is found to be equivalent to the ideal DD method with inter-system DD observations and resolved inter-system DD ambiguities. Furthermore, an average approach and linear model are proposed to isolate the receiver-dependent Uncalibrated Phase Delays (UPDs) from the SD ambiguities for CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) GNSS systems, respectively, to address ambiguity resolution. Experiments show that after removing the UPDs derived by the proposed methods, the fractional parts of the residuals for almost all ambiguities are less than 0.1 cycles for the GPS, BDS, GLONASS and Galileo systems, which confirms the validity of our UPD calibration methods. Experiments also show that the mean differences between the daily solutions derived by GAMIT and the 4-h solutions derived by the proposed SD method are approximately −0.12, −0.33, 1.04 and 0.31 cm in the north, east, up and length components, respectively. We also find that the baseline repeatability of the new SD method outperforms that of the DD method with only DD observations formed in each GNSS system by 36% and 26% in the north and up directions, respectively. These improvements are more significant in environments with poor observation conditions. An improvement of 40% and 30% in the north and up directions are, respectively, found when only 5 GPS and 4 BDS satellites are available. Therefore, more reliable and precise baselines can be derived with our new baseline processing method in multi-GNSS cases. © 2017","37","Global positioning system","Code division multiple access - Data handling - Frequency division multiple access","Baseline processing - Data processing methods - Global Navigation Satellite Systems - MGEX - Multi-GNSS - Navigation and timing - Observation condition - Single differences",,"Number: 2016M590714, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 41525014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41704030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are very grateful to IGS MGEX for providing multi-GNSS data.

Aimed at the aesthetic feeling of slender body of heavy color painting, the human body image restoring is put forward to reshaping the character in the image. To keep body structure and fine texture of the heavy color paintings, the technique of combining style transfer based on semantics and image analogy is proposed, and the regularization term of structure maintaining is added into loss function. For the distinct line in the heavy color painting, the image smoothing method via L0 gradient minimization, the anisotropic DoG (difference of Gaussians) filter and the gap detection are combined to extract the smooth and coherent line drawing from content images to enhance the line sense.

Xylanases with advantageous properties, especially excellent thermostability, are in high demand in industry. In this study, we aim to improve the thermostability of XynCDBFV, a fungal GH11 xylanase. To achieve this aim, we discovered residues 87-QNSS-90 with pronounced flexibility based on B-factor analysis, identified highly conserved residues 87-RGHT-90 in GH11 xylanases by multiple sequence alignment, and constructed four single mutants by substituting residues from 87 to 90 by site-directed mutagenesis. Temperature stability measurements showed promising enhancement of thermostability for all four single mutants, and the thermal tolerant ability from strong to weak is N88 G, S90 T, S89H, Q87R, XynCDBFV. Four single mutants all retained higher than 50% activities after incubation at the optimal temperature 60 for 1 h, while the retained activity for XynCDBFV was only 20.94% at the same condition. N88 G retained greater than 60% residual activity after incubation at 65 for 1 h, while the residual activity of XynCDBFV decreased rapidly, losing all activity after 45 min of incubation. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis were applied to explore the heat-resistant mechanisms for mutants: novel hydrogen bonding interaction were discovered and accounted for the improved thermostability. Enzyme activity of the single mutants compromised with their thermostability and combined mutations displayed antagonistic effect due to the closed contact of the mutated residues. This study confirms that combining B-factor analysis and multiple sequence alignment is an effective strategy for obtaining a thermostable enzyme, and the negative findings help to recognize limitations in xylanase engineering for preferable properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","49","Factor analysis","Enzyme activity - Hydrogen bonds - Molecular dynamics - Multivariant analysis - Mutagenesis - Stability","B factors - MD simulation - Multiple sequence alignments - Site directed mutagenesis - Thermostability - Xylanases","461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2016FD018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017YFB0308401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 31660240, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 31660240 and No. 31660304 ]; the National Key Research and Development Program of China [No. 2017YFB0308401 ]; Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province [No. 2016FD018 ].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results suggested that SLQA and 1 g/L BS12 effectively improved the ethanol yield through enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis. SLQA had no significant effect on the yeast cell membrane and glucose fermentation. However, 5 g/L BS12 reduced the ethanol yield as a result of the fact that 5 g/L BS12 damaged the yeast cell membrane and inhibited the conversion of glucose to ethanol.

The results show that the structural stability of model II is better than the other two stacking configurations, and the binding energy is the lowest when the interlayer spacing is 2.4 Å (d2.4-ZnTe/InP). The electronic structure of the ZnTe/InP HJT exhibits characteristics of type II band alignment. Additionally, it was found that the bandgap of the ZnTe/InP HJT can be readily tuned by changing the interlayer spacing. The charge density difference shows that covalent bonds are formed between the layers of the ZnTe/InP HJT, which can enhance the interfacial bonding strength of the heterostructure. The strongest peak of the absorption coefficient of the ZnTe/InP HJT appears in the ultraviolet zone, indicating that it has excellent ultraviolet absorption capacity.

Here we analyze the long-term impacts of extirpations and invasions on both phylogenetic and taxonomic alpha and beta diversity of fish assemblages in Chinese isolated lakes. Data of fish assemblages in 15 lakes were grouped into three periods spanning the last 75 years: historical, intermediate and current periods. We partitioned phylogenetic beta diversity into turnover and nestedness component, and examined how introductions and extirpations led to temporal changes in alpha and beta diversity using linear regression and multiple regression models on distance matrices, respectively. Introductions and extirpations caused an increase of phylogenetic diversity (Δ+) and phylogenetic unevenness (Λ+) within the lakes, but the phylogenetic dissimilarity between lakes declined. Such trend, resulting from 60 years introductions and extirpations, was mainly due to a decline of the phylogenetic turnover, indicating that the replacement of native endemic species by widespread exotic species was the main driver of the observed phylogenetic homogenization. Temporal changes in phylogenetic and taxonomic dissimilarities were positively correlated, and taxonomic homogenization causes phylogenetic homogenization in ca. 60% of the lake pairs. Nevertheless, taxonomic homogenization turns to phylogenetic differentiation in one third of lake pairs due to the extirpation of the closely-related species and the introduction of distinct exotic species belonging to different lineages among lakes. Therefore, measuring phylogenetic diversity changes provides complementary information to taxonomy, and gives support to the Darwin's naturalization hypothesis stipulating that species distantly related to natives easily establish in their introduction range. Our results demonstrate that half a century of anthropogenic disturbance was sufficient to blur the phylogenetic distinctiveness among lakes that resulted from the last 5 million years evolutionary history of the Yun-Gui plateau. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","74","Lakes","Fish - Regression analysis","Average phylogenetic distance - Darwin's naturalization conundrum - Phylogenetic dissimilarity - Phylogenetic diversity - Species gain","922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2016YFC0402108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2018JM5088, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Number: 51622901, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (NO. 2016YFC0402108 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31770460 , 31400469 , 51622901 ) and Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (Program No. 2018JM5088 ).

In the estimation of volumetric heat transfer coefficient (VHTC) which is assumed to vary with flow rate, noises signals caused by various unstable factors (e.g., measurement errors) often corrupt the time series of VHTC. For forecasting the heat transfer performance of DCE in ORC more accurately, this paper proposes a novel approach (refers as EMD-RBF-NN), which combines multi-input radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Specifically, the original VHTC time series is firstly decomposed by EMD method that is fully data-driven. Then, the proposed method models the resultant decomposition series with flow rates of two fluids (dispersed and continuous phases) and VHTC by using RBF neural network. This simple technique was illustrated by using the ORC direct contact evaporator (ORC-DCE) and data processing system. Via using the experimental datasets of ORC-DCE, this paper demonstrates that the proposed EMD-RBF-NN model that associates flow rates of two phases with VHTC improves the forecasting accuracy of VHTC noticeably comparing with existing models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","35","Heat transfer performance","Data handling - Evaporators - Flow rate - Heat transfer coefficients - Radial basis function networks - Rankine cycle - Signal processing - Time series","Data processing systems - Direct contact - Empirical Mode Decomposition - Heat transfer properties - Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC) - Radial basis function neural networks - RBF Neural Network - Volumetric heat transfer coefficients","631 Fluid Flow - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017FB093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51706195, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51666006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","We wish to thank the referees for their numerous detailed questions and constructive criticism, which greatly improved the presentation.

In our study, the PBE method is mainly used to calculate the electronic and optical properties, and the HSE06 method is used to further modify the band gap and optical absorption edge. It is indicated that monolayer 1-T HfS2 and HfSe2 present a stable indirect band gap semiconductor when the strain is 0%. The band gap of all monolayer 1-T HfX2 decreases significantly and the optical absorption edge shows an obvious red-shift trend with an increasing in-layer biaxial compressive strain. When the compressive strain is greater than −8% in HfS2 and -6% in HfSe2 respectively, the band gap decreases to zero, and so the semiconductor-metal transition was produced. Conversely, the band gap increases insignificantly with the increasing in-layer biaxial tensile strain from 0% to +10% while the absorption edge reveals an inconspicuous blue-shift trend. The general rule for the change of the band gap and the absorption edge tuned by strain of monolayer HfX2 could be explained well according to the different changes of near-band-edge states. Moreover, with the vertical electric field (E-field) increases, there is the band gap decreases and the absorption edge red shifts in all monolayer HfX2 under different in-layer biaxial strains. Our study suggests that the strain and electric field (E-field) engineering are effective tunable approaches to alter the electronic and optical properties of monolayer HfX2.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recently developed intravascular imaging technique with high resolution approximately 10 microns and could provide accurate quantification of coronary plaque morphology. However, tissue segmentation of OCT images in clinic is still mainly performed manually by physicians which is time consuming and subjective. To overcome these limitations, two automatic segmentation methods for intracoronary OCT image based on support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were performed to identify the plaque region and characterize plaque components. In vivo IVUS and OCT coronary plaque data from 5 patients were acquired at Emory University with patient’s consent obtained. Seventy-seven matched IVUS and OCT slices with good image quality and lipid cores were selected for this study. Manual OCT segmentation was performed by experts using virtual histology IVUS as guidance, and used as gold standard in the automatic segmentations. The overall classification accuracy based on CNN method achieved 95.8%, and the accuracy based on SVM was 71.9%. The CNN-based segmentation method can better characterize plaque compositions on OCT images and greatly reduce the time spent by doctors in segmenting and identifying plaques.

The ore occurs as laminated or lenticular units in skarns, distributed in the contact zone between the Jubuzhari complex intrusions and carbonate strata of the Mengla Formation. Intrusions associated with the two ore blocks are granodiorite, granodiorite porphyry, and granite porphyry of 62.4 ± 1.2 Ma, 62.6 ± 0.6 Ma, and 63.7 ± 1.0 Ma by zircon U–Pb age dating. Molybdenite Re–Os analyses yield an isochron age of 59.0 ± 1.7 Ma, with a MSWD of 1.6. Comparable isotopic ages between the intrusions and mineralization indicate that they are genetically related, and occurred during or shortly before the main stage of the Indian–Asian continental collision. Granodiorites have SiO2 content of 62.0–69.1 wt%; Al2O3 content of 15.1–15.3 wt%; total alkali concentration (K2O + Na2O) of 6.63–7.46 wt% and vary in terms of the differentiation index (DI = 67–78). Rocks from the granodiorite porphyry and granite porphyry are characterized by high SiO2 contents (72.3–74.0 wt%; 74.8–75.8 wt%) and DI (89–90; 93–94). Contents of CaO, Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, P2O5, TiO2 of granodiorite, granodiorite porphyry and granite porphyry show negative correlations with SiO2. Samples from the granite porphyry have the most negative Eu anomalies (δEu = 0.35–0.36), which are lower than the granodiorite porphyry and granodiorite (δEu = 0.46–0.55 and 0.46–0.66). All the rocks are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (Rb, Ba, Pb, K and Th) and depleted in high-field-strength elements (Ta, Ti and Nb). The granodiorites have zircon Hf(t) values from +2.5 to +8.4, while Hf(t) values of the granodiorite porphyries and granite porphyries range from −6.3 to +6.8, and +1.8 to +6.9, respectively. These data suggest that the three types of intrusions are genetically related, and the less evolved granodiorites are I-type granites that were derived from a mantle-crust mixed source. The granodiorite porphyries and granite porphyries were strongly fractionated, and most likely derived from the melts represented by granodiorites through fractional crystallization of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, ilmenite, titanite, apatite, and zircon. Zircon trace elements (average ΔFMQ values of granodiorites, granodiorite porphyries, granite porphyries are 0.15, −0.07 and 0.25, respectively) indicate that the Lietinggang-Leqingla magmas were weakly oxidized to moderately reduced. The involvement of mantle materials and medium oxygen fugacity controlled the Fe-Cu mineralization, while the contribution of ancient crustal end-member and strongly fractional crystallization caused the Pb–Zn mineralization of the Lietinggang-Leqingla deposit. Combined with previously published data, we suggest that the Fe–Cu–Pb–Zn fertilities of magmas in the central Lhasa subterrane and their metal series were not only influenced by magma sources, but also by the evolution degree (fractional crystallization) and oxidation state of the magmas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","138","Granite","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Deposits - Feldspar - Geochronology - Hematite - Magnesia - Mica - Mineralogy - Molybdenum compounds - Ores - Oxidation - Petrology - Phosphate minerals - Silica - Silicate minerals - Sodium compounds - Structural geology - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Zircon","Alkali concentrations - Continental collisions - Fractional crystallization - High field strength elements - Large ion lithophile elements - Lhasa terrane - Oxidation state - Petrogenesis","481.1 Geology - 481.1.2 Petrology (Before 1993, use code 482) - 482 Mineralogy - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2016YFC0600306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41472076, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41702091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41872083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 53200859424, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: DD20160024-07, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: DD20179172, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; ","This study is supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0600306), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41702091, 41872083, 41472076), the Program of the China Geological Survey (DD20160024-07, DD20179172), 111 project (B18048), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (53200859424).

Although various methods are available for conveyance estimation of two-stage compound channels, very few are concerned with the multi-stage case. After a critical review of predictive methods for two-stage channels, this paper presents a general model for predicting the stage–discharge relationship in multi-stage compound channels. A multi-stage compound section was divided laterally into several homogeneous subsections, which were further classified into seven subdivision elements. In each element, we employed a general expression to analyse momentum balance, which accounts for momentum exchange between adjacent subsections. Then, a linear system with a tridiagonal coefficient matrix was used to estimate discharge in multi-stage compound channels. Experimental data from the literature were used to calibrate model parameters and examine the performance of the proposed model. The comparative results indicate that the proposed model produces satisfactory predictions.

Tectonically it is located in the conjunction of the Cathaysia and Indochina blocks. The orebodies primarily hosted within the stratiform-like skarn and marble in the Paleoproterozoic Nanyangtian formation. Three ore-forming stages have been identified based on mineral assemblages and on the intercalated relationships between the veins. They include skarn-scheelite stage, quartz-scheelite vein stage and carbonate-scheelite vein stage. In this paper, we present 40Ar–39Ar laser incremental heating analyses of hydrothermal biotite intergrowth with scheelite from quartz-scheelite vein with two yielded well-defined 40Ar–39Ar plateau ages of 97.49 ± 0.97 Ma and 99.48 ± 0.97 Ma, and two isochronal ages of 97.01 ± 1.39 Ma and 99.58 ± 0.98 Ma, respectively, representing the age of second mineralization stage of the Nanyangtian tungsten deposit. The ages are well consistent with the emplacement age of the Laojunshan granite (96 Ma to 117 Ma). U–Pb geochronological data for magmatic zircons separated from porphyritic granite dyke in the mine pit indicate that the granite body was emplaced in the post-ore stage (89.88 ± 0.53 Ma). Integrated with previously high resolution diagenetic and metallogenic geochronological data, two significant magmatic-mineralization events are presented in SE Yunnan, China and North Vietnam. The first event took place from 97 Ma to 124 Ma, which is closely related to the tungsten mineralization. The second event occurred from 75 Ma to 95 Ma, which is closely related to the Sn–Cu–Ag–Zn mineralization. According to the exhibited data, we preliminarily conclude that the Late Cretaceous magmatic-mineralization activity in SE Yunnan and North Vietnam is the product of post-collision of the Cathaysia and Indochina blocks and should have formed under a same geodynamic setting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","76","Mineralogy","Biotite - Deposits - Geochronology - Granite - Mica - Ores - Quartz - Tungstate minerals - Tungsten deposits - Tungsten mines - Zircon","Geodynamic setting - Heating analysis - High resolution - Late cretaceous - Mineral assemblage - Nanyangtian - Paleoproterozoic - Post-collision","481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines","Number: 41203039, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41663006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41203039, 41663006).

TMDs are two-dimensional (2D) layered materials like graphene, with a covalently bonded hexagonal network in layers stacked by weak van der Waals forces between layers. However, the zero band gap of pristine graphene seriously restricted its application in most electronic and optoelectronic fields, while the MoS2 submits to a transition from indirect band gap in bulk to a direct band gap in single atom layer. Further transport measurements demonstrate that the field-effect transistors made of TMDs single layer possess high mobility and large on/off ratio. Nevertheless, the applications of TMDs are limited due to their poor light absorption and emission, specially in some light-driven related field. Hence, for the sake of acquiring more superior optoelectronic materials, scientists creatively introduced a heterogeneous integration of the noble metal nanoparticles (NM NPs) and 2D TMDs thin films and utilize the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of NM NPs as a excitation pump to strengthen the photoluminescence(PL) intensity of 2D TMDs. The hybrids of NM NPs and 2D TMDs exhibit unique optical, electronic, and photoelectrical properties, which hold great promise for their application in expansive fields, including optics, biology, memory materials, electronics and catalysis. Currently, with regard to the studies on the structure of NM NPs-2D TMDs hybrids, researchers mainly take advantages of diverse structures of NM NPs, including nanospheres, nanorods, nano-islands, nanodisks, nano-antennas and nano core-shell structures to enhance the light absorption, and excite the surface plasmon polaritons in the nm nanostructures, then transfer the energy to 2D TMDs for stimulating the high-intensity light absorption and light emission, and finally realize the modulation of its optical properties. Study on the enhancement characteristics of photoluminescence and photocurrent of the hybrids nanostructures have been carried out as well. To date, the method of fabricating hybrids nanostructures are mainly concentrated on electron beam etching, spin coating, infiltration, etc. However, those hybrids nanostructures built by the me-thods mentioned above exist some defects, for example, the deposition position of the NM NPs is uncontrollable, and the disordered nanoparticles are easily deposited at the edges and defects of the TMDs, resulting in rough thickness of the nanoparticles film on the surface, which restrict their applications to a certain extent. In addition, there is little investigations relating to the impact of the structure parameters like the morphology, size, arrangement and spacing of the NM NPs on photoelectricity properties of the hybrids nanostructures.

The results show that the addition of FeO from 0 to 9.25 wt% in slag can increase the activity of dissolved oxygen (a[O]) in Si and the mole fraction of O2− in slag. Moreover, the increase of O2− concentration leads to the increase of non-bridge oxygen (NBO). The value of LP (the partition ratio of phosphorous between slag and Si shows a first increase and then decrease trend and reaches a maximum value of 1.95 at 5 ± 0.1 wt% FeO.

When FeO content is increased to more than 5 ± 0.1 wt%, LP value gradually decreases although the values of NBO and a[O] are increasing. NBO plays a leading role in this process, it can be speculated that more NBO can depolymerize the Q3 (Si and P) to destroy the stability of P in silicate network.

The results show that the distribution of average pressure drop between the adjacent nodes is similar to the fluctuation height of fracture surface along the seepage direction, the average pressure drop increases at the location where the fracture surface raises, and decreases in the sunken region. The influence of geometrical morphology on the local pressure drop is different for the position with different distances to the fracture surface, the closer to the fracture surface, the more sensitive of the geometrical morphology to the local pressure drop, especially in the area where the fracture surface fluctuates sharply. The inlet velocity also affects the average pressure drop, the larger flow velocity results in the greater resistance of the rough wall to the fluid and the corresponding energy loss, the more significant pressure drop is generated as a result.

In order to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and quality of Coffea arabica under the shade of banana trees in dry-hot region, the local Coffea arabica (5 years) was chosen for test material. In the field experiment, 3 levels of irrigation, i.e., full irrigation (FI, which was determined by the monthly water demand data of Coffea arabica and precipitation in dry-hot region), light deficit irrigation (DIL: 75%FI) and severe deficit irrigation (DIS: 50%FI), and 4 modes of shade cultivation, i.e., no shade cultivation (S0: monoculture Coffea arabica, i.e., natural light intensity), light shade cultivation (SL: intercropping with 4 lines of Coffea arabica and 1 line of banana), moderate shade cultivation (SM: intercropping with 3 lines of Coffea arabica and 1 line of banana) and severe shade cultivation (SS: intercropping with 2 lines of Coffea arabica and 1 line of banana) were designed. Principal component analysis and TOPSIS method were used to evaluate total sugar, protein, fat, caffeine, chlorogenic acid, crude fiber and water extracts content of Coffea arabica comprehensively. The results showed that the dry bean yield of Coffea arabica was significantly different under different shade cultivation modes and irrigation levels (P2) and the highest dry mass of 100-bean of Coffea arabica in the FISM treatment. But FISM was not significantly different with the FISS treatment (P>0.05)in the volume and fresh mass of 100-bean of Coffea arabica. The effects of irrigation level on total sugar content of Coffea arabica were not significant (P>0.05), and that of interaction between irrigation level and shade cultivation mode on fat and crude fibre content were also not significant (P>0.05). However, the effects of their interaction on total sugar, protein, caffeine, chlorogenic acid and water extract content of Coffea arabica were extremely significant (PM treatment, while lower content of caffeine and crude fiber. Pearson correlation analysis showed that there were extremely significant positive correlation between protein, fat, chlorogenic acid and water extracts content of Coffea arabica, while significant negative correlation between crude fiber and total sugar, protein, fat, chlorogenic acid and water extracts content of Coffea arabica, respectively. Based on both principal component analysis and TOPSIS method, the best comprehensive quality of Coffea arabica was FISS treatment, the next was FISM treatment, and the poorest comprehensive quality was DISS0 treatment. Compared with the FIS0 treatment, total sugar, protein, chlorogenic acid, water extracts content and dry bean yield of FISM treatment increased by 6.11%, 10.79%, 40.58%, 9.95% and 14.32%, respectively, while protein, chlorogenic acid and water extracts content of FISS treatment increased by 19.88%, 43.10% and 11.94%, respectively, dry bean yield decreased by 15.69%. Considering the comprehensive benefit of high production and superior quality, the suitable combination of irrigation treatment and banana shade cultivation mode for Coffea arabica was full irrigation under moderate shade cultivation (FISM).

Based on the plane flow function and the large eddy simulation method, the characteristics of three-dimensional gas vortex vorticity distribution and the variation of velocity field were analyzed on the basis of determining the formation mechanism of gas film microvibration. Finally, the time domain and frequency domain characteristics of gas film self-excited micro-vibration in triaxial direction were tested by experiments, and the influencing factors of each axial self-excited micro-vibration were analyzed. The results showed that the self-excited vibration of the aerostatic thrust bearing is formed by three-dimensional gas vortexs in the film flow field, and the vibration intensity along the film height direction (z direction) is significantly higher than that in the horizontal plane (x, y direction). The intensity of self-excited vibration in the three directions of bearing film increases with the increase of gas supply pressure, and the intensity of self-excited vibration in x and y directions are more sensitive than that in z direction.The natural frequency of the self-excited vibration in the x and y directions will increase with the increase of the gas supply pressure.

Furthermore, a maximum GABA content of 38.57 mg g−1 was obtained when cells were cultured with 0.4 g L−1 NaCl under photoautotrophic conditions in stage II, whereas the carbohydrate content of cells sharply decreased from 26.68 to 18.22%. In addition, salt stress upregulated the expression of the gad and cam genes. The results of this study demonstrate an efficient strategy to produce GABA from the microalga H. pluvialis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","50","Biomass","Algae - Amino acids - Gene expression - Sodium chloride","Aminobutyric acids - Carbohydrate content - Fulvic acids - Gamma-aminobutyric acids - Haematococcus pluvialis - Mixotrophic cultures - Photoautotrophic conditions - Two-step cultivation","461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 21766012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21766012 ).

Based on classical electromagnetic theory, we obtain analytically the dispersion equation for cavity plasmon polariton (CPP) modes. The obtained results show the existence of two types of CPP modes in THz range. One can be referred as Fabry-Pérot-like modes and another as surface-plasmon-like modes (SPLMs). Interestingly, the SPLMs can realize notable enhancement of wave localization in comparison with usual graphene plasmons. Moreover, a scheme to modulate the THz CPP modes via visible light irradiation is proposed and examined. We find that the optical pumping can affect rather efficiently the CPP modes via excitation of photon induced carriers. These important theoretical findings indicate that the CPP can be applied in all-optical tunable plasmonic devices in THz bandwidth.

The results demonstrated that poor froth stability of the coarse particle size bastnaesite led to poor flotation recovery. The medium particle size led to appropriate froth stability and also improved the recovery of bastnaesite. The fine particle size yielded an excessively stable froth, yet did not increase the adherence of bastnaesite particles to the bubbles, but it may have increased the entrainment of kaolin. A longer flotation time may have contributed to improving the recovery of the fine size fraction bastnaesite due to its greater flotation rate. Yet, it had little impact on the recovery of the coarse-grained bastnaesite. In addition, a low proportion (20%) of kaolin improved the recovery and flotation rate of the coarse size fraction bastnaesite. In general, however, the presence of kaolin was detrimental to the flotation performance of bastnaesite. Moreover, the presence of kaolin increased the froth stability of the bastnaesite and resulted in more hydrophilic kaolin particles being entrained into the concentrate products. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","35","Froth flotation","Carbonates - Clay - Kaolin - Particle size - Recovery - Stability","Bastnaesite - Batch flotation - Coarse particles - Different particle sizes - Flotation performance - Flotation recovery - Froth stability - Kaolin particles","482.2 Minerals - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by Sichuan Key Technologies R&D Program of China (no. 15ZC1801) and High-end Leader Talent Cultivation Special Funded Project of Guangdong Academy of Sciences (no. 2017GDASCX-0301).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Knowing the hydrodynamic properties of rectangular cylinders in a steady flow is of practical importance for many engineering applications. Although the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders has been broadly studied, investigations on the flow around rectangular cylinders close to the free surface are limited. In the present study, two-dimensional multiphase simulations of flow past rectangular cylinders were conducted using RANS. The Mentor shear stress transport (SST) k - ω model and the volume of fluid (VoF) model were adopted. The Mentor SST k - ω model is capable of accurately predicting the flow past rectangular cylinders near the free surface when the width-to-length ratio is larger than 0.7. The effect of the depth-to-length ratio on the hydrodynamic properties of rectangular cylinders is affected by the width-to-length ratio and becomes significant when the depth-to-length ratio is lower than 1.0. The effect of the width-to-length ratio on the flow past rectangular cylinders near the free surface is different from that in an infinite domain. The findings from the present study can provide a deep understanding of the hydrodynamic properties of rectangular cylinders close to the free surface. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","31","Cylinders (shapes)","Drag - Hydrodynamics - Lift - Navier Stokes equations - Shear stress","Engineering applications - Free surfaces - Hydrodynamic properties - Multiphase simulations - RANS simulation - Rectangular cylinder - Shear-stress transport - Volume of fluid model","651.1 Aerodynamics, General - 921.2 Calculus","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Oregon State University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and China Scholarship Council (CSC) .

To prepare training and testing datasets for the ANN and ICA–ANN predictive models, an extensive number of limit equilibrium analysis modelings (e.g., for the lower bound, LB, limit analysis and upper bound, UB, limit analysis) was conducted. The analyses were conducted using OptumG2 computer software and implemented on two-layered cohesive soil layer sets. For each of the LB and UB limit analysis, the database consisted of 320 training datasets and 80 testing datasets. Variables of the ICA algorithm such as the number of countries, the number of initial imperialists and the number of decades were optimized using a series of trial-and-error process. The input parameters that used thorough the OptumG2 finite element modeling (FEM) analysis include depth factor (i.e., the ratio of first soil layer thickness to the slope height), slope angle, undrained shear strength ratio where the output was taken dimensionless stability number. The estimated results for both of datasets (e.g., training and testing) from ANN and ICA–ANN models were assessed based on three known statistical indices namely value account for (VAF), root means squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). To evaluate the performance of proposed models, color intensity rating (CER) and total ranking method (TRM), i.e., based on the result of statistical indices, was used. After 72 trial-and-error processes (e.g., sensitivity analysis on some neurons) the optimal architecture of 3 × 6 × 1 were found for both of the ANN–UB and ANN–LB models. As a result, both models presented excellent performance, however according to the introduced ranking system the ICA–ANN model could slightly perform a better performance compared to ANN. Based on R2, RMSE and VAF values of (0.9999, 0.0107 and 99.9924) and (0.9991, 0.0102 and 99.9913), respectively, were found for training and testing of the optimized ICA–ANN–LB predictive model. Similarly, for the ICA–ANN–UB predictive model, values of (0.9984, 0.0129 and 99.9659) and (0.9984, 0.01047 and 99.9915) were obtained for the R2, RMSE and VAF of training and testing datasets, respectively. However, in the ANN model, the R2 and RMSE for both of the training and testing datasets were (0.9982 and 0.01815) and (0.9972 and 0.01748), respectively. This proves a better performance of the ICA–ANN model in predicting the behaviors of slope stability of cohesive soils and consequently more reliable design solution charts provided herein. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","63","Slope stability","Errors - Neural networks - Optimization - Sensitivity analysis - Shear strength - Soils - Statistical methods","Coefficient of determination - Design charts - Limit equilibrium analysis - Optimal architecture - Predictive modeling - Training and testing - Trial-and-error process - Undrained shear strength","406.2 Roads and Streets - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, effects of the two solvents in an atrazine molecular imprinting system were evaluated theoretically and experimentally. A polarizable continuum model was adopted, and it was found that using the two solvents, the energy difference for the atrazine–methacrylic acid complex between vacuum and solution was not the same. The two types of MIPs prepared using different solvents vary in morphology, porosity, binding capacity, and specificity. All of these results suggest that the abilities of the solvents used to form hydrogen bonds with other compounds in the system are different. The porogen imprinting effect of the solvents also has an influence on binding capacity. Compared to MIPs synthesized using acetonitrile as solvent (MIPs-ACN), MIPs synthesized using toluene as solvent (MIPs-PhMe) have fewer but larger pores and exhibit much higher adsorption capability but less rigorous specificity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
