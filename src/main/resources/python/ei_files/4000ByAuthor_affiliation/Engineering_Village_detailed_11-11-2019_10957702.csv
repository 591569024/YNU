Understanding how bacterial assemblages are associated with nutrients and stoichiometric gradients in lakes and streams is essential for understanding biogeochemical cycling in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we conducted field sampling of bacterial communities from lake water and stream biofilms in Erhai Lake watershed. We determined bacterial communities using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and explored the relationship between bacterial composition and environmental factors using networking analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and variation partitioning analysis (VPA). Physicochemical parameters, nutrients, and nutrient ratios gradients between the lake and the streams were strongly associated with the differences in community composition and the dominant taxa. Cyanobacteria dominated in Erhai Lake, while Proteobacteria dominated in streams. The stream bacterial network was more stable with multiple stressors, including physicochemical-factors and nutrient-factors, while the lake bacterial network was more fragile and susceptible to human activities with dominant nutrients (phosphorus). Negative correlations between bacterial communities and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) as well as positive correlations between bacterial communities and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the network indicated these factors had strong effect on bacterial succession. Erhai Lake is in a eutrophic state, and high relative abundances of Synechococcus (40.62%) and Microcystis (16.2%) were noted during the course of our study. CCA indicated that nutrients (phosphorus) were key parameters driving Cyanobacteria-dominated community structure. By classifying the environmental factors into five categories, VPA analyses identified that P-factor (total phosphorus (TP) and SRP) as well as the synergistic effect of C-factor (DOC), N-factor (NO3-), and P-factor (TP and SRP) played a central role in structuring the bacterial communities in Erhai Lake. Heterogeneous physicochemical conditions explained the variations in bacterial assemblages in streams. This study provides a picture of stream-lake linkages from the perspective of bacterial community structure as well as key factors driving bacterial assemblages within lakes and streams at the whole watershed scale. We further argue that better management of phosphorus on the watershed scale is needed for ameliorating eutrophication of Erhai Lake. © 2019 by the authors.","67","Nutrients","Bacteria - Catchments - Eutrophication - Factor analysis - Forestry - Lakes - Organic carbon - Phosphorus - RNA - Watersheds","Bacterial community - Bacterial community structure - Canonical Correspondence Analysis - Environmental change - Physicochemical parameters - Soluble reactive phosphorus - Stream-lake linkage - Taxonomic","444.1 Surface Water - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 41671048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51439007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was funded by the State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (SKL2018CG02), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51439007 and No. 41671048), and the IWHR Research and Development Support Program (WE0145B052018 and WE0145B532017).

At present, the focus of collaborative filtering recommendation research is mainly on how to improve the accuracy of recommendation by improving the recommendation algorithm.

In this case, what it means for the improvement of collaborative filtering recommendation methods, and how they performed when we use the commonly used quality metrics to evaluate the collaborative filtering recommendation methods? In view of these problems, this paper presupposes that the user's rating behaviour is a bounded rational behaviour, and based on the normality hypothesis of rating error, introduces a simulated rating experiment innovatively to analyse the effect that rating prediction can achieve in sense of the commonly used quality metrics.

The analysis shows that for the local solids concentration time series in the whole riser, the solids concentrations in the larger (8 in.) riser are higher and have higher fluctuation frequency than those in the 3-in. riser. The pressure drops at the various axial levels of the 8-in. riser are higher than the 3-in. riser. Correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy in the 8-in. riser are also higher than those in the 3-in. riser under the identical condition. The microstructure of the gas–particle flow in the 8-in. riser appears to be more complex than that in the 3-in. riser at identical axial levels and under the same solids flux and superficial gas velocity. In the larger riser, the energy distribution in wavelet domain is also stronger than that in the 3-in. riser.

The results demonstrated that both intraparticle diffusion and chemisorption marked significant contributions to the Cu2+ adsorption process by both raw argillaceous limestone (R-AL) and C-AL in mono-metal adsorption systems. Antagonism was found to be the predominant competitive effect for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ adsorptions by C-AL in the multi-metal adsorption system. The three-dimensional simulation and FTIR analysis revealed that the presence of Cu2+ suppressed Pb2+ and Cd2+ adsorptions, while the effect of Cd2+ on Cu2+ and Pb2+ adsorptions was insignificant. The spectroscopic analyses evidenced that amide groups in C-AL played a crucial role in metal adsorption. The preferential adsorptions of Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ were likely due to the different affinities of the metals to the lone pair of electrons on the N atom from the amide groups and/or the O atoms from the –OH and -COO- groups on C-AL. The interactions between C-AL and metal ions and between various metal species influenced their competitive adsorption behaviors.

A combination of active and passive ultrasonic techniques was implemented to study the effect of the control method on mechanical deformation, ultrasonic P-wave velocity, acoustic emission (AE) characteristics, and the ultrasonic amplitude spectrum. During each test, active surveys were performed at regular time intervals. P-wave velocity was found to be strongly anisotropic and was used for the construction of a time-dependent transversely isotropic velocity model for each specimen. AE data were continuously acquired and digitized at 10 MHz and 16-bits for the duration of each test where four channels were amplified 30 dB and the rest 50 dB. Discrete AE events were harvested from the continuous waveforms and were then used for source location analysis based on the constructed velocity model and the collapsing grid search routine. An analysis of the ultrasonic amplitude spectrum was also performed to relate attenuation to the formation of macroscopic fracture. In addition, the post-peak energy balance was quantitatively estimated by calculating the rupture energy, surplus energy, and residual elastic energy, suggesting a typical self-sustaining failure. Differences in the post-peak energy balance between the two sets of tests are also reflected in the AE magnitude distribution in addition to the failure modes. Finally, the reason for the large amount of missing AE data associated with eventual rupture was investigated, with the conclusion that multiple gain levels should be adopted during brittle failure of rocks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","47","Acoustic emission testing","Acoustic emissions - Acoustic wave velocity - Compression testing - Energy balance - Failure (mechanical) - Sandstone - Seismic waves - Strain rate - Ultrasonic measurement - Ultrasonic testing - Wave propagation","Acoustic emission characteristics - Circumferential strain - Class II - Mechanical deformation - Post-peak - Transversely isotropic - Ultrasonic P-wave velocity - Uni-axial compression tests",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A fast solution approach allowed the controllable growth of ZnO nanorod- and nanosheet-arrays directly on flexible substrates, which were endowed with abundant nanojunctions. Electron microscopy observations revealed the existence of two types of the nanojunction interfaces, i.e., the attached and interconnected interfaces within the nanostructure networks. Compared with the attached nanorods, the optoelectronic NO2 sensors based on interconnected ZnO nanosheets showed higher responses and faster response/recovery rates under UV illumination at room temperature. The responses of the nanosheet-based sensor ranged from 28% to 610% toward NO2 concentrations of 10 ppb to 1000 ppb. Moreover, the optoelectronic sensors exhibited excellent reversibility, and mechanical and long-term stabilities along with low detection limits. The enhanced optoelectronic NO2 sensing properties of the interconnected ZnO nanosheets could be attributed to different types of nanojunction interfaces, which played a key role in modulating the interfacial potential barrier heights of the nanojunctions according to the surface depletion model. The presently developed strategy of nanojunction interface engineering is expected to have wide interest for semiconductor-based sensor applications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","49","Integrated circuit interconnects","Crystal symmetry - II-VI semiconductors - Nanorods - Nanosheets - Nitrogen oxides - Phase interfaces - Wide band gap semiconductors - Zinc oxide","Nanojunctions - NO2 sensors - Potential barrier height - UV illuminations - ZnO nanosheets","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: B13025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: JNU, Sponsor: Jiangnan University; Number: BK20180630, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2019J0034, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: 51802123, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: JUSRP11816, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51802123 ), China; the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180630 ), China; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( JUSRP11816 ), China; and Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Education Department ( 2019J0034 ), China Financial support from Key Laboratory of Synthetic and Biological Colloids, Ministry of Education, Jiangnan University , China and MOE & SAFEA for the 111 project ( B13025 ), is also gratefully acknowledged.

At 1225 °C, the replacement of Ti by Zr formed Zr2CS and (Zr, Ti)N (the Ti/Zr atomic ratio is 0.11) and reduced the consumption of Ti. At 925 °C, it was identified that TiC phases were precipitated at first and Zr was incorporated into the TiC lattice in the subsequent precipitation process, which promoted the precipitation of titanium carbide. The calculation of the interaction coefficient between Ti, C, N and Zr showed that Zr reduced the activity of Ti and C and increased the activity of N in the iron matrix. Therefore, with the addition of Zr, the solubility of Ti was increased, and the consumption of Ti was reduced at high temperature in Ti microalloyed low-carbon steel. The thermodynamic calculation of carbide precipitation transformation showed that the replacement of Ti by Zr increased the nucleation driving force and the nucleation rate of titanium carbide, while the critical core size and the critical nuclear energy were reduced. As the holding time was extended, the Zr/Ti atomic ratio increased and the size of the precipitates also increased. When the Zr/Ti atomic ratio reached a certain level, the size of the precipitates did not increase with further increase in atomic ratio. When the Zr/Ti atomic ratio in (Ti, Zr)C was 0.05–0.17, (Ti, Zr)C was the most stable carbide and the easiest to nucleate at 925 °C. There was more of the (Ti, Zr)C phase than TiC at 925 °C after 50 and 100 s, and the time to complete the coarsening behavior of (Ti, Zr)C was shorter than that of TiC. © 2019, China Iron and Steel Research Institute Group.","30","Nitrogen compounds","Atoms - Coarsening - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Low carbon steel - Microalloyed steel - Microalloying - Nucleation - Precipitation (chemical) - Scanning electron microscopy - Sulfur compounds - Thermodynamics - Titanium carbide - Zirconium","Carbide precipitation - Coarsening behavior - Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry - Interaction coefficient - Precipitation process - Scanning electrons - Thermodynamic calculations - Undissolved phase","531.1 Metallurgy - 545.3 Steel - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2017YFB0304701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 51761019, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51761019) and the National Key R & D Program of China (Nos. 2017YFB0304700 and 2017YFB0304701).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The dsDNA-template can facilitate the formation of highly fluorescent CuNCs with a maximum emission wavelength of 575 nm. In the dsDNA-CuNC fluorescent probe, rutin was intercalated into the structure of dsDNA via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The fluorescence of dsDNA-CuNCs was quenched considerably due to the electron transfer from CuNCs to rutin. This decrease in the fluorescence intensity of dsDNA-CuNCs can be used to monitor the concentration of rutin from 0.6 to 400 μM with a detection limit of 0.12 μM (S/N = 3). Compared with the previous reports, this method does not require any complex DNA sequence design, fluorescent dye label and sophisticated experimental techniques.

Although deep neural networks have the ability to model images with hierarchical representations by convolution kernels, they cannot automatically extract the structural representations of object categories in a human-perceptible way. Furthermore, sketch images usually have large-scale visual variations caused by the styles of drawing or viewpoints, which make it difficult to develop generalized representations using the fixed computational mode of convolutional kernel. In this paper, our aim is to address the problem of fixed computational mode in feature extraction process without extra supervision. We propose a novel architecture to dynamically discover the object landmarks and learn the discriminative structural representations. Our model is composed of two components: a representative landmark discovering module that localizes the key points on the object and a category-aware representation learning module that develops the category-specific features. Specifically, we develop a structure-aware offset layer to dynamically localize the representative landmarks, which is optimized based on the category labels without extra supervision. After that, a diversity branch is introduced to extract the global discriminative features for each category. Finally, we employ a multi-task loss function to develop an end-to-end trainable architecture. At testing time, we fuse all the predictions with different number of landmarks to achieve the final results. Through extensive experiments, we compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets, TU-Berlin and Sketchy, for sketch classification and retrieval, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","57","Deep neural networks","Classification (of information) - Convolution - Memory architecture - Network architecture - Neural networks","Convolutional kernel - Convolutional neural network - Discriminative features - Hierarchical representation - Sketch based image classification and retrieval - State-of-the-art methods - Structural feature - Structural representation","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to shed light on the tectonic setting, magma evolution and genesis of mineralization in the orogeny, highly evolved granitic rocks (monzogranites) from the Qibao and Qiqing deposits in the Xiaoliugou ore field were studied. Typical of subduction-related A-type granites, the Xiaoliugou granitic rocks are enriched in SiO2, Rb, Th, U, Ta, Nd, Zr and Hf but relatively depleted in Ba, Sr, P and Eu. The variable initial whole rock 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.62937–0.70543) and wide range of zircon ΕHf(t) values (−18 to 6) suggesting mantle–crust interaction and mixing of depleted mantle and deep crust in the source area. Whole-rock elemental and Rb–Sr isotopic geochemistry suggest slow cooling, significant fractional crystallization, weak wall-rock assimilation/contamination and intense fluid differentiation/metasomatism during the genesis of the Xiaoliugou granitic rocks. Zircon U–Pb dating yielded three age clusters: Precambrian (>540 Ma) (n = 32), Ordovician (~450 Ma) (n = 40), and Cretaceous (~135 Ma) (n = 18). Zircon internal textures indicate a range of sources including residual/detrital zircons from the magma source region and local sediments, magmatic and fluid-altered zircons, and late stage hydrothermal zircons. Zircon trace element and Lu–Hf isotopic compositions suggest fluid metasomatism during granite emplacement in the Ordovician and overprinting by a more evolved, oxidized fluid in the Cretaceous. Involvement of a late, high-temperature, highly fractionated, F-rich fluid could have enhanced W–Mo mineralization. Consequently, a two-stage genetic model is proposed for the Xiaoliugou granitic-minerogenic system involving primary mineralization in the Ordovician (~450 Ma), followed by a Cretaceous magmatic hydrothermal overprint (~135 Ma). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","107","Mineralogy","Geochemistry - Granite - Isotopes - Ores - Silica - Silicate minerals - Tectonics - Textures - Trace elements - Zircon","Gansu province - Hf isotope - Hydrothermal zircons - Ore genesis - Sr isotopes","481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482 Mineralogy","Number: 41502067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41502067 ).

To quantitatively study the effect of color on visual comfort, the measurements of channel independence, constant chromaticity, and color characterization accuracy are needed. This paper reports these measurements recorded from a barrier-type autostereoscopic display that uses a color active matrix liquid crystal with thin film transistor. The results show that the channel independence of the stereoscopic display is poor in the three-dimensional (3D) mode, but it is very good in the two-dimensional (2D) mode. The chromaticity of the display is consistent in both 3D and 2D modes. In both modes, the characterization accuracies of the gain-offset-gamma (GOG) model are 3.64 and 0.99 times the CIELAB color difference ΔEab*, respectively, and the accuracies of the look-up table (LUT) model are 2.36 and 0.65 times the CIELAB color difference ΔEab*, respectively. The display in the 3D mode is affected by crosstalk. Therefore, the color characterization in the 3D mode is less accurate than that in the 2D mode. The characterization accuracy of the LUT method is sufficient for the requirements of the most color-vision experiments. However, to achieve accurate color prediction and control, other more accurate color characterization methods are needed to be developed. © 2019, Chinese Lasers Press.

Also, the appearance of soft computing techniques has made many traditional methods antiquated. Thus, the main effort of this study was to evaluate the capability of several learning methods for appraising the HL and CL of a residential building. To this end, a proper dataset consisting of eight influential factors was provided. To simplify the problem, we executed feature validity by using a correlation-based feature subset selection (CfsSubsetEval) technique. The results of this process showed that wall area, overall height, orientation and glazing area have the most significant impact on the HL and CL simulation. After preparing the suitable dataset, sixteen learning methods namely, elastic net (EN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), least median of squares regression (LMSR), multiple linear regression (MLR), multi-layer perceptron regression (MPR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function regression (RBFR), sequential minimal optimization regression (SMOR), functions XNV, lazy K-star, lazy LWL, rules decision table (RDT), M5Rules, alternating model tree (AMT), directional path consistency (DPC), and Random Forest (RF) were developed in Weka environment to forecast the HL and CL variables. Referring to the results, it was concluded that RF, lazy K-star, RDT and AMT outperform other predictive models. Also, comparing the results with the results of the previous studies showed that the applied feature reduction not only did not disturb the learning process but also has enhanced the performance of models. Also, due to the excellent accuracy of the MLP, a formula was derived from the optimized structure of it to predict the HL and CL variables. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","100","Energy efficiency","Decision tables - Decision trees - Function evaluation - Heating - Housing - Learning systems - Least squares approximations - Linear regression - Machine learning - Optimization - Radial basis function networks - Soft computing - Stars","Correlation-based feature subset selections - Energy efficient - Energy performance of buildings - Feature validity - Gaussian process regression - Least median of squares regression - Residential building - Sequential minimal optimization","403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.1 Computer Programming - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","","We would also like to show our gratitude to the Ali Asghar Heidari, from National University of Singapore, for sharing his vision with us during the course of this research, and we thank four reviewers for their insights.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The decomposition process of lanthanum carbonate hydrate was analyzed by TG-DSC and indicates the reaction undergoes three stages, resulting in the generation of lanthanum oxide at 770 °C. For microwave assisted calcination, XRD patterns demonstrate that hexagonal La2O3 structure is initially formed after calcination at 650 °C for 2 h, and FT-IR analyses confirm the decomposition of precursor is complete after calcination at 750 °C for 2 h. SEM investigations reveal that 800 °C is the optimal calcination temperature to generate La2O3 powders with uniform morphologies. In comparison, conventionally calcination experiments are carried out in electrical furnace. Both XRD and FT-IR analyses are in consistence with TG-DSC, which indicate the temperature required for fully decomposition of lanthanum carbonate hydrate by conventional heating is higher than that of microwave heating. SEM images present irregular morphologies and wide particle size distribution of conventionally prepared samples.

In order to study the oil-sulfur corrosion problem of aluminum foil in the special structure of 'oil-paper-aluminum' in bushing and the influence of its sulfur corrosion products on the properties of oil-paper insulation, the corrosion experiments were carried out according to GB/T19291(150, 72 h). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microtopography change of aluminum foil to determine the corrosion of aluminum foil, and the content of aluminum in oil was tested to determine the corrosion extent of aluminum foil. The electrical and physicochemical parameters of insulation oil and paper were also tested to investigate the effect of corrosion products on oil-paper insulation. The results show that the oil-sulfur corrosion phenomenon exists on aluminum foil in insulating oil of certain acid value and sulfur content, and the formic acid, one of aging products of the oil, will aggravate the corrosion of aluminum foil. In addition, the oil sulfur corrosion of aluminum foil will increase the dielectric loss, viscosity and moisture content of insulation oil and increase the permittivity and dielectric loss of insulation paper, which will degrade the oil-paper insulation performance. This investigation provides a theoretical basis for further research on preventing oil-paper insulation from being damaged by oil-sulfur corrosion in the bushing. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The difference of the surface temperature between defective and reference area has been calculated when the thermal excitation meet the Dirac function. Second, the plate and short insulator samples with interfacial defects have been produced. The defects in plate samples could be easily distinguished by radiation quantity but not in insulators. In order to increase the resolution of experimental result, the derivate of the data has been further processed in the Logarithmic coordinate system. The difference between defective area and reference area has approximately enlarged 7 times and 1 mm defect in insulators, which is the smallest, could be distinguished.

Aiming at overcoming the noise interference problem encountered in this kind of weak fault feature extraction, a novel weak fault feature extraction algorithm termed as ACFSS of rolling bearing is proposed. The ACFSS is based on an overcomplete dictionary (or overcomplete atomic library) of Attenuated Cosines(AC) basis, which is highly matched to the bearing fault waveforms, and an improved Basis Pursuit algorithm with Feature Sign Search(FSS) is introduced into the ACFSS to improve the calculating speed. In order to select the suitable parameters of the attenuated cosine dictionary, some methods such as peak resonance frequency (PRF), power variation peak (PVK), time shift parameter (TSP), etc. are introduced. These parameters span the sparse overcomplete dictionary. Finally, the bearing fault data of Case-Western University and full life accelerated IMS bearing data are utilized to verify the validation of ACFSS. Compared with the ordinary envelope spectrum analysis(ESA) method /the ordinary Basis Pursuit Denoising(BPDN) method/ Wavelet package transform(WPT) Kurtogram method and Empirical Mode Decomposition(EMD) combining Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) method, The experiment show that the proposed method are more redundant and robust when facing strong noise interference, and it can be used to extract the weak fault feature frequency efficiently and accurately. © 2019 ISA","31","Roller bearings","Extraction - Feature extraction - Signal processing - Singular value decomposition - Spectrum analysis - Time domain analysis - Wavelet decomposition","Basis pursuit - Basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) - Bearing fault - Empirical Mode Decomposition - Feature Sign Search - Singular value decomposition method - Sparse representation - Weak fault feature extraction","601.2 Machine Components - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations","Number: 2017FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51405211, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51465022 , 51405211 ), Key scientific research projects of Yunnan Province (Gant Nos. 201601PE00008 , 2017FA028 ), and Yunnan Province Personal Training Projects (Grant Nos.

However, mimicking unique natural structures and ingenious functions remains a challenge. Now, multiple biochemical reactions were integrated into artificially designed compartments via molecular assembly. First, multicompartmental silica nanoparticles with hierarchical structures that mimic the chloroplasts were obtained by a templated synthesis. Then, photoacid generators and ATPase-liposomes were assembled inside and outside of silica compartments, respectively. Upon light illumination, protons produced by a photoacid generator in the confined space can drive the liposome-embedded enzyme ATPase towards ATP synthesis, which mimics the photophosphorylation process in vitro.

Low temperatures limit the geographic distribution of Coffea canephora Pierre ex A.Froehner. The WRKYs of C. canephora are still not well characterized, and the response of C. canephora WRKYs (CcWRKYs) under cold stress is still largely unknown. We identified 49 CcWRKYs from the C. canephora genome to gain insight into these mechanisms. These CcWRKYs were divided into three groups that were based on the conserved WRKY domains and zinc-finger structure. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that 14 CcWRKYs were induced during the cold acclimation stage, 17 CcWRKYs were preferentially upregulated by 4 °C treatment, and 12 CcWRKYs were downregulated by cold stress. Subsequently, we carried out a genome-wide analysis to predict 14,513 potential CcWRKY target genes in C. canephora. These isolated genes were involved in multiple biological processes, and most of them could be grouped by the response to stimulus. Among the putative CcWRKY target genes, 235 genes were categorized into response to the cold process, including carbohydrate metabolic, lipid metabolic, and photosynthesis process-related genes. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and correlation analysis indicated that CcWRKY might control their putative targets that respond to cold stress. These results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanism for CcWRKY-mediated cold responses. © 2019 by the authors.","54","Transcription","Coffee - Geographical distribution - Metabolism - Plants (botany)","Coffea canephora - Cold stress - Correlation analysis - Gene expression analysis - Genome wide analysis - Photosynthesis process - Target genes - Zinc finger structure","405.3 Surveying - 461.9 Biology - 822.3 Food Products","Number: 31601771, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank LetPub (www.letpub.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, 31601771 and Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan, 2017FB056, and Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Provincial Education Department of China, 2016zzx007.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

From a total of 2047 cavities, we found that cavity density was mainly driven by habitat rather than tree species richness or diameter at breast height (DBH), and the characteristics of cavities were not uniformly distributed across habitats. Cavities were significantly more abundant in high- and low-slope than high-plateau habitats. Compared with other habitats, more “butt hollow” cavity types were found in high-slope habitat and they occurred at a lower tree height, whereas more “crack” cavities were found in low-slope habitat and they had a narrower entrance diameter. Although the mean orientation of cavities faced towards the northeast, cavity orientation varied significantly across habitat types. Our results indicate that certain types of cavi­ties are concentrated in specific habitat types, which can provide avenues for forest management and biodiversity conservation.

In order to improve the control of diesel engine exhaust emissions, the diesel engine oxidation catalyst (DOC) + catalytic diesel particulate filter (CDPF) + selective catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR) + NH3 oxidation catalyst (ASC) united technology has become the mainstream technology for catalytic aftertreatment. Perovskite oxides have emerged as a promising catalyst for NO oxidation and can be used as the DOC. Undoped La2MMnO6 (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu) double perovskites, A-site Ba-doping (La2-xBax)CoMnO6 (%Ba = 0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) perovskites and B-site Cu-doping La2Co1-yCuyMnO6 (y = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1) double perovskites were prepared by a facile molten-salt synthesis method and examined by XRD, SEM, BET, in situ DRIFTS, and XPS. In addition, we calculated the B-site ionic magnetic moments of the double perovskites μ which were contributed by the effective Bohr magneton number np of the B-site 3d transition metal ions, such as Mn3+, Mn4+, Co3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, and Cu2+. The correlations between the B-site ionic magnetic moments and the maximum NO conversion over all those double perovskites were also calculated. The B-site ionic magnetic moments has a strong positive correlation with the highest conversion rate of NO catalytic oxidation over all those double perovskites. That is, the higher the B-site ionic magnetic moments, the better the catalytic oxidation performance of NO over the double perovskites. So enhancing the B-site ionic magnetic moments by A-site doping is a method to improve the catalytic activity of NO oxidation over the perovskites. Increasing the B-site ionic magnetic moments is the key index to improve the catalytic activity of NO oxidation of the double perovskites by B-site doping. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","60","Catalytic oxidation","Ammonia - Barium compounds - Catalyst activity - Copper compounds - Diesel engines - Doping (additives) - Filters (for fluids) - Lanthanum compounds - Magnetic moments - Manganese compounds - Metal ions - Oxidation - Perovskite - Selective catalytic reduction - Transition metals","Catalytic performance - Diesel particulate filters - Double perovskites - Molten salt synthesis method - NO catalytic oxidations - Oxidation catalysts - Positive correlations - Selective catalytic reduction catalysts","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 482.2 Minerals - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 531.1 Metallurgy - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2011AA06A106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21176108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work described above was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Plan (863 of China, No. 2011AA06A106), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21176108 and No. 21666016 ).

The experimental results show that in the condition of the same incident energy, with the strength of the interlayer material is reduced, the ratio of reflection energy rises and transmission energy ratio descends gradually. The change rules of energy dissipation ratio are decided by the characters of the interlayer material.

In this paper, we present a high-resolution chemical element dataset covering the past 2000 years from Lake Yamzhog Yumco (28°27'N-29°12'N, 90°08'E-91°45'E, altitude in 4440 m a.s.l.), which is a representative inland lake located in the southern Tibetan Plateau. These data were acquired using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner, which is used for in situ, high-resolution, continuous, multi-element analyses. The chronology presented herein is based on 210Pb and AMS14C dates from the macro-remains of plants. The interpretation of elemental geochemistry, together with magnetic susceptibility and grain-size, enabled the reconstruction of the environmental changes in the southern Tibetan Plateau over the past 2000 years. Reconstructions of the temperatures, precipitation and lake levels indicated that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Current Warm Period (CWP) were associated with low precipitation and high temperatures. In contrast, the Dark Cold Age Period (DCAP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) were associated with high precipitation and low temperatures. Moreover, the level of warmth during the peak of the MWP may equal or slightly exceed the 20th century warming. In addition, the prolonged LIA may have experienced a warm event on a centennial timescale, and the 17th and 18th centuries may be the coldest centuries in the last two millennia. Our reconstructions also indicated that the lake level evolution has been affected by interactions of temperature and precipitation. More specifically, during the cold periods, an increase of precipitation amplified the rise of lake levels, and vice versa. The climate records from Lake Yamzhog Yumco have confirmed a cold-moist/warm-dry climate pattern on the southern Tibetan Plateau over the past 2000 years. Additionally, the temperature variations inferred from the records were strongly correlated with the solar irradiance and northern hemispheric temperature changes, which suggests a possible link between the solar forcing and climate variability in the past 2000 years on the southern Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the enhancement and southward shift of the westerlies was determined to have significantly contributed to the high precipitation conditions during the LIA on the southern Tibetan Plateau. © 2019, Science Press.

Here, we present high-quality draft genomes of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus) with scaffold N50 of 6.04 Mb and 3.96 Mb, respectively. Sequence alignment comprising genomes of three canid species reveals SVs specific to the dog, particularly 16 315 insertions, 2565 deletions, 443 repeats, 16 inversions and 15 translocations. Functional annotation of the dog SVs associated with genes indicates their enrichments in energy metabolisms, neurological processes and immune systems. Interestingly, we identify and verify at population level an insertion fully covering a copy of the AKR1B1 (Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member B) transcript. Transcriptome analysis reveals a high level of expression of the new AKR1B1 copy in the small intestine and liver, implying an increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis and antioxidant ability in dog compared to gray wolf, likely in response to dietary shifts during the agricultural revolution. For the first time, we report a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of SVs during the domestication step of dogs.

In this study, soils were sampled from 30 grasslands across >2000 km on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to determine the distribution patterns of methanotrophs and their driving factors at a regional scale. Methanotroph abundance and community composition were analyzed using quantitative PCR and Illumina Miseq sequencing of pmoA genes, respectively. The pmoA gene copies ranged from 8.2 × 105 to 1.1 × 108 per gram dry soil. Among the 30 grassland soil samples, Upland Soil Cluster Gamma (USCγ) dominated the methanotroph communities in 26 samples. Jasper Ridge Cluster (JR3) was the most dominant methanotrophic cluster in two samples; while Methylocystis, cluster FWs, and Methylobacter were abundant in other two wet soil samples.

However, it is unclear how the environmental impacts are in such dairy production system. This study evaluated, for the first time, the global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and energy consumption (EC) of 36 intensive dairy farms by life cycle assessment (LCA) in China, and investigated the effects of the feeding patterns on the environmental impacts by a principal component analysis (PCA). The results of the LCA showed that the impacts of beef production by surplus calves and culled cows accounted for 43, 41, 41 and 40% of the total GWP, AP, EP and EC values, respectively, despite the fact that beef was considered as a by-product in the dairy system. Five feeding patterns were distinguished as principal components (PCs): vegetable residue-based concentrate feeding (PC1), beverage by-product feeding (PC2), corn grain-stover feeding (PC3), corn silage-stover feeding (PC4) and rice straw-based brewers' grain feeding (PC5). The results of the PCA indicated that the farms utilizing by-product feeds purchased from companies near the study area had relatively low environmental impacts. In contrast, the farms that managed cows without precise nutritional planning showed relatively high impacts in terms of GWP, AP, EP and EC. Other impact categories, such as abiotic depletion and land use, would be considered for a complete assessment of dairy production in future studies. The consequences of this study could have a certain reference value on making policy/planning for developing dairy-beef production in China. © 2019","66","Life cycle","Acidification - Beef - Economics - Energy utilization - Environmental impact - Eutrophication - Farms - Feeding - Global warming - Grain (agricultural product) - Land use - Principal component analysis","Abiotic depletion - Dairy cattles - Eutrophication potentials - Global warming potential - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) - Principal Components - Production system - Reference values","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 822.2 Food Processing Operations - 822.3 Food Products - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences","Number: -, Acronym: MEXT, Sponsor: Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; ","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) 26257411 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

This study developed an integrated approach containing Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL) and a dynamic nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) network to decompose and estimate the nutrient concentrations in Lake Erhai, a preliminary eutrophic lake in China. The STL decomposition results indicated that total nitrogen (TN) concentration of Lake Erhai progressively descended from 2006 to 2014, except for some agriculture area. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2013 and then decreased in 2014, but in the area near the tourist attractions, TP increased continuously from 2011 to 2014. Seasonal variations in TN and TP indicated that the lowest water quality of Lake Erhai occurred from July to October. Based on results obtained with STL, TP was selected as the sensitive parameter, as it showed a significant deterioration trend, and the area near the tourist attractions was selected as the sensitive area. Three variables (DO, pH, and water temperature) were selected as input parameters to estimate TP using the dynamic NARX model. The NARX modeling results demonstrated that it can accurately estimate TP concentrations with low root-mean-square error (0.0071 mg/L).

The effect of the methanol/lauric acid molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the lauric acid conversion was investigated by single-factor experiments. On the basis of single-factor experiments, the esterification of lauric acid and methanol was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD).

However, how soil C-decomposition enzymes respond to different land use change remains unclear. Here, we conducted a study to explore seasonal variations in C-decomposition enzyme activities including hydrolases (α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and β-xylosidase) and oxidases (polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase) in woodland, shrubland, cropland, and adjacent uncultivated soils in central China. Soil dissolved organic C (DOC), SOC, labile C (LC), recalcitrant C (RC), soil C recalcitrance index (RIC: RC/SOC ratio), pH, soil moisture, and temperature were also investigated. Both afforested and cropland averaged higher hydrolase and oxidase activities compared with the uncultivated land, with higher levels of enzyme activities in topsoils than deep soils. By comparing with the uncultivated land, higher hydrolytic enzyme activities in afforested soils were mainly attributed to higher DOC and LC contents, whereas higher hydrolase activities in cropland soils were possibly due to lower C:nitrogen (N) ratios and agricultural disturbance (i.e., fertilization and tillage). In contrast, two oxidases activities were the highest in the cropland, which might be attributed to higher RIC and lower C:N ratio. Cropland soils also averaged higher specific enzyme activities (i.e., enzyme activities per unit of SOC) compared with the afforested land, indicating fast C turnover rates in cropland. Seasonal variations in soil enzyme activities were primarily driven by soil temperature and pH.

Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new method to improve the system's shortcomings and improve the system's application. This study proposes a multi-angle automotive fuse box detection and assembly method based on machine vision. Firstly, the HSV color extraction method and OCR character recognition method are used to obtain the fuse color and model on the fuse box, and the fuses of each model in the fuse box are quickly detected and recognized. Then, the upper surface image of the fuse box is captured by two cameras with different viewing angles. The coordinates and depth of field information generated by the difference in viewing angle are used to judge the position of the torque wrench, and the torque of the torque wrench is automatically adjusted. Finally, the prototype of the detection and assembly system is designed. The simulation results show that the detection accuracy, detection speed and reliability of the method reach a high level. The field test results of a certain type of fuse box on the prototype show that the recognition speed is about 0.085 s/piece, and the fuse detection accuracy for 99.9%, the position recognition accuracy of the torque wrench is 100%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","22","Computer vision","Assembly - Character recognition - Image processing - Tools - Torque","Assembly systems - Color extraction - Detection accuracy - Detection speed - Multi angle - Position recognition - Recognition speed - Torque wrenches","723.5 Computer Applications - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Research and Development; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41761084), China High Technology Research and Development Program 863 (2012AA121402), and Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China (2016FD020).

This study uses the Dongjiang River Basin in south China as an example and focuses on the influence of reservoir operation on hydrological drought. The Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and run theory were applied to determine the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. A semi-distributed hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate long time series (>30 years) monthly streamflow data; the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using the monthly streamflow data from periods with less human regulations. Streamflow was then simulated and compared by using the same model parameters, as well as the sub-surface features, to simulate the streamflow during the human regulation periods. The 'simulated-observed' comparative approach (i.e., a comparison of the characteristics of the hydrological drought obtained from the simulation-based SSI and observation-based SSI) was used to assess the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The results showed that the ‘simulated-observed’ comparison approach based on the SWAT model exhibited a good ability to ascertain the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The reservoir operation was the dominant factor affecting the hydrological drought propagation in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River basin and had mostly a short-term effect by decreasing the duration and severity of drought development (or recovery). However, the reservoirs tended to release water during the development process and to store water during the recovery process during a long-term hydrological drought in the study area, leading to an increase in average recovery duration and severity. The results of this study may further optimize water resources management system during drought for effective drought prevention and mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","50","Reservoirs (water)","Drought - Recovery - Rivers - Stream flow - Watersheds","Dongjiang rivers - Drought prevention and mitigations - Hydrological droughts - Reservoir operation - Semi distributed hydrological models - Soil and water assessment tool - Standardized streamflow indices - SWAT","407.2 Waterways - 441.2 Reservoirs - 444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water","Number: 2017YFC0405900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 51809294, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51861125203, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: SYSU, Sponsor: Sun Yat-sen University; ","This research is supported by funding from the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51861125203, 51809294), and the International Program for Ph.D candidates, Sun Yat-sen University.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Classic subject- and/or time-homogeneous assumptions on transition matrices in transition model as well as the emission distribution in the observed process may be inappropriate to interpret heterogeneity at the subject level. For this end, a general extension of LVHMM is proposed to address the heterogeneity of multivariate longitudinal data both at the subject level and the occasion level. The main modeling strategy is that the observed time sequences are first grouped into different clusters, and then within each cluster the observed sequences are formulated via latent variable hidden Markov model. The local heterogeneity at the occasion level is characterized by the distribution related to the latent states, while the global heterogeneity at the subject level is identified with the finite mixture model. Compared to the existing methods, an appeal underlying the proposal is its capacity of accommodating non-homogeneous patterns of state sequences and emission distributions across the subjects simultaneously. As a result, the proposal provides a comprehensive framework for exploring various kinds of relevance among the multivariate longitudinal data.

The materials for the syngas are low-quality lignite and the industrial waste-phosphogypsum (PG). However, the reaction temperature for the process is high, which consumes a lot of energy. Therefore, in this work, a catalyst has been proposed to lower the reaction temperature in the CLG of syngas. Ellingham diagram has been used as a guide to find the catalyst. Furthermore, theoretical calculations using the thermodynamic software FactSage, have been conducted along with experiments to analyze the performance of compound oxygen carrier in the CLG process. After the analysis, it is suggested that the Fe supported PG has great characteristics with high oxygen carrying capacity, high selective conversion ability of C to CO, excellent activity and recyclability. In addition, compared with the PG applied used as oxygen carrier, the compound oxygen carrier has reduced the temperature to 1023 K with more than 90.00% carbon conversion, whereas more than 70.00% of carbon of lignite is transformed into CO. Additionally, the syngas has the cold gas efficiency of 81.38% and the lower heating value (LHV) 3222.52 kJ/Nm3.

Therefore in this work, the single-crystalline Bi6Fe2-xCoxTi3O18 (BFCTO) (x = 0–0.5) nanocrystals were synthesized successfully by the hydrothermal method. As the Co ions doping concentration increase, the main morphology of BFCTO nanocrystals changed from nanoplate to nanosheet. Meanwhile, doping Co ions in the BFTO can efficiently reduce the band gap of products. As the Co ions doping concentration increase to x = 0.5, the corresponding bandgap is shorten from 2.576 to 2.201eV. Besides, the BFCTO-0.5 sample exhibited optimal ultraviolet (UV)-light-driven photocatalytic activity for decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB). At room temperature, upon Co doping, the samples have spontaneous magnetic moments, indicating the ferromagnetic nature. The hysteresis loop of BFCTO-0.2 and BFCTO-0.1 nanocrystals obtained the maximum remnant magnetization 2Mr of 0.27emu/g and the maximum coercive field 2Hc of 1600Oe, respectively.

The CQDs attached by N, S, and P elements are synthesized via pyrolysis of a mixture of citric acid and NH3H2O, H2SO4, and H3PO4, respectively. Thus, part of –COOH at the edges of CQDs can be converted into –C=O and functional groups such as –NH2, –SO2, –HSO3, and –H2PO4 can connect to the carbon bonds. We find that the formation of the N/S/P-CQDs can reduce the amount of –COOH that attaches to the edges of sp2-conjugated π-domains located at centers of these CQDs. This effect can result in the reduction of the non-radiative recombination for electronic transition in these CQDs. As a result, the quantum yield (QY) for fluorescence from the CQDs can be efficiently enhanced. We demonstrate experimentally that the QYs for N/S/P-CQDs can reach up to 18.7%, 29.7%, and 10.3%, respectively, in comparison to 9% for these without functional group modulation.

Indigo was enriched on a nylon membrane by the multi-channel membrane enrichment device with which analyte in standard solutions and sample solutions can be enriched on the same membrane at different positions. A mobile APP was developed to detect the membrane. Digital photographs of membrane were collected by the phone. With the APP, the influence of illumination and noise was eliminated and all samples enriched at different positions on the membrane could be identified automatically, the color signal of the samples were extracted, thus a standard curve of the color signal vs. concentration of the pesticide could be regressed. Limit of detection of trichlorfon was estimated being 0.030 mg/L. The content of trichlorfon in cucumber was analyzed with the developed method. The results showed that the recoveries were 95.8%-106.9% with relative standard deviations of 3.8%-5.4%. Using a smartphone but spectrometer, the proposed method is simple and applicable.

In addition, with the increasing number of object categories, the background of scene has become another crucial issue in object classification. This paper focuses on image object recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues. Firstly, we propose a semantic refinement method that analyzes the relationship among similar categories in images from the perspective of semantic knowledge. The knowledge of the relationship between semantics comes from a wide range of open knowledge. Secondly, we utilize the knowledge graph method to create the image knowledge graph with multiple categories in images. Our method exploits the knowledge from the adjacency matrix computed on train data to merge relevant classes into graph. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale image datasets (ImageNet), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

In this study, a novel approach that integrates precipitation zoning with random forest regression is proposed for the spatial downscaling of satellite-based precipitation. Precipitation zoning is delineated through iterative rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analyses of ground- and satellite-based precipitation observations. Random forest regression is applied to link the satellite-based precipitation to 1-km-resolution predictors such as latitude (Lat), longitude (Lon), elevation, aspect, slope, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The accuracy of the resultant downscaled precipitation is evaluated based on five statistical evaluation indices. The performance of the proposed approach is exemplified in the Lancang–Mekong River basin, taking Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks–Climate Data Record (PERSIANN–CDR) products acquired in 2001 (wet year), 2005 (normal year), and 2009 (dry year) as the databases. The results show that seven precipitation subregions can be roughly distinguished in the study basin. Zoning-based downscaling outperforms non-zoning-based downscaling in terms of accuracy, resulting in statistically significant reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 1–17% across the entire basin. Among the selected predictors, the variables Lat and Lon are the most important for precipitation estimation, whereas the remaining variables have lesser and subregion-dependent importance. The proposed approach is promising for generating high-spatial-resolution precipitation data in regions with sparse ground-based observations and differentiated climatic regimes. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","55","Precipitation (meteorology)","Decision trees - Mean square error - Neural networks - Orthogonal functions - Rain gages - Regression analysis - Rivers - Satellites - Watersheds - Zoning","Down-scaling - Empirical Orthogonal Function - Mekong river basins - Normalized difference vegetation index - Precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information - Random forests - REOF analysis - Tropical rainfall measuring missions","443.2 Meteorological Instrumentation - 443.3 Precipitation - 444.1 Surface Water - 655.2 Satellites - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","Number: 41461017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions of Anhui Province; Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014HB005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","information National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFA0601601; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41461017; Candidates of the Young and Middle-Aged Academic Leaders of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 2014HB005; Program for Excellent Young Talents at Yunnan UniversityWe thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments.

Hot rolling, a process of the combination of deformation and heat, remains an attractive method to thin the solder strips for bulk ingots of Au–Sn eutectic alloys, but the mechanisms governing the hot rolling process of Au–Sn eutectic alloys is not yet clear. Solder strips thinning is thus not reached easily. In this study, the heat induced coarsening origin and spheroidization mechanisms in Au–Sn eutectic alloys were uncovered in terms of the microstructural evolution and orientation relationship. Microstructure evolution of lamellar colony of Au–Sn eutectic alloy revealed that the initiation sites of coarsening occurs at the boundary of the lamellar colony structure and the end of the lamellar fault inside the colony structure. Termination migration was found to dominate the origin of coarsening mechanism of Au–Sn eutectic alloy, with involving large scale nano-lamellae, paired lamellar faults and a large number of coarsening structure. And another new coarsening mechanism, lamellae splitting, was proposed based on 'groove' morphology, interface structure and crystallographic orientation relationship, to create massive lamellar faults for termination migration. The mechanisms will provide a new insight into coarsening origin. And the results pave the way of hot rolling Au–Sn eutectic alloys in terms of parameter selection, microstructure evolution and coarsening mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","30","Tin alloys","Annealing - Binary alloys - Coarsening - Eutectics - Gold alloys - Hot rolling - Lead-free solders - Metal castings - Microstructural evolution - Microstructure - Morphology - Ostwald ripening","Coarsening behavior - Coarsening mechanisms - Crystallographic orientation relationships - Eutectic alloys - Interface structures - Micro-structure evolutions - Orientation relationship - Spheroidization mechanism","531.2 Metallography - 534.2 Foundry Practice - 535.1.2 Rolling Mill Practice - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 538.1.1 Soldering - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2017YFB0406300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2018JS003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: U1502272, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0406300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1502272), the Key R&D program of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2018BA068), Yunnan Science and Technology Projects (Grants No. 2018ZE023) and Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Province Education Department (Grants No. 2018JS003).

The study of shale brittleness evaluation can provide basic data for fracturing design. The mineral composition characteristics of shale gas reservoir in the early Cambrian Qiongzhusi formation of Huize area, Eastern Yunnan Province are reported in this paper, and the brittleness is evaluated according to the proportion of brittle minerals in total minerals. The results show that the mineral composition of the reservoir is complex. After comparing the brittleness index calculated by different formulas, it is considered that the minerals with high young's modulus and low poisson's ratio should be considered as brittle minerals, which is conducive to the universality of the brittleness index formula and the objectivity of reservoir brittleness evaluation. Shale gas reservoir of Qiongzhusi formation is obviously divided into two sections: the layers of 1 to 7 with a large brittleness index (77.60% on average) on the lower part are beneficial to reservoir fracturing reconstruction, while the layers of 8 to 14 with a small brittleness index (37.78% on average) on the upper part are not conducive to reservoir fracturing reconstruction.

Although WEU is recognized as an important hydrological feature, little is known about its effects on aquatic ecosystems. Herein, two laboratory experiments were conducted to test the effects of WEU on 1) environmental conditions in the absence of plants, and 2) both environmental conditions and plant growth in the presence of two wetland macrophytes Phalaris arundinacea and Polygonum hydropiper. A two-factor factorial design comprising WEU (low-, intermediate-, and high-level of unevenness) and burial depth (0 and 5 cm) was used for both experiments. Compared to turbidity, pH, and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration of the waterbody, dissolved oxygen concentration showed the highest sensitivity to WEU, which decreased significantly with increasing WEU regardless of the absence or presence of plants. For the sediment, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), NO3-N, total N, available P, and total P decreased consistently with increasing WEU, regardless of burial depth and the absence or presence of plants. Furthermore, deeper burial led to further decreases in soil ORP for all three WEU levels. Biomass accumulation decreased with increasing WEU and burial depth in both plant species. Additionally, plants developed shorter and thicker roots, and the root alcohol dehydrogenase activity increased, but there was a decrease in the root mass ratio, likely due to the plants adapting to anaerobic stress under higher WEU levels and/or deeper burial conditions. However, under deeper burial conditions, increased WEU generally did not lead to further root adjustments due to the limited nutrient absorption capacity. Consequently, plant biomass decreased by 49.82% for P. arundinacea and 76.94% for P. hydropiper from low to high WEU levels at 5 cm burial depth compared to values of 39.68% and 45.71% at 0 cm burial depth, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrated that WEU strongly influences the performances of wetland macrophytes through modulation of oxygen and nutrient availability. Considering that anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are markedly altering the WEU of lake ecosystems, we call for more research into this hydrological element to assess its potential ecological impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","52","Dissolved oxygen","Aquatic ecosystems - Biochemical oxygen demand - Carbon dioxide - Climate change - Finance - Nutrients - Redox reactions - Soil testing - Wetlands","Alcohol dehydrogenase activity - Hydrological variation - Plant morphology - Plant nutrients - Sediment properties","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 31660169, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31670440, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: C6183014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to Yuxin Bai, Hua Liu, Zhiwei Pu, and Jing Ren for assistance in the experiment.

However, the use of magnetic COFs in electrochemical immunosensors has rarely reported. Herein, a novel electrochemical assay for the determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was developed using black phosphorene (BPene) as a platform and magnetic COFs for signal amplification. BPene was prepared via water-phase exfoliation. BPene nanocomposite (Au@BPene) was prepared by depositing Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto BPene. This nanocomposite was utilized as an immunsensing platform to bind primary antibodies and improve electron transfer. Subsequently, an Au NP-loaded magnetic COF was used to immobilize the secondary antibodies and abundant electronic signals of methylene blue (MB). The fabricated sensor exhibited linearity ranging from 0.0001 ng mL-1 to 10 ng mL−1 with the detection limit of 30 fg mL−1. The sensor could determine the PSA in a real sample with excellent specificity, good stability, and desirable reproducibility. The effective signal amplification of the proposed sensor is attributed to the good electron transfer of Au@BPene, excellent enrichment capacity of signal molecules (MB) of the COF, and efficient catalytic activity of Fe3O4.

Typically, the electron injection is followed by electron trapping at the semiconductor/dielectric interface or sometimes in the bulk semiconductor, resulting in a modification of the built-in field in the FETs. Such a dynamic process causes continuous threshold voltage or Dirac voltage (Vth/Dirac) shift and thus unstable device operation. A charge-selective electrode (CSE) design is used to address these problems. The CSE is formed by inserting a molybdenum trioxide interlayer between the electrode and the semiconductor, which creates an energy barrier to block electron injection. It is shown that the CSE strategy can generally work for FETs based on three semiconductor families, namely conjugated polymer, graphene, and quantum dot, and greatly suppresses the Vth/Dirac shift, enhancing the bias stress stability as well as reducing the noise level of the FETs. The mechanism for CSE-reduced bias stress is investigated through trap analysis. CSE is a general strategy for achieving stable and low-noise operation of unipolar FETs. The device design concept can be applied to other device configurations. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To consider this, the axial compression loading and confining pressure unloading experiment of shale is carried out, and then the influence of unloading rate on the mechanical parameters, failure characteristics, and the brittleness of rock are analyzed. What is more, a new evaluation method of brittleness characteristics that take the unloading effect into consideration is proposed. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The unloading rate has a weakening effect on the mechanical parameters, such as the destructive confining pressure and the residual strength of the samples. (2) The failure characteristics of shale specimens are a single shear failure in an oblique section under low unloading rate, and multiple shear zones accompanied with bedding fracture under high unloading rate. (3) The brittleness of shale samples is well verified by the brittleness index Bd1 and Bd2 during the loading path; nevertheless, it has shortage at the unloading path. This paper proposes a new brittleness evaluation method which can consider the influence of the different unloading rates and unloading points.

Recombinant β-xylosidase (rHJ14GH43) exhibited maximum activity at 25 °C, approximately 15, 45, and 88% of maximum activity at 0, 10, and 20 °C, respectively, and poor stability at temperatures over 20 °C. rHJ14GH43 showed moderate or high activity, but poor stability, in NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, KNO3, Na2SO4, and (NH4)2SO4 at concentrations from 3.0 to 30.0% (w/v). The crystal structure of rHJ14GH43 was resolved and showed higher structural flexibility due to fewer salt bridges and hydrogen bonds compared to mesophilic and thermophilic β-xylosidases. High structural flexibility is presumed to be a key factor for catalytic adaptations to low temperatures and high salt concentrations. Approximately one-third of the surface of rHJ14GH43 is positively charged, which may be the primary factor responsible for poor stability in high neutral salt environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","40","Crystal structure","Bacteriology - Convergence of numerical methods - Escherichia coli - Hydrogen bonds - Hydrolases - Nitrogen compounds - Potash - Potassium Nitrate - Salts - Sodium chloride - Sodium nitrate - Sodium sulfate - Stability - Sugars - Temperature - Thermodynamic properties","Glycoside hydrolase family 43 - Glycoside hydrolases - High salt concentration - Low temperatures - Positively charged - Primary factors - Structural flexibilities - Xylosidase","641.1 Thermodynamics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2017YFB0308401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2014 1782, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201810681017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program; Number: 31660445, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015HB033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 2017YFB0308401 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 31660445 and 31460694 ), the Yunling Scholars (Grant no. 2015 56 ), the Yunling Industry Leading Talents (Grant no. 2014 1782 ), the Reserve Talents Project for Young and Middle-Aged Academic and Technical Leaders of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2015HB033 ), and the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students of China (Grant nos. 201710681016 and 201810681017 ).

However, current use and consumption of bamboo resources has created some serious problems that will inevitably impede sustainable development of bamboo resources. The present study focuses on four major issues that are closely related to the usage and development of bamboo resources, including overexploitation, low utilization efficiency, the shortage of bamboo raw material, and environmental issues that arise out of the development of bamboo industry. Based on an analysis on such major problems associated with the utilization and development of bamboo resources, several strategies were proposed to help improve the protection and utilization efficiency of bamboo resources, including the collecting and harvesting of bamboo resources following scientific guidelines, the enhancement of the utilization efficiency, especially multiple use of bamboo resources, the maintenance of high production and genetic diversity of bamboo resources, and the realization of an eco-friendly development of bamboo industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","8","Bamboo","Collector efficiency - Efficiency - Environmental protection - Environmental technology - Planning - Sustainable development","Environmental issues - Genetic diversity - Human society - Overexploitation - Problem analysis - Protection and utilizations - Terrestrial ecosystems - Utilization efficiency","454 Environmental Engineering - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 702.3 Solar Cells - 811.1 Pulp and Paper - 912.2 Management - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: 213233, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31460158, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31460158), and Special Fund for Biodiversity Conservation in Yunnan Province/Screening and evaluation of plant resources with industrial potential (213233).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The self-crystallization fraction of Ba2LaF7 has decreased with the increase in melting temperature. The Fourier transforms infrared spectra, X-ray Fluorescence analysis and differential thermal analysis revealed that the increase in temperature makes the Si[sbnd]O bond longer in the glass, resulting in the increase of activation energy for crystallization instead of precipitating the crystals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","17","Fluorine compounds","Activation analysis - Activation energy - Barium compounds - Differential thermal analysis - Fluorescence - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Fourier transforms - Glass ceramics - Lanthanum compounds - Luminescence - Melting point - Temperature","Ba2LaF7 - Crystallization mechanisms - Crystallization phenomenon - Effect of temperature - FTIR - Low phonon energies - Luminescence centers - X ray fluorescence analysis","641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 11664022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11774138, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKSY201632046, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11774138, 11664022) and Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FA021 and 2016FB081) and the project for personnel training fund supported by Kunming University of Science and Technology (KKSY201632046).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
